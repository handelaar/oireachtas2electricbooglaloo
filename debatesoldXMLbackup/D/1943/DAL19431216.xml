      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that on 26th November last the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, in a public address, indicated as the alternative agricultural policies open to this country (a) large farms, which would mean fewer farms and fewer farm workers, and (b) small farms with more farmers and more labourers, and said that as between these two the choice had been made; and if he will state which of these policies is the one chosen by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in a speech delivered on the 26th November last the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, speaking on national planning, referred to two conceivable land policies for this country &mdash;one, that of a highly mechanised <Col N="940" /> agriculture with large farms, fewer farmers, and fewer farm workers.  The other, that of smaller farms, more farmers, and more farm workers.  The choice between these two policies, he said, had been made.  I think it was quite clear from his speech that the policy which the Minister referred to as having been chosen is that indicated in Article 45 of the Constitution directed towards establishing on the land in economic security as many families as in the circumstances shall be practicable.  This policy, which puts the social above the narrow economic aim, has been the basis of the activities of the Land Commission for a large number of years and it is the policy of the Government to maintain that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett (for Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware of the hardship caused in the City of Dublin by the inadequate supplies of fuel and, in particular, of wood fuel, and if it is a fact that large quantities of timber have been accumulated and are available for quick disposal; and whether, in the circumstances of prevailing distress, he will make arrangements to have the accumulated stores distributed to citizens in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been represented to me that difficulties are being experienced in <Col N="941" /> different urban areas, including Dublin, in securing firewood supplies, but I cannot accept the suggestion that supplies of fuel in the City of Dublin are inadequate.  Stocks of merchantable turf are available to meet domestic requirements in the City of Dublin as in other areas.</P>
      <P>Reserve stocks of firewood have been accumulated but these are being held as an iron ration to meet any major emergency that may arise.  It is not the intention to release this fuel at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that at present there is a considerable shortage of turf in the city, and that poorer people, especially, are finding it very difficult at certain times to get turf?  It is very hard for a person who has not sufficient fuel to see these enormous dumps of wood in Dun Laoghaire and Inchicore which could very quickly be made available to them and in which, in fact, the wood is deteriorating in quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the facts are quite different from what the Deputy stated.  Nobody in Dublin should have any difficulty whatever in procuring a ration of turf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is entirely different from the Minister's. The stocks of wood could be easily made up by the Government later on in the year and portion of the stocks could be let out now before Christmas. The shortage is causing very considerable hardship on a lot of people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett (for Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will give detailed particulars as to how the sum in excess of £1,000,000, which it is stated Irish Shipping, Limited, is saving this country in insurance premiums, is made up, showing the different savings effected on ships, freights and cargoes; if he will state when these several risks were first covered by Irish Shipping, Limited, the varying rates on which the said saving is calculated and the period over which the said saving has been achieved; <Col N="942" /> and also by whom and to what extent Irish Shipping, Limited, has been from time to time financed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Shipping, Limited, is entitled to the same privileges as any other joint stock company in regard to the publication of its accounts and the details of its business. There is no obligation whatever on the company to publish particulars such as those asked for in the question and I cannot see my way to disclose them.  I may say, however, that I have had an opportunity of examining the figures and the method of computation and I have satisfied myself that in the company's last accounting year, namely, that which ended on the 30th June, 1943, the company has saved for this country a sum in excess of £1,000,000 which would otherwise have gone abroad in respect of premiums on the insurance of hulls and freights against war risks.  Moreover, this figure does not include anything for premiums in respect of war risks on cargoes.</P>
      <P>The company undertook the insurance of land war risks at Lisbon in July, 1941.  It decided to carry war risks on its own hulls and on freights in April, 1942.  The cargo war risk insurance scheme commenced in October, 1942.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the question, apart from the company's share capital, it was for some time financed by bank accommodation under a guarantee given by the Minister for Finance in pursuance of the provisions of Emergency Powers (No. 72) Order, 1941, and Emergency Powers (No. 157) Order, 1942.  The necessity for bank accommodation no longer exists and the guarantee of the Minister for Finance has lapsed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett (for Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state if the letters recently addressed by his Department to traders to whom shipping space for imports had been allocated conveying representations as to effecting insurances with Irish Shipping, Limited, mean that such space will be given only or preferentially to those who insure with Irish Shipping, Limited; if so, if any public statement as to the adoption of this policy has been made, and further, if the Board of Irish Shipping, Limited, had been advised of and had approved of the contents or the purport of these letters and the dates upon which the said company had made the representations ascribed to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first and third parts of the question is in the negative, and the second part does not arise.  It would be entirely incorrect to place on these letters any such interpretation as that suggested in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>The limited space available on Irish ships for the import of goods from abroad is allocated under my direction by reference solely to the nature of the goods to be imported and the purpose for which they are required.  The representations referred to in the letter issued to certain traders were made orally to my Department following inquiries addressed to the company.</P>
      <P>I have caused a further letter to be addressed to the traders in question for the purpose of removing any misunderstanding on their part as to the interpretation of the letters previously addressed to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>If the implication which the normal person would take from that letter was not, in fact, the implication intended, what was the purpose of sending the letter out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy's interpretation of the implication which a normal person would take from the letter would be. In my opinion, it is the business of persons engaged in commercial activities to support such an enterprise as <Col N="945" /> that which Irish Shipping, Limited, has undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not dealt with the point which I raised, which was: what was the purpose of sending out that letter if it was not that which most people thought was implied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose was to advise persons importing goods to place their insurances with Irish Shipping, Limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the letter bears that interpretation on the face of it and I am quite certain that persons familiar with the procedure in connection with the allocation of shipping space would be under no misapprehension, because space is allocated, and must be allocated, before any question of insurance arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister appreciates that large numbers of people who received that letter took it that, if they did not arrange to insure through Irish Shipping, Limited, their chance of obtaining shipping space would be very remote.  That is what most persons who received the letter thought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount paid out of public funds during the 12 months <Col N="946" /> ended 30th November, 1943, to subsidise flour was £1,736,368 4s. 10d. Subsidy is not paid direct to flour millers; they obtain imported wheat from Grain Importers (Éire) Limited at such a price as enables them to produce flour at the controlled price.  The losses incurred in these transactions by that company are recouped by issues to them from the Vote.</P>

Tanners in this country are prepared to purchase any suitable hides offered to them through the usual trade channels.  There is a limited export of hides to Great Britain at present but export facilities are granted only to firms who normally engage in this export trade and only in cases where my Department is satisfied that the hides are surplus to the requirements of the tanneries.</P>

      <P>The Electricity Supply Board has completed plans for the erection at Clonsast of a generating station using peat as fuel.  Tenders for this work had been obtained at the outbreak of war.  It will be necessary to obtain revised tenders at the end of the emergency period.  Expenditure to the amount of £6,110 has already been incurred by the board in the survey and acquisition of the site for the station and in the construction of a railway siding connecting with the Great Southern Railways system, which work is not completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> As regards the production at Clonsast bog of turf suitable for use in a generating station, the maximum quantity so far won in any year was 45,000 tons.  This annual output will of course, be considerably increased when delivery of the remainder of the machinery has been effected.  The lowest average present price per ton delivered at or near Portarlington is 35/- per ton, but in this connection it will be appreciated that when the output reaches its maximum the cost per ton will be materially reduced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, I am aware that proposals which would result in depriving the nursing staff of the Galway Central Hospital of a portion of the Nurses' Home are at present under examination.  The adoption of this course has arisen out of the necessity for taking some steps towards relieving the grave overcrowding of patients in the Central Hospital.  The present overcrowding is of serious import and a solution must be found.  Other means of solving the problem have been examined and found to be impracticable.  The new maternity block which will shortly be completed will provide accommodation for 40 patients, but that would only relieve one half of the present overcrowding. The scheme under examination is to adapt the two-storey block at the rere of the Central Hospital containing maids' sleeping quarters and a lecture room for the accommodation of patients.  This necessitates the provision of alternative accommodation for the maids.  As a purely temporary arrangement, and as a preferable alternative to requiring the maids to reside outside the hospital, it is proposed to utilise portion of the ground floor of the Nurses' Home as sleeping accommodation for the maids.  The nurses will still have available in the home a visitors' room, a large dining-room and two other general rooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the arrangements which I have outlined are given effect to, I would, <Col N="956" /> in the circumstances, have no option but to concur.  I can assure the Deputy that the allocation of portion of the Nurses' Home for maids will be a purely temporary measure and that every step possible will be taken to provide alternative accommodation for the maids within the institution, pending a permanent solution for the relief of overcrowding in the hospital.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider making representations to the county manager to the effect that proper accommodation should be provided for these nurses, in view of the fact that accommodation has been given there to students who could attend lectures in the college?  I understand that accommodation is provided for these students and other officials, and, surely, it should be an easy matter to arrange for their accommodation elsewhere rather than deprive the nurses of accommodation?  After all, the medical students could receive their lectures in the college, which is only two or three minutes' walk away.</P>

These nurses feel that it is not necessary to deprive them of the accommodation that was provided for their private use, for the purposes now proposed. It would appear that this may cause a grave dislocation in the case of the Galway Central Hospital, because I understand that the attitude of the nurses is that they will take serious action in the event of this being done</P>

I cannot undertake to do anything in the matter.  The Deputy must realise that the manager is responsible for this, and that I cannot override the good sense or knowledge of the manager in a matter of this sort. The manager is responsible for the accommodation of the patients in the hospital, and he has to see that the hospital accommodation, generally, is properly maintained.

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the Debates (column 1371) of the 28th October, 1948.  When introducing the Vote for my Department on that date I made a full statement in regard to the provision of special assistance in the present financial year for persons undergoing domiciliary or dispensary treatment or who have received sanatorium treatment, and the provision of facilities for the segregation in their own homes of tuberculous patients, including separate beds, and bedding.  In the case of necessitous patients undergoing treatment in institutions, the arrangements included the provision of suitable clothing outfits such as underwear, overcoats, boots and shoes so that the patients may be able to benefit fully from their stay in the institution.  These measures are to be given effect to in Dublin at once.</P>
      <P>As regards the latter part of the question the doctors and nurses employed by local authorities in connection with the treatment of tuberculosis possess full knowledge of the circumstances of all classes of patients dealt with under these schemes so that in these cases the employment of almoners does not seem to be justified.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to state when it is proposed to carry out the extension referred to at Youghal Auxiliary Mental Hospital. This is a matter which primarily concerns the committee of management. The representations recently received were made by the Youghal Urban District Council.  The principal body concerned is the Joint Committee of Management of Cork District Mental Hospital of which the Youghal institution is an auxiliary.  The area of the mental hospital district embraces Cork City and County and the ratepayers of both these areas would be affected.</P>
      <P>When the improvements at Youghal were proposed it was intended that the expenditure should not exceed £200,000.  That was in the year 1938. Sketch plans were subsequently submitted and it then became apparent that the expenditure would exceed £300,000.  The Youghal institution provides accommodation for harmless patients and, except as a means of relieving overcrowding in the mental hospital at Cork, the scheme at Youghal could not be regarded as an urgent one.  In 1940, as an alternative to proceeding at that time with the scheme at Youghal and with a view to providing a certain amount of additional accommodation to relieve the overcrowding in the Cork Mental Hospital, my Department agreed to the erection by the committee of management of a new block at the latter institution. This has now been completed and is occupied.  The cost was £24,000 and it is estimated that the building so provided has relieved 50 per cent. of the overcrowding.  The number of inmates in Cork Mental Hospital has fallen by 200 in the past four years.</P>

I have had no representations from that body in regard to delay in putting a new scheme into operation.  The local authority started some time ago a scheme for the improvement of the water supply of the town, but owing to difficulty in obtaining certain requisites it has not, so far, been found possible to complete it fully.  In the interval the plans for the sewerage scheme have been in course of preparation.  The planning of the scheme has presented considerable difficulty to the local authority as either a pumping or ejector plant will be necessary, and it is doubtful if such plant could be obtained at the present time.  I am addressing the council in the matter and as soon as the necessary documents are received from the local authority they will be dealt with.</P>

      <P>The operations of the Forestry Act in restraint of tree felling have not been relaxed.  All general permits for tree felling were withdrawn at the outbreak of war.  No person can legally fell any tree, with some minor exceptions, unless he has given 21 days' prior notice of his intention to do so to the sergeant in charge of the nearest Gárda <Col N="966" /> Síochána station, and has not, within that period, received from the Minister for Lands an Order prohibiting the felling.  In any case where a Prohibition Order is issued the Minister may, after inspection, grant a licence for the felling of some or all the trees, either unconditionally or subject to conditions as to satisfactory replanting.  Any person who cuts down or uproots, or causes or permits to be cut down or uprooted, any tree in contravention of the provisions of the Act is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £5 in respect of every tree concerned.</P>
      <P>Licences granted for felling are subject in every case involving an appreciable number of trees to a replanting condition, and it is the intention to insist upon the fulfilment of that condition.</P>
      <P>The demand for native timber has resulted in a great increase in the number of trees felled annually, and seems to have led to a widespread belief that the restrictions on tree felling may be ignored on the plea of urgent requirements for fuel or industrial purposes. I am not prepared to accept that plea, and I am determined to insist as far as possible upon the preservation of immature trees and of trees required for shelter or ornament, and upon adequate replanting to provide for the replacement of felled trees.</P>
      <P>In the five years 1933-1938, inclusive, 140 prosecutions for illegal fellings took place, and resulted in 130 convictions and ten dismissals.  In the year 1938-39, there were 60 convictions and four dismissals; in 1939-40, 141 convictions and 11 dismissals; 1940-41, 66 convictions and two dismissals; 1941-42, 206 convictions and five dismissals; 1942-43, 283 convictions and 14 dismissals.  These figures indicate an alarming growth in the number of illegal fellings.  In the single year 1942-43, more than twice the number of prosecutions took place as compared with the five-year period before the war.</P>
      <P>Under Emergency Powers (No. 169) Order, the felling of trees standing within 30 feet of the centre of any road (including private roads and avenues) is, with very few exceptions, entirely forbidden.</P>

      <P>The normal grant to the Royal Irish Academy is £3,200 and this amount was included in the main Estimate for 1943-44 which has already been passed by the Dáil.  In 1941-42 a Supplementary Estimate was presented to the Dáil for an additional grant of £200 for the Academy and a supplementary grant of similar amount was provided in 1942-43.</P>
      <P>It was hoped that this additional subsidy would not have to be repeated and the provision included in the current year's estimate was limited to the normal grant of £3,200.  Recently, however, the Academy made representations for additional assistance to meet increased expenditure arising mainly out of the printing and publication of their proceedings.  For a variety of reasons the number of research papers suitable for publication by the Academy has been increasing for some time back and, after consideration of the Academy's representations, the Minister for Finance agreed to give the Academy an additional £300 this year.  The Supplementary Estimate before the House is presented accordingly.  If the Academy want additional assistance next year they will have to make their case for it to the Minister in due course.  Although savings on the Vote already passed, sufficient to meet the extra £300, are expected, a Supplementary Estimate is necessary to enable these savings to be utilised, as the annual assistance to the Royal Irish Academy is provided by way of Grants-in Aid, and the rules as to Parliamentary control of expenditure do not permit of a Grant-in-Aid being increased without the sanction of the Dáil.

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate arises because of the additional amounts required under three sub-heads, which are not related one to the other.  The first sub-head is the health embarkation certificate service.  As Deputies are aware a number of Irish workers are at present proceeding to employment in Great Britain under arrangements which have been made for the protection of their interests with the British Ministry of Labour and National Service.  During the course of the year the British authorities alarmed, I think, at some minor outbreaks of typhus or typhoid which were reported in this country proposed to require workers proceeding to employment in Great Britain to go to centres in that country for medical examination. The Government here considered that regulation undesirable for many reasons, particularly in the interests of the workers themselves, and following consultation with the British authorities, arrangements were made for the medical examination of workers before they left this country.  Consequently, the British Ministry of Labour and National Service made regulations which required workers who were proceeding to employment in Great Britain to have health certificates issued by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> In consequence of that regulation a service was established for the medical examination of workers in this country. Those who are found medically fit are given the certificates.  Where necessary, treatment for scabies or lice infestation is given.  Those who cannot be regarded as being in a sufficient state of health are refused the certificate, and they are not put to the expense and trouble of travelling to Great Britain before that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The main item in the Vote is an increase in the advances to the Mineral Development and Exploration Company.  As Deputies are aware, this company, which was set up to explore and develop the mineral resources of the country, is, during the war, confined to such commercial activities as are concerned with the working of phosphate rock in County Clare, and pyrites in County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>The company is financed by means of repayable advances from the Exchequer, and the Act under which it was established put a limit of £50,000 to these advances.  By Emergency Powers Orders, that limit was raised to £160,000, and additional funds were made available to the company.  It is proposed to regularise the position in the next session of the Dáil by the introduction of amending legislation. That amending legislation will not merely provide for an alteration of the limit in the repayable advances that may be made to the company, but it will also provide for the amalgamation of this company with the other company which was formed for the development of Slieveardagh coal mines.  I propose also to change the Irish name of the company from the present rather cumbersome title to something much more simple.</P>
      <P>The immediate sum involved in this Supplementary Estimate is required to further the work of mineral exploration and development by the company in relation to the Clare deposits and the Wicklow pyrites.  As Deputies are aware certain quantities of phosphate rock were won in County Clare by quarrying operations.  The time now has come, however, when it is no longer possible to procure production by means of quarrying, and in order to maintain production of phosphate rock it is necessary to embark upon mining&mdash;a much more expensive operation requiring an expansion in the amount of capital invested in the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of pyrites, the difficulty which the company is experiencing is due to the fact that only lump pyrites can be utilised in furnaces of the superphosphate manufacturers.  The bulk of the pyrites available was in a powder form which these furnaces are not <Col N="973" /> capable of burning.  In consequence, the activities of the company in that regard are somewhat restricted.  It is not an immediate problem, because we have been able to import fairly substantial quantities of pyrites from Spain.  Whether we will be able to import more, or not, is very doubtful, but the stock available in the country is sufficient to secure the utilisation of the quantity of the phosphate rock likely to be available during the coming year.  Some 14,000 tons of phosphate rock have been produced by the company in County Clare, and about 500 tons of pyrites have been sold to the sulphuric acid manufacturers.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated by the House, of course, that the activities of the company are related solely to emergency conditions.  The quantity of phosphate rock normally imported would be about 100,000 tons per year, and it is probably true to say that the total quantity of it in Clare, so far as it has been revealed by exploration work, is less than a year's normal requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The total quantity proved to exist.  In the present circumstances, where it is very difficult or almost impossible to get supplies of phosphate rock from abroad, and then only with very considerable difficulty and expense, clearly we must make the fullest use of our available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the mining or quarrying of 100,000 tons in Clare exhaust the entire deposit there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  The exploration work is being continued.  In so far as it is possible to estimate the quantity of rock there from the borings already made, it is, I think, true to say that 100,000 tons would exhaust the deposit&mdash;possibly less.  What I wish to point out is that this Clare phosphate activity of the company is an emergency activity only.  I do not hold out to the House that there is any prospect of permanent industry to be developed there on the basis of our present knowledge.  We have instructed the company to go ahead with this <Col N="974" /> work because, irrespective of other considerations, including cost, the aim was to get the maximum quantity of phosphate rock procurable by any means.  The company worked by quarrying, naturally, so long as it was practicable to do so, but now quarrying has exhausted the quantity available by that method, and it is undertaking production by the more expensive method of mining.</P>
      <P>In the case of the pyrites in Wicklow; it is of course possible to utilise the powder pyrites in furnaces of a somewhat different type to those at present installed by the chemical manufacturers. There is a possibility of a permanent and successful development in County Wicklow.  However, it is not desirable to be more specific than that until a great deal more exploration work has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third item is a minor one involving in fact a very much smaller amount of money than that stated in the Estimate. As the House will remember, we had a pavilion at the New York Fair.  An English company did certain work in connection with that pavilion. It was necessary for that English company to enter into some contracts and to purchase materials in New York. The Consul-General in New York guaranteed payment for these materials and services by the English company. Against that guarantee, there was withheld from the amount due to the English company the sum of £1,246. In the event, the English company went into liquidation and defaulted in its payments.  The amount of the default in our case was £1,258 1s. 1d., against the sum of £1,246 which had been withheld from the company. Furthermore, there was an item of £20 representing goods supplied by an Irish company to this English company for display in the fair, which were neither displayed nor returned to the Irish company, and it has been impossible for that company to obtain redress from the English company which was in default.  The cost of these was £20, so that the total liability that is imposed on the State is £1,279.  Against that £1,279 there has been, as I stated, £1,246 withheld from the company and <Col N="975" /> the deficit has to be made good by this Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It raises the question of the wisdom of the methods pursued in the manufacture of superphosphates. I understand that there is a new method now being carried on on the Continent for the manufacture of superphosphate without the use of sulphuric acid.  The rock is roasted with alkaline, with the result that soluble phosphates are produced.  If this method could be adopted with the Clare rock, in view of the fact that the Clare rock is excessively hard and requires a very substantial quantity of sulphuric acid over and above the amount normally used in the treatment of North African phosphates, it would result in a very considerable saving. This is a matter that should be fully investigated because it would get over the difficulty of the powdered pyrites and the expensive method of breaking down raw phosphates to convert them into superphosphates.</P>

      <P>I should like some more information from the Minister in connection with the proposed scheme of medical examination for persons who propose to leave the country.  I can quite understand that from every point of view, national and international, it is desirable that people should be fully medically examined in order to ensure that there would be no adverse comments when they arrive in another country, but I gather from the Minister's statement that some new type of local government service is being created, and that it is proposed through the medium of this service to examine these persons in Dublin.  If their condition is found satisfactory, it is proposed to issue a certificate to them of a clean bill of health, whereupon they can entrain for Great Britain or Northern Ireland, as the case may be.  I should like to know something more from the Minister as to the actual operation of this scheme.  Does it mean that a man in Kerry or Kildare who gets a permit, a passport or a travel visa, will have to come up to Dublin for that examination?</P>

      <P>Let us take the case of a worker in Kildare who comes to Dublin, arrives at night and is medically examined and who is told by the examining authority: &ldquo;You will have to undergo treatment for a couple of days.&rdquo;  That means that the man has to go back home to undergo treatment because it is impossible for him to remain in Dublin.  I am wondering whether it would not be possible to give such a person a medical examination locally so that whatever superficial treatment he might require could be administered locally.  He could present himself to the local dispensary <Col N="978" /> officer, who would administer any treatment necessary and thereupon issue a certificate, instead of obliging the person to come to Dublin to get that certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  Apart from Slieveardagh I think this mineral exploration company has rather restricted its activities and might usefully have explored for minerals elsewhere.  It is asserted on high technical authority, including the ex-head of the geological survey department, that there are extensive deposits in the Leinster Basin, and that these are of a kind that are merchantable, and the winning of these deposits would provide not only a local industry but certain raw materials of which we are in dire need.  I want to avail of this Estimate to suggest to the Minister that seeing that the total deposits of rock in Clare constitute only one year's import of phosphatic rock and there is not very much scope for development, the Minister should endeavour to switch the efforts of the company to other areas where minerals are definitely known to exist.  In this connection I want to again notify the Minister of the reputable report that has been made of the existence of minerals in the Leinster coalfield and to suggest that the company might investigate it not merely by carrying out a geological survey but by borings&mdash;borings being of course, the most reliable method of obtaining evidence of the existence of minerals.  Judging by the evidence available, of engineers and the ex-head of the geological department and local records I think that mining work in that area is something that ought to be undertaken.  If there are minerals there well and good, they can be made available.  If they are not there in <Col N="980" /> quantities which are merchantable, well and good, at least we will have explored the deposits and we will know that we are not losing a source of mineral wealth.</P>

They go and see the agent and he gives them a voucher for their journey.  They arrive in Dublin with their bag and a ticket marked &ldquo;C.E.F.&rdquo;  There is a fellow there waiting for them, and if they have to go home, they are sent home and all expenses paid.  As the result very largely of the vigilance of our <Col N="981" /> Departmental officials, these men are well looked after, and the Federation of Engineering Industries treats the men equitably and reasonably well.  I am not so sure that that was the case in the early stages, but negotiations were undertaken, and as a result of the efforts of our officials there is no reason to apprehend that these men are now inequitably treated.  I want, however, to draw attention to Mr. Pat Dooley who, in the name of the Connolly Association, claims to be seeking to serve the best interests of these men.  Now, if there is anything scandalous or wrong, here is the place to deal with it.  If there is anything wrong, this is the best place to deal with it in the open.

      <P>Pat Dooley reports the activities of Flann Campbell.  He is a Trinity College man and has tramped through the Nissen huts, concrete mixers, mud and sand piles, the buildings of East Anglia, assisting building workers and shop stewards to organise better conditions for Irish lads.  He addressed a speech to the Irish lads, in the course of which he said: &ldquo;Belfast man and Dubliner work side by side and neither have any time for Fascist propaganda.&rdquo;&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Campbell, &ldquo;grievances must be remedied.  Bonus rates are often incompletely assessed.  An end must be put to the discrimination with regard to clothing coupons and, to great applause', an ending to the verminous condition of the Kingdom Hotel in Dublin through which Irish workers pass en route to Britain.&rdquo;  Is this Kingdom Hotel one of the ordinary centres through which they pass?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only hotels which have been approved are the Globe Hotel in Talbot Street and the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Fitzwilliam Square. There was a complaint at one time concerning conditions of some of the hotels to which these workers were sent.  I do not think they had necessarily to stay in them but they were directed to them by employers' agents, who paid for their keep in the hotel overnight.  In order to remedy any possible grievance on that score there was a complete examination of every one of these premises.  Only those which were regarded as suitable were approved.  A limit was placed on the number of people who could be accommodated and arrangements were made to see that there was adequate lavatory accommodation and that the places were scrupulously clean.  Possibly at the beginning there was some cause for complaint but the activities of the Department of Local Government and Public Health have eliminated that cause for complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At least we can take this occasion to assure Flann Campbell, Pat Dooley and the Connolly Association that it is nonsense to publish broadcast that the workers proceeding from Ireland to Britain are confined in verminous premises in Dublin.  I think I might, at this stage, say that if people have information that workers are being confined in verminous premises they would better serve the interest of the workers if they would write a half-penny postcard to the Minister for Local Government or to the Lord Mayor of Dublin, who is a member of this Dáil and a member of the Labour Party, and say that they are informed that certain premises to which Irishmen are being directed are unsatisfactory.  If they are sincerely interested in the welfare of the workers, and not in getting a bit of disreputable, publicity for themselves, they ought to know that, if they cannot trust the Minister for Local Government, they ought to be able to trust the Lord Mayor of Dublin to ensure <Col N="983" /> that whatever remedial measures are necessary, will be taken.  While demurring very strongly to the kind of scabious publicity which Flann Campbell indulged in, I think occasion might be taken by the Minister to make clear that if any responsible person hears of any complaint that these young lads or these girls may have in the course of their journey to Great Britain, or in their employment with the federation, the proper course is to communicate the facts to the Minister and, whether the story be well or ill-founded, it will be investigated and will be followed up.  That course should have been taken before indulging in publicity of the character I have referred to in connection with this Connolly Association pamphlet.</P>
      <P>With regard to sub-head J (3), I think we have learned to-day a very salutary lesson.  The Fianna Fáil Party have been stumping this country for the past 20 years suggesting that but for the utter futility of their predecessors and everybody else, but for the dark conspiracies hatched in the Civil Service, we could have drawn from Clare all the superphosphate that would be required for this country for a generation.  It now emerges that the total known deposit in Clare is not sufficient to provide one year's consumption of superphosphate for this country.  And that is what all the hullabaloo was about.  Upon my word, I was almost beginning to believe there was some truth in what I heard, both here and outside, that there was enough superphosphate in Clare to fertilise the whole of Europe.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is, but it will not be there very long if the Fianna Fáil Party get after it.  I do not suppose we can prevent them lashing out this £88,850.  I believe most of it will be lost.  The process of educating Fianna Fáil has been, and still is, a very expensive business; but I suppose so long as Deputy Norton wants to go prospecting in the Leinster basin, he is not going to oppose Fianna Fáil prospecting in every constituency in the country, and so long as it is necessary to prop up the Party by experiments in Slievardagh and elsewhere, I suppose appropriations will be brought in here in the sacred name of mineral deposits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last thing I want to refer to concerns the losses at the New York World Fair.  That subject was brought before the Committee of Public Accounts during the last two or three <Col N="985" /> years.  A great deal of money was lost in connection with the New York World Fair.  If any Deputy has read the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts he will have seen that the Committee came to the conclusion that there was not much blame to be assigned to any of the officers of our own Departments in connection with these losses.  I am sorry that the Minister did not take the occasion of this, which, I rather imagine, will be the last Supplementary Estimate in connection with the losses arising out of the New York World Fair, to give the House a picture of the total cost that our exhibit involved us in.  At some stage I think we ought to get from the Minister&mdash;perhaps when he has disposed of all the liabilities that the exhibit gave rise to&mdash;a statement of what the total cost was.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I agree that the Government was right in taking a stand at the New York World Fair, and in doing what they did, but I think it would be well that the House should realise what it means going into an exhibition of that kind; Deputies should realise that you are liable to be exploited in the most extraordinary way by sharks who get monopolies in the business of erecting stands and carrying out display work and one thing or another of that kind. My recollection is that at the Committee of Public Accounts we were told stories by the Accounting Officers&mdash;the full record will be found in the minutes of evidence&mdash;that would astonish the House, if they were carefully studied&mdash; stories of the extent to which we and every other exhibitor were held up by contractors and other persons who got monopolistic rights in constructing stands and providing display equipment at the fair.</P>
    <P>Whether, if we are to enter any other exhibition of that kind in the future, we should not try to take some measures to exact from the Government which acts as host for the fair some sort of guarantee that there will be a schedule of charges payable to the Government which acts as host and allow that Government to settle with its own nationals who do the contract work, is something that I think <Col N="986" /> ought to be considered.  It is extremely difficult for foreigners to be masters of the whole technique of dealing with contractors in other countries, and they are very liable to something closely approximating to blackmail if they find their stand is not completed and the exhibition is to open in a very short time.  I can conceive of no machinery whereby a visiting Government can be protected against that kind of thing, unless by an arrangement whereunder the visiting Government deals with the Government which acts as host and let the home Government deal with its own contractors, knowing all the strings and so forth, and being thus able to circumvent any attempt at a hold-up by the class of contractors to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to go back to the first matter I mentioned, and only for the purpose of saying this: I understand the Irish Labour Party availed of the services of Mr. Flann Campbell, who was so eloquent in the pamphlet I quoted, during the general election.</P>

That is not true.  There may be individual cases where the conditions were not as they should be, but I want to make the point that any honest person desiring to protect the travellers and the country which is receiving them as host would write to the Minister for Local Government or to the Labour Lord Mayor of Dublin and get that situation put right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the hotels approved for the accommodation of persons travelling to take up employment in Great Britain, the position is that only two such hotels are at present approved.  Each of these is inspected daily by the medical officers of the Department of Local Government, and the Dublin Corporation, and there are very strict regulations as to the total number of persons who may be accommodated, and as to the facilities which must be provided there.  If, in either hotel, there were found to be unsatisfactory conditions, approval would be withdrawn.  I think it is possibly true to say that, in the early stages, there were some hotels to which these workers were sent in which conditions were not satisfactory.  I should not like to say, because I could not be certain of my own knowledge, that the hotels were unclean, but it is undoubtedly true that they were sometimes overcrowded, and also true that lavatory accommodation was insufficient. The hotel mentioned in the pamphlet from which Deputy Dillon quoted, and some others, have not been approved for this scheme and are not being utilised in connection with the scheme.  The Globe Hotel in Talbot Street and the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Fitzwilliam Street are the only hotels approved, and these are inspected daily by the medical officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And if any complaint arises and is relayed to the Minister, he will have it investigated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  There are, of course, complete liaison arrangements between ourselves and the British Ministry of Labour and National Service to eliminate any causes of complaints which may arise either here or in Great Britain in relation <Col N="990" /> to the accommodation provided for or the treatment of these workers.</P>
      <P>In the matter of the Clare phosphates, I think it is not correct to say that the Fianna Fáil Party or any section of it made fantastic assertions as to the size and value of these deposits. Quite early after the present Government came into office, a committee of experts was set up to investigate the Clare phosphate deposits and to report on their commercial development.  The report of that committee was adverse. One member of the committee disagreed with the report and undertook to submit a minority report, but in fact never did so.  The general tenor, however, of the report was adverse to the prospect of their successful commercial development in normal circumstances. All these considerations disappeared, however, when the war started.  When we found that the normal source of supply of phosphate rock, North Africa, was cut off and the difficulty of getting it from Florida, the only other source of supply, was very considerable, it became necessary to develop these deposits, even though they are of a lower grade than the rock normally imported, and even though the quantity known to exist or proven to exist was limited, because of our immediate needs.</P>
      <P>The company for which this money is required does not, of course, manufacture fertilisers.  They quarry the rock and produce the pyrites and sell them to fertiliser manufacturers.  The best utilisation of our resources having regard to the fertiliser needs of the country is a matter no doubt for the Government in present circumstances, and it is advised by the Industrial Research Bureau and by the manufacturers that, with existing equipment, the best use that can be made of our available supply of fertilisers and fertiliser-making machinery is the production of this compound fertiliser now being sold.  I should not like anyone to think from Deputy Dillon's reference to losses in connection with the New York World Fair that we had embarked there on some commercial enterprise which did not succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We put up a shop window at that fair, as we have often done at other international exhibitions and fairs, for the purpose of advertising our wares, hoping eventually to attract either business or tourists to our country.  We have frequently taken exhibition space and financed displays at fairs in countries with which we had in fact little trade at all, in the hope of developing better commercial relations. That is part of the normal national advertising in which all countries must engage in ordinary circumstances. In the case of the New York World Fair, we considered that, because of our commercial and other associations with the United States of America, it was desirable that we should not be missing from the international fair which they organised in New York.</P>
      <P>It has been my experience that, although we spend what is, for us, a substantial amount of money upon these exhibitions, most people who see them in relation to the gigantic displays of far wealthier countries urge that we should have spent more rather than less, because the displays which we can make possible with our limited resources naturally do not appear very elaborate compared with what the wealthy nations can undertake.  At the same time, the evidence is that the country as a whole has gained from these displays at international fairs. There is no question of displaying goods at any international fair now and possibly for some time to come, but when normal international trade relations are restored I should imagine that this question will arise again.  It is, however, a matter for the Dáil to decide how much we can afford to spend upon advertising of that kind and to decide to spend that in the recognition that it will not bring an immediate return in cash but may bring an ultimate return in improved commercial relations with the country concerned or in international good will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>There is no standard practice.  The Deputy understands that in the last 15 years or so&mdash;before the war&mdash;we have had displays at New York, at the Glasgow Exhibition and, I think, in Brussels.  In each case the circumstances were different.  In some cases, the exhibition authority provided the space and even provided the pavilion and you had only to supply the goods for display.  In other cases you had to build the pavilion yourself. The conditions are different in all cases.  A lot depends on the nature of the exhibition and the extent to which the Government behind it is prepared to lose money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister not undertake to direct the attention of this Exploration Company to the Leinster coalfield?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not possibly do that.  This company has an obligation to carry out an exploration of mineral resources everywhere.  Its only commercial activities at the moment are the Clare phosphates and the Avoca pyrites.  I do not think it would be possible for it to undertake any other form of commercial development of mineral resources at the present time because it could not possibly procure the equipment.  It did not succeed in getting the equipment necessary for the proper development of the pyrites deposits in Wicklow.  It has nothing to do with coal.  It may have following the introduction of the new Bill which I forecast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, however, to say this: that, normally, it is desirable that mineral development work should be done by private enterprise since it is highly speculative.  Every mineral development <Col N="993" /> work is a gamble which may produce a complete loss or a big profit. It is because of its highly speculative nature, in a country of our size, that it is difficult to get people to undertake it.  Where there is a reasonable prospect of success, however, private enterprise will be interested.  It is only where there is not that reasonable prospect of success that this company comes into the picture.  I would ask Deputies, therefore, in considering the operations of this company now and in the future to remember that it is being left with the most speculative of the possible development projects that are in the country.</P>
    <P>It may be that it will have losses to report to the Dáil from time to time, because many of the projects which it will explore will prove on exploration to be impracticable.  It is a rather risky matter for the Government to set up a company of this kind, because it will be left with the uneconomic fringe of the field which is there for development. In so far as there is development where the prospects are good, there will be private persons interested, and if there are, this company does not interfere.  These considerations do not arise in the case of the work upon which it is now engaged, because it is work which must be done, irrespective of cost.  Its main activity, in relation to post-war development, is at present being concentrated on exploration work with a view to ascertaining, so far as that can be done with precision, the areas in which permanent and profitable development will be possible.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> In pages 4 and 5, Section 3 (3), to delete paragraph (a) and substitute the following paragraphs:&mdash;</P>

    <P>(iii)  where the child normally resides with his mother, who is a widow or is living apart fromher husband, the mother,</P>
    <P>(iv)  where the child normally resides with his step-mother, who is a widow or is living apart from her husband, the step-mother,</P>
    <P>(v)  where the child is being educated at a boarding school or is boarded out for the sole purpose of attending school, the person with whom he would otherwise normally reside,</P>
    <P>(vi)  where the child is an inmate of a hospital, the person with whom he would otherwise normally reside,</P>
    <P>(vii)  where the child is an inmate of an institution (other than a hospital) and would otherwise normally reside with a person who contributes towards the cost of his maintenance in the institution, that person,</P>
    <P>(viii)  in any case to which none of the foregoing sub-paragraphs is applicable, the head of a household of which the child is normally a resident member,</P>
    <P>and the child shall be deemed not to be maintained by any other person;</P>
    <P>(b)  in any case to which any two of sub-paragraphs (i) to (iv) of paragraph (a) of this sub-section are applicable, the child shall be regarded as being maintained by <Col N="996" /> the person mentioned in the first in order of the applicable sub-paragraphs and shall be deemed not to be maintained by any other person.</P>
    <P>It will be recollected that, in the course of the Second Reading debate, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney raised a question on the legal implications of the terms used in sub-section (3) of Section 3 with particular reference to &ldquo;the custody, care and control&rdquo; by a person of a child.  An examination of the matter seemed to indicate that it was desirable to avoid the difficulties that might arise from a possible interpretation of these words.  Consequently, it is proposed to delete that sub-section and insert a new sub-section. The purpose of the new sub-section is to get rid of this legal difficulty to which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney referred, and to make it clear that residence with is the main proof of maintenance of a child by an adult. Where the child normally resides with the father, the father will be regarded as maintaining the child; where the child normally resides with the step-father, the step-father will be regarded as normally maintaining the child.  If the child's mother is a widow, or is living apart from her husband, then the mother or, as the case may be, the step-mother and so on down the list. The paragraphs in the new sub-section set out the person with whom the child normally resides.  That person will be regarded as the person maintaining the child.  There is an omnibus clause to deal with possible circumstances not visualised in drafting the sub-section.</P>

I quite understand what the Minister means by having those words inserted.  Cases may arise in which one of the parties to the maintenance of the child may be making a moiety contribution.

If any two parts of the sub-section apply in a particular case, it is the first one that will operate.  Circumstances may arise in which a mother is living apart from her husband, and is, say, living with another man.

      <P>I am not interfering with that.  I am not disputing that point nor do I want to alter the arrangement that is here.  What I am at is: If we assume that two persons have a liability towards the maintenance of a child, we will take for the sake of argument that one contributes 6/- per week and the other 4/- per week.  I am making no case as between one and the other, but what I want the Minister to have examined is whether this terminology interferes in any way with the 4/- a week contribution made by one of the persons?  In other words, could it be interpreted in a court by reason of this clause that the said 4/- was not being paid at all, although the person would be subsequently liable for an additional 4/-?</P>

      <P>On this amendment the question of establishing clearly the maintenance of the child arises.  One of the tests of maintenance arises when children are at school and you have to determine who is paying the school fees.  I want to suggest that that test of maintenance ought to be eliminated, because you will find in a number of cases, notably in the case of a widowed woman who may have five or six children, that perhaps a relative will undertake to educate them.  They are at school, and, in fact, I have a case in my mind in which a relative is paying for the maintenance of the children, but none of that lady's neighbours know that her circumstances are such that she has to call on the assistance of her brother who has family responsibilities of his own. If that test is applied that lady will have to display her affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But, surely, it is consistent with the principle we have already laid down, that whatever abuses might exist in certain households where the father was not as good a man as the mother&mdash;if I may use a bull&mdash;we should recognise the father as the head of the household and make the payment to him.  The House will recognise there is a distinct and normal father and mother and step-father, but one has to recognise that when a married woman with children re-enters matrimony, the step-father is the head of the household if he and <Col N="1002" /> his wife are living together as man and wife.  It would be rather strange to suggest that this second marriage had some kind of defect in it and that the distinction within the family should be emphasised. The obviously desirable thing for the step-father is that he should assume, with the consent of all parties, the role of head of the household. It would be rather unhappy if Dáil Eireann decided that we did not recognise a second marriage as a satisfactory family arrangement and persisted in the relationship of the natural mother.  The ideal situation should be that the step-father steps into the shoes of the deceased parent and assumes the headship of the household with the willing and close consent of all the parties, and it is in very few cases you will find that it is necessary to make a distinction, because of the possibility that a step-father might abuse the allowance, or misuse money he might receive for his step-children.  We should assume that he would use it with as much scrupulousness for his step-children as for his own children.  I think Dáil Eireann should act on that assumption.</P>

      <P>Would not the Leader of the Opposition feel that there is a great deal to be said for abstaining from any investigation of intimate family details, and that the advantage of that abstention far outweighs the very occasional undesirable circumstance where this peculiar situation arises: that there is a step-father who is contributing nothing to the family, and that the mother is the sole wage earner; in fact, the sole maintainer of the children?  I think the Leader of the Opposition will agree that that is a very rare circumstance, though, of course, it can arise.  Surely, if we set ourselves out to legislate for every conceivable kind of obscure complication of that kind that can arise, we would land ourselves in endless difficulties, and in this supreme difficulty, that we would have to set up an inspectorate which would cross-hackle every family as to who is actually doing the maintenance.  Surely that is a most undesirable thing.  The whole principle of the Bill has barred and bolted the door, apparently, against the bureaucrat. It is one of its best features. Undoubtedly, the desire to do that will create a certain number of anomalies, and we must pass this Bill in the certain knowledge that within 12 months' time we will be confronted with a group of these anomalies which will have to be abated in the best way we can. But, they are all being allowed to develop in the certain knowledge that they will develop in order to secure <Col N="1004" /> this supremely important principle, that the bureaucrat will not be thrust into the centre of the family.

      <P>On the Report Stage, I want to say a few words.  We have now passed the stage at which we can propose any amendment to the Bill in this House.  As a matter of fact, neither on the Committee Stage nor on the Report Stage was any person other than a member of the Government in a position to propose the amendment I have in mind because it would operate to place a small additional charge on the Exchequer.  I am going to urge the Minister for Industry and Commerce to introduce in the Seanad the amendment necessary to make of this Bill the complete success that it should be and could be.  I believe that 90 per cent. of the persons who interested themselves in this question of family allowances recognise that the financial burden which will be placed <Col N="1006" /> on the State is considerable and that they gladly salute the courage of the Government in undertaking this at the present time.  There may be those who will try to make the case that the family allowances are inadequate. Doubtless, the family allowances are inadequate in the judgment of us all if we had not to consider the resources from which we have to finance the scheme.  But, if we consider those resources, then I consider that the family allowances now made go probably as far as any reasonable Government could have been expected to go.</P>
      <P>But, having courageously gone thus far, for some utterly astonishing reason the Government have chosen to spoil the whole thing by an interpretation of their purpose which will result in little or no economy, but which will give rise to endless disappointment and dissatisfaction throughout the country. Ninety per cent. of the people believed when this Bill was published that, if they had three children, the family would receive in respect of the youngest of these children the family allowance until that youngest child had attained the age of 16 years.  But now it is clear that the Bill means that the family will get no allowance in respect of that child if the eldest of the children is over 16 when the Bill passes into law.  I urge on the Minister to amend that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have intervened on the Report Stage in order to avoid that dilemma which arises on the Fifth Stage.  I could not put down an amendment to this effect because any amendment I would put down would be ruled out of order on the ground that it would put an additional charge on the Exchequer.  The Minister could do this.  It seems to me fantastic <Col N="1007" /> that the Minister will not do it, because the additional charge would be microscopic and it would make all the difference between this measure being welcomed all over the country as a virtually flawless social reform and its being received with consternation by a very large number of people who had high hopes when it was introduced.  All I am asking is this: that the families of this country should be divided into two categories: those with only two children and those with more than two children, and that in any family where there are more than two children all the children after the first two should qualify the family for the family allowance until they had reached the age of 16.  I do not believe that that concession would cost the Exchequer £50,000.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy not appreciate that, if we adopted that suggestion, we would conceivably be paying a children's allowance to a family after the first two children of the family had married and were rearing families of their own and were drawing family allowances themselves? The Deputy is assuming that there is only a year between the first two children and the others.</P>

      <P>I have been trying to cover the Minister's flank throughout this debate in regard to all sorts of fantastic points raised against him, that this and that anomaly will arise. We all know, who have any experience of legislation, that anomalies are inevitable no matter how much care you give to the drafting of a Bill.  I know that you have families in which you have a situation where you have people who, at the very end of their <Col N="1008" /> married life, suddenly have a child 15 or 20 years after the last one has been born.  But that is not a common occurrence.  I agree, too, that you could have a very anomalous situation if you had a boy or girl married at the age of 20 or 21&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That need not be the circumstance at all.  The first two qualified children may be nephews living with a couple only recently married, and you could have the family structure of a nephew of 15 years, another nephew of 14 years, and a child of six months.  Does the Deputy suggest that we should keep on paying that family even if one of the nephews is 32 years and the second 31 years?</P>

      <P>I would be quite prepared to say that the concession I am seeking should be made in respect only of children born to the family itself, and not to adopted children, or to children who are only children of the family for the purpose of this Act.  If the Minister says that he is not prepared to give it in consideration of the class of case that he has just mentioned, I think it is a fair reservation. If he would come with me so far as to say that, in respect of the children born of the family, he would provide that, after the first two children, the family will receive family allowances in respect of each ensuing child born of the family, until it has reached the age of 16, I think he would remove, by that method, the last defect from the Bill. I am quite prepared to concede that what I may call the constructive children of the family should be debarred, but for the children born of the family I ask for a concession, and I submit that he should make it, even at the cost of £200,000 or £300,000 more.  No reasonable Dáil will ask him to go further than he is going at the present time, unless and until the circumstances undergo a change and a very much larger income and national revenue are available in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly anxious not to leave any flaw which would permit of effective agitation in the early future leading to a demand on this, or any succeeding Government, that any additional substantial concession should be <Col N="1009" /> made under this Bill.  Such demand should not be made.  It will take some time to adapt our national finances to the strain of this measure.  For those reasons, I most strongly urge on the Minister to consider whether, at least in respect of the children born of the family, he could not make the concession that I have suggested.  If it is made, I am certainly prepared to defend this measure in the country or anywhere else, as the utmost limit of social justice that this or any other Government could reasonably be asked to undertake in response to the national demand for the institution of this system of family allowances.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the case made by Deputy Dillon. There is just one point that I would like to refer to.  The Minister said in reply to Deputy Dillon that it might possibly happen that some of those children would be married and rearing their families.  Might I suggest, and I think Deputy Dillon might fall in with it, that the Minister might agree to bring in an amendment in the Seanad on those lines, and insert the provision that in all cases where children over 16 were being maintained by the family this would apply?  That would obviate the difficulties of the Minister, because if the children were married and settled down they would not be maintained by their parents, and some of them might have reached the age of 18 or 21 and have left the family and got work to support themselves. In all cases where the children were maintained, the younger children would get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter has been fully considered.  It was discussed here merely in relation to the normal run of families where there was only a year or two between every child.  Even though it was put in a different way the same result would be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No one asked that the allowance should go on until the child is aged 18.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an allowance attaching to the individual child. It is a contribution to the family by <Col N="1010" /> reason of the size of the family.  As I have repeatedly pointed out, the service is intended to help large families. We are not, therefore, bringing the child into it with half-a-crown a week attaching to it.  It is only if the size of the family is such that assistance of this kind is desirable or necessary it would be given.  May I say that in fixing the maximum age of 16 we have gone as far as any country in the world has gone?  No country in the world has made the allowance&mdash;where they have given it at all&mdash;except up to the age of 16.  In the majority of cases it is 14, and having regard to the cost of even a slight modification in the scheme I think we should let the scheme work as it is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what precisely the population structure is at the present time.  Deputy Connolly was good enough to send me a letter containing a number of estimates which he had made, based on the 1926 census, and which appear to indicate that the number of children benefiting under the Bill would be substantially larger than I had suggested in the Second Reading debate.  His calculations were based on the census of 1926, and my calculations were based, not on the census of 1926 but on the census of 1936, which showed a very considerable, almost alarming, drop in the number of children in the country.  It may be remembered that, at the time, it aroused considerable discussion in the country, and caused apprehension in the hearts of a number of national school teachers.  The indications are that the reverse change has taken place in the meantime, at least in so far as the total population of the country appears to have increased since the beginning of the war, despite the fact that a number of people over 22 have emigrated; and the suggestion is that the number of children has again risen in comparison with the number in 1936.  We will have more precise information concerning this from the register of population now being taken.  It is impossible to find out what the actual cost will be, and it would be wiser to await further information than to proceed with developments now.  The total amount <Col N="1011" /> which this country can provide for social services is limited, and the more we spend on this one the more restricted is our ability to provide assistance under other services.</P>
    <P>I think that when Deputies are speaking on a Bill of this kind, they should keep the whole picture before them, because efforts to make this service more satisfactory in its operation may have a very detrimental effect on our ability to carry out the perhaps necessary improvement in other services.  If it is generally recognised that the whole scope of our social services is inadequate, considering the humanitarian purposes they are needed to serve, we must remember that our ability to improve them is restricted by the wealth of the nation, its productivity, and other resources.  We cannot get the improvement we desire in the services until we get the increased resources that will make it possible, and we should be very slow to elaborate existing services until we are satisfied that such elaboration is essential and immediately necessary for the removal of want.  Rather should we concentrate our available resources in the direction in which they can do most good. I think that, over and above the £2,250,000 for which this Bill calls, any sums we can provide for relief of distress can be best spent in directions other than that indicated by this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At this moment, I claim the privilege to say that we have travelled a long way since I first raised this matter in Dáil Eireann in the autumn of 1938.  On that occasion, not only amongst my own colleagues but amongst Deputies on the Government and other benches, I was regarded as rather a &ldquo;wild catter&rdquo;&mdash;a man who advocated new things just because they were new and who did not think things out.  In the classic phrase of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I was &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;.  The Minister will forgive <Col N="1012" /> me if I experience a certain mild satisfaction in having brought him to the point of introducing my Bill and steering it through Dáil Eireann.  Next time he is tempted to say that Deputy Dillon is wrong, I invite him to dwell on the fact that Deputy Dillon brought him along the stony road of conversion and induced him to sponsor a measure which he had recommended to him.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I want to add that I recognise that the Minister has, amidst his multifarious faults&mdash;and God knows they are many and deplorable&mdash;certain good qualities, and one of them is a doughty courage.  He was once described by the <i>Irish Times</i> as a doughty fighter.  They waxed very enthusiastic about him.  That was one of the very rare occasions on which the <i>Irish Times</i> was right.  He possesses one of the very rare qualities which anybody&mdash;even the <i>Irish Times</i>&mdash;would be justified in praising.  I want to salute that courage to-night, as manifested in the bringing in of this Bill. If the Minister's name is associated in the history of this country with this reform, it will do something to remove the verdigris from his reputation and the general execration with which his name will be ordinarily remembered because of the havoc he has wrought to our nation.  I venture to promise him that, in memory of what he has done to-day, if an attempt is made to burn his effigy in the times to come, I shall be there with my quota of water to quench the conflagration.  If a statue be erected and if it be pelted with mud, I shall be there with my rag to rub off a little of it as a memorial of the present occasion.  When posterity come to judge him, I shall ask them to spare him from the verdict he has otherwise so richly earned.  I now venture to anticipate and to say that, when his political death is decreed by the court of the people, I shall ask them to review the sentence and to go no further than political penal servitude for life.  Any man responsible for a measure which, in my opinion, so vitally improves the social services of this State is entitled to some indulgence from posterity for his follies and even for his crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over and above that, I think that <Col N="1013" /> this country is giving a lead almost to Europe in the institution of this system.  I ventured to prophesy six years ago that we would establish family allowances, and my promise has come true.  I venture to forecast now that within the next decade every country in Europe will follow our example.  I am happy to think that this nation has set an example to Europe in this superb reform.  It is true&mdash;in a predominantly Catholic country it is right on occasion of this kind to recall the fact&mdash;that this is not an ideal solution of the problem with which we are dealing.  The ideal thing, from the Catholic social point of view, would be that we should have an economic setup in this country which would permit of every wage earner having a family wage for the work he does.  I thought that over a good deal, and I came to the conclusion that, in view of the smallness of the units of industry and agriculture in this country, it would be impracticable for us to hope for the organisation of industry on lines which would permit of the establishment and maintenance of the ideal system of the family wage payable by the employer to the man whom he employs.  The ideal being impracticable, I think we are doing the next best thing&mdash;that is, allowing the existing wage structure to function and to correct the anomaly inherent in such a system by providing from the common purse the differential in wages which we would have preferred industry to supply directly.  What we are, in fact, doing here is: we are correcting the anomaly of the unmarried man and the man with family responsibilities having a similar reward for their work.  In doing that, I believe that we are doing something which conforms with the highest standard of social justice to which any Government could aspire.  I congratulate this Government on undertaking the task, and I rejoice that the measure we are about to pass will pass with the unanimous consent of the Legislature.</P>

      <P>In view of that qualified eulogy, I think that a very special word of thanks is due to Deputy Dillon, who first advocated such a measure and who has been advocating it for years.  When he first spoke about it, he was practically a lone fighter.  Many Deputies were very sceptical about the whole idea.  Some went so far as to laugh at him when he spoke about it.  Now, the children for whom he fought such a valiant fight will have the last laugh.  At the same time, I am very glad that Deputy Dillon, on the Second Stage, sounded a necessary note of warning, which he has just now repeated, that we must not regard a scheme of children's allowances as anything like a substitute for a decent family wage.  This House, in putting through this measure, should send out a warning to all employers that they must not make it an excuse for not granting a decent family wage, that they must not make the fact that a man receives 5/- or 7/6 by way of children's allowances a reason for not increasing his wages where such wages are inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this at all, but, in view of the statements made by Deputy Dillon and other Deputies, I should like to say that I happen to be one of those people who, since the days when I worked as an agricultural labourer, believe in this scheme of family allowances.  I have always felt, however, that the agricultural labourer should be put on the same level as any other member of the community when it came to the matter of family allowances.  I must say that I congratulate the Minister and the Government on the introduction of this and other measures of social justice, but I feel it is my duty to say that in this particular regard the Government could have shown more appreciation of the work that is being done by the agricultural labourer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> In saying that, I do not mean to take away from what the Minister and the Government have done in this matter of social justice, but in view of what Deputy Dillon has said, I think I should point out that if the Government had followed Deputy Dillon's advice in former years there would be a lot of hungry children in this country at the present time.  Apart from that, however, I think that the Minister, in dealing with this scheme of family allowances, should have given preference to the agricultural labourers, rather than to other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>It is very hard on the agricultural labourer, with four or five children, two of whom are 15 or 16 years of age, and two or three of whom are under that age, to be deprived of the allowance, and I would urge on the Minister that preference should be given to such people because, after all, these are the people who form the main portion of the community and who have to do the real work of the community. Compare the case of a boy who gets into the Civil Service, or into other sheltered positions, with that of a boy working on a farm.  The boy working on the farm has to work from early morning until late at night, on every day in every week of the year.  He has, practically, none of the comforts of life.  In fact, he has only a bare existence, and I think that such a state of affairs should not be allowed to exist in a country such as ours.  Therefore, although I appreciate what the Minister has done in connection with measures of social justice such as this, I would appeal to him to be more lenient in the case of these allowances to agricultural labourers.</P>

      <P>I should like to say, merely, that in any remarks I uttered in the course of this debate I did not wish to take away from Deputy Dillon whatever credit may be due to him for his efforts in bringing about the introduction of this Bill.  Whether or not it is a historical fact that he was the first to advocate such a measure, it is true that he did speak on many occasions <Col N="1016" /> in favour of such a Bill as this, and, of course, any Deputy who speaks as often as Deputy Dillon is bound to be right some time.  The only thing I wish to say, in regard to the remarks of Deputies Dillon, Byrne and Tunney, is that I hope that when, next May, the Minister for Finance will be dealing with the financial measures that are an essential part of the whole scheme, the enthusiasm of these Deputies will be still undimmed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that he undertook to do certain things on the Report Stage.  We made a few points with regard to certain important aspects of this matter, and I think that Deputy Dillon succeeded in getting an undertaking from the Minister that he would consider these aspects between the Committee Stage and the Report Stage.  There were certain aspects of this Bill to which we took very strong exception, and I understood that the Minister had undertaken to review these matters.  Accordingly, I was very much surprised to notice that there was scarcely any change.  A rather important change has been made in regard to sub-section (1) of Section 3, but a question was raised, with regard to sub-section (3), as to this matter of the disqualification for membership of committees of agriculture, and also the matter of receiving any benefits or advantages offered in the pursuance of agricultural schemes administered by these committees, and so on.  I understood that the Minister undertook that, if the House felt it was necessary to have that safeguard put in, any benefits that a committee could secure would be of a general character.  At any rate, I certainly <Col N="1017" /> understood that the Minister undertook to look into the matter.  I also understood that he was to look into the matter of Section 5, but, on looking at that section, I find that there has been no change whatever.  That is the section to which the House generally took great exception, but the Minister, evidently, has considered no alternative with regard to a man's reelection in the case of the dissolution of one of these committees.  I understood that the Minister was going to look into that matter.</P>
      <P>Then, in regard to Section-9, I drew the Minister's attention to sub-section (2), which says that the Minister may terminate a suspension under that section, and that every such suspension shall continue until so terminated.  We felt that there should be some qualifying clause there&mdash;something to qualify the word &ldquo;terminate&rdquo;.  We felt that there should be something to the effect that the Minister should satisfy himself as to the grounds of suspension. As the sub-section stands, the Minister has complete and absolute power, regardless of the position of the committee concerned.  If the committee feel that they should not retain an officer, the Minister can terminate that officer's tenure of office without an inquiry, and we felt that if the committee took such a decision, unless the Minister was fully satisfied that it was a frivolous charge, there should be an investigation.  I understood that the Minister stated that he would have that matter investigated, and I wonder if he would tell us now why there has been no change in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Deputy Hughes in his expression of regret that while the Minister appeared to have a certain sympathy with the proposal that in the event of his dissolving the county committee of agriculture he would impose upon himself the duty of first seeking to reconstitute it out of the members of the county committee before he appointed an individual or group of individuals of his own choosing to discharge the functions of that body, the Minister now seems to have turned his back on that altogether.  I can recognise, of course, <Col N="1018" /> that it would be an additional nuisance to the Minister to have to do that, but I think that if the Minister really means to preserve the essentials of democratic local government he ought to accept the inconvenience he would have to face in the very unlikely event of his being properly called upon to use the powers in this section.  I cannot conceive such circumstances ever arising, but if they do I think we should have provided the elected body with the safeguard that Deputy Hughes suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other ground on which I strongly object to this Bill is Section 11.  That section is now incorporated in three Bills which this House has considered in the immediate past, and it operates to take from an officer his contract rights in his original contract of service. I know that in a matter of this kind it is extremely difficult to engage the sympathy of Deputies of Dáil Eireann, but I want to say that in passing Section 11 you are doing something which is contrary to justice.  It seeks to establish this principle that a young fellow of 23 or 24 years of age, with his life before him, is offered conditions of employment by the State. He looks at these conditions of employment and says: &ldquo;Well, the salary may not be as big as I can earn outside but there is a certain degree of security here, pension rights and a variety of other prerogatives available if I accept this contract of service&rdquo;.  Influenced by these considerations he goes in at 23 and accepts the employment.  Thirty years later when that man is a man of 53 years, when he cannot contemplate starting a new career, Dáil Eireann comes along and completely changes his conditions of employment.  Not content with doing that they enact Section 11 which bars and bolts the High Court to that individual, absolutely prohibits him from going before an equity or common law judge and saying: &ldquo;I have been unfairly treated by the Government and as an individual citizen I claim the protection of the judiciary.&rdquo;  We, Dáil Eireann, supposed to represent the people, being the delegates of the people sent here for the purpose of keeping our eyes on the Executive and preventing the Executive <Col N="1019" /> from unduly trespassing on the rights of the individual, enact Section 11 which says: &ldquo;The fact that an officer is in office at the date of the passing of this Act shall not be a ground for contending that the three immediately preceding sections of this Act do not apply in relation to such an officer&rdquo;.  There is no private employer in this country who can alter the conditions of employment and if the employee did not accept these alterations dismiss him without rendering himself liable to action for wrongful dismissal and payment of damages.  The State is no more entitled to wreak injustice than an individual.  It is true that the State has power to do injustice if we, the Deputies of Dáil Eireann, give to the Executive the authority.  We are the legislating instrument of this community and we should not give to the Executive authority to perpetrate injustice. What we are doing in this section is manifestly unjust.</P>
    <P>There is not a single Deputy in this House, if I got him alone in the Lobby, who would not agree with me that it is not fair to lure a man into your employment when he is a young man on one set of conditions and then radically to alter those conditions when he has passed middle age and forbid him access to the courts in order to get the damage done to him computed by an impartial judge if he has suffered damage.  There is not a single Deputy here who would not agree in private that it is unjust and wrong to do that and yet the whole Fianna Fáil Party will go into the Lobby and vote for it. I could go from here to those benches opposite and there is not a single Deputy who is an employee, either a teacher or something else, would not admit that they would bitterly resent it if they felt they were unjustly treated, yet they will go into the Lobby to-day to enact that the treatment of every employee of a county committee of agriculture is to be left to the Government.  It is bad enough to leave it to the Government but what in my opinion is so maddeningly unjust is to close the courts to them. There may be some addled-pated individual who will say there would not <Col N="1020" /> be many unfortunate teachers who could afford to go to the High Court. But the organisation could.  A test case could be brought and would be brought; in an analogous case a test case was brought and the rights of an individual member of the service were protected.  It is because the Minister and his advisers believe that this Bill would not stand examination by the High Court if a test case was brought that Section 11 was inserted.  I am not sufficient of a lawyer to judge whether the section is conformable to the Constitution. Personally I would strongly advise the association of vocational teachers and teachers in the State service to take advice at once with a view to determining whether such provisions are constitutional or not.  I do not believe we could get a sufficient number of Deputies and Senators to refer this matter to the Council of State, though I would gladly have that done, but definitely the persons to be affected have an organisation which can bring a test case.  Once before we had a Bill of this House rejected by the Supreme Court on the ground that it was a breach of the Constitution. A very grave breach of the Constitution and a very detestable one was attempted in that education Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a matter of higher principle was involved in that Bill, but I declare the purpose of Section 11 to be a meaner attempt at a breach of the Constitution.  It is a more contemptible and more hateful breach of the Constitution to do an injustice and then debar access to the courts.  Are Deputies going to stand for it?  Is there any voice in the Fianna Fáil Party with courage to get up and say that, bound as they are to their Party allegiance, they feel free vocally to demur from the proposal?  Is there any Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party who, knowing that if these provisions were to apply to himself he would resent them, will have the courage to get up and reject them?  Is there any member of the legal profession there who, recognising the utterly detestable character of the section, will get up and vindicate the profession to which he belongs by protesting on behalf of the individual citizens?  Is there any <Col N="1021" /> Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party who has so much independence who will say what he believes in regard to this section?  If there is, there is some hope for the Party system in this country; but if 68 Deputies, every one of whom knowing that this provision is mean and contemptible, is going to stay silent while it is passed, then God help the future of individual liberty in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Liam Cosgrave Mr. Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Liam Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say a few words in support of the matter with which Deputy Dillon was dealing. When replying on the Committee Stage the Minister stated that he knew of no case where an individual had been taken over by a county committee from the Department of Agriculture.  I do not want to name a particular individual, or the county committee under which he is now functioning, but he joined the service of the Department of Agriculture in 1909, and remained there continuously until 1928, when he was taken over by the county committee that he is now working with.  He has worked continuously with the same committee, with the exception of one or two brief periods, when he did temporary duty elsewhere.  When this man reaches 65 he will have had 45½ years' continuous service in connection with agriculture, the majority of the time being with the Department of Agriculture, and the remainder with the county committee.  When he joined the Department of Agriculture in 1909, at the age of 19 years, he was entitled to believe that at the end of his term he was going to have a fair basis of superannuation.  If he was not to receive that, he should have been told to the contrary when he entered. What the Minister proposes to do here is to conclude a contract on one side only.  This man joined the service of the Department under certain conditions, and the Minister now proposes to change the conditions to suit himself, thereby injuring the individual concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon stated, no private employer, no individual and no company can conclude a contract on one side, without leaving the employer or the company open to an action for <Col N="1022" /> wrongful dismissal or for breach of contract.  The State is setting up an example in this case, and similarly in the Vocational Education (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, by concluding a contract on its side, but the same courts which will grant redress to an individual aggrieved in the case of a private employer or a company are precluded by this Bill from even considering the application of an official who is treated in what can only be described as a detestable fashion.  The Minister is being set up as the sole arbiter of the rights of the private individual. When it comes to a matter of giving fair superannuation to an employee who came in under certain conditions and who is now too old or for whom there is no other position for which he might be suitable, open, the Minister can say: &ldquo;We are cutting your superannuation. We find you unsuitable and you can go.&rdquo;  The individual is left with no redress.  If that is the position a man who is entitled to a fair compensation should have the right of redress in the courts.</P>

      <P>I should like Deputy Hughes and other Deputies to realise that I did not leave the Dáil with the idea of paying no attention to this matter.  I did look into all the points that I thought required further consideration. I did not say that I would bring in an amendment, because it was wrong to make that promise.  I gave consideration to points that were raised.  I could give various explanations of the different sections referred to by Deputy Hughes.  One of the matters the Deputy did not mention concerned the laying of regulations on the Table.  As a matter of fact, on going back to the office I found that that point is covered in the main Agriculture Act of 1931, and that any regulations made under this Bill will be laid on the Table.  With regard to Section 3, the benefits must be of a general nature.  Deputy Hughes will admit that that was to a great extent settled, on the Committee Stage, because I was moving an amendment making it clear that the Minister could make an exception of a particular type rather than of a general nature.  In <Col N="1023" /> view of the wishes of the Dáil I withdrew that amendment.  The courts might take a different view, but the draftsman, who does not claim to be infallible, believes this to be of a general nature.</P>

      <P>The fact that I withdrew the amendment was sufficient proof that I had given in to the Deputy and that we were against any particular treatment for any person.  There was a long debate on Section 5, and on a division the Dáil decided that this power should be left in the Bill when the principle was decided that the Minister should have power to dissolve a committee of agriculture directly, without having to adopt the roundabout way that he had to go through previously, of going to the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister gets that power here directly. The section as drafted is a reasonable one, and anyone reading it would gather that the first thing to do was to see if the county council would appoint a new committee that would carry on under the circumstances then prevailing, whatever they might be.  If that were impracticable the next thing to do was to appoint an <i>ad hoc</i> committee of local people, principally farmers, and if that were impracticable, a person would be appointed who, of course, would be as usual referred to in the Dáil as a bureaucrat.  That is the way I would approach the matter.  I think anybody in my place would act in the same way.  I am not saying that he would be bound to do that as the section stands.  He might ignore the county council and the county committee and might consider appointing another person.  Any reasonable person would pursue it in that order, taking the first alternative if possible, and, if that was impossible, taking the third one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Section 11, the question of principle is discussed.  I do not think the example given by Deputy Dillon was a very impressive one.  The Deputy spoke of a man who joined the service at 20, <Col N="1024" /> whose conditions were changed when he reached 50.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that a young man will take a position in the Civil Service or in the service of local authorities, even if he is going to get less pay than he would get from a commercial firm, because he is looking forward to security, to a job for life, and, if he does his work, a pension at the end.  That is all right, but still if he is any sort of reasonable man, he knows that he is going to be pensioned at some time or other.  At least he should not expect to be left in a job until he reaches a very old age.</P>
    <P>I am sure every Party agrees that the big consideration is the public service, and that we must keep in mind the necessity for seeing that every one of these officials carries out his duties efficiently.  We do not want to have people in positions who are unfit to carry out their duties owing to age, sickness or any disability of that kind. Therefore, this matter of laying down a retiring age is a necessity.  The rule that will be made in regard to a retiring age will be a general rule.  I do not know what retiring age may be decided upon, whether it will be 65 or some other age, but 65 is usually the age for public positions of this kind. At any rate, once it is made and for the class for which it is made&mdash; for instance, if it is made for secretaries of committees&mdash;it will apply to all of them.  Similarly if a retiring age is made for county agricultural instructors or for poultry instructresses, it will apply to all of them.  There may be a different age for each class according to the work they are doing.  Undoubtedly, some men are better able to carry on than others at 65, but I am quite sure that if I came to the Dáil and said: &ldquo;I am going to lay lown a rule for each individual,&rdquo; the Dáil would say that that was very unfair and that that the Minister might discriminate as between one person and another.  I think on the whole that a general rule is better. Every individual will have to conform to that rule.  Our first aim should be to get a good public service and, secondly, I think we would all agree that a general rule with regard to the <Col N="1025" /> retiring age is most desirable.  Of course, a general rule with regard to retiring age has applied for some time to people coming into the service. They come in on that condition, but we should remember if we are aiming at that efficiency which is desirable, that even 30 or 40 years hence there would be some people in the service, who entered before the new rule was made, and to whom no retiring age would apply unless some provision in that respect is made now.  If we are to be consistent in looking for efficiency, the retiring age must apply to all existing officers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made a very vehement speech about the great injustice of this proposal, and Deputy Cosgrave supported him almost as vehemently, but there is no injustice whatever in it.  The county committees of agriculture, if this Bill were never passed, could to-day or to-morrow make such a rule for themselves but they are not doing it.  As a matter of fact they are not tied to any age.  The Principal Act passed in 1931 by another Government laid it down that the county committee of agriculture could retire its officials.  It does not say whether for sickness, age, or anything else.</P>
    <P>They could, just if they took it into their heads, retire their officials if the Minister approved.  We must have had a very accommodating Dáil here in 1931 when that clause was allowed to pass.  We were in the Opposition Benches then but we did not press the Minister to insert all sorts of safeguards because we took it for granted that any Minister would have a certain amount of commonsense and sympathy. Section 22, sub-section (4) of the Act of 1931 says: &ldquo;A committee of agriculture may dismiss any servant of such committee&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Dáil put that through hoping that the county committees of agriculture would do their job and that they would get rid of public servants when these servants became too old to discharge their duties efficiently, but the county committees of agriculture have not done that and Deputies know very well why.  They know very well that members of county committees of agriculture who are meeting these officials every day of the week are too sympathetic and too soft towards them.  They just leave them there even though they know that they are not doing their work.  Therefore, no new power is being taken here.  The local authority official had no privilege to continue in office irrespective of age or other considerations.  At least, since 1931, if he read that clause in the 1931 Act he knows that he is in no privileged position and that he can be put out of office by the local authority.  He has no privilege in that respect and we are not taking any privilege from him by bringing in this section.  The point is, of course, that when we come to individual cases, whenever the axe falls and when that rule is made, the Bill lays down that six months' notice must be given before it comes into operation.  When the Minister does make the declaration referred to in this section, that the retiring age should be 65, then those who have reached the age of 65, in six months' time will go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the rate of pension, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health can be very generous if he wants to.  It is the Minister for Local Government who is concerned in this case, not the Minister for Agriculture, because, as I explained before, the Minister for Local Government is in charge of the rating authority and therefore must have the last say in such a matter as superannuation.  He has power to be very generous.  In practice he sanctions a pension at the rate of one-sixtieth of the salary for each year of service.  In cases where that practice was departed from where officers were removed because they <Col N="1027" /> became redundant or where the office was declared no longer necessary because of amalgamation, added years were granted and the pension was very generous.  I do not think anybody here would say that if an officer reaches his full pension, that is, after 40 years' service, and if he gets two-thirds of his salary as pension, we should do anything further for him.  I know that the sympathy of Deputies and my own sympathy would be extended to the person who had not got a full 40 years' service and who still would have to go out of office.  That is not an easy matter to deal with.  I have discussed that matter with the Minister because I promised the Dáil that I would do so.  I said that I felt I could not bring in an amendment to deal with it and that the only thing I could do was to discuss the matter with the Minister for Local Government to see what the position was going to be.</P>
    <P>There is a Superannuation Bill coming along dealing with the officials of local authorities.  I am not going to say that it will put these particular men right.  It will, at least, regularise the position, because at the moment, as the law stands, the local authorities may grant a pension or they may not. Of course, the individual concerned can appeal to the Minister and the Minister can award a pension.  There are things like that to be made right, and also with regard to the retiring allowances.  All I can say at this stage is that where there are men who have to retire immediately when the Order is made, men who are 65 years of age and who have not served the number of years&mdash;that would give them the full pension&mdash;that is, men who have under 40 years' service&mdash;a certain sympathy can be shown in such cases and we can, at any rate, try to cover the gap between what would amount to a full pension and what would be awarded on the one-sixtieth basis&mdash;that is, one-sixtieth for each year of service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not responsible for that.  I merely asked the Minister to deal with certain promises he made. This Bill met with a good deal of vigorous opposition, and with every justification.  It is an objectionable measure, especially as it is to be operated against such a body as county committee of agriculture. When we consider the constitution of those county committees and how they are operated, the position becomes even worse.  The Minister said he had no cause to complain as to the manner in which county committees have carried out their duties.  Therefore, the introduction of this measure, in such circumstances, is extremely provocative. I suggest the Minister might take this opportunity to assure the House that, in so far as the administration of this measure is concerned, it will be only in extreme and exceptional circumstances&mdash;only as a last resort&mdash;used against county committees. In that way the sting can be taken out of it.</P>
      <P>The case the Minister made for this Bill was not a convincing or impressive case.  He did not convince us that this measure is necessary and we should like to have an assurance from him that in the event of any committee failing completely to carry out its duties, the powers contained in this measure will be used only as a last resort, and after the Department have explored every avenue in order to get the committee to do its work.  It is, I suggest, only then that this legislation should be utilised.  I feel sure the Minister will be prepared to give the House that undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister assuring the House that he would be sympathetic when dealing with existing officers.  So far as the members of this Party are concerned, we do not stand for keeping inefficient officers or men who, through old age or infirmity, have become incapable of carrying out <Col N="1029" /> their duties.  I do not think there is anything to be said against retiring a man at 65 years, provided you deal justly with him and give him ample compensation for the breaking of a contract solemnly entered into years ago.  No matter what arguments the Minister may use about the 1931 Act, the fact is that it has not been operated all these years.  The Minister mentioned that county committees have been working closely with officials and they may be slow to take action under that Act, but now this is sprung upon them, terminating the service of officers of county committees and breaking their contracts.  The Minister, I am sure, will again assure the House that every sympathy will be given to individual cases and all the circumstances will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>We pointed out on the Committee Stage that the difficulty is that there is a precedent established so far as the operation of the 1925 Act is concerned. Any member of the House who has experience of a local authority knows that in computing the superannuation allowance the number of years over 60 has been definitely established and there is no question of added years of service.  That is a difficulty that will not be easily surmounted&mdash;the fact that there is that precedent over a number of years, and no added years of service.  We know of no case where years were added to the period of service in order to arrive at a superannuation allowance.  An assurance from the Minister that such cases will be dealt with sympathetically, in view of the fact that this is definitely interfering with a contract of service, will be welcome.  In view of the fact that you are interfering with a contract and that you are asking a man to retire at an age earlier than he anticipated, we suggest he is entitled to more generous treatment than a man who is fully informed as to the conditions and the length of his service.  If the Minister can give us that assurance, it will be generally welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The most objectionable feature of this measure is that it gives the Minister power to dissolve committees <Col N="1030" /> of agriculture.  The Minister has not been able to give the House any sound reasons why this power should be included in the Bill.  One thing, I think, is certain, and I believe the Minister will agree with me, and that is that there never was at any point during the past 20 years an instance when it was necessary to utilise such power, if the Minister had it.  I suggest it is very unlikely that in the next 20 years an occasion of that kind will arise.  Why then go to the trouble of enacting a measure which includes a provision for which there is absolutely no necessity, which may cause grave disquiet, and which could be, in certain circumstances, abused by a Minister for Agriculture, not perhaps in a moment of calm consideration, but at times when tension over some particular political question might be rather rife in the country and when feelings and tempers might be aroused?  In such circumstances a Minister might be tempted to utilise this power to destroy a locally elected body.  No occasion arose during the past 20 years when the exercise of such power was justified, and I suggest there is no reason why it should arise in the future unless the Minister or some Minister would avail of it in order, perhaps, to vindicate a political party, or score over an opposing political party, or for some other consideration arising in the heat of the moment and without calm consideration.</P>
      <P>While those bodies have administrative functions, they are, to a great extent, advisory bodies inasmuch as they bring to the administrative machine and the executive officers of the Department, at first hand, the views and opinions and experience of people engaged in the agricultural industry. Now that we have done our best to have the objectionable features deleted from the Bill, I trust the Minister will give an assurance that they will not be used unless in very exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather tiresome to have to repeat that it was only in an attempt to regularise local government legislation generally that Section 5 was put in, containing the <Col N="1031" /> power to some Minister or other to dissolve a county committee of agriculture. As each of the three Ministers, Local Government, Education, and Agriculture, had divided up that local government legislation, it naturally came into my Bill rather than the others.  I do not think there need be so much discussion of this power.  I do not know if it would ever be used.  I have been almost 12 years in the Department and I never would have used the power in that period because I never had any necessity to do so.  I hope it will not be necessary to use it in the next 12 years.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that Deputy Cogan is now taking a favourable view of the county committees.  He was very uncomplimentary to them on one occasion. When I announced that I proposed to have the Agricultural Consultative Council composed in future principally of the chairmen of county committees, he told me that they did not represent anybody.  I hope the Deputy will agree with me in future that they are very important bodies and that the chairmen are very important and representative men.</P>

Cosgrave reflecting upon our knowledge, or my knowledge, of the income-tax code and taking up what I would describe as the position of the kindly father to the prodigal son.  They felt it was necessary to try to educate us with regard to the application of income-tax and the administration of the income-tax code.  I am well aware that a substantial sum was spent&mdash;I assume, free of tax&mdash;to teach these Deputies the details of income-tax <Col N="1032" /> administration.  That, of course, I had the privilege of enjoying.  Nevertheless, it is not necessary for me to have to study&mdash;commonsense is sufficient&mdash; to know that income-tax, as we know it, should be applicable to the amounts received by members of this House. There is nothing tremendous or exciting about it and there is nothing which might be considered new involved. It is not a decision which the Farmers' Party are trying to bring about, but a decision which the people are agitating for.  Deputy Cosgrave scoffed at the saving which would result from the adoption of this motion.  It would come to only £33,000 per annum, he said.</P>

      <P>I remind the Deputy that the Opposition were rather annoyed when they were described as allowances.  They said we should describe them as salaries.  If Deputy Esmonde is looking for dishonesty, he need not search far.  Both the big Parties have displayed, and are displaying, dishonesty, and there is no need for them to look across at these benches, to point the finger of scorn at us and to say we are dishonest. We are dishonest perhaps because we have hurt their feelings, because we have moved something which the people desire should be moved. Members of the House fully realise that and know that it is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our attitude to this question is going to have a marked effect on the regard of the ordinary man and woman for Parliament.  Deputies know well that many people regard the present arrangement as unjust.  It is not our Party which is demanding the change, but the ordinary citizen.  The demand existed long before we came into this House.  It is very unwise for Deputies to refer me or anybody on these benches to what appears in the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  We are told that <Col N="1034" /> it has been advocating this.  The present arrangement offends the ordinary man.  The ordinary citizen is old-fashioned enough to believe that people who make laws for others should observe these laws themselves and should be prepared to accept them, no matter what trials or burdens the effect of such laws may have upon their ordinary lives.  Deputy Esmonde mentioned last night that one newspaper was campaigning for this.  No doubt, Fianna Fáil speakers will accuse us of taking our line from this paper. But have not the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Parties combined about this, although they differed over something that happened 20 years ago?  Have they not read the programme that we put before the people during the last general election?  I am sure they have. In that programme they will find that we advocated the application of the payment of income-tax to these allowances. I would remind the House that that programme came from the people and was not made up by what we as politicians may determine.  Of course, the <i>Irish Independent</i> has been urging this.  That does not prove that it is wrong.  I remember when I was a young fellow reading a very clever statement that was made by the Taoiseach.  It arose out of the Spanish War.  One side of the House wanted to recognise Franco and the other side did not&mdash;that it would mean following England.  &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Taoiseach, &ldquo;if I was on the way to Heaven with the devil that does not suggest that I would turn back.&rdquo;  I thought that was very clever.  He would be very unwise to turn back if he was on the way to Heaven, even though the devil was in his company.  Some people may look on the <i>Irish Independent</i> as being anti-Irish, anti-national or low, but this does not mean that we are following in its footsteps.  I notice that some Deputies are smiling.  They are smiling, I suppose, over their own pitfalls.</P>
    <P>I said last night that an increase in the allowances on which income-tax should be paid would be preferable to the continuance of tax-free allowances. Across there on the Fine Gael Benches I heard a very astute politician, a man with the law at his finger-tips, say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" />&ldquo;Ah, you have let the cat out of the bag.&rdquo;  That remark was splashed in the <i>Irish Press</i> to-day, not that we get much publicity in &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo;.  We have no cat in our bag to let out in the same sense in which Deputy Linehan describes it, or at least in the sense in which he would like to interpret this.  What I meant by that statement was this: that if there is a majority of Deputies opposed to the application of income-tax to the allowances because of the fact that by assenting to it their allowances would not be sufficient to enable them to carry out their duties, then, in my opinion, it would be preferable to increase the allowances and pay income-tax on them according to the code that operates for those outside the House.  As far as I and the members of this Party are concerned, we are opposed to any increase.  We want income-tax to be payable on the present allowances, without any increase, but in order to satisfy those Deputies who claim that they do so much and work so hard that their allowances are not sufficient to enable them to carry out their duties to the constituents whom they have the honour to represent, I want to say to them that if they are in the majority they have got an alternative, and that is to increase the allowances and make them subject to the payment of income-tax. But, so far as the Farmer Deputies are concerned, we believe beyond any question of doubt&mdash;I am glad that Deputy Linehan is present to hear what I have to say&mdash;and we want it to be understood that we are demanding the application of income-tax to our present allowances.  We do not desire any increase, and would vote against it.  I am not advocating increased allowances.  I think that the present allowances are big enough, and that the ordinary income-tax rate should be applicable to them after claims for expenses have been met.</P>
    <P>I listened to the speeches made last night by Deputy Esmonde and Deputy W.T. Cosgrave.  They wanted to know what exactly we meant by the motion. Deputy Cosgrave said that it would receive a better welcome if we had put down the figure of 7/6 on the £480. <Col N="1036" /> The position is that we want to be reasonable.  We want to bring the members of this House into line with the outside public.  In the case of the present allowance, the income-tax inspector will level up things for Deputies in the same way that he does for an ordinary citizen or for a civil servant who has a salary of £480.  If a Deputy is a married man and has a wife and children he will get certain reliefs, so that the income-tax inspector will require him to pay what he considers just in accordance with the law.  That is what we want.  What fault can any Deputy find with that? What twist can they give it in order to suit their own political gains?  As far as we are concerned, I want to make it quite plain that our Party is opposed to any increase.  It was pure devilment on that side of the House, the side which instigated this allowance, to suggest that we were in here under some kind of a cloak, the cloak of patriotism or the cloak of trying to pull wool over the eyes of the people&mdash; to suggest that, while we were out to reduce our allowances by applying the payment of income-tax to them, on the other hand we were demanding an increase in the present allowance to make up for the deficit which the payment of income-tax would bring about. That is completely wrong.  Any member of the House, apart from these benches, who stands up to make that statement is lying, and he knows that he is lying.</P>
    <P>Last night I made my case on principle. It is not what can be saved by income-tax, not the amount of money you will put into the Exchequer but the principle.  I want to ask this House: how do you expect people to abide by the laws of which we are the creators, if we ourselves are not prepared to shoulder them?  That is the important question.  It is impossible to understand the minds of the men who try-to make a case against it or the mind of the man who is so gullible as to say &ldquo;there is no case&rdquo;, and merely smiles it all off, wondering why we discovered these pitfalls.  I say it here and I stand over it, that if, prior to the increase of the allowance by £10 a month this question was put to the country: &ldquo;I want you to return us on <Col N="1037" /> one condition, that you give us permission to increase our allowance by an extra £10 a month, but we are prepared only to give the worker in the field or on the road a halfpenny a week of an increase,&rdquo; I wonder what the answer would be to that?</P>
    <P>I presume we will have a reply and I hope the reply will be an answer which will ease my mind and which will show us what they would think would happen if they had told the people honestly what they intended to do.  I may be wrong, but I have no doubt what it would be unless the people were as foolish as their prospective representatives.</P>

      <P>This is a salvage motion introduced by certain members of the Farmers' Party to try to salvage something out of that famous programme quoted by the last speaker, Deputy Cafferky, at the last election and published in different forms and with different items in different counties.  In Mayo, the programme was as different from that in Meath as black is from white and the programme in Meath was as different as black is from white from what it was in Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have copies of all of them.  It is a salvage motion to get in by a pretence some little propaganda talk to enable them to represent themselves as giving effect in their speeches in the Dáil to what they said during the elections.  I thought it was a motion which aimed at economy.  I thought this Farmers' Party, which came in here to put this &ldquo;madhouse&rdquo; in order were going to start economising and would start at the root of things and really economise, but, according to Deputy Cafferky, they are prepared to expend more on our allowances, possibly, but leaving themselves in the position to say: &ldquo;Hang it all, you are liable for income-tax.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Micheál O Cléirigh Micheál O Cléirigh">
      <NameTxt>Micheál O Cléirigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We thought they were all for economies.  I presume the <Col N="1038" /> change of attitude is because of the sensible outlook of members of the Party like Deputies Halliden and Cogan&mdash;men who know what it is to be income-tax payers, who are here for some years or in other capacities as professional men elsewhere.  The difficulty is that all members of Deputy Cafferky's Party are not farmers, including himself, and when he gets up to make himself heard here, he has to be in harmony with the chairman of his Party, Deputy Halliden.  But he sees a chance here to bring in a motion asking for income-tax while at the same time he can accommodate the members of his Party who say that Dáil allowances should be increased so that they would suffer no loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a motion to ensure any economy or saving for the State and I must assume, therefore, that it is only a salvage motion.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> now finds them as the advance agents of its policy to discredit members of the House.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> says that if this motion were passed it would make all men equal as far as this House is concerned, and as legislators we would have a better outlook in imposing income-tax on others because we paid income-tax ourselves.  This motion will not achieve that object, because if it were passed it would leave many members free of income-tax, including the Leader of the Farmers' Party, and if we are not going to have all members of this House paying income-tax will not the <i>Irish Independent</i> take the view that we are not equal because some members pay income-tax and some do not?  Can we hold that Deputy Donnellan, who is not an income-tax payer, will take a different view if the motion were passed?  Can we hold that the others who do pay tax will take a different view also?  Can we hold that Deputy Cafferky, if this motion is passed, will then be honest in legislation?  He is not honest now, according to the <i>Irish Independent.</i> Are we to fall for the ramp that if men here, as Deputy Cafferky said, are corrupt and crooked, if they are battening and fattening on the poor they will become honest legislators <Col N="1039" /> even if they did not pay income-tax? Can we follow that doctrine and vote for this motion before the House to please those who want to salvage something of their programme at the last election?  Why not have a motion to reduce the allowances of Deputies?</P>

      <P>Then you will hit everybody.  You will let the Leader of the Farmers' Party out.  We would all be at one, and we could have full argument and debate, and such a motion might be carried in this House. Thousands might be saved although, personally, and speaking with experience of expenditure for a longer number of years than any member of the Farmers' Party, I would vote against the reduction and so would Deputy Cogan.  His only objection when the increase in allowances was voted on in 1938 was that the time was not opportune. He stated that the allowances were not then sufficient, but the farmers' Deputies do not want to save in that way.  The aim of those angels who come in to put this &ldquo;madhouse&rdquo; in order is to make us just like all other people in the country.  Why not third class travel for Deputies?  Deputy Cafferky travels down to Mayo at the expense of the State in a first class carriage.</P>

      <P>Then why not? There are many ways of coming down to the level of the ordinary people and proving they are honest.  I do not see why those members of the Party should be worried about what people think of them as Deputies, why they should make loud speeches and try to pass salvage votes that to show are honest. They should surely forget a lot of the <Col N="1040" /> things they said at the last election. They should have forgotten them by now because they knew they were never real.  If they did that they would not be so worried now about politicians. They say that we Deputies are a privileged class.  Some Deputies are. Deputy Donnellan himself is privileged. He gets an allowance for his car.  We have to pay hire.  Why not say: &ldquo;I will foot my way as an ordinary Deputy.  I will pay a taxi-man to carry me around.  I am like the ordinary people&mdash;I do not want to be privileged.&rdquo; Would it not be a much better and a more decent gesture to the people than to bring in a salvage motion here?</P>

      <P>We heard a further statement that there would be no respect for the State if this motion were not passed.  Deputy Cafferky, <Col N="1042" /> who was amazed to find young men in this country with patriotism enough to join the Defence Forces, stated last night that he was not a politician.  With that I am in thorough agreement.  In the sense in which it is accepted by every decent-minded man, he is not a politician.  He is a politician in the sinister sense.  His standard is that of accusing everybody in public life of being corrupt and being crooked and being a self-seeker.  That is Deputy Cafferky's idea of a politician.  He talked throughout Mayo and Galway about the crooked politicians and the self-seekers in Leinster House who only thought of themselves and forgot the interests of the people.  He said it was a scandal that they should be drawing £480 a year, a salary which he now draws himself and which he says should be increased to enable him to pay income-tax.  Furthermore, he stated to-night that we, as law makers, should respect the law and should carry out the law.  Will Deputy Cafferky apply that to himself?</P>

      <P>The Deputy stated last night that if we do not pass this silly motion we will be trotted out as being corrupt, as being self-seekers, and being unprincipled. What right has the Deputy to say, because we do not vote in a certain way, that we are corrupt?  What right has he to use a campaign that was started by a certain newspaper to say that, when they came into this House, they came into a semi-madhouse, with people on both sides of the House fighting and quarrelling about past differences and not about the people's needs?  There is no such thing happening here.  I think it can be said&mdash;and this is probably new to Deputy Cafferky who has not been long in this country and who is without his wisdom teeth&mdash;that no country on earth, having gone through the times this country has gone through in the past 25 years, with men as divided and as bitter as they were, has a House of representatives that observes such decency in public life as this House. That can be said for members on all sides of the House.  Why try to pretend by a motion of this kind that these angels of peace came in here to try and quench fires of disunion, disruption and abuse that never existed? There are, naturally, differences between members on the Opposition Benches and those on these benches. But men who are not long here should not try to cover up their own uselessness both in debate and in policy by saying that it is shocking to hear the language used here.  Deputy Cafferky said recently that the awful language and abuse he heard in Leinster House amazed him.  There was no such language used.  We passed decent legislation here, although the arguments it times may have been hot enough. Those men who are new to the life and do not know what a decent politician's life should be, should realise that this House gives a decent lead despite the very bitter differences there were years ago between Parties in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion, of course, will not be <Col N="1044" /> passed.  It is deliberately put down to bolster up the propagandist tactics carried out against decent men of all Parties in public life in the past couple of months.  They will go back to their constituencies and say: &ldquo;We told them what we thought about them. We told them that they should pay income-tax. We were prepared to do it ourselves even to the extent of increasing our allowance to enable us to do so.&rdquo;  If this motion is passed in the way they want it, they can be accused of being paid hacks, paid politicians, coming within the income-tax code.  Deputy Cafferky suggested that a law should be passed so that everybody would come within the income-tax code.  I suppose he will agree to that?</P>

      <P>Does he agree that every farmer who buys and sells cattle and who, in addition, may have a little shop or business should be queried by the income-tax officials as to what he should pay in income-tax? Is that the suggestion which is to follow from this motion?  Is it the suggestion of Deputy Cafferky that everybody in this country should be queried by the income-tax officials as to his income and as to the money he has in bank or as to his investments?  If he continues in that strain he will find quite a lot of farmers, who had some hope of the Farmers' Party some months ago, saying: &ldquo;We will watch those fellows.  They are bringing the income-tax inspectors on us to search our accounts and we must try to hide away some of the deposits that we have.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must congratulate Deputy O Cléirigh, first of all, upon the warm applause which he received from the Opposition Party.  For the first time we have brought about unity between the two big political Parties in this House, unity to preserve privileges to which Deputies know in their hearts they are not entitled.  I know that the Taoiseach must bitterly regret having to experience such an exhibition by a member of his Party in this House.  I did hope that this <Col N="1045" /> motion would be considered in an atmosphere of calm deliberation.  I did hope that the exhibition of ill-temper which we have had from both sides of the House would not have been so obvious.  What are Deputies losing their tempers about? If this question concerned any other section of the people but members of this House, there would not have been such exhibition of heat; there would not have been any attempt to drag the dust and the dirt of the District Court into this House.</P>
      <P>Let us consider this question calmly and objectively.  I quite agree that an independent organ of the Press has advocated that members of this House should be subject to income-tax like everybody else.  I think the Leader of the Opposition Party repeated that phrase &ldquo;like everybody else&rdquo; very frequently.  But why should Deputies be put in a different category from everybody else?  Why should not an independent organ of the Press, which is not tied to any political Party, bring to the notice of the public an evil which exists in our democratic system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very fine to attack the Press in this House.  But we must remember that the liberty of the Press and the freedom of the people demand that, in addition to having a free vote, and a right to exercise that vote freely, there should be a right on the part of any citizen who wishes to set down in writing what his views are in regard to political matters, and that freedom should be exercised by the organs of the Press to correct any evil tendency that might show itself in the administration of the laws, in legislation, and in the Government of the country.  Any attempt to curb or restrict that right is fraught with danger.  It is always possible for the limited number of political Parties in this House to co-operate together in order to secure, by mutual co-operation, some advantage for all the members of this House, and, owing to the fact that those advantages are shared mutually by all members of the House, to stifle competition.  But as long as you have a free Press, I do not care whether it is ultra-national or anti-national, it is at least some safeguard <Col N="1046" /> for the rights of the plain people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>An amendment put down to this motion seeks to confer a smaller privilege upon the members of this House. It seeks to exempt a portion of the allowances of Deputies from income-tax. That amendment is absolutely unacceptable to this Party.  We hold that the Deputies of this House should be on an exact par with the ordinary citizen in this country.  They should have no special protection.  They are neither infants nor innocent babies. They are just as capable of defending their rights against the income-tax inspectors, or anybody else, as the ordinary citizen, and they need no special protection from the law.  That is why we do not accept that amendment.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy can claim that a certain portion of his allowance is in respect of out-of-pocket expenses. Well, he can make his case before the income-tax collectors in the same way as the ordinary citizen is forced to do. A suggestion has been made that some members of this House may escape income-tax even if this motion is passed. But no member of the House will escape having to make his case before the income-tax authorities the same as the ordinary citizen.  And why should any member of the House be allowed to escape, or why should any member claim such privilege over the other citizens of the State?  If we calmly accept the position that Deputies who impose income-tax upon the people of the State are entitled to be exempt themselves, why should the principle not be extended, so that Deputies of the House would also be exempt from paying duty upon their tobacco or alcoholic liquor, if any of them indulge in such a luxury?  Why should they not enjoy other privileges similar to the privilege which they enjoy in respect of income-tax?</P>
    <P>You might go further and ask why should not members of an urban council or a county council who impose rates upon the ordinary ratepayers be also, themselves, exempt to some extent from liability for rates.  Those who make the laws for the people ought not claim any special privilege <Col N="1047" /> or exemption from those laws.  That is why this motion is put down.  I put down a motion similar to this more than two years ago relation to Deputies' salaries, but it was not accepted because it was not in order. I had to wait until we had a Party in the House to bring the matter to the forefront.</P>
    <P>The case that has been made by some Deputies is that this allowance, which they receive in respect of their duties as members of the House, is not a salary&mdash;that it is purely an allowance to the extent of 100 per cent. of the £480 paid.  Can anybody sustain that argument for one moment.  Take the members of this House who have no other source of income but their allowance as Deputies&mdash;are we to take it that if the £480 is purely an allowance to cover out-of-pocket expenses, those Deputies must, since they have no other sources of income, apply to the local relieving officer for home help, because that is what is implied in that suggestion?</P>
    <P>Of course, the fact is that it is partly an allowance for out-of-pocket expenses, and partly a salary paid to the members as public representatives for their services to the community. And just as the doctor and the surgeon who receive an annual income must make a case to the income-tax authorities that portion of it was in respect of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by reason of their profession, Deputies should be compelled to make a similar case.  It may cause us some headaches in dealing with this matter, but they are the headaches which every citizen in this country who has a taxable income is compelled to face, and we should face them boldly, and courageously.</P>
    <P>We did not come in here considering ourselves superior to any other Deputies or Parties, and we have advocated this policy throughout the country.  Deputy O Cléirigh has great confidence in the shortness of the memories of the electorate.  He believes the electorate has forgotten everything he promised.  It may be satisfactory for him to think that.  But <Col N="1048" /> whether the electorate forget the promises made to them at election times or not, there is certainly some obligation on Deputies who give a solemn assurance to the people, to carry out their promises to the best of their ability.  That is exactly what we are doing.  I do not think there is any Party in this House which gives the motion a fair, impartial consideration and faces the question coolly and calmly&mdash;not as a question that concerns their own protection but as a question of right and wrong&mdash;that will not decide that this motion is worthy of support, and support it.</P>

      <P>I am quite sure that the Taoiseach was not so indiscreet as to connive at what was done, but the fact remains that those who differ from the Taoiseach will rarely receive personal insult from the Taoiseach&mdash;though there are exceptions to that rule&mdash;but you may depend on some warrior being found in the back benches who will be afforded an opportunity of getting up and pouring out all the filth he can put his tongue to and very rarely will anybody occupying a seat on the front bench of his Party stand up and <Col N="1049" /> disown him.  I shall be interested to hear if the Taoiseach, when he comes to speak, adopts the line of controversy adopted by Deputy O Cléirigh.  Does he approve of Deputy O Cléirigh's references to Deputy Cafferky?  With a lot of the things that Deputy Cafferky says, I disagree and I deprecate them, but there are ways of rejecting his representations without resorting to the filth to which Deputy O Cléirigh resorts.</P>
      <P>Let us get this matter clear.  Deputy Cafferky worked in England.  Does anybody want to make anything out of that?  Hundreds of thousands of decent men in this country went to work in England, worked honestly there, came home and founded good families here.  Deputy Cafferky has spoken in Hyde Park.  So did Abbot Butler.  So did my uncle.  Any number of distinguished Catholic laymen have spoken in Hyde Park.  Does anybody want to make anything out of that?  If it would suit Deputy O Cléirigh or the Fianna Fáil Party to get a placard and hang it up stating &ldquo;Deputy Cafferky worked in England and spoke in Hyde Park,&rdquo; so that we could see it as we passed along and, perhaps, hang a garment on it as we moved into the Lobby, it would save a lot of time.  I am sick listening to this sort of thing.  It does not cut any ice here and I can assure Deputy O Cléirigh that it will cut no ice in County Mayo.  The people of Mayo know Deputy Cafferky.  They know his father and mother and all belonging to him.  They do not claim to be great people, but they claim to be honest people and decent neighbours and nothing that Deputy O Cléirigh can say will alter that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not mean that I agree with everything that Deputy Cafferky says, because I do not, but I am sick listening to men being sprayed with dirt and filth from the Fianna Fáil Benches They have got to the stage when they are afraid to spray me because they know that they would get back as much as they gave but they like to get somebody who is comparatively new to this House and try to fuss him into <Col N="1050" /> playing into their hands.  The time will come when they will get as good as they give from Deputy Cafferky and, perhaps, Deputy O Cléirigh got that to-day.  Let him put it in his pipe and smoke it.  Yet, I hope that we shall not have a recurrence of this conduct. I disagree with much of what Deputy Cafferky said about Deputy O Cléirigh but, God knows, I sympathised with him when he said it.</P>
    <P>A very good case could be made for this motion but the Farmers' Party have made about the worst case they could make for it.  The whole question boils down to this: Do you regard the £480 that we receive as a salary or as an allowance for expenses?  If it is a salary, then, of course, the motion proposed by the Farmers' Party is unanswerable. If we are salaried servants of the State, then we ought to return our salaries on our income-tax forms and pay tax, same as if we were earning the £480 as a result of being doctors, lawyers, farmers or engaged in some other occupation.  Deputy O Cléirigh shakes his gory locks at Deputy Cafferky and says: &ldquo;Do you want all the farmers to have to fill up income-tax forms?&rdquo;  Of course, the farmers have to fill up income-tax forms if the Revenue Commissioners think they have a sufficient income. Farmers are not exempt from income-tax. They pay it under one schedule or another.  If they are liable, they have to pay.  Nothing that Deputy Cafferky has done will make them any more or less liable than they were.</P>
    <P>It is a new doctrine to me that I am getting a salary from the State for being a Deputy in Dáil Eireann.  I lose money by it.  When I have paid my election expenses, when I have attended to my correspondence, spent my time going around to Departments and have done the various chores that an ordinary Deputy has to do for his constituents, I have lost money at the end of the year.  If anybody offered me £9 a week for doing the work I do as member for Monaghan, I should spit in his eye.  The work I do as member for Monaghan is worth infinitely more than £9 a week.</P>
    <P>No solicitor would take £9 a week <Col N="1051" /> for doing the work I do for my constituents in Monaghan.  I venture to say that the same is true of most of the active Deputies in this House.  If you take into account the letters you write, the interviews you seek and the time spent in attending to your constituents' private business and cast it up on the basis of solicitors' costs, charging a fee for each letter you write, you will find that you would be entitled to remuneration far in excess of £480.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan is not the only Deputy so situate in this House; I could name other Deputies within 100 miles from here.  It would be invidious to mention names but there is a Deputy present and if you put a fee on every job of work he did for his constituents&mdash;Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael&mdash;he would earn considerably more than £480.  I labour under no illusions as to why we are here in Dáil Eireann.  Some of us are here because we like to be &ldquo;big shots&rdquo;.  It is grand to be a T.D.  That is the plain fact.  Some of us are here because we have got politics in our blood.  It is just the same with us as with the man who climbs mountains or undertakes some task which he conceives it to be his duty to do without reward.  Some of us are in public life because we believe we can do some good in it.  I suppose there are some imperfect souls amongst us who are in it for what they can get out of it.  Do not let us imagine that Dáil Eireann is any more perfect than any other Parliament.  We are made up of all sorts of men but, if the man who goes into public life in this country has a business or profession or farm of his own and if he thinks he is going to make anything out of the £480 which he gets for attending Dáil Eireann, he is a fool.  If he casts up the accounts of his business or profession and sets out against them whatever surplus is left, after paying his expenses, out of the £480, he will find that he has lost substantially on the transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> I cannot honestly feel that this £480 a year is payable to us as a salary. If that is the belief of the Farmers' Party, then I think the Farmers' Party are rightly putting down this motion But surely the Farmers' Party might have reflected more carefully on what they were doing.  It is all very well for Deputy Cogan to tell us that he was actuated only by the loftiest motives in putting down this motion. Is there any green in our eyes?  Does he expect anybody to believe that this motion was put down only with the loftiest motives?  Surely, there was some little thought in the back of the minds of the movers that it would be a popular thing to do?  Of course, there was.  We all know there was and it would be much more honest to admit it.  The fact that a thing is popular does not necessarily mean that it is wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Or right.  But if a thing is popular and right, you should do it. If a thing is popular and wrong, you ought not to do it.  When Deputies of the Farmers' Party say that income-tax should be levied on our £480, what is really going to happen?  Every poor man in this House will be put in very much the same position as he was before. He will not pay 1d. in income-tax. I do not suppose that any member of the Farmers' Party claims to be a plutocrat.  Like Deputy Flanagan, I suppose they are all poor men and, at the end of the year, will have very little left out of the £480.  So far as they are concerned, whether this resolution is passed or not, it makes no difference.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that the members of the Farmers' Party, according to their own statements, are all poor men and, therefore, I think we may assume that the farmer would be paying income-tax according to the farming schedule, and that if that farmer is in receipt of an allowance, as a member of this House, of £480 per annum, his income-tax would be <Col N="1053" /> increased proportionately.  A case may be made for doing that, if you regard that allowance as a salary, but, if you do not regard it as a salary, I do not think there is any case to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this allowance is to defray our expenses, and if, in the judgment of the House&mdash;as has been suggested, by, I think, Deputy Cogan &mdash;the allowance is substantially more than would pay the expenses of a Deputy, I think that every Deputy in the House would agree that that payment should be reduced; but, if not, I cannot see what case is to be made for this motion.  I am sure that Deputy Cogan is as industrious as any other member of this House, but I am equally sure that he does not do anything more or less than any other member of the House.  Now, with regard to this matter of the allowances given to Deputies of this House, I am bound to say that, in my experience, there is a great amount of expense involved. Perhaps I do not manage my affairs as well as Deputy Tunney does; but that has been my experience, and it does seem to me that the proposal to levy income-tax on the allowances given to Deputies is irrelevant, because the money paid to us is not actually to be regarded as income.  I do not want to think that I am a servant of the Government, or that I am accepting a salary from the Government just because I am here as an elected representative of the people.  I am here as a critic of the Government, and I want to be absolutely free and independent of the Government in that respect.  I do not want anybody to say that I am dependent on the Government for any part of my income.  I never was, and I hope that I never shall be, dependent on the Government, whether as a member of the Opposition or not. I would not like to be in such a position. I believe that this money, which has been voted by the Dáil and which has been accepted by the members of the House, is merely intended as something to enable us to defray our expenses. Now, bear in mind that if you follow a system whereby the members of this House are to be provided with a sufficient salary by the State to enable them to live, independent of what <Col N="1054" /> they earn outside, you will have to increase substantially the present allowance of Deputies, and that would mean turning the whole 138 members of this House into professional politicians. The result would be that the efforts of a great many people in this country would be directed towards becoming professional politicians, and nothing else.  Now, I do not know of anybody in this House who engages in politics just as a profession, and who does nothing else.  In my own case, I have my business to attend to; other Deputies have their farms or businesses to attend to, and they can only devote a certain amount of time to their Parliamentary duties.</P>
    <P>The only persons in this House who can devote their time exclusively to Parliamentary duties are the Ministers or their Parliamentary Secretaries. Deputy Flanagan has said that he began as a solvent man but that, since he became a member of the Dáil, he is living on an overdraft for the first time in his life.  Well, that may be so, but we cannot have the whole nation living on an overdraft, because, if so, the banks giving us the overdraft will, necessarily, play a very considerable part in the operations of this House or of the country.  I think that the members of this House should be able to stand on their own legs, so to speak&mdash;that they should be independent of anybody.  After all, if a married man finds himself in difficulties, he is likely to find pressure of a very acute kind brought to bear on him, and I deprecate most strongly the ferocity of the assault that was made on members of the Farmers' Party in connection with this motion, because I think that it is purely a matter of considering whether this payment is to be regarded as a salary, or an allowance to meet expenses.  If it is to be regarded as a salary, then I would agree, but if it is to be regarded as just an allowance, then I think it ought to be left as it is at the present time.  However, in view of what one of the sponsors of the motion said with regard to the inadequacy of these allowances for the provision of Deputies' expenses&mdash;if that is the case let us have an inquiry into it at once, <Col N="1055" /> and I am quite sure that the Taoiseach would agree to have such an inquiry. If it is found, as the result of an inquiry, that £480 a year is too much, then let us go back to £360 a year, or whatever will be regarded as enough for our expenses.  It is understood, of course, that we cannot legislate for exceptional cases, but if I am to judge from Deputy Cogan's speech, one would have to make exceptions in particular cases.  I can say that my expenses in connection with the last general election were very much heavier than they would have been if I had been a member of a Party. Deputy Cogan, however, says that in his experience the allowance given to Deputies is excessive.</P>
    <P>Well, then, if we feel that the allowance is excessive, let us give it back. I do not want to be acrimonious, but I do think that the members of the Farmers' Party are in a slightly invidious position in this regard. According to them, it would appear that we are all getting too much, and that this is a question of high principle, but surely they are bound to consider this matter on its own merits? If they feel that the allowance is too high, surely it can be left to their own discretion, without reference to any other tribunal, to return to the State the amount of the allowance which they think is excessive?  Will Deputy Donnellan undertake to do that?  After all, I am sure that any contribution that could be given to the Government at the present time would be gladly accepted.  Not only would the widow's mite that might be contributed by the Farmers' Party be regarded as a glorious contribution, but I am sure that any such contribution would be very acceptable to the Government. Deputy Cafferky spoke at length about the necessity for setting a good example and a good headline to the whole community.  What more appropriate headline could there be than that those who are receiving more than they need should return it to the community from which they got it?  That seems to me to be the unavoidable consequence of the argument of the Farmers' Party here to-day.  Surely, <Col N="1056" /> until and unless they do that, they will find themselves in some difficulty if they continue to point the finger of scorn at their colleagues.  I say that, in my judgment, this is an allowance for expenses.  Therefore, I am opposed to laying income-tax upon it.  If the House thinks that it would be a desirable reform to turn Deputies into salaried public servants then let an equitable salary be determined and let it be liable to income-tax as anybody else's salary is.</P>
    <P>If any experienced Deputies think that £480 is excessive for the expenses in which the average Deputy is involved, then I suggest that we forthwith put our hand to the task of ascertaining what the expenses are and reduce the Parliamentary allowance to that figure without more ado.  I regret that it would be beyond the limits of order to put down an amendment to that effect but I propose a verbal amendment to the Farmers' proposal. It is that instead of going in for the abracadabra of levying income-tax we define it to be an allowance designed to defray expenses and that we reconsider the expenses and reduce the Parliamentary allowance to that level which the average Deputy experiences in the ordinary discharge of his duties. I want to say that if I am called before that committee I will be constrained to say that a sum of £480 is not excessive but there is no reason why, in this matter, we should try to legislate for the exception any more than we do in any other case.  What we have to do is to try and find the average and make the allowance conform to that.  That will undoubtedly result in some advantage to the peculiarly economical Deputy and further disadvantage to persons like myself of whom there may be a number but the substantial majority who stand in the position of Deputy Cogan may find a surplus in their hands.  Let Deputy Cogan set an example by returning to the treasury in anticipation of the reform I suggest the surplus that they find in their hands.  I invite the Farmers' Party to join with me in pressing upon the Government as a substitute proposal to their own that we should open an inquiry into the average expenses of <Col N="1057" /> the average Deputy and bring the Parliamentary allowance down to that.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has given rise to a good deal of heat.  I think that heat was engendered because of the manner in which it was proposed or spoken to at any rate. One does not like to be a member of an Assembly and to be told that the members of it are corrupt.  If there has been objection taken to it by the members listening I think it is fundamentally the fault of those who set the debate on a particular line.  This is a serious matter.  Before I go on to deal with it I would like to say that <Col N="1058" /> I have on all occasions deprecated personalities, that I think they do no good whatever&mdash;none.  I think that they tend to damage the prestige of this House and tend to turn away minds from the subject of the debate itself to something which is irrelevant. Having said that, I want to say with regard to this motion that it is a matter which is of great public importance. The whole question of whether public representatives are to receive payment from public funds, whether by way of allowance or salary, is an important one.  If you say that there should be no allowances and no salaries, no sums paid out to the individual Deputies from the public purse at all, then it becomes possible only for those who can afford it to become public representatives.  You put it out of the power of the person who is unable to maintain himself otherwise by business or from a private income to take part in the people's Assembly.  Such a move would be fundamentally undemocratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would mean that the Parliament would be a Parliament simply of those who are relatively well-to-do, hence I think that all in this House would agree that it should be made possible for any individual in the country, no matter of what class or what his means otherwise, to be returned if he is a fit and proper representative and can serve the country or the particular constituency that he has been asked to represent.  I think we have that in common.  We all agree on that.  The next question is, what should be the amount that would be made available for a person who is in that way to be enabled to be a representative of the people?  Surely we will all agree that the amount should be such as will enable that person to take up an independent attitude and act in his office with dignity and be in a position reasonably to be self-respecting in every way. That is the point of view, I take it, from which this question of Deputies' allowances, and that of Ministers' salaries when we come to it later on is approached.  That is the way we would approach it if we were sitting down in a conference room considering it for the first time and trying to arrive at <Col N="1059" /> a solution of this problem.  In dealing with the motion, apart from the question of economy, you do not want the allowance to be so large as to make it attractive, because of its money value.  You do not want that, but it is clearly necessary to make it of such an amount as will enable the poorest section of the community to have their representative to come forward if he is elected and do the work which he is appointed to do without having the greater part of his mind concerned with the question of how himself and his family are going to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>The next question that would arise is this: what should be its character? Should it be a salary or should it be an allowance?  I did not think this motion was coming on to-day; otherwise, in preparation for it, I should have tried to get more details than I have been able to get of what takes place in other countries.  I have certain figures, but I should like to know to what extent payments are tax free. It would be necessary to know if they are allowances, and to have a number of other particulars about them before they would really be of value in this debate.  As far as I can see, the allowances here are not excessive.  They are not on the high side at all.  The principle is to regard them as allowances and to have them free from income-tax.  Of course, nobody is going to make the mistake of thinking&mdash;though from the way it was expressed one would think it was the case&mdash;that T.D.s are exempt from income-tax.  It is only these particular allowances that are exempt.  If a T.D. has any other income, it comes under income-tax law.  What is done here is this: a sum is set aside which is characterised as an allowance and that allowance is free from income-tax. Deputies realise that allowance is made for expenses in the case of the various professions.  There is freedom from tax on certain expenditure incidental to the conduct of business.  I take it that, in 1925, that principle was definitely accepted here, in accordance with the idea that the expenses which Deputies incur are incidental to <Col N="1060" /> their work as Deputies.  I take it that that was the principle behind this matter all the time.  Therefore, because they are expenses incidental to a Deputy's work, they should be tax free.</P>
    <P>Now comes the question whether the amount is too large, regarding it from that point of view.  If, as was suggested by Deputy Dillon, it is considered to be too large, I think the best way to deal with that is by a definite motion.  If it is to be treated as an allowance, and if, as an allowance, it is too high, then you should reduce it.  I thought myself that the allowances were deliberately put on the rather high side for a definite purpose, because Deputies come from different parts of the country.  It was decided to have a flat rate.  There was not going to be an investigation into all the differences in expenditure that would arise.  A flat rate was decided upon so as to cover the cases of those who might be a good distance away, and who, owing to particular circumstances, might have more expenses than others.  If it is suggested that the expenses should be vouched for, you will have a different system.  The system was a flat rate system to avoid difficulties of administration.  I believe that we set a reasonably high figure so as to cover these cases and so that Deputies would not be at a loss because they were doing their work as Deputies properly.</P>
    <P>There was probably another reason for making them all the same.  It was pointed out that, if income-tax were charged on the allowance, a Deputy, who was married, with three children, and was taxed on earned income, would have to pay nothing, whereas in the case of somebody with unearned income, he might have to pay supertax or surtax, with the result that the amount available for the Parliamentary expenses of different individuals would not be uniform.  This question has been examined five or six times since it was first raised.  This is the first occasion on which it has been raised as a principle.  I do not remember any other occasion.  Deputies who were here before we came in may be <Col N="1061" /> aware if it was raised previously.  I do not remember that, at any time, it was questioned as a principle.  I think it was intended all through as an allowance. It was to be generous, to the extent that nobody would be deterred from doing the work of Parliament because of the expense which would be involved, and so that there would not be the excuse for not doing Parliamentary work that they would be too much out of pocket.  The idea was to make the payment uniform, so that representatives, whether rich or poor, as far as their Parliamentary work was concerned, would be given out of the public purse an amount to cover expenditure so that there would be no justification for not doing that work.</P>
    <P>That becomes very important in this sense, that we want here, I take it, representatives of all sections of the people.  We do not want to do anything to deter people who have a particular type of experience&mdash;perhaps successful business men or successful professional men&mdash;from coming in here by putting too heavy a strain on their pockets.  We do not want to have any obstacle to their coming here.  If it is necessary to go into the matter, I can do so.</P>
    <P>I question if we in this country have not suffered from the fact that we are beside a very rich nation with a world Empire, where they are more easily able to keep up a higher standard than we are.  We suffer from that in a number of ways.  I feel that, in our standards here, we are suffering from that, and that we would do very much better by adopting standards of a different type.  They need not necessarily be worse standards.  Judged by purely monetary standards, they would be lower.  The fact is that, whether it is wages for workmen or salaries for professional men, or otherwise, we have standards here which are very largely the standards in existence across the water.  I have never questioned Parliamentary allowances.  When the matter was considered again in 1938, as Leader of our Party I made inquiries about Deputies' expenses. I spoke to a number of people.  I had no reason to believe that they wanted to mislead me, but <Col N="1062" /> a number of them said privately what Deputy Dillon has said in public.</P>
    <P>That was that, on the £360 allowance which Deputies were then getting, they were in fact out of pocket.  We came to the conclusion that it was not good for the State that that should be so and there was then a proposal to increase the allowance from £360 to £480.  I do not remember what the discussion was like on that occasion.  I do not know whether there was much opposition, but this I do say, that we were not then the prophets that it has been suggested we were, and that we were not able to look forward to a world war and make provision then for the increased burdens that were likely to fall, particularly on those with fixed salaries or fixed allowances.  I should like to have been able to see these things ahead; it would have been a very valuable faculty if I could do that.  Unfortunately, we were not able to do these things.  It is that type of suggestion, the type of suggestion made by Deputy Dillon on another occasion, that makes debates here run along lines quite different from those which they should normally or properly follow.</P>
    <P>I pass away from that and say that my view is that, if this allowance is regarded as being too high, then there should be a motion here for its reduction. If, on the other hand, the view is that, in a democratic country like ours, we cannot have all sections of the people represented by simply having allowances that are cut to the bone, there should be a motion brought in here for the payment of salaries.  I think in Britain they have the salary system.  The salary is about £600 and out of that £600 there is definitely put aside, first of all, £100 for expenses.  After that, secretarial and other expenses can all be claimed for through the local tax officers.</P>
    <P>If you try to make a calculation, you will find that a salary of £600 for a single man with the allowances that are made here, will give him a net income of something in the neighbourhood of £480.  If you were to regard this as the <Col N="1063" /> equivalent of a salary, you will find that it will correspond to the case of a single man without dependents, giving him all the allowances that are provided for but without taking into account the £100 for expenses, or any allowance for secretarial or other assistance which he might require.  You will find on this basis that a net income of £480 is roughly equivalent to a round figure of £600 after deduction of ordinary allowances.  A salary of £600, from that point of view, is about the salary of certain higher executive officers in the State.  There are some hundreds of them.</P>
    <P>I am not making any allowance in that calculation for the work which a Deputy has to do.  I am making allowance only for the remission which he would get in any occupation for expenses in connection with his particular work.  We have hundreds of officers who are receiving salaries at that rate.  They come in here to offer their services to the State and to the community.  They have fixity of tenure and they have pensions to look forward to.  Deputies who come in here to serve for a period, if they hold positions which are incapable of being held at the same time as they are Deputies, or if they cannot get substitutes, may have to give up these positions.  Later on when a dissolution comes, they may be thrown out and have to seek their old positions.</P>
    <P>If you want people to serve the country and to get as wide a representation as you can, do you suggest that Deputies who come in here are doing less public service than, say, a higher executive officer?  I do not.  The representatives of the people are here because they have been chosen by the people.  Nobody can come in without a very stiff examination, namely, an examination by their constituents, as to whether they are or are not worthy to represent them.  I know that no type of examination will get you exactly the man best fitted for the post; therefore we cannot always assume that because we have been <Col N="1064" /> elected we are first-class.  At any rate, Deputies come in here after having passed the test of acceptance by the people.  They devote themselves from the period of one dissolution to another to the public service.  If they do their work well, they are advocates for every individual in their constituencies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke of what would be their charges if they were, say, solicitors.  It seems to me that a Deputy is an agent practically for every individual in his constituency who feels that, in any particular respect, administration is pressing heavily or unequally on him.  He has to correspond with these people.  He has to come here to town to see the various Government Departments, etc.  In my opinion, merely from the point of view of service, if Deputies do their work, the work which a very large number of Deputies, if not all, are doing now. I do believe they are working in the public service and they are doing work which is, at least, as important to the community in general as the work done by higher executive officers.  Yet they have not got anything like the security of tenure of such officers.  I do not think that the sum of £480 net, if you regard it as the net result after a salary of £600 has been given&mdash;and it is treated as a salary&mdash;is at all on the extravagant side; that is, if we keep the other standards up.</P>
    <P>I once made a very big mistake in that connection.  We came in here at one time and we accepted lower salaries&mdash;that was from 1932 to 1937; we accepted considerably lower salaries.  When you went into it fully, it worked out that they were lower, by some hundreds of £ in individual cases, than the salaries that obtained before.  I thought that we could similarly bring down the scales in the Civil Service, but I found I had made a mistake.  I found that there were certain rights which civil servants had and, if these were interfered with, it would cause them to leave the service.  You might say: &ldquo;Let them go,&rdquo; but, at that time anyhow, whatever the position in the future may be, you were going to lose the most experienced and the best of your public servants.  Next, I found I <Col N="1065" /> was going to be most unjust to a number of men, because they could point out to me: &ldquo;Look here, I was at school with so-and-so; they were my companions at school.  I chose this particular career and they chose other careers. I had as much brains as they had, and I showed as much ability as they did, but they are outside now as professional men and they are able to have, as such, much higher salaries than we have.  Why will you cut us down, why will you treat us as the one section of the community who are to be reduced in salary, whilst the other people are let free?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious it would be wrong and, therefore, if anybody is out to lower the salary scales, he will have to try to do it by quite a different method from that which I tried.  I tried as honestly as I could, but I found I lost sight of certain things, and I think some of the farmer Deputies, when they get experienced, assuming they are approaching this subject somewhat from the point of view that I had when I approached it originally, will learn that it cannot be done in that particular way.  One result would be to endanger the quality, generally, of public representation.  They will be trying to deal with one particular set of people, namely, those who are public representatives&mdash;trying to deal with them in a way which would be quite different from that of the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>It is an honour to be a public representative. Why should we all the time try to demean them, to lower their prestige in the eyes of the people? They occupy honourable positions.  I cannot see any reason why we should try to demean them or lower them in the eyes of the people.  I believe if you want to lower standards and salaries here, if you want a simpler living here, you will have to approach it in a different way, in such a way that it will apply all round.  When you vote here your £480, or whatever may be the amount you will vote as an allowance, you are saying: &ldquo;Here is a net sum given to all alike, a net sum given to enable you properly to carry out your duties as a Parliamentary <Col N="1066" /> representative.  What is wrong about it?&rdquo;  In my own case, I made an arrangement at the beginning and I said: &ldquo;Give me what will meet my needs.  Do not ask me to pay back afterwards something you have given me.&rdquo;  What I get at the present time is arranged so that they can keep the income-tax.  If there is an extra charge put on next year, I have to put up with that.  I simply try to get the net amount the State will give me.</P>
    <P>That brings me now to the salaries of Ministers.  I was talking about this on other occasions.  From 1932 to 1937 we voluntarily accepted lower salaries. By 1937 I was satisfied, from experience, that it was not in the best interests of the country that that should be continued.  Some months before the election&mdash;the election was in June, or about that time&mdash;I pointed out to the people that we would have to revert to the old scales, and the reason we had to revert to the old scales was that I was satisfied that the proper position which the Ministers should occupy, a position of independence and freedom from debt, could not be maintained if that was not done.</P>
    <P>When the new Constitution was going through, I pointed out that the time had come when there should be a new examination of the salaries of Ministers and of allowances for Deputies.  A committee was set up. That committee consisted of representatives of farmers, labour and all sections of the community&mdash;certainly, the main sections of the community. They considered the position and they arrived at certain decisions.  These decisions were in every case, I think, to recommend higher salaries than the salaries that were then being accepted, that is, higher salaries than those in the scale to which we reverted.</P>
    <P>I felt it was not necessary to do that, and that the T.D.s' allowance, which Ministers get as well as other T.D.s should not be taken into account at all.  I had calculations made&mdash;I will not worry the House with them, but I can give them if they are required&mdash;a repetition of some calculations made before.  When we brought <Col N="1067" /> in a Bill, we did not implement the findings of the committee; we reverted to the old scale, and in every case the net amount is less than that recommended by the committee, in some cases by some hundreds of £.</P>
    <P>This question has been examined time after time by people who had no end whatever to serve, except to get amounts in the way of allowances or salaries which would enable the State to be decently served, to be served in the best way.  One does not like, in these things, to be talking of oneself. I believe I live as simply as most people.  A number of expenses that the average person has, I have not got.  I do not smoke or drink; I do not entertain to any extent.  I do not believe any person who succeeds me on the present salary will be able to do better than I do from the point of view of economy.  I assure everybody here that I am not going to be a rich man&mdash; and I am a long time in office now.  If I were leaving it as a testament to other people who come after me I would tell them: &ldquo;If you want to have the work properly done, do not bring the salary of the Head of the Government lower than it is&rdquo;, and I would say, with regard to the salaries of Ministers, that those salaries are not sufficient.</P>
    <P>That is my own belief.  I have been able to manage, because it happens to suit me to live in a simple way. Other people would say that I should do things, as Taoiseach, which I do not do, which I am not doing.  If other people should think it was their duty to the public to do these things, I say that they will not be able to do them on the present salary.</P>
    <P>Taking this question of salaries and allowances all round, I do think they are reasonable.  They enable decent dignity to be preserved, but it is only a frugal dignity, and there can be no extravagance in it.  I think we ought to be satisfied&mdash;I am satisfied, for one &mdash;that, in the public interest, the allowances and salaries being paid are right, fair and proper, and that they are not extravagant, but, as I have said, if anyone thinks that a salary should be paid&mdash;and that position <Col N="1068" /> can be defended&mdash;to public representatives while they are acting as such and puts that case forward, it can be fully considered here; or, if it thought that there should be no salaries but merely the barest allowance that will do, there should be a motion to reduce the present allowances.  These allowances have been treated in that way over a long period of time, and I think that on the whole they have justified themselves.</P>
    <P>The position which has obtained in this country has been one in which there has been no suggestion of anybody, because of being in debt or for any other reason arising from not having sufficient to enable him to do the work he has to do, being made subject to anybody.  There has been independence here and there has been no hint of corruption.  It is detestable to hear people flinging that word around.  I do not know whether they know what they are talking about when they talk about corruption.  I think it wrong that that should be done.  When a person talks about corruption, if there is corruption, it is his duty as a public representative to nail it directly and definitely, and not to fling wildly general charges about corruption around, leading people who do not know to think that there is something wrong about the administration here.</P>
    <P>My attitude with regard to this is: we vote against the motion.  With regard to the suggestion for a committee, I do not think a further committee would be of any use.  We have had this matter examined time after time and the circumstances are not very different. The proposal made here is in fact a proposal to reduce the allowances, although it is hidden.  For instance, in the case of some Ministers, it is a proposal for a reduction of a couple of hundred £.</P>
    <P>People say: &ldquo;You, the Ministers, do not pay any income-tax.&rdquo;  I have no other income but what I get from the State, and I pay in income-tax between £500 and £600.  If it is suggested that, because one does not pay income-tax, one is likely to impose income-tax on others, it can also be said in the opposite direction that, if one does pay income-tax, one may not be prepared <Col N="1069" /> to impose income-tax where it should be imposed.  That sort of argument cuts both ways.  So far as we are concerned, we will vote against the motion.  If there is a suggestion to reduce the amount, let it be a straightforward motion to reduce.  If there is to be a question of an alternative, that is, a salary with allowances which will be regarded as allowances are regarded in other professions, as amounts necessary to enable certain expenses to be met, well and good, but let us have it in that way and not in this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  The speech delivered by the Taoiseach is, in my opinion, a fair representation of the position of the average Deputy and proves that even the Taoiseach has learned something in the school of experience. I was elected to membership of this House on the first occasion at a time when there was no prospect of payment of any kind in the shape of salary, allowances, or expenses. That, I admit, applies with greater force to the members of the Government and of the Front Opposition Bench and other members of the House who were elected to the First and Second Dála.  Since I was elected, I have been obliged to fight nine general elections and to meet the personal expenses which have to be met by those taking part in such contests.  I received certain allowances from a certain date and I could go before any committee, select or otherwise, of this House or before any other committee, and prove that everything I received in the shape of salary, expenses or allowances during that period has gone into circulation for the benefit of somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unfortunate feature of this whole position is that the majority of the income-tax payers with whom I <Col N="1070" /> come in contact are very envious of the position which we Deputies occupy, because they believe that the amount we receive is a salary, and, as such, should be subject to the current rate of income-tax.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach and his Information Bureau and propaganda department can do anything to remove that wrong impression from the minds of the majority of the people.  It may have been hammered into their skulls by the leading articles and articles written in certain papers with a very wide circulation.  Personally, I regarded this amount from the very beginning &mdash;and I think it was so described&mdash;as expenses, and expenses, as I understand the word, are moneys you get to spend and which most of us do spend.  In ordinary commercial life&mdash; the Taoiseach referred to this point&mdash; commercial travellers and representatives of public companies receive, in addition to their salaries, expenses to cover the cost of hotel accommodation and other incidental and personal expenses, and at no time since I became a member of the House, have such expenses, so far as I am aware, been subject to income-tax.</P>
    <P>This Party, in the ordinary course, would be more concerned than any other Party I know of with the issue now to be decided by the vote of the House, because the majority of my colleagues on these benches have no other means or income of any kind but what they receive in the shape of expenses or allowances, or, as some people call it, salary.  As one who is not entirely dependent on the allowance I receive as a member of the House, I sympathise very much with some of my colleagues, who, I know, find it very difficult to keep themselves and their families in a respectable position on the allowance of which they are in receipt.  Some eloquent members of the Fianna Fáil Party at one time placarded me in my constituency as being in receipt of a salary of £1,000 a year, in addition to the allowance I received as a member of the House.  I never received anything like that figure and I am sure I am not worth it; but, on the day of judgment for Deputies, <Col N="1071" /> I can say that, just as the allowance I receive has gone into circulation, so has every other additional penny, for the benefit of the community.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies describe this amount of £480 as expenses; others describe it as an allowance; and others as a salary; but I am sorry to think that the majority of the people look on it as a salary, and if that is the opinion of the majority of the people, I would feel reluctantly obliged to put myself in the same position as we, as Deputies, or the members of the Government, put the community in regard to liability for payment of income-tax.</P>

      <P>I regret that those who have spoken did not deal with the motion as it should have been dealt with.  Deputy Tunney made one great point, which is a credit to him, when he said that on every motion which comes before the House we discuss the terrible cost that it is going to put on the Exchequer.  A little earlier last evening, he said, a motion was withdrawn which proposed to give an extra few pence to the blind people in this country.  My conscience tells me, and the people whom I represent here, that this allowance is definitely a salary.  I look upon it as £480 per year for doing work for the people who have sent us here.  That is my view, and it is the view of the people whom <Col N="1072" /> I have the honour to represent that, when there is not income-tax paid on that sum, just as it is paid on a like sum which civil servants and other public officials are in receipt of, there can be no doubt that we are setting ourselves up as a privileged class in getting the £480 free of tax.  By doing that we are shaking the foundations of this State.  That is my honest opinion. I do not mind what Deputies think about me.  It was not propaganda motives that urged me to put down the motion.  The motion represents my honest belief, and when I put this matter before my constituents in Galway I was returned with the support of 10,000 votes, with more votes than some of the Deputies who have tried to throw dirt and mud on me here received.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde told us last night that he welcomed the Clann na Talmhan Party into the Dáil.  He must think that he was talking to fools.  I know that he did not welcome us.  I know that no Deputy, and no Party in this House, welcomed us into it.  I know that we were not wanted in it, but still the people sent us here. The Deputy talked about professional politicians and that class of thing. Well, if the cap fits him he is quite welcome to wear it.  I make no apology for bringing forward this matter. My conscience dictated to me that I should do so, and the people who elected me desired it.  I am not ashamed of it.  I do not mind how many Deputies support it.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Esmonde's amendment, it is not acceptable to us because it, also, would have the effect of setting up a privileged class.  That amendment proposes:</P>
      <P>and that for the purpose of arriving at the amount of assessable income in respect of members of Dáil Éireann a sum of at least £250, and in respect of members of Seanad Éireann a sum of at least £150, be deducted as legitimate expenses from their respective allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because that amendment suggests the setting up of a privileged class we will <Col N="1073" /> not accept it.  I notice that, in a certain newspaper to-day, we have the motion described in black print as being &ldquo;dishonest.&rdquo;.  Well, I suppose, a guilty conscience troubles people sometimes in matters like this.  It is not dishonest.  I read in a certain newspaper another of Deputy Esmonde's statements in the course of which he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Did we realise that, if the motion were carried, we would bring the income-tax inspector to every farmer in Ireland whose poor law valuation was less than £100?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was one of the most dishonest statements made during the whole debate because such is not the case. He also said that his amendment was put down for spiking purposes.  I know well that a good many Deputies on each side of the House spiked our motion, that they tried to make little of it, and to paint us to the country as a crowd of people who do not know what they are talking about.  I want to tell the House straight that we are honest anyhow, and that we are sincere in the proposals that we make here. We are new to this House and we have not the financial conveniences that other Parties have at the end of their elbows to enable them to get a certain amount of information.  I am sure Deputies know what I mean.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave repeated ten times the statement: &ldquo;What did they mean by everybody else?&rdquo;  He reminded me of the cuckoo on a June morning that says &ldquo;cuckoo, cuckoo&rdquo;.  That is what his statement amounted to.  What is &ldquo;meant by everybody else&rdquo; is that the position should be the same for Deputies as it is for every other individual outside the House who draws a salary for his work.  The motion means that and nothing more.  The Deputy told us that in Australia the members get £1,000 a year.  I hope the day will never come when that will be attempted here.  It would take a stronger combination than that of the two big political Parties to succeed with that.  The Deputy talked about the poor saving there would be at the rate of 7/6 in the £&mdash;that it would be in or about £33,000 a year.  What does <Col N="1074" /> that matter?  But in the West of Ireland all that we can give for the starving children is £7,000 a year for the free meals.  That is all that we can afford for free meals for the starving children in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>If Deputy O Cléirigh wants to throw it at me that I will be free of income-tax because I am the father of eight children, I want to say that I am not ashamed of that. That is one thing that he will never be able to boast of.</P>
      <P>He said that this motion was introduced in order to raise bad blood and that bad blood never existed here. Bad blood never existed in this House! I can assure you that it is not for the purpose of raising bad blood that we came into this House.  We came into this House to heal those wounds that have been created because bad blood exists here and will exist here while the two big Parties in this House are in it, as they were founded in a civil war.</P>

      <P>Statements have been made here with regard to a certain newspaper and what it says.  We have not the slightest interest in that newspaper.  I want to tell you that straight.  If a certain newspaper has advocated anything like this, it is not on our advice, I can assure you.  It is not from that paper that we are taking this line; it is from our people that we are taking it.  I have heard some people here criticise that paper which has often made itself very useful to them.  Deputy Dillon&mdash;though I seldom agree with him&mdash;has been quite honest about this matter.  He wants to know if this is a salary or an allowance I explained when introducing the motion last night that the reason I put it forward was that we believed it was a salary.  Some speakers said that Deputy Cafferky stated: &ldquo;Increase the salary.&rdquo;  Of course, that is only propaganda.  That is like the Deputy who said we are out for making a farmer with anything up to £100 valuation pay income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>He said it anyway.</P>

      <P>He certainly did not say it.  I was listening to him and he made no such statement.  He said that he would prefer the salary to be increased and income-tax paid on it, if you were able to make a case for it. The case we make is that, no matter what the salary is, it should be subject to income-tax.  I was listening to the Taoiseach and there is no doubt about it that he spoke as the great man he certainly is.  He was honest about what he had to say.  If the time comes when I, or the other members of our <Col N="1076" /> Party, will learn as he did, well I suppose we will bow to it, the same as he has done.  But it is our view, as I said, that this is a salary and that it should be subject to income-tax.  In one statement the Taoiseach made I think he went away from the matter. I hope he did not try to convey to the House that our idea is that only individuals who can afford it financially should come into this House.  I gathered from his statement that he meant that, if there were no allowance or salary, only a certain class who are financially fit, so to speak, could come into this House.  I can assure him that that is far from our view.  I am sure that if he considers the position of the Deputies on these benches, or if he talks to that henchman, Deputy O'Clery, who spoke, during the election, of candidates as &ldquo;spalpeens&rdquo; he would realise that we are not Deputies who can afford to come in here for nothing, that at least we must get something which would make us financially able to come in here.</P>
      <P>If that was his idea, I should like him to get away from it.  He also said that a Deputy's examination was the greatest examination of all.  To a certain extent, he is right in that statement. He also stated that we were the agents for everybody.  I hope that that is the case.  I often find that it is not the case in regard to certain Deputies.  I hope that he will make those people whom he controls agents for everybody; that there will be no such thing as: &ldquo;You will have to do so and so before I do anything for you,&rdquo; which very often happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one statement of the Taoiseach's which I could not understand: he referred to income-tax on Ministers' salaries.  I always thought that that part of Ministers' salaries over £480 was subject to income-tax; I always understood that £480 of their salary was free from income-tax.  It would be hard to convince people down the country that Ministers are not getting sufficient salary.  I ask Deputies to consider this matter in all sincerity.  I can assure the House that this motion is not brought forward as propaganda.  It is an honest motion sponsored by honest people.  It is not <Col N="1077" /> brought forward for any political purpose or anything like that.  It is what the people who sent us here believe should be done.  I accept full responsibility for bringing the motion forward. I do not believe that I have done anything wrong in bringing it forward.</P>
    <P>We come here as honest representatives of the people.  I appeal to Deputies to vote for this motion so that in future we will not be spoken <Col N="1078" /> of as a privileged class.  If this motion is carried, we will do something which will prove to the people outside that we are willing to bear our share of the general burden, the same as the other people of the State.</P>
