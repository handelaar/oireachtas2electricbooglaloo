      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he has received a resolution by the Kilrush Urban District Council requesting that the scheme of reclamation for Pol-na-Sherry Bay be considered, as this scheme would give whole-time employment to a considerable number of men in the surrounding district, reclaim a large area of land, and drain and enhance the value of the bogs and turbary adjacent; and if he will state whether he will give immediate consideration to this matter so as to relieve the present volume of unemployment in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a resolution from the council, asking that the scheme referred to should be considered for the purpose of providing employment in the district in the post-war period.  It is a matter for the county manager, in the first instance, to examine any scheme thought to be suitable for that purpose; but it is doubtful if the reclamation of Pol-na-Sherry Bay would, on examination, be found suitable as it is by no means clear that the benefits which would accrue from the work would justify the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An allocation related to the number of unemployment assistance recipients has already been made for road and other works in the area, in order to <Col N="2075" /> provide employment during the present winter season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the new Gárda Síochána barracks at Crumlin was roofed with imported tiles, while tile manufacturing concerns in the district were compelled to lay off workers through lack of orders; and if he will ensure for the future that, as far as possible, home-manufactured materials be specified in contracts for Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The specification for this building provided that all materials, appliances and fittings were, whereever possible, to be obtained from manufacturers operating in Éire. Kingscourt clay tiles were specified for the roofs.  Kingscourt clay tiles were not available when required and, alternative clay tiles of Irish manufacture not being available, the contractor used clay tiles of British manufacture which were actually in stock.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any local manufacturers of clay tiles having been compelled about that time to lay off workers through lack of orders.  It is the invariable practice to specify the use, wherever possible, of materials obtained from manufacturers operating in Éire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state on what basis <Col N="2076" /> candles are distributed at present; and whether it is proposed to introduce any scheme of rationing for candles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The quantity of candles to be distributed is determined each quarter by my Department and distributed by the manufacturers to wholesale and retail traders on the basis of those traders' purchases in 1938.  Where no supplies were purchased in that year, distribution is made on the basis of purchases in 1937 and 1939.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to introduce a scheme of rationing for candles.  The total supplies available are so small in relation to the demand that the quantity which each householder would receive under a rationing scheme would not be sufficient to justify the setting up of the elaborate machinery which would be required to operate the scheme.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - D.U.T.C. Employees' Clothing Coupons.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware of the hardship and inconvenience caused to the employees of the Dublin United Transport Company through the demand made on their clothing coupons for uniforms worn when on duty, and if he will increase the coupons to enable them to have sufficient for their civilian clothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>During the first year of clothes rationing, a scheme was in operation under which persons provided with uniforms were allowed to receive them on surrender of one-quarter of the appropriate number of coupons.  This arrangement placed persons who normally wear uniforms in the pursuit of their callings at an advantages as compared with other members of the community, because they were provided with clothing for their working hours, in which the wear and tear on clothes is heaviest, at a very reduced rate of coupons.  When reviewing the Clothing Rationing Scheme towards the end of the last ration year, I felt that, in view of the accentuated shortage of textile supplies, the scope of this concession <Col N="2077" /> would have to be modified.  Following discussion between officers of my Department and representatives of the principal trade unions and employers of uniformed workers, I decided that the concession should continue to apply only in cases where it was considered essential that the public should have a ready means of identifying a particular class of employees, and where the normal period of wear of the uniform had been extended by 50 per cent.  In accordance with this decision, the concession will apply, during the present rationing year, to bus conductors and bus inspectors, whose duties bring them into immediate contact with the public, but will not be granted to other grades employed by the Dublin United Transport Co.  In the light of the present supply position, it is not possible to modify this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has been in consultation with Messrs.  A. Guinness, Son and Company regarding the recent dismissals in that firm, and whether he has suggested to the firm the adoption of a system of rotational employment or similar arrangement to obviate extreme hardship in many cases; if so, if he will state the result and, if not, whether he will undertake to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The desire of the Government that the disemployment of workers should, if possible, be avoided or minimised during the period in which it is necessary to prohibit exports of beer was conveyed to the representatives of Messrs. Guinness and Company by officers of the Department of Supplies and by myself, personally, together with an intimation of my willingness to reconsider the margins allowed to the firm on home <Col N="2078" /> sales if such adjustment was considered necessary by the firm.  Messrs. Guinness and Company intimated, however, that the disemployment of a number of workers was considered necessary.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of a notice by Messrs. Guinness and Company that a number of its employees were about to be dispensed with, the Department of Industry and Commerce discussed with the firm's administrative officer the matter of the adoption of a short-time scheme to cover the employees being dismissed.  The company had been previously supplied with a memorandum on the subject of the prolongation of employment by means of short-time working, in which were given examples of the many systems under which payment of unemployment benefit or assistance can be made for recurring spells of unemployment and an outline of the special arrangements that may be made for dealing with short-time workers either at the local office of the Department or at the firm's premises.</P>
      <P>My Department was, however, subsequently informed that the whole matter has been fully considered by the board of the company but that it had not been considered practicable to adopt a short-time system of working.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister in a position to state if any consultations have taken place with, or if any representations have been made to, Irish maltsters, with a view to obtaining the necessary barley so as to avoid any dismissals; and, if so, with what result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not get the Deputy's point.  It has been decided to limit the quantity of barley that may be malted in the present cereal situation so that barley may be available for use in flour production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The question that arises in this connection is the quantity of barley that may be malted.  The full quantity of barley offered for sale will be purchased.  A proportion of that will be released for malting.  The remainder will be used for admixture with wheat in the production of flour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether it is possible to utilise nettles for making paper, etc., in this country, as is being done in other countries; and, if so, whether the collection of nettles should be undertaken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first portion of the Deputy's question, my information is that it is possible to utilise nettles for making paper in this country.  I understand that it would be practically impossible to collect nettles in sufficient quantities to make their use for paper manufacture economical and that the fibre yield from nettles is considerably lower than that from other materials available in this country for paper manufacture, such as straw.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>How does it come that it pays both in England and Germany&mdash;both countries at war and severely pressed for labour&mdash;to collect nettles and that it is uneconomic for us to do likewise?  Are we to continue feeding the donkeys on them as of yore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Paper can be made out of any fibrous matter but, of all fibrous matter available to us, nettles are, probably, the most unsuitable.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that there has been serious delay from day to day in the dispatch from the Great Southern Railways, at Wexford station, of farm machinery manufactured by Messrs. Pierce, of Wexford; that, as a result of such delay, there are at present lying at Wexford depot, awaiting dispatch to customers in Éire, 50 corn <Col N="2080" /> drills, 84 root cutters and 147 horse ploughs; that the rolling stock made available by the railway company for Messrs.  Pierce's products is totally inadequate to clear their output; and whether, in view of the fact that these newly-manufactured implements are urgently needed to be put into use for food production, he will either make such representations to the railway company as will ensure the speedy dispatch of Messrs. Pierce's products, or else have them classed as priority goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The transport of agricultural machinery from Wexford has, for some time past, been under discussion with the Great Southern Railways Company.  I am satisfied that every effort is being made to deal with the traffic as expeditiously as circumstances permit.  At present, when the grain and beet traffics are at a peak, it is temporarily impossible to meet the full demands of other traffic on the company's rolling stock and engine power. No purpose would, however, be served by adding this traffic to the priority list, as it is already accorded preference over all other traffic, with the exception of certain perishable foodstuffs, beet, fuel and live stock for fairs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.  The Dublin Rheumatism Clinic, which was established about a year ago, is under the management of an incorporated body.  I am aware that there is up-to-date treatment provided in the clinic for all forms of rheumatic ailments under the supervision of a medical director, and I believe that the facilities for treatment are widely known throughout the City of Dublin.  The experience gained in the working of the clinic and the results of treatment will be of value, and no doubt the management of the clinic will publish, at suitable times, reports on the working of the clinic.  The Articles of Association provide that at every annual general meeting the chairman shall present a report of the progress and work of the association during the previous year.  My Department have no means of obtaining statistics regarding the incidence of rheumatic disease amongst the population generally. I would refer the Deputy to the Fourth General Report of the Hospitals Commission which contains statistics regarding the incidence of rheumatic diseases amongst the insured population.</P>

      <P>As regards the first part of the question, if the Deputy <Col N="2087" /> refers to the classification which soil chemists in neighbouring countries have for the time being agreed to adopt and which is based entirely on empirical laboratory methods, the answer is in the negative.  As regards the latter part of the question, farmers themselves have a sound practical knowledge of the state of fertility of their soils and of the suitability of these soils for cropping purposes.  The main causes of depressed yields are well known and are more or less common to the country as a whole rather than peculiar to particular holdings. The information in regard to these causes, which can be obtained from the agricultural instructors and which will be based on numerous field experiments conducted under varying conditions throughout the country, will be found far more reliable and practical than advice which may be based on the empirical laboratory methods already referred to and which may, in fact, be quite misleading.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the order of business, I want to enter a protest against what I think is the lack of consideration shown by the Government to other Parties in the House. When we adjourned last Thursday night we understood that the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach was to be taken after Vote 66.  We are informed to-day that it will not come on after Vote 66 and that it has been put at the end of the Estimates. Other Estimates, which we were told would not be taken until Wednesday or Thursday, were injected into the order in such a way as to throw them out of their normal course.  I can quite understand that there may be some necessity for making a revision of the order in taking the Estimates, but I think it is unfair and unreasonable that this should be done at such short notice, without any intimation to any of the Parties, so far as I can discover, <Col N="2099" /> until such time as this order had been irrevocably fixed.  I knew nothing of the proposal until to-day. We might have been told on Friday, Saturday or Monday that they were being taken, but nothing was done until to-day.  I think the Taoiseach will recognise that it is unfair to do that at short notice.</P>

The point is that everybody knew that the Estimates were about to be finished, and that the two main Estimates left, after the External Affairs Estimates, were the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department and the Estimate for the Department of Finance.  It was intended that my Estimate should be the last to be taken.  The Minister for Finance was available to take his Estimate and desired to take it.</P>

I do not think anyone in the House <Col N="2101" /> has got any cause for complaint if the order is changed.  I intervene in this for one reason only, and that is because the Minister for Finance came to my office yesterday.  He has been ill for a considerable time, and I was surprised to see him there.  The question as to whether he would or would not take his Estimate arose, and it was decided that he would take his Estimate to-day.  That is the order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The line, I think, on which the debate on this Estimates was running was that it was our duty to look ahead, to try to anticipate the conditions that will exist when this war comes to an end and to make what preparations we could so that when peace came we would be in the best possible position to meet it.  That was an important matter to discuss.  I had already indicated that it was extremely difficult at this stage to see precisely what would be the conditions that would obtain when the war came to an end.  We had seen published a number of statements relating to the policies of the different sets of belligerents, and so far as it was possible to get these we had properly to interpret them.  It was quite clear, at any rate, that one set suggested that they intended, when the war ended, that there was to be an organisation designed to secure an end to war.  I have pointed out that the position of this country had been clear in that regard. It was not something that we were saying just now.  It was something that had been indicated as the national attitude as far back as 1919 and 1920. We then indicated our readiness to enter into any organisation of States designed to maintain the rights of nations and to secure peace, such an association being based on the idea of the sovereign equality and rights of nations, large and small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, however, when it came to his turn to speak, gave the whole discussion something of a twist. I have read his speech in the proof form, and I have to confess that read-it calmly I had the same difficulty in <Col N="2103" /> getting a clear idea of what he was after as I had when I was listening to him speaking.  The best I could make of it was this&mdash;that as a result of our neutrality there was likely to be an estrangement between this country and some of the countries with whom we have been friends in the past, that it was desirable to seek the earliest possible opportunity to make it clear, particularly to the people of the United States, that we sympathised with them, that our attitude was due to our own particular set of circumstances, that we would have desired to help them, but the conditions in which we found ourselves were such that we could not gratify those desires.  I looked anxiously to see what methods he proposed for the doing of that.  He said that it was too late now to take such steps as he had indicated, that it would look very much like getting on the band wagon.  Still, he spoke about Portugal, although Portugal's position and our position are altogether different.  He mentioned the help which, as he said, was given immediately by Portugal.  He noted, of course, that our diplomatic protests with regard to bombing incidents were mild.  He knows everything that took place before Portugal decided to give such help.</P>
    <P>He did not indicate exactly what we were to do.  He did on one occasion advocate here that we should give our ports and so on to the United States, and take whatever the consequences might be, in other words, get into the war.  As we all know he stated that in this House, and did not get very much support here.  He had a great opportunity of putting it to the test in Monaghan during the election, but he took very good care when he spoke in Monaghan not to suggest what he wanted us to do, to get into the war. He took good care on that occasion to point out that it was only a foolish person would bring upon the people the horrors of war.  Some of the previous speakers here had been talking about propaganda.</P>

      <P>I will quote for the Deputy if he thinks that my summary of his speech is unfair to him.  I will quote a sentence from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of May 31st, 1943, page 3, column 6.  According to the report when speaking at Donaghmoyne, Mr. Dillon said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They were told that if they voted for him they would be in the war, but no one was so foolish as to bring upon himself all the horrors of war.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did make a speech on neutrality which appeared in the newspapers during the election campaign. What I did say was that nobody wants war, but that there were worse things than war.  That will be found in the <i>Irish Press,</i> the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the <i>Irish Times.</i></P>

      <P>What did the Deputy mean?  Did he mean that this country was to go into the war?  He said that the people did not want the horrors of war.  These are carefully chosen words to deceive the electorate, in other words, saying: &ldquo;I do not want war. If you vote for me you are not voting for this country going into war.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not want in the slightest to misrepresent the Deputy, but I say that if a Deputy comes here and expresses certain views everybody who knew the position at the time must have realised that accepting those views meant the giving up of neutrality and, in fact, entering the war.  If he went to Monaghan he could have said to the people there: &ldquo;I think the whole national policy is wrong, all are out of step but me; elect me and show by that fact that you stand for a policy which I maintain is the right one&rdquo;, but he did not do <Col N="2105" /> that.  I have another report of a speech from the <i>Irish Times</i> headed</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon does not want war.&rdquo; Denying emphatically the allegation that he wanted war, Mr. Dillon, at Castleblayney, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No one could want war&mdash;one of mankind's greatest afflictions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Nobody wants war, not even those going into it.  Not even those inviting it! They did not want the horrors of war.  Deputy Dillon and the rest of us might not want the horrors of war, but he wants us to make war.</P>

According to the <i>Irish Times</i> the Deputy said that he had been accused of saying that he wanted to send the young men of Monaghan to die on foreign battlefields.  When he spoke at Monaghan the Deputy stated that that was a lie.  Although the Deputy was going to enter into the war in association with the other nations that were going in, he was going to claim the right of the Irish people to stay at home, while other people abroad would do the fighting for them.  Of course that was in Monaghan when he was talking to the people there.</P>

      <P>Very well; if the Deputy says he said that, I am not denying it, but I do say that it is foolish, because when you go into war you are not playing a game.  When you go into war, and when other people beside you are sacrificing their lives in other lands, you cannot stay at home and say: &ldquo;Yes, you do the fighting abroad.  We shall just do it here, if it comes here.&rdquo;  The Deputy knows full well that you cannot do that sort of thing.</P>

      <P>If the position of the Deputy is that it is the best way in which it can be done, the other associates agreeing that it be done in that particular way, that is all right, but you cannot in advance say: &ldquo;We will go into the war, but we will go in on these conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked what Deputy Dillon really wants us to do.  As I have said, there is this question of propaganda. Deputy Dillon knows full well that since we declared our neutrality, there has been a vicious campaign of propaganda against our people and against our country.  He knows that full well, and he knows that the one thing above all others which he, as a good Irishman, should have striven to do was to try to kill that propaganda, and not to make balls for those who are opposed to us and attacking us abroad to fire.  He knows full well that there has been a very bitter campaign carried on abroad against this country. He knows that it was suggested that German submarines were refuelling round our coasts, and that the crews of these submarines were being entertained in our remote villages.  He <Col N="2107" /> knows that it was asserted that the personnel of the Axis Legations in this country were increased almost a hundred-fold. He knows it was said that there was a vast espionage system against Britain and against America set up in this country, and that wireless messages were going out from our mountains.  He knows all that, and he is not content that these things should be falsely alleged against us, but must go out of his way to try to fasten upon this people and upon us one of the most despicable of charges&mdash;the charge of ingratitude.</P>

      <P>Yes, it is despicable. Ingratitude is mean in a man and meaner still in a nation.  Why should the Deputy go out of his way to try to fasten such a charge upon us?  He pretends to quote from a message which I sent to the people of America. I remember the occasion on which I sent it; I remember scribbling it on a piece of paper that was at hand down deep in the bow of the forecastle of the old <i>Celtic</i> as she was ready to leave New York Harbour.

      <P>The Deputy said it was not the first time he had raised it and he also had given his own additions and constructions to it.  He spoke of this message as if it were a treaty.  Treaties at least ought to be construed on their texts and their spirit, but again he construed it, and wants to construe it, not as most people try to construe treaties, in the spirit in which they were given and the intention in which they were made, and to the benefit of their own people, if there is a doubt.  I do not think it is an unfair line to take that people should construe them in their spirit, their literal meaning, and, if there is a doubt, I do not see why they should construe them against their country, unless for some higher purposes which may serve the interest of their country. In order that there may be no misunderstanding about it, I propose, if I am permitted, to read the latter portion of this message.  It consists of three paragraphs.  The first two are short and I shall omit them.  The final paragraph reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I came to you on a holy mission, a mission of freedom&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2109" />&mdash;I was addressing the people of the United States as I was leaving&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I return to my people who sent me, not indeed, as I had dreamed it, with the mission accomplished, but, withal, with a message that will cheer in the dark days that have come upon them and that will inspire the acceptance of such sacrifices as must yet be made.  So farewell&mdash; young, mighty, fortunate land.  No wish that I can express can measure the depth of my esteem for you, or my desire for your welfare and your glory.  And farewell, the many dear friends I have made and the tens of thousands, who for the reason that I was the representative of a noble nation and a storied, appealing cause, gave me honours they denied to princes&mdash;you will not need the assurance that Ireland will not forget and that Ireland will not be ungrateful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I say here to-day that Ireland has not forgotten the generosity of the American people and that Ireland is not ungrateful.  That is truth.  It is true of me personally.  Like other members of the House and other people throughout the country, I have closer personal connections with the United States of America than I have with any other country but this.  That is true probably of a large number of our people.  We have not forgotten the assistance we got from the United States, and we are not ungrateful, but is the position which Deputy Dillon takes up that we have forgotten and that we are ungrateful unless we pay that debt in the blood of our people?  Is that the sort of repayment that the people of America were entitled naturally to expect from that message?  Is it fair that Deputy Dillon should go and interpret that message so as to get that meaning out of it?  I say it is not.  It was neither intended by me&mdash;because I did not foresee situations like this&mdash;nor was it expected by the people of the United States.</P>
    <P>I came from the people of the United States and I want you to remember the circumstances.  I went over to the United States for two or three main <Col N="2110" /> purposes.  But the principal purpose for which I went was to secure recognition of the Parliament and the State which had been declared here as a result of a general election, declared here by the representatives of the Irish people.  People would naturally say: &ldquo;How did he expect that the United States Government was going to give recognition to a State so declared? Were they going to do something which was going to give offence to Britain, their associate in the war?&rdquo; Would one not say that was a very foolish mission, indeed, a very hopeless mission from the start, to go over to the United States and to ask the Government of the United States to recognise a Government that was set up here as the result of the votes of the majority of the Irish people, by a majority of the representatives of the Irish people; to recognise the Republic which was declared here by the Irish people; that it was foolish to expect that; that, so long as Britain did not recognise it, America was not going to do such a foolish thing as to offend Britain by giving such recognition? Yes, indeed, it would have been, in ordinary circumstances, a rather hopeless mission.</P>
    <P>What inspired it?  Why was it undertaken at all?  Well, those of us who lived through the last war and knew what was said during the last war understand it.  But there are young people&mdash;perhaps Deputy Dillon may be one of them&mdash;who may have forgotten about those times, and may, like others, be wondering how it was that we undertook such a mission at all.  I will try to bring back some of the circumstances of those times to you by telling you what were the declarations that were made at that time.  The United States of America entered the war some time in April, 1917.  Long before that, however, President Wilson had given utterance to his views on world affairs, and he had set out the principles which he believed would have to be accepted as basic if there was to be international peace.  On May 27th, 1916, speaking at Washington to the League to Enforce Peace, he set down three fundamental principles:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2111" />&ldquo;First, that every people has a right to choose the sovereignty under which they shall live.</P>
    <P>Second, that the small States of the world have a right to enjoy the same respect for their sovereignty and for their territorial integrity that great and powerful nations expect and insist upon.</P>
    <P>Third, that the world has a right to be free from every disturbance of its peace that has its origin in agression and disregard of the rights of peoples and nations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Within a few months of making that statement, these principles were, word for word, being incorporated in the platform of the Democratic Party. They were made the basis on which the election was held as the public policy of the United States, and the democratic President was elected on that basis.</P>
    <P>Before he actually took office a second time, President Wilson, on January 22nd, 1917, still before America was in the war, addressing the Senate on the conditions of peace, stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The equality of nations upon which peace must be founded, if it is to last, must be an equality of rights; the guarantees exchanged must neither recognise nor imply a difference between big nations and small; between those that are powerful and those that are weak....</P>
    <P>No peace can last, or ought to last, which does not recognise and accept the principle that Governments derive all their just powers from the consent of the governed, and that no right anywhere exists to hand peoples about from sovereignty to sovereignty as if they were property....</P>
    <P>That no nation should seek to extend its polity over any other nation or people, but that every people should be left free to determine its own polity, its own way of development, unhindered, unthreatened, unafraid, the little along with the great and powerful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2112" /> These principles of the right of nations to choose their own sovereignty, of the equality of rights between great nations and small, were repeated in speech after speech that the President of the United States at that time delivered and, when America was entering the war in April, 1917, these principles were further elaborated.  On May 26th, 1917, in a cablegram to Russia he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Phrases will not accomplish the result.  Effective readjustments will, and whatever readjustments are necessary must be made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On August 27th, 1917, in a message to His Holiness the Pope, he put the recognition of the rights of people as the foundation stone of peace, and he stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The American people believe that peace should rest upon the rights of people, not the rights of Governments&mdash;the rights of peoples, great or small, weak or powerful&mdash; their equal right to security and freedom and self-government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On December 4th, 1917, in his address to Congress he said that the justice for which they were fighting would be applied impartially:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be full impartial justice&mdash; justice done at every point and to every nation that the final settlement must affect, our enemies as well as our friends.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On May 26th, 1917, he defined America's war aims in one sentence, in his cabled message to Russia. Speaking of America, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;She is fighting for no advantage or selfish object of her own, but for the liberation of people everywhere from the aggressions of autocratic force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As the war continued, he emphasised all these principles time and time again, On September 1st, 1918, in a public message to American Labour, he said of the American soldiers that they went as crusaders:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They are giving their lives that ... men everywhere be free as they (themselves) insist upon being free ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2113" /> The Armistice, as you know, was signed on November 11th, 1918.  The President came to Europe for the Peace Conference.  Representatives of this nation sent messages asking that their claims should be heard, but they would not be heard.  Going back to America on February 24th, 1919, at Boston, on his return from Paris, he said the world looked to America as to no other belligerent, because America acted her ideas:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When they &mdash; the European nations&mdash;saw that America not only held the ideals, but acted the ideals, they were converted to America and became firm partisans of these ideals ...We set this nation up to make men free ... and now we will make men free.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On March 4th, 1919, at New York, he spoke again on his way to the Peace Conference, and struck a new note of hope for oppressed peoples.  Referring to the States that had been oppressed, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Europe is a bit sick at heart at this moment, because it sees that statesmen have had no vision.  Those who suffer see ... The nations that have long been under the heel ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;there are some omissions there; it is a long sentence, but the sense is&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;have called out to the world, generation after generation, for justice, liberation and succour, and no Cabinet in the world has heard them. Private organisations, philanthropic men and women, have poured out their treasure in order to relieve their sufferings, but no nation has said to the nations responsible: &lsquo;You must stop; this thing is intolerable and we will not permit it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Need I say to those who are here what hope these words inspired in our people?  If anybody wonders why we could go to the United States of America on the mission that we went on, I ask him to read these words, if they are printed, or to take them away in his memory from what I have said. President Wilson went on to reassert the determination of the United States <Col N="2114" /> of America to bring freedom to all peoples:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The United States, when it became necessary, would go anywhere where the rights of mankind were threatened.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have given a rather long list.  I could have multiplied that list and given a list at least five times as long, every statement bearing out the position which was taken up by the President of the United States of America. But that was not all.  Those Deputies over the half century will remember fairly well the conditions in the last war.  They will remember the appeals that were made to our people during that war.  They will remember that the statements that were made by the President of the United States of America were repeated, in other forms, by the statesmen of Britain and of other countries.  I have here samples of the posters that were issued during that war, asking our young people to come in and serve.  They are too long to quote in full.  I will give just a sentence or two at the beginning and, perhaps, one or two at the end.  The first one here is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ireland and America.  The Star-Spangled Banner is unfurled for the fight.  There is not the slightest ambiguity about the language of President Wilson.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think those who have been listening to the extracts which I have read will admit that that sentence was justified. And it ends:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Will Ireland fight for this freedom?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps, to make the argument clear, I should read it in entirety:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner is unfurled for the fight.  There is not the slightest ambiguity about the language of President Wilson:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Territory, sovereignty, or political relationship&mdash;any or all of these&mdash;to be settled upon the basis of the free acceptance of that settlement by the people immediately concerned.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>The President also said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are concerting with our <Col N="2115" /> Allies to make not only the liberties of America secure, but the liberties of every other people as well.'</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No man can read these words without applying them to Ireland as well as to Belgium, Poland, the Jugo-Slavs and the Ukraine.  The Allies&mdash; and America clearly states this&mdash;cannot undertake to free the peoples under Germany and Austria and leave other peoples under a system of government which they resent. America, speaking through its President, declares that &lsquo;the liberties of every other people&rsquo; are as valued and are to be made secure, aye, as the liberties of America.  Will Ireland fight for this freedom?  America will see her rights are secured.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This is a poster which was issued with the authority, apparently, of the British War Office. It is numbered, 417, 5626. 3. 20,000, Falconer, G. 5.  There is a second one&mdash;&ldquo;Ireland and the Peace Conference&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Allies declare in specific terms that they are out to give freedom to small nationalities.  The Central Powers, Germany and Austria, refuse to declare any such thing, and their treatment of Belgium, Serbia, Montenegro and Roumania in the present war is enough to show their principles and method.  But they go further and ask the Allies to agree to close out all nations not in the enjoyment of freedom prior to the war.  The Allies refuse.  Is it not in the interest of Ireland then to test the public declarations of the Allies and aid them in the fight they are waging for Small Nationalities? They cannot then in the face of Europe give freedom to all the Small Nations and leave Ireland out.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Well, I think I have shown to the members of the <Col N="2116" /> House why we had the temerity to go to the United States of America at that time and to ask that a small nation, which had proved most conclusively what it required, and that had set up a Republic based upon its people's will, should receive recognition. But, just as President Wilson had said, Cabinets had not listened before, and so the American Government did not feel that it could do this so far as we were concerned, and, accordingly, our claim for recognition was not accepted.  The principal part of my mission, therefore, which was to secure recognition of the Republic, had not been successful, the United States Government feeling, I suppose, that President Wilson, when he came to Europe, had a difficult task to face.  He failed, I believe, in things that he wished to do himself because he found the conditions in Europe were too much for him, although I do believe that when he made those statements he meant them.</P>
      <P>When it came, however, to the point when he had to choose, as the head of his Government, between the friendship with his Allies which he thought might possibly be involved&mdash;although, really, that should not have been the case, because Britain and British statesmen, as I have pointed out, had already committed themselves to these principles almost as completely as had the President himself.  Therefore, he might very well have been able to say to the British Government at that time: &ldquo;See what I have said; see the principles for which I have entered into the war&mdash;which principles you yourselves have accepted&mdash;and why should you now be offended by these principles because I give recognition to them myself, and because I have recognised a nation which, if ever a nation could have done so, has proved in a most conclusive manner that it was in a position to govern itself?&rdquo; As I have pointed out, if there were not other interests involved, and if the conditions of the time had not been too much for him, I believe that that would have been the attitude of President Wilson, but, for its own reasons, the Government of the United States of America did not do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2117" /> As I have said, we would probably not have had the temerity to seek for these things were it not for these representations that had been made, but I understood the difficulties with which President Wilson was confronted.  I understood that, as far as the President of the United States was concerned, his duty was to be concerned with the interests of his own people ultimately, and, if on those grounds, he came to a decision not to give us recognition, then I knew enough about world affairs to take that as it was. But the attitude of the American people, who had listened to and supported these statements, was quite different.  The attitude of the people of the United States everywhere was one of friendliness towards us.  The State Legislatures passed resolutions asking the American Government to give us recognition.  The House of Representatives, as well as the Senate of the United States passed resolutions asking that Ireland's delegates be received and heard at the Peace Conference.  Everything that the people of the United States could do, I might say, outside of actually getting their Government, or forcing their Government, to give us recognition, they had done.</P>
    <P>We went to the Presidential Convention in Chicago&mdash;the Republican Convention. We asked those Americans who were friendly to our cause to put down as a part of their political programme that if the candidate which their Party was putting forward were elected President, they would give that recognition to our nation which seemed to have been indicated clearly in President Wilson's statements.  I remember it well.  We had got resolutions, as I have said, in our favour, from State Legislatures; municipalities had supported us; the Houses of Congress had supported us, and there was no use in having simply a resolution of sympathy at that stage.  The only thing that was going to be of any real value to us at that stage was a definite pledge of recognition.  However, there were Americans who, although friendly to Ireland, thought otherwise, and wanted to have something like an expression of sympathy inserted.  Now, it seemed to me that the time for that <Col N="2118" /> had gone, and that the only thing that was going to be of value to us was a definite, formal pledge by the Party that they were prepared to give recognition to us.</P>
    <P>I have indicated at the start that, in 1916, the Democratic Party had adopted the principles which we asked should be applied to us, and I felt certain that if the Republican Convention had put on its programme the recognition of the Republic that had been set up here by the vote of the Irish people, the Democratic Convention would do the same, if we requested them to do so, and I felt sure that such a resolution, if it had been pressed probably, would have been passed by both conventions.  As I have pointed out, I had gone everywhere as the representative of our people, and had got recognition everywhere as the representative of our people.  Deputy Dillon has said&mdash;and possibly rightly&mdash;that probably nobody could claim ever to have got wider recognition from our own people, in the sense of having authority from our own people to speak in their name, than I had at that particular time, nor had anybody received a greater reception by the people of the United States of America than I received, at that time, as the representative of our own people.</P>
    <P>We had floated a loan.  They had subscribed generously to that loan. Although I had not, when I was leaving, got the recognition which was the principal purpose of my mission, I had got very much for our people for which I feel we were bound to be grateful. Although I have read these things which President Wilson stated as indicating the purpose of our mission to the United States, I do not want that to take away from the gratitude which I think our people owe to the people of the United States for the position we have reached up to this time.  It has been a continuing help.  When I was over negotiating in 1938 I got that help also.  I could not have got it formally and officially, but I did get it unofficially.</P>
    <P>Why then does Deputy Dillon try to put us in the position of being ungrateful?  Why use the word <Col N="2119" />&ldquo;ingratitude,&rdquo; to which the words &ldquo;black,&rdquo;&ldquo;base,&rdquo;&ldquo;mean&rdquo; and &ldquo;despicable&rdquo; are the only adjectives that can be applied?  Why does he want to fasten that on our people, when it is not true?  I do not think that the United States acted unfairly by us because we did not get that recognition, though I say because I know enough about the world, that that would have been one of the outstanding things in history if it were done.  It was not done.  Am I going to say that the United States let us down, that we were badly treated and so on?  Am I going to try to work up the people of this country so that they might feel bitter towards the people of the United States because that was not done?  I certainly am not because the truth is, if it were done, it would be an outstanding thing in history.  It was not done, and what we are grateful for are the things that were done.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible but I shall give you what I said in Cork after the United States entered the war.  This is an extract from my speech in Cork:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Since this terrible war began our sympathies have gone out to all the suffering peoples who have been dragged into it.  Further hundreds of millions have become involved since I spoke at Limerick a fortnight ago.  Its extension to the United States of America brings a source of anxiety and sorrow to every part of this land.  There is scarcely a family here which has not a member or near relative in that country.  In addition to the ties of blood, there has been between our two nations a long association of friendship and regard continuing uninterruptedly from America's own struggle for independence down to our own.  The part that American friendship played in <Col N="2120" /> helping us to win the freedom that we enjoy in this part of Ireland has been gratefully recognised and acknowledged by our people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon says that it is all black ingratitude as far as we are concerned. The statement went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would be unnatural then if we did not sympathise in a special manner with the people of the United States, and if we did not feel with them in all the anxieties and trials which this war must bring upon them.  For this reason, strangers who do not understand our conditions have begun to ask how America's entry into the war will affect our State policy here.  We answered that question in advance. The policy of the State remains unchanged.  We can only be a friendly neutral.  From the moment this war began there was for this State only one policy possible&mdash; neutrality.  Our circumstances, our history, the incompleteness of our national freedom through the partition of our country made any other policy impracticable.  Any other policy would have divided our people and for a divided nation to fling itself into this war would be to commit suicide.  Of necessity, we adopted the policy of neutrality, but we have been under no illusions about it.  We have been fully alive to the difficulties and dangers which it brought.  We are fully aware that, in a world at war, each set of belligerents are ever ready to regard those who are not with them as against them, but the course we have followed is a just course.  God has been pleased to save us during the years of war that have already passed.  We pray that He may be pleased to save us to the end but we must do our part.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement was made in Cork.  It set out clearly what were our special relations with the United States, but, of course, according to Deputy Dillon, we cannot be grateful unless we repay the debt in blood, even to the destruction of our people.</P>
    <P>Then Deputy Dillon wants to come to the help of those who are attacking our country abroad.  He knows perfectly well that one of the things that <Col N="2121" /> have been referred to, time and again in the foreign Press, has been my statement when the American troops entered into the North.  I shall read that statement for the House; it is just as well it should be on record.  Naturally, the moment that it became known that American troops were coming into the North I was asked questions by the Press, and in reply to the Press this statement was issued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In reply to the Press, Mr. de Valera stated to-day that the Irish Government had not been consulted either by the British Government or the American Government with regard to the coming of the American troops to the Six Counties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a definite statement of fact, a statement of fact which it was my duty to make known.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Everyone knew, he said, that Ireland had 20 years ago been partitioned, and the Six Counties cut off from the rest of the country by an Act of the British Parliament, despite the expressed will of the Irish people.  When the United States was entering the last war, President Wilson declared that America meant to fight for democracy and for the right of peoples to national self-determination. The Irish people took him at his word and, in the General Elections of December, 1918, by an overwhelming vote&mdash;more than three for to one against&mdash;declared for National Independence and for the establishment of a Republic.  This decision was reaffirmed, after two years of conflict with Britain, in the General Elections of 1921, when the Partition candidates returned were again less than one-fourth of the total representation. Nevertheless, the British Government cut the nation in two and set up a separate Parliament for six of the 32 Counties.  Those six counties formed no natural, historic or geographical entity.  The area was chosen solely with a view to securing a majority within it for the anti-national minority.  In one-half of the area, including the City of Derry and the whole territory adjoining the Boundary with the Twenty-Six Counties, a majority of the inhabitants are against Partition.</P>

      <Col N="2122" />&ldquo;To partition the territory of an ancient nation is one of the cruellest wrongs that can be committed against a people.  The partition of Ireland is in essence not different from the former partition of Poland, nor are the evils that flow from it less in kind than those which Abraham Lincoln foresaw from the projected partition of the United States, when he determined to prevent it, even at the cost of fighting one of the bitterest civil wars in history.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The people of Ireland have no feeling of hostility towards, and no desire to be brought in any way into conflict with the United States.  For reasons which I referred to a few weeks ago, the contrary is the truth, but it is our duty to make it clearly understood that, no matter what troops occupy the Six Counties, the Irish people's claim for the union of the whole of the national territory and for supreme jurisdiction over it will remain unabated.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Four years ago, the British Government and Parliament recognised fully the sovereignty of the Irish nation over that part of the national territory included in the Twenty-Six Counties, and the bond has been honourably kept in that regard.  But the maintenance of the partition of Ireland is as indefensible as aggressions against small nations elsewhere which it is the avowed purpose of Great Britain and the United States in this war to bring to an end.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What does Deputy Dillon object to in that statement?  The first part was a statement of fact which it was my duty to make public; the rest of it was a clear indication that that portion of the territory&mdash;no matter what might be the international conventions with regard to it&mdash;was regarded, as a matter of right, as part of the national territory of this country; and that, therefore, when the United States' troops were coming there, it was our duty to make clear our position in regard to it.  Again I ask, what offensive thing have I said to anybody there?  Was I, the responsible Minister for External Affairs, to let that happen and make no statement whatever about it?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2123" /> The Deputy asks why I went to the Press.  I went to the Press so that public opinion might be informed.  He does not know what took place, what private dispatches had passed with regard to it; he does not know what the position was, but he wants to accuse me of going out of my way to create bad feeling between the United States and ourselves.  I did not want to do that, and he knows perfectly well I did not want to do it.  If there was one man in this country who has no interest in doing that, I am that person. Although I went there as the representative of our people, and although I am not such a fool as to think that any of the things done there were done for me personally, one would have to be a stone to go through America and see what I saw, from 1919 to 1921, and not be grateful to the people of the United States.  But I have a duty to perform as Minister, and I am going to perform that duty, and it was in performance of it that I made that statement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon goes on in his line of propaganda:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, you did not behave that way when Belfast was attacked.&rdquo;  In other places, he says:&mdash;&ldquo;Actions speak louder than words.&rdquo; But actions in the case of Belfast do not speak at all, apparently&mdash;it was words that were wanted then.  If we did what Deputy Dillon has asked us on more than one occasion to do, to hand over a portion of our territory to be used by Britain and the United States to make war on Germany, if we did hand over the port at Cóbh and if it were being used as a base to attack Germany, on what basis could I protest if Germany bombed it?  I might protest against the bombing.  I think, and always thought, that the bombing of men, women and children is inhuman, that it is the same as going back to the days when villages were wiped out by warring tribes; but I know that modern war has taken on that shape and that there is no use in talking against bombing as such.  If we had handed over Cóbh and if Cork and Cóbh were bombed then, on what basis could I issue a protest to Germany? Would I not be told: &ldquo;War is being made upon us from there.  War <Col N="2124" /> is war, and from wherever we are being attacked, on that place we can hit back and shall hit back.&rdquo;  If I had to make any protest with regard to Belfast, should I not have directed the protest first to those who involve in the war a large portion of the people there against their will?  If, instead, I had protested to Germany, what answer would I get?  The protest would be an idle one.</P>
    <P>I remember that I was rung up in the middle of the night by the Fire Department and was told that an urgent message had come from Belfast asking for assistance.  It was a very urgent message.  I took a few minutes to consider its consequences and, within five minutes, I said: &ldquo;Let all the strength that we can give, all the help that we can give, to put out those fires, be given to our people&rdquo;; and it was given.  I knew that that might have been regarded as a hostile act.  People do not burn and destroy, when they are at war, for the fun of the thing; they want the destruction to take place.  It was a very big decision for me to take, but fire is fire, and the decision, if taken at all, had to be taken then and there.  I took the decision and I felt that the Government&mdash;with whom I got in touch as quickly as I could&mdash;the Parliament and the people would have stood behind that act.</P>

      <P>They were our people, and a more definite act of sympathy with our people could not have been made.  I think there is nothing more mean in all this campaign than the suggestion of cowardice on our part.  We are a small nation, we are quite aware that in modern wars the equipment and armaments required are far beyond the possibilities of a small nation; but when we adopted the policy of neutrality, none of us were foolish enough, I hope, to think it would be a simple, an easy or a safe policy.  As a matter of fact, we knew perfectly well that, in adopting the policy of neutrality&mdash;though it was the wiser one&mdash;it might at some stage involve us in war.  It is not enough to declare a policy of neutrality; you have to defend it and <Col N="2125" /> uphold it.  The upholding of neutrality, if you are sincere about it, means that you will have to fight for your life against one side or the other &mdash;whichever attacks you.  That was the position we were in and that is the position we are in to-day.  Many people are talking to-day as if the danger were past.  I have said time after time that the danger to this country will not be past until the last shot is fired.  Anybody who advises the people to the contrary is giving them wrong and bad advice.  If it should happen that the danger is past, we shall not bring the danger closer by being ready and prepared.  We shall not lose anything by having been prepared and by remaining prepared to the end.  We should commit an irreparable fault if we neglected to be prepared and, thinking the danger was past, were caught unprepared. The wise thing to do is for every one of us to remain at his post from now until the end of the war.  It is hard to steel oneself to doing that when war gets distant but it is the duty of everybody who realises the dangers that lie in our situation to do so.</P>
      <P>Neutrality is not a cowardly policy if you really mean to defend yourself if attacked.  Other nations have not gone crusading until they were attacked.  I saw a letter a short time ago written by an Irishman whose views on many matters are very different from mine. He participated in the last war to defend some of the things set out in the posters from which I was reading. He was an old Parnellite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At least, he put on the uniform and went out and fought. Captain Harrison's letter was written <Col N="2126" /> in reply to Professor Commager, who had been lecturing in Cambridge and who went over to the United States and wrote a long article trying to show the American people that, somehow, Ireland had lost its moral sense. Those were not his exact words, but that was the general effect of his article.  Here we have a reply from an Irishman who fought in the British Forces, who got, if I mistake not, the Military Cross, who believes in what Deputy Dillon, apparently, believes&mdash; close association between Ireland and Britain and Ireland and America&mdash;who has the same views as to the outcome of the war that Deputy Dillon has. But he does not think, as Deputy Dillon does, that to help on those views he must attack this country. He sets out to defend this country. He wrote to the <i>New York Times.</i> Whether his letter was published in that paper or not, I do not know.  I saw it in another paper.  In his letter he says to Professor Commager:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;You insist, again and again, that Ireland has erred in the sphere of morals.  You proclaim that the Irish people have &lsquo;missed out somehow on the greatest moral issue of modern history&rsquo;, and that her continued neutrality shows this.  But see how your whole picture is awry.  You fail to advert to the indisputable fact that whilst, of the four principal Allied belligerents, two relinquished neutrality to enter the war, neither of them did so until they had been assailed by the Axis with fire and sword.  Presumably, when Britain and France declared war upon the Axis in September, 1939, &lsquo;the greatest moral issue in modern history&rsquo; came into being but Russia continued to &lsquo;miss out&rsquo; on it until Hitler invaded her territory in June, 1941, and America herself &lsquo;missed out on the greatest moral issue of modern history&rsquo; for 2¼ years until December, 1941, when Japan struck her the assassin blow at Pearl Harbour. These two great leviathan Powers were no voluntary crusaders leaping into the area in unreflecting and disinterested enthusiasm for high moral principle.  They had made no move when others were wantonly <Col N="2127" /> attacked.  They remained neutral when Denmark and Norway, Holland and Belgium, Jugoslavia and Greece were, in turn, ravaged and enslaved.  They fought because they had to, because they had no choice left, because they were attacked, because, being attacked, they needs must fight or submit to a conqueror's yoke.  And little Ireland was not attacked.  That is the difference. That is the sole difference.  For there is nothing more certain than that Ireland also would have fought back if she had been attacked.  She would have fought with such arms as she could get and as best she might, successfully or not.  Her thousand years of resistance to invasion are sufficient guarantee of that.  In drawing your attention to these indisputable facts, I do not asperse the conduct of either Russia or America, as you must necessarily do if you attempt to justify your censure upon Ireland.  I am fully aware&mdash;as you, apparently, are not&mdash; that national policies are the resultant of many complex motives and that considerations of material resources, of timing, of attendant circumstances, of long-term strategy, of national interests, of plain prudence and the like are all involved in the final decisions not less than regard for high moral principle.  I merely cite these facts to show that your censure on Ireland is ill-considered and ill-founded.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There we have an Irishman defending the attitude we have taken up.  Deputy Dillon said that he did not mind what Captain Harrison said and did not want to follow him.  I ask Deputy Dillon what portion of that statement he objects to.  Let him tell us.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have said most of the things that I wanted to say.  We in this country have chosen our policy.  We have chosen that policy with full recognition of the fact, as I said in Cork, that when people are at war they are apt to conclude that those who are not with them are against them.  We have seen other wars, and I have known Ireland to be abused before&mdash;Ireland was abused in the last war.  We knew that propaganda was going to be used against this country by those who were interested in defaming it, and we knew that that propaganda would continue having its effect, even when the war has ended.  We knew what we were doing.  We are not apologising for it, because we think we have done rightly and correctly.  If it should happen that in the post-war period there will be an attempt made by any State to vent its anger upon us, we have got to face that, just as we have to face, at the present time, the possibilities of attack.  We will face that, I hope, with the same courage that we faced the crises through which we have passed.  We have passed through, not one, but a number of serious situations since the war began.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We shall face whatever comes, and I have not the slightest doubt that our people are not so foolish as to think that in times of stress there is any policy that any nation can choose which is not going to have reactions.  What we have to do, as a people, is to rely on our right, to rely upon the goodness of our cause, to hope that the Almighty will <Col N="2129" /> be as favourable to us as He has been up to the present, and to do everything we can to deserve it, and, whatever the future brings, to accept it and to do our best to minimise any dangers that may be in it.  But we are not going into the position that Deputy Dillon wants to put us into.  He wants to put us into that position.  He would have the whole Irish nation put into this position.  He wants us to go on wishing that one side will win, to go on wishing and shouting about it.</P>
    <P>If this nation were so foolish as to do what Deputy Dillon is saying, do you not think there would be somebody facing this nation, as there are people facing Deputy Dillon, who would say: &ldquo;Very well, then; if you want all these things, why do you not take the steps that will enable these things to come about?&rdquo; If you want these countries to win, if you shout about it, then your duty naturally will be to go and take part.  That is the position.  I have heard somebody talking about Deputy Dillon's speech the last day and the effect it had upon him.  He said it looked to him that Deputy Dillon's speech seemed to indicate that he was all a wish-bone, that he had a wish-bone as big as an ostrich&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £8,058 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1944, for a Contribution towards the Expenses of the League of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amount provided in this Estimate, namely, £8,058, differs little from the amount provided in 1942-43.  Actually, there is a decrease of £280.  The provision is for our contribution to the League of Nations for the calender year, 1942.  The League has effected some economies in its expenditure.  So far as the contributions of member States are concerned, these economies have, in fact, very largely been counterbalanced by the fact that the number of States is somewhat smaller than before.  For instance, in 1941, the necessary two years' notice of the termination of their membership of three States expired, reducing the membership at the beginning of 1942 to 45 States.  We are still liable to contribute on the basis of ten units, but each unit is now greater than it was and, whereas the total expenditure of the League in 1941 was allocated over 523 units, the expenditure in 1942 was allocated over 473.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of the activities, and of our membership, of the League, I do not think there is anything I can usefully add to what I said <Col N="2131" /> on this Estimate last year.  As I pointed out then, the political work of the League has almost entirely ceased but it is continuing its social, economic and humanitarian activities, and has for some time past been devoting a good deal of attention to the study of various problems of post-war reconstruction. Some great central organisation will be essential in the post-war world, and whilst it is impossible at this stage of events to say whether the League itself will emerge as that body, or whether it will be superseded by some other international body it would, in my view, be unwise for a State such as ours to abandon the League at the present juncture.  I do not know if there is anything more that I could usefully add on the Estimate.</P>

      <P>It is not usual for the Minister to say much in moving this Vote.  In fact, in looking over the reports of the previous year's debates I find that there was very little discussion on the Vote for my Office.  The Vote shows a net increase of £3,000 odd as compared with last year.  The increase in cost is largely due to increments to staff, the grant of emergency bonus and, to some extent, to the fact that there are 53 pay weeks in this year as compared with last year.  Eighteen members of the Department's staff are on loan to other Departments, due to the emergency, but the payment of their salaries is still on this Vote.  The salary list has also been increased because of certain activities arising out of the emergency.  This was called for as a result of foreign exchange control, on which we have ten additional officers working.  We have eight officers working on the Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Act.  That has also led to a certain increase in cost.</P>

      <P>I am sure I am expressing the views of other members of the House when I say that we are all glad to see that the Minister has recovered from his recent illness.  I hope that he is fit and well again, and is willing to join his colleagues in the work of preparing a plan for the post-war period. I gave notice to the Minister's Private Secretary that I would ask him to give the House a brief survey of the activities of the Central Bank since it was established and what, if anything, it has done to try to bring down interest rates.  Will he also tell us of any other aspect of the work which <Col N="2133" /> was delegated to that body when it was set up by the authority of this House?</P>
      <P>I do not know whether, on an occasion like this, it would be fair to ask the Minister what he thinks about the revenue position, or, with the information at his disposal, if there is likely to be any necessity for the introduction of an emergency or supplementary Budget.</P>
      <P>One serious matter came to my notice from studying the last issue of the <i>Trade Journal.</i>  The returns indicate a great increase of investments by Irish banks abroad during the period between June, 1939, and June, 1943. The report of the Central Bank disclosed that the investments of Irish banks abroad have increased from £104,000,000 to £161,000,000 inside of four years.  I would be interested to know what is the average rate of interest earned on these foreign investments. I am informed that some of that money is invested at a rate of interest as low as 17/6, or less than 1 per cent., and that the average rate of interest from these huge foreign investments, which increased by £57,000,000 in four years, would not exceed 2 per cent.  That is of interest to everybody who has made any examination of the position that is likely to face the Government of the day in the post-war period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in answer to a question addressed to him last week from these benches, said that the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Supplies, Industry and Commerce, and himself, were acting as a sub-committee of the Cabinet dealing with proposals for the post-war period.  We know perfectly well from the reports of proceedings of local authorities published in the newspapers that county managers, the Tourist Board, the Electricity Supply Board and other big bodies have been invited by the Government to submit plans for the provision of employment in the post-war period.  I read a number of statements made following invitations that were sent to county managers, presumably by the Department of Local Government.  In Galway the county manager stated that one of the proposals he was submitting, presumably for approval, was the building <Col N="2134" /> of 360 labourers' cottages at a cost of £133,200.  On the assumption that interest at the present rate was charged local authorities, it worked out at £370 per cottage.</P>
    <P>In Kerry it was estimated that, with present financial facilities, it would cost £550 to build a house that could be constructed a few years ago for £350.  I want to know from the Minister, particularly as he is acting as one of the members of the Cabinet sub-Committee dealing with the solution of post-war problems, what instructions or advice have been sent to county managers.  Can he tell us if county managers, county councils, the Tourist Board, or the Electricity Supply Board have been instructed to prepare their plans on the basis of interest rates now charged local bodies for development schemes.</P>
    <P>Is it understood that in the post war period local authorities here will be expected to plan for the building of a large number of houses for labourers in rural areas, having regard to the present cost of materials, at the present excessive rates of interest?  I gather that that is the position in view of recent remarks of county managers in Galway and Kerry.  If that is so it is certainly very serious for the taxpayers. At the same time we find that £161,000,000 has been invested by Irish Banks in foreign securities&mdash; British Government securities I presume&mdash;at rates of interest not exceeding 2 per cent.  A big proportion of that money is lent at rates of interest not exceeding and, in some cases, less than 1 per cent.  What action if any has the Minister, the Government or the Central Bank&mdash;if it has any function there&mdash;taken to bring down rates of interest for work of the kind I mentioned to a reasonable figure.  I asked the Minister on a previous occasion to indicate any country where the cost of money for national development purposes was as high as it is in this small State.  Is it to be understood that the building of houses, the drainage of land, the carrying out of afforestation, local relief schemes, peat development or other national development works that may be undertaken post war, will be carried out with moneys borrowed <Col N="2135" /> at excessive rates of interest?  Have any representations been made by the Government to the Central Bank to ascertain whether there is any justification for the bank interest being 1 per cent. higher here than in Great Britain?  In view of the fact that we are tied hand and foot to the British £ I do not see any justification for having the bank rate here 1 per cent. higher than in England.  I hope the Minister will not think it unfair of me to ask for an answer to these questions. I gave notice of my intention to do so earlier, because they are of serious moment to the people as a whole and involve the capacity of the taxpayers to undertake them.</P>
    <P>Recently the question of the removal of the means test in connection with old age pensions has been raised in this House.  Like other Deputies, I welcome the introduction of the Children's Allowances Bill, but there is one striking feature of it which, I hope, has made a deep impression on the Minister for Finance.</P>

Sin é an dlí atá againn, ach ní fheadar an bhfuilimíd go léir sásta go bhfuil luach an airgid sin á fháil againn.  Scéal achrannach an scéal seo.  Níl mórán eolais agam i dtaobh scéal Ollscoile na hÉireann.  Is gá baint do bheith agat leis an áit sin chun eolas cruinn d'fháil mar gheall uirthi.  Do réir mar thuigim-se an scéal, domhan beag inti féin iseadh an Ollscoil.  Níl aon chomhacht ag an Riaghaltas uirthi agus sílim gur amhlaidh atá an scéal in gach tír fé luighe na gréine.  Sa tír seo, creidim go mba cheart Ollscoil níos Gaedhealaighe ná mar atá do bheith againn, go mba cheart gur domhan beag Gaedhealach bheadh inti, ach ní mar sin atá. Tá, deimhnithe go leor againn maidir le hOllscoil na hÉireann nach bhfuil scéal na Gaedhilge chó maith ná chó mór ar fónamh agus ba cheart a bheith.  Sílim go bhfuil an scéal níos measa san gColáiste annso i mBaile Atha Cliath ná mar tá sé in aon choláiste eile den Ollscoil, agus ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an dTánaiste an bhfuil sé sásta go bhfuil an t-airgead atá áchur i leath-taobh á chaitheamh ar fónamh ar mhaithe leis an tír agus ar mhaitheas Ghaedhealú na tíre.

Tá sé soiléir ón dtuairise sin nach féidir bheith sásta le staid na Gaedhilge sa Choláiste sin.  Chuir sé áthas ar Ghaedhilgeoirí agus ar dhaoine Ghaedhealacha gur labhair an tUachtarán nua i gCorcaigh as Gaedhilg nuair tháinig sé os cóir an phobail ar an chéad ócáid mar Uachtarán agus nuair dúirt sé go ndéanfadh sé gach a raibh ar a chumas an Ghaedhilg do chur chun cinn sa Choláiste i gCorcaigh. Rud mór ab eadh é sin, ag teacht ón bhfear sin, agus tá súil ag gach duine go bhfuil aithne aige air go seasóchaidh sé lena bhriathar.

Chím go bhfuil £3,000 le fáil ag an gColáiste le haghaidh léighinn na Gaedhilge fé fhó-mhír (D) an Mheastacháin.  Ba mhaith liom fháil amach an bhfuil aon eolas againn ar conus a caithtear an t-airgead sin.

Bhí baint ag dream maith daoine atá ina dTeachtáí fé láthair leis an troid sin.  Bhí dlúbhaint ag an dTaoiseach, ag an gCeann Comhairle, agus ag Teachtaí ar na binsí thall leis.

Bféidir go bhfuilimíd beagáinín, ach nílimíd chó fada chun tosaigh le Gaedhealú na hOllscoile agus ba cheart.  Sílim go bhfuil an t-am tagtha go mba cheart don Riaghaltas an cheist iomlán do scrúdú go cúramach, agus más rud é go bhfuil airgead le cur amach againn, go mba cheart deimhniú do dhéanamh de go gcuirfí cuid den airgid sin i leath-taobh le hOllscoil cheart Gheadhealach do bhunú.  Iarraim go láidir ar an Aire agus ar an Riaghaltas coimisiún do chur ar bun a scrúdóidh an cheist seo ar fad, staid na Ghaedhilge, agus uile, chun go mbeadh deimhniú ag an dtír go mbeadh Ollscoil náisiúnta ceart againn agus a háit cheart onórach ag ár dteanga féin ann.</P>

Má cuirtear coimisiún ar bun ag an Riaghaltas chun cúrsaí oideachais Ollscoil na hÉireann do scrúdú, sílim go mba cheart obair an Cholásite eile atá sa tír seo do scrúdú chó maith. Tá tuairim agam&mdash;tuairim pearsanta seadh é&mdash;gur cheart an dá Ollscoil a bheith le chéile, agus nach gá Coláiste na Tríonóide bheith ann.  Bhí cuspóirí áirithe ann nuaire cuireadh an Ollscoil sin ar bun, mar is eol do gach aon duine a léigh stair na tíre seo.  Níor eirigh leis na cuspóirí seo, ach tá an Ollscoil sin inár measc fé láthair agus níl fhios againn conus a sheasann sí. Níl fhios againn cioca Ollscoil Ghaedhealach nó Ollscoil Ghallda í, nó a nglacann an Ollscoil sin le cuspóirí na tíre seo.  Ba cheart feasta go mbeimíd deimhnitheach mar gheall ar na rudaí seo.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate I desire to raise the question of the administration of the Civil Service cost-of-living bonus stabilisation regulations for which the Minister for Finance, as the ultimate employer of civil servants, is responsible.  It is probably necessary briefly to give the House an idea of the genesis of the complaints which have arisen because <Col N="2142" /> of the Minister's action in stabilising the cost-of-living bonus.  To those who are not intimately acquainted with the subject it might appear at first glance that what is known as the Civil Service cost-of-living bonus is a special gift from a benevolent Government.  I want at the outset to lay that ghost by asserting that it is no such thing.  The cost-of-living bonus agreement came into operation in 1920.  The purpose of that agreement was to enable the pre-1914 rates of wages and salaries to be adjusted in so far as the Civil Service was concerned by an upward or downward movement reflective of variations in the cost-of-living index figure.  That bonus agreement of 1920 was not just a Government edict.  It was the product of a long period of negotiation and ultimate agreement and became known both to the Government of the day and to the staff organisations as the cost-of-living bonus agreement. Under that agreement, the British Government of the day bound itself to respect its terms and the staff organisations, on the other hand, bound themselves likewise.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the bonus agreement provided for an adjustment of the wages of the staff in the Civil Service and in all branches of the Civil Service, in accordance with fluctuations in the cost-of-living index figure.  The main grievance of the staff in regard to it was that, whatever its advantages in respect of those with fairly good basic salaries, it had a very obvious and easily recognisable defect inasmuch as it was made applicable to the lower grades of the Civil Services who had low basic rates of wages.</P>
      <P>From 1920 to 1940 that agreement was loyally honoured by the staff. They respected their word; they respected and honoured the agreement, notwithstanding the fact that during that period they suffered constant reductions in wages as a result of its operation, these reductions being inflicted by the Government because of their contention that the cost-of-living index figure had fallen to a degree that would justify wage reductions under the terms of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many and bitter were the sufferings <Col N="2143" /> of the staff by reason of the constant wage reductions imposed upon them. In order to get a picture of the extent of the losses which they sustained because of the fact that they honoured the bonus agreement, it is only necessary, perhaps, to quote one instance to this House.  An officer who, under the bonus agreement, in March, 1921, had a consolidated wage, that is, a basic wage to which the cost of living figure applied, of £4 12s. 9d., had that wage reduced to £2 12s. 6d., in July, 1933&mdash; a loss of £2 0s. 3d. per week in a period of 12 years, under the normal operation of the cost-of-living bonus agreement.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister, and I think I can challenge contradiction, that no other grade of worker, in private industry or in the municipal service, suffered such severe reductions in wages during that period.  In all the years, from 1920 to 1940, the British Government, this Government and the previous Government acted the classical role of Shylock; they claimed and got their pound of flesh under the cost-of-living bonus agreement, in the form of wage reductions, even when they must have been convinced that the imposition of wage reductions, particularly on lower-paid personnel, meant a debasement of their standard of living and an improverishment of many persons working in the State service.</P>
    <P>In 1931, when the extent and intensity of these reductions were inflicting very great hardship on the lowly-paid staff in the Post Office, an effort was made to secure an easement of the burdens and on that occasion the Fianna Fáil Party, then in opposition, was approached.  The merits of the case were explained to the Party and no less a person than Deputy MacEntee, first Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government, was so convinced of the justice of the claim of the lower-paid grades that he elected to champion their cause in this House and to plead here for an easement of the burdens which he then recognised were inherent in the rigid application of the cost-of-living bonus agreement.  It might be well at this stage to quote, for the edification of <Col N="2144" /> the present Minister, some of the views of his predecessor in connection with the rigid application of the cost-of-living bonus agreement to the basic wages of lowly-paid civil servants. Speaking in this House in June, 1931, the former Minister for Finance, then Deputy MacEntee, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To me, looking at the rates of pay which some of the smaller civil servants have, it is a constant wonder how they are able to maintain the appearance they do.  I can only assume that they do it by spending upon clothes what might be much better spent on food.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later in the same speech, the Deputy continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not surprised that such discontent should exist, particularly among the lower grades, because they see an entirely unfair standard has been adopted to determine what is going to be their remuneration from quarter to quarter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the viewpoint of the first Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government.  But, of course, like many of the other utterances of that great man, it was quickly forgotten when the mantle of responsibility was adventitiously thrust upon him in 1932.  But, even if we do not put the same value now on the views which Deputy MacEntee then expressed, we can go to higher fonts of authority in order to ascertain the extent to which at that time even the present Government believed it was desirable that, so far as the lower grades of the Civil Service were concerned, they should be treated fairly and honourably.</P>
    <P>In 1932 the Taoiseach issued what became known as the Fianna Fáil election manifesto of that year.  This is what the Taoiseach then said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We do not propose to seek economies by restricting the social services or by cutting the salaries of the middle and lower grades of the Civil Service.  The salaries are in most cases barely sufficient to meet the cost of the maintenance of a home and the support and education of children.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach issued that manifesto in 1932, the cost-of-living index <Col N="2145" /> figure was operating normally.  Whatever were the defects in the agreement, at least, the staff were getting what they undertook to agree to in 1920 and, if the salaries of the middle and the lower grades of the Civil Service were barely sufficient to meet the cost of the maintenance of a home and the support and education of children, when the agreement was operating normally in 1932, surely the position is very much worse to-day when the bonus machinery is not operating normally and when the Government, having exacted all the benefits to which it claimed to be entitled under the agreement, has now declined to recognise that there are obligations on the Government to respect the agreement even when it does not happen to be as advantageous to them as it had been.</P>
    <P>In order to show that that was not merely an incidental statement by the Taoiseach, we had a subsequent Fianna Fáil election manifesto in 1933. These were the days when Fianna Fáil believed that civil servants' votes were important.  This was the 1933 declaration:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our promise not to cut the middle and lower salaries of the Civil Service still remains good. This does not, of course, refer to the change in the cost-of-living bonus which is automatic in its operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that in 1933, having promised in 1932, not to cut the salaries of the middle and lower grades, the Taoiseach re-affirmed his 1932 declaration and added that, so far as the cost-of-living bonus agreement was concerned, it was automatic in its operation and, impliedly, he had no intention whatever of interfering with the agreement.</P>
    <P>In 1933, about the time that the Fianna Fáil manifesto of that year was issued, there was considerable agitation in the Civil Service to endeavour to secure an easement of the cuts in the cost-of-living bonus which were then threatened because of a continued fall in the cost-of-living index figure, a fall which was not reflected in the price of commodities and a fall which, whatever may have been its <Col N="2146" /> theoretical effect, at least in its practical operation did not make it possible for the lowly-paid civil servants to adjust themselves to the altered index figure.  At that time the Taoiseach was appealed to and was asked to intervene with the then Minister for Finance in order to ensure that, whatever the operations of the bonus agreement were, they should not be relied upon to such an extent as to impose hardship and actual suffering on the lowly paid grades in the Post Office, grades that were particularly badly remunerated and in respect of whom the burden of the cuts in wages was heaviest.  The Taoiseach at that time told us that the cost-of-living bonus agreement was a sacrosanct document, that it could not be interfered with, that it was something the Government inherited and something the Government intended to apply, and that, if there were any defects calling for a remedy, the remedy for the defects lay in adjusting the basic wages and salaries and not in a revision of the cost-of-living bonus agreement or in the abolition of that agreement.  So convinced was the Taoiseach on that occasion that he went down to Ennis in January, 1933, and, according to the <i>Irish Press</i> of 9th January, 1933, the Taoiseach delivered himself of these views.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was at present a commission sitting to inquire into the conditions of the Civil Service, and its report was expected very soon.  The Government have nothing to do with the cost-of-living bonus.  It had been in operation before they came in.  We promise that when the report is issued we will reconsider the bargain between the British Government and the civil servants.  I never spoke of that at the last election.  I was speaking of a reduction of big salaries, and I promised at the last election that when we begin to deal with salaries in the Civil Service we are not going to cut the lower salaries.  We are going to keep our word when we get the commission's reports.  In my opinion it would be a bad thing for Labour to agree to getting rid of that sliding scale.  I am as certain as I am standing here that world prices are going to go up, and the <Col N="2147" /> cost of living will go up; and when prices do go up, it is a great boon to the civil servants to know that salaries will go up to meet the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These were definite, positive, and unequivocal declarations by the Taoiseach that he regarded the cost-of-living bonus as something by which the Government was bound, as something which was an honourable agreement between both sides, as something that it was bad to get rid of, and, even more so, as a covenant with the civil servants, and, so far as he and his Government were concerned, they were not going to scrap that agreement because they recognised that it was a document to which two groups were parties.</P>
    <P>From 1933 to 1940, realising that the Government regarded the cost-of-living bonus agreement as something sacrosanct and as something which could not be and would not be interfered with, the Post Office staff endeavoured to have a remedy applied by making claims for increases in the low basic wages so as to offset in some measures the reductions which were inflicted on them by the operation of the cost-of-living bonus agreement.  It was not an easy job to convince the Post Office authorities even to examine the matter of a claim for an increase in wages.</P>
    <P>But the present Minister for Defence, when he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in 1939, admitted to a deputation which waited upon him that he was impressed with aspects of the claim for increased wages and undertook to examine the matter sympathetically. The whole atmosphere surrounding the discussion with the Minister on that occasion and the Minister's very obvious words indicating his sympathy with the claim led the staff to believe that at least the Minister was going to recognise frankly that his staff were underpaid and that he was going to improve the notoriously low scales which were in operation in the Post Office.  But, much to the surprise of the staff, the emergency was utilised as an excuse for not pursuing the matter further.  Subsequently the staff, through its union, <Col N="2148" /> was told that, in view of the emergency, the Minister could not see his way to grant any increase at that time in the basic wages of the staff.</P>
    <P>That position was bad enough, but in the following year, in June, 1940, the Minister for Finance announced that he had decided to stabilise the application of the cost-of-living bonus on the basis of an index figure of 85, the base being 0, and that he proposed to apply that stabilisation as from July, 1940. When that stabilisation was applied, the cost-of-living index figure was not 85; it was 105.  So that, by applying stabilisation on the basis of an index figure of 85, the Minister was very definitely cheating the staff of a bonus award to which they were entitled on the basis of the normal application of the cost-of-living bonus agreement as from July, 1940.  The immediate effect of the stabilisation of the bonus at the time was that an officer in receipt of, say, the low basic wage of 35/- was denied an increase of 7/- per week which he ought to have got under the normal operation of the bonus agreement. By the Government's unilateral repudiation of the agreement, that officer was denied the increase of 7/- per week to which at that time he had a moral and legal right under the operation of the agreement.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the pages of our recent history contain an act by a Government so mean and dishonourable as the stabilisation of the cost-of-living bonus by this Government. The Government knew that it was bound by the agreement.  No less a person than the Taoiseach himself declared his complete faith in the agreement, and his determination to honour it.  Yet, in 1940, after this Government and its predecessors had exacted, under the agreement, every wage-cut which they claimed to be entitled to make, we discover in July, 1940, the Government stabilising the cost-of-living bonus at a time when it felt that the staffs concerned would get some slight advantage under the agreement because of the fact that the Government was unable to control the upward movement of prices.  It seems to me that the repudiation of agreements of that kind&mdash;agreements freely <Col N="2149" /> and voluntarily entered into between the two parties concerned&mdash;shows very little conception of honour and fair play, and I think that it is a very serious reflection on our Administration here that a Government, having exacted all the benefits that it could for itself for a period of about 20 years, under an agreement, should then repudiate that agreement.  That is a type of conduct which, I think, does not enhance the reputation of this State.  At any rate, it certainly does not tend to inspire respect for agreements or respect for those who so light-heartedly tear up these agreements.</P>
    <P>I think it was in November, 1939, that this Government announced, rather heroically, that it was going to set its face against anybody getting any advantage from the war situation; but when, by implication, it was indicated by the Government that if it was going to control wages on the one hand it would also control prices on the other hand it was generally thought that that declaration by the Government meant that if wages were to be pegged down to certain levels, prices would also be maintained at approximately such levels as would maintain the relative stability of wages as a purchasing medium.  But what has happened since then?  Since the cost-of-living bonus agreement was stabilised on the basis of an index figure of 85, the cost-of-living index figure has risen to 184&mdash;a rise of 99 points since the bonus was stabilised, in July, 1940: a clear indication of the helplessness or the unwillingness of the Government to control prices on the one hand, whilst being wickedly efficient in controlling wages on the other hand.  If the Government could or would control prices, one might understand their contention that wages ought to be controlled.  I do not say that one needs to agree with their contention in that respect, but one might at least understand the philosophy which it postulated.  What can one think, however, of a Government which, stabilising wages on the one hand, refuses, on the other hand, to take the necessary steps to control prices so as to maintain the relative stability of the pre-war purchasing power of wages?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2150" /> Prices have risen very rapidly.  The present wages index figure is 184 as compared with 73 in September, 1939, and the fact is that the purchasing power of wages paid to a worker, whether he is employed by the Post Office or engaged in private industry, has shrunk so low that such a worker is completely unable to maintain anything like his pre-war standard of living or the pre-war purchasing power of his wages.  In the Post Office, in response to sustained demands by the Post Office staff, trifling increases&mdash; described as an emergency bonus&mdash;were granted as from June of last year. The maximum increase granted was as low as 3/6 per week.  Some of the increases varied from 2d. to 6d. per week. Now, I do not purport to be able to plumb the mentality of people who can maintain, in 1942, that an increase of from 2d. to 6d. per week will compenstate a man for the shrinkage in the purchasing power of his wages as between 1939 and 1942; but if there are any such financial and economic wizards in the Government, or in any Government Department, who can discover that an increase of 2d. or 6d. per week, or even 3/6 a week, will adjust the shrunken purchasing power of wages in 1942, as compared with 1939, then I should say that that person is a national benefactor; that his discoveries should be published at once, and that he ought to be permitted to give to suffering humanity, in this one respect, the benefit of his advice as to how to adjust present low wages conditions to the rise in prices that has occurred.</P>
    <P>I think that the most cynical and ironical comment that could be made in connection with the present situation would be with regard to the decision of the Minister for Finance not to permit any part-time single officer to participate in that increase. Some such officers in the Post Office, in many cases, would be paid less than £1 per week.  Some of them might have £1 per week; some might have 25/- a week, and some of them might have 30/- per week.  Although these people are single, they may have to maintain aged parents, or younger brothers and sisters, or invalid brothers or sisters. <Col N="2151" /> Yet the Minister for Finance decided on that occasion that because such people would not, or could not, marry on their low wage of £1 per week they would not get any increase at all. Evidently, from the point of view of the Minister, the best way to get such people to marry is to squeeze them by giving them no increase in salary, in the expectation, apparently, that they will be consumed immediately with a passion to enter into the state of matrimony so as to get the increase in their wages.</P>
    <P>Now, I think that anybody can hardly imagine a person with a wage of £1 a week contemplating matrimony, but evidently the Department of Finance lives so far away from the normal feeling of men and women that it expects that people should be willing and eager to marry on £1 per week and that, because such people either would not or could not marry on that miserable pittance, then they should be deprived of the bonus increase.</P>
    <P>Since last year&mdash;indeed, since July, 1940&mdash;the bonus increase has now been lifted to a maximum of 7/-.  Only full-time married officers can get that increase, and it includes the bonus awarded last year.  If a full-time officer is unmarried, he can only get a bonus increase of 5/-, and if he happens to be an unmarried part-time officer, he can only get an increase of 3/- per week.  Can anybody imagine this petty increase providing anything like adequate compensation for the shrunken purchasing power of the low wages of the Post Office staff in present circumstances?  Can anybody imagine that it is equity or even approaching fair play to offer these petty increases to a staff which, by definite agreement, was assured that its wage standards would be regulated according to a rise or fall in the cost-of-living index figure?  I shall now give the petty amounts offered to the staff in compensation for what they have lost&mdash;and just look at what they have lost! An officer in the Post Office, with a basic wage of 20/- per week&mdash;and, Heaven knows, that wage is low enough&mdash;is losing to-day, under the Government stabilisation proposal, <Col N="2152" /> and even with the Government giving credit for the emergency bonus increase-10/- per week.  If his basic wage amounts to 30/- per week, he is losing 18/6 per week; if it amounts to 40/- per week, he is losing 24/9 a week. If the basic wage amounts to 50/- per week, he is losing 28/8 per week; if it amounts to 60/-per week, he is losing 32/6 per week; and if his basic wage amounts to 70/- per week, he is losing no less than 36/8 per week.</P>
    <P>One has only to reflect for a few moments on these figures, and to remember that these are not annual or monthly losses, but weekly losses, to realise the unjust and unfair manner in which the lowly-paid staff of the Post Office have been treated under the Government stabilisation proposals.  I put it to the Minister that he can easily confirm the truth of my assertion that there are in the Post Office large numbers of lowly-paid officers whose basic wage or whose combined wage is utterly insufficient to enable them to bear the heavy burdens which are imposed by the substantial cuts in salaries and wages made operative under the stabilisation proposals.  I tell the Minister, I tell the public, that there are in the Post Office Department to-day many hundreds of young married officers who are absolutely in debt and who, in that state of financial impoverishment, are yet required to handle millions of pounds of the community's property each month and each year.  They work at all hours of the day and night in order to serve the community, and I think it will not be gainsaid that they serve the community faithfully, efficiently and courteously. They perform onerous and responsible duties, and I think it will be admitted on all hands, having regard to their difficult task and to the regulations which enshroud them, that they discharge these duties in a manner which from time to time calls for, and begets, the admiration of the public they serve.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the history of Post Office wages is a history of low wages and wretched incremental conditions. It may astonish the Minister to know that, low and all as are the basic maxima rates in the Post Office, it <Col N="2153" /> takes officers from 14 to 22 years to reach these low maxima.  It would be difficult to discover in any other employment in this State a scheme of wage rates, based upon putting such impediments in an officer's way of reaching the maxima as have been devised in the calculation of Post Office wage scales.  One would imagine that at this stage in our history it would not take an officer, for instance, 17 years to reach a basic wage of approximately 48/- to 50/-.  That is the position in the Post Office, and because of that position, young officers are suffering from severe privations, owing to their low wages at all times and the low basic maxima which they attain only after service varying from 14 to 22 years.  I know from my own experience that young married Post Office officials, with heavy rents to pay, with heavy domestic responsibilities, are carrying the community's property, running into thousands of pounds, while they are beset with the almost impossible task of making ends meet.</P>
    <P>While they are carrying thousands of pounds belonging to the community, they are wondering how they are going to pay the rent next week, to pay the grocer, to pay the milkman or to buy clothes and shoes for those dependent upon them.  I put it to the Minister that these facts, which can easily be confirmed if he wants evidence, disclose a situation, so far as wages in the Post Office are concerned, which calls for an immediate remedy.  I know of no financial situation here which would justify the imposition of these hardships on the lowly paid staff of the Post Office.  I put it to the Minister that he cannot justify them either on financial or economic grounds and that he dare not try to justify them on social grounds.</P>
    <P>I speak here on this matter of the stabilisation of the cost-of-living bonus and the hardships which it has imposed for the lowly paid staff of the Post Office and of the Civil Service generally, in other words, for those entering the State service who are in roughly the same category as workers in private employment.  I want to appeal to the Minister to give these people a fair deal and a square deal. <Col N="2154" /> They are entitled to nothing less.  We put in our Constitution Article 45 which declares:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing that the citizens (all of whom, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood) may through their occupations find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that is not just all &ldquo;cod&rdquo;, and if it was not put in there just to deceive and ensnare people, the least the Government ought to do is to honour that Article and to observe it in respect of its own employees.  To tell us that the State's policy shall be directed towards securing that citizens may through their occupations find a means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs, while paying officers in the Post Office rates of wages that deny them an opportunity of meeting legitimate demands for groceries, clothing and other household necessities, unless they pawn their property, is a sheer mockery.  The Minister for Finance, in the last resort, is the employer of civil servants.  He has a moral responsibility for their well-being and for the payment of wages.  I put it to the Minister that he must realise in his conscience that he is bound in duty to honour and discharge that responsibility by paying fair rates of wages and by recognising the necessity for decent conditions for those whom he employs.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by asking the Minister to examine personally and sympathetically the unfair way in which lowly Post Office employees are being treated under the operation of the stabilisation of bonus regulations. If he does examine the case fairly and sympathetically, I feel he must be convinced that, so far as these grades are concerned, there is an undeniable case, an unanswerable case, for improving their wages because the present wages are not sufficient to enable them to discharge their citizen and domestic responsibilities and are certainly not sufficient remuneration for the onerous, faithful and efficient services which they render to this community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin has informed the House that in looking up recent returns of investments made in Great Britain he has discovered that associated banks in this country have invested in Great Britain a sum of approximately £161,000,000.  He pointed out that that sum has grown in the last four years by something over £50,000,000.  He went on to state that some of the moneys are invested at rates as low as 17/6 and that the rate operating over the aggregate sum of £161,000,000 is under 2 per cent.  He suggested, more by innuendo than otherwise, that it was the policy of the banking institutions here to invest money abroad at the present time.  I have no interest in, nor brief for, the banking institutions, but it may be of interest to see if the Minister can give us any information on this matter.  Can he say what portion of the increased amount of money invested in external assets is due to the export of goods in the form of live stock and other commodities exported from this country? Our assets have appreciated, as our exports are greater than our imports&mdash; we are sending out more goods at present than we are importing.  As a result, there has been over a period of years an appreciation of our assets.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister also say what portion, if any, is due to direct investment at those low rates of interest?  It has puzzled a great many people and appears to have puzzled some Deputies in the past.  I remember that, in the debate on the Central Bank Bill, many Deputies pointed out that moneys were invested by banking institutions abroad at very low rates of interest, while at the same time high rates were being charged at home.  It appears to me that they do so in order to strike a fair balance, what they consider a fair profit, if they have to accept a low rate of interest abroad.  Those investments are not due to the banks but to our own commercial activity.  I do not know what effort the Government has made to secure imports in exchange. If the banking institutions have to accept a very low rate of interest for moneys invested outside, it appears that, in order to strike what they call a fair profit, the rate at home is proportionately higher.</P>

      <P>On the question of post-war planning, I agree with Deputy Davin that the cost of building and reconstruction will be very seriously affected by the high cost of money.  For building activities and other such purposes, money lent by the Government and by Government institutions is certainly very dear, and that is possibly due to the fact that the rates paid for Government loans are high.  In the event of any loan being floated by the Government in the near future, I wonder if the Minister would be prepared to take the other Parties in the House into his confidence in discussing the rate of interest?  It should be the concern of every Party in the House to try to have the rates on loans for State purposes reduced to the lowest possible rate at which money can be borrowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of old age pensions, I would like to refer to the means test. I am sure every Deputy is experiencing complaints at the present time on that point.  There appears to be very high valuation in the case of poor people&mdash; especially small farmers and labourers &mdash;of any little industry they may have, such as poultry or a cow or a couple of calves.  In my opinion, the valuation assessed on an income of that sort is far too high, and is unfair and unreasonable. I believe that the director of old age pensions would be sympathetic on this matter, but the law is there <Col N="2158" /> and he is bound by it.  A pension at the rate of 10/- per week is already low at present without trying to cut it any lower, and there are far too many pensions granted at a rate below the full amount.  I hope that the Minister will look into that matter and deal with it sympathetically.</P>
    <P>On Vote 8, I would ask the Minister the amount of draw-back paid on bounty on sugar made from homegrown beet.  It is £600 this year, and last year it was as high as £26,000. Would the Minister say if that is entirely or mainly paid on condensed milk exports, and why there is such a substantial reduction during the present year?  Does it mean that this is another commodity which we were exporting in substantial quantities in the past and which now is almost disappearing? Would he say what amount of sugar is involved, and the total quantity and value of the goods exported? I am not criticising the policy of paying a draw-back to firms who have been exporting goods under this heading, but I regret the fact that our trade in that regard has fallen.</P>

      <P>I listened with great sympathy to Deputy Norton's plea on behalf of the lower-paid members of the Post Office staff.  I think that the sufferings of people who have fixed incomes on a very low scale are very severe.  I am more familiar, of course, with the case of the agricultural labourer who has 36/- a week.  I am bound to say that, again and again, I stand in open-eyed amazement when I see a man with five children and with 36/- a week living.  I do not know how he does it.  I do not know of any statistician or social worker who can explain to me how a farm labourer with 36/- a week, with the prices of things as they are, is able to keep living and to maintain five or six children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to become too avuncular in the case of my neighbours. I am not in the habit, when I visit my friends, of asking how they live.  I accept whatever hospitality I get.  Nor should I like my friends to ask how I provide any hospitality I may afford them.  But I remain in silent astonishment in the presence of people suffering under these appalling circumstances.  My familiarity with the sufferings of the agricultural labourer makes me peculiarly sympathetic with the case Deputy Norton is making for the Post Office employee who, in some cases, is living on remuneration commensurate with that of the agricultural worker.  While I feel that sympathy and feel it very genuinely, I find myself confronted with a problem which, I have no doubt, is present to the mind of the Minister for Finance.  I do not think that there is any escape from this equation: if we want to preserve the purchasing power of the citizens at the same level as obtained pre-war, by providing them with a cost-of-living bonus on their basic wage proportionate to the rise in the cost of living, are we not confronted with this situation&mdash;that a purchasing power in the community equal to that of pre-war, with a diminishing amount of supplies, means inflation, which means higher prices for whatever supplies are available. These higher prices will weigh most heavily on those who have the smallest resources.  I agree that if you had as comprehensive a system of rationing as obtain in England, you could meet that position by providing for every citizen a limited supply of goods at fixed prices and insisting that every citizen, rich and poor, get that supply every week.  But we have not that in this country.  The system of rationing here is extremely lax.  It relates only to a very limited number of commodities and, if the purchasing <Col N="2161" /> power of the community is the same as it was pre-war, the price of everything not strictly rationed and controlled will go sky-high.</P>
      <P>We have experience of people who are entitled to rations under the existing rationing scheme finding themselves unable to get them because the demand in the black market is sufficient to induce dishonest traders to put them into that market instead of selling them to the people entitled to them.  I feel that, if we are to continue the struggle to prevent inflation much longer, we shall have to institute a much stricter form of rationing.  I have no doubt that the Minister for Finance is having his mind directed to this situation.  While he and I may be in substantial agreement as to the fundamental purpose of the policy the Minister is employing to avoid uncontrolled inflation, no economic argument will reconcile our people to seeing children obliged to go to school in Dublin barefooted because their people are unable to purchase shoes for them.  I do not think I exaggerate when I say that, in some of the poorer districts in Dublin, children are going to school in what are little more than rags and, in a small number of cases, barefooted, because their parents are unable to get boots for them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All this is being done in the sacred cause of avoiding inflation. While I sympathise with the Minister's desire to avoid inflation, I think you have got to take the risk of whatever inflation may attend upon the effort to relieve the circumstances of those in the low wage ranks.  I have taken that view right from the beginning.  If that involves a very much wider system of rationing, then I think we ought to prepare ourselves for that and face it. But I do not believe you can continue the existing system, in which wage restrictions tend to keep people in the lower wage brackets at a level which means that the children must go barefoot because their people cannot afford the shoes.  I think that Ministers, who have the best intentions, Governments, with the best intentions in the world, <Col N="2162" /> who are taking the long view and are apprehensive of the remote consequences of inflation, may become so obsessed with that remote, if certain, danger that they will lose sight of what is right under their eyes, and that is, the rigidity with which they are sticking to their precautionary policy may precipitate, in the present, the very upheaval that they are apprehensive will eventuate if inflation were to get fully under way.  I think prudent foresight is a good thing, but it is a foolish thing not to see the chasm under your feet, you are so anxious to avoid the pitfall on the horizon.</P>
      <P>We must not underestimate the difficulty of the Minister for Finance.  I think, situated as we are in the lee of Great Britain, with millions of pounds pouring in here all the time from our people who work there, and with a steadily diminishing supply of goods coming in, it is fearfully difficult to avoid inflation in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, in fact, the truth is that we are experiencing a very brisk inflation at the present time and it is the refusal to acknowledge that, and to make the necessary adjustments with those earning lower wages, that may precipitate trouble. I know I am going to bring &ldquo;melia murder&rdquo; around my head by stating this, but it requires to be stated, that, so far as national school teachers are concerned, so far as civil servants with three or four hundred pounds a year are concerned, and so far as any other section of the community is concerned, the plain fact is that, unless we are going to pull the whole community round our ears, persons with incomes of that size will have to face the fact that they must experience a certain measure of hardship in the period through which we are passing, and no effective relief can be given them by increasing their remuneration without precipitating a catastrophe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not say what they are receiving is excessive: I do not think it is generous; but there are lots of things we have to bear with at present that we would not expect anyone to bear with in normal times.  I am fully <Col N="2163" /> aware that where you have an unfortunate man struggling to keep up a family, his position is very hard.  He is obsessed with his own personal and family difficulties, and it sounds very hollow in his ears to be talking economics when he is trying to keep his children at school.  Undoubtedly if you try to restrict income at that level, individual cases of hardship will arise which no one would wish to eventuate &mdash;men with peculiarly heavy responsibilities, men in exceptional positions. But, talking generally, I do not think we can escape the conclusion that unless we are going to abandon ourselves to a tornado of inflation, persons in the higher income brackets will have to recognise that they must accept a lower standard of life than they enjoyed before the war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how the Minister will answer Deputy Norton unless he can meet the implications of that.  I know of no argument that he can put up against Deputy Norton, unless it is that the only reason we can withhold from the civil servants the bonus they all got in normal times is that if we give them the bonus the whole thing will blow up and, instead of giving them a benefit, we will do them an evil.  I anticipate that that will be the Minister's reply.</P>
      <P>I am trying to take a middle course. I think he is going too far.  I am saying, in respect of all persons at a fixed income, that his rigid attitude is a mistake. I say that with the persons right down at the bottom there ought to be a recognition that it is right to take a risk now rather than precipitate a revolution.  I know I am speaking to a Minister who is sympathetic and that I am not dealing with a reactionary.  I say quite deliberately that if I were a man in this town with a fixed income and I discovered that the Government policy to avoid inflation required me to take the shoes off my children and send them to school barefoot in the type of weather we experienced for the last two days I would revolute, and I believe if the people did revolute on this ground only, that it wanted the wherewithal to put shoes on their children, nobody in the House would say: &ldquo;Turn out the troops; mow them down.&rdquo; I think Deputies would say: &ldquo;Whatever the remote consequences of meeting that emergency, we are in favour of meeting it and, if there are evil consequences hereafter, when they begin to manifest themselves we will take appropriate measures.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am certain, if we can carry conviction to the Minister's mind that the remote evil will be less disastrous than the present hardship, no one will be more ready than he to alleviate the present hardship.  That is the case I am trying to make.  I do not believe, from any point of view, it is good to let the present situation go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2165" /> Convinced as I am that increasing purchasing power while supplies are diminishing is going to produce inflation, with all its attendant evil results, I do not think that conclusion should debar us from considering whether we might not try to increase production of certain things that we can produce here&mdash;if necessary, borrowing the money wherewith to produce them&mdash;and distribute them, if needs be, free, provided that by doing that we acquire a tangible asset rather than a further accretion of our foreign investments. Suppose we increase the production of milk and alleviate, in some measure, the distress of very lowly paid or unemployed persons in our cities by ensuring that their children should at least have an abundant supply of milk, free if necessary, does the Minister agree with me, provided we could increase the production of milk from our own resources, that it would be a good thing and a sound thing to take such measures as might be necessary to get that increased production, distribute it amongst our own people, and thereby purchase the health and strength for children who would otherwise grow up in some degree crippled or inefficient? I venture to suggest that if we adopted that course we would purchase with currency at present intact the capacity to earn stabilised currency in the future.</P>
    <P>If we continue to pile up external assets through saving on account of the scarcity of materials which prevents consumption, it seems to me that what is going to happen is that we must lend the saving either to Great Britain or to some country outside this, and that, ultimately, when currency is re-constituted after the war, as I believe it must be, our loans at present made will be repaid in the re-constituted currency. Well, now, if all loans of that kind are going to be repaid in devalued post-war currency, might we not as well take advantage of making the repayment in the devalued currency, always provided that we are going to get tangible assets without adding to our existing problems.  There are two tangible assets that I see we could purchase at the present time.  The first is <Col N="2166" /> health for young children growing up to whom that would be denied if poverty constrains their parents to impose malnutrition upon them, and, secondly, the reconditioning of the land.  I am not going to expand that because I think it would be wandering pretty far afield if we were to proceed to examine every question on which we could borrow money.</P>
    <P>I do say that our desire to avoid inflation should be qualified by two restrictions.  The first is that the special problem of the poorer sections of the community should be kept in mind.  The second is that one of the results of the measures requisite to prevent inflation is calculated to produce a large saving.  In our state of affairs, as we are carrying on at present, that saving must go somewhere. It is going to Great Britain because it has nowhere else to go, and it is liable to be repaid in devalued currency.  We might as well take advantage of this devalued repayment, always provided that we are going to purchase with that currency tangible and useful assets at the present time. Albeit I see a revaluation of currency post-war, let nobody in this House fall into the egregious error, which I have heard enunciated from Fianna Fáil Benches, that the external assets which we are accumulating at the present time are of no value.  I have gradually come to regard myself as the Cassandra of this nation.  I am continually warning the House of things that are about to happen, but nobody believes me.  When they do happen, Deputies forget that I had warned them.  I warn them now of this: that after this war the very existence of our nation will depend on our accumulated external assets.  We will pass through the post-war period when nothing but the accumulated savings of our people during the war, invested in.  Great Britain, will enable us to keep afloat.  The existence of that raft on which to float after the post-war seas have settled down, and its storms have abated, will enable us to arrive at a <i>modus vivendi</i> with the rest of the world.  Without these accumulated assets, I think we might be precipitated into an immediate and <Col N="2167" /> desperate disaster.  Therefore, I beg of Deputies to keep a proportionate view of the value of our external assets, to rejoice in their accumulation, and whilst setting a due and proper value on them not to become their slave.  Let us recognise that they are a useful servant to use post-war, and at the same time ensure that they will not be inflated by moneys which might be more profitably used for the purchase of tangible assets of enduring quality within our own community. I am sure the Labour Party will agree that certain hardships will have to be borne by all sections of the community, but I think if you proceed on the lines I have indicated, reasonable provision can be made for those on whom troubles bear most heavily at the present day, while the rest of us can get along as best we can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like very much to see the Minister increasing the weekly amount paid to old age pensioners. At the present time it is very difficult for an old person to support himself or herself on 10/- a week.  I know, of course, it is easy for me to ask the Minister to do this.  I realise that he must take the necessary steps in order to get the money to give the increase.  If the Minister is unable to grant the increase, I think he should at least consider carefully the old age pensioners who belong to the labouring class.  They have to depend exclusively on the old age pension they get from the Government.  They have no other means to pay rent for their houses, to buy milk, butter, potatoes, etc.  They are in worse circumstances than the large number of old age pensioners who have rights reserved to them under deeds of assignment.  I think that, at least, these old age pensioners should be supplied with free milk, potatoes and vegetables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is not in a position to grant these concessions to the old age pensioners, he should, I think, obtain for them the right to have the means rate restored to what it was before it was reduced by the Fine Gael Party: that is to say, they should be entitled to receive the full pension if their <Col N="2168" /> means do not exceed £26 5s. 0d. a year instead of the £15 12s. 6d. as at present. I also consider that the interest charged on money in the bank, or in hands, is too high.  At present the rate is 5 per cent. on the first £400.  I think the interest charge should only be that which the money earns.  It appears to me to be absurd to have a person who has £100 in a bank assessed at 5 per cent. a year, if he only receives 1½ per cent.  I consider that the interest charged on the market value of shares is too high.  I could understand an assessment of 5 per cent. if a share was paying a good dividend, but where no dividend is paid why should an assessment of 5 per cent. be made?  These are two regulations which the Minister might look into.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton put up a very good case on behalf of the Post Office officials.  I wish to call the Minister's attention to the position of auxiliary postmen whose wages vary from 20/- to 30/- weekly, and in some rural districts are only 10/- weekly. These men must be ten years acting as auxiliary postmen before they receive uniforms and are out in all weathers. In view of what it costs to keep a family at the present time, I ask the Minister to give their case favourable consideration.</P>

      <P>Attention has been called by other Deputies to the conditions of postal workers, but I wish to refer to pensioners who left the service in pre-war days and who are now living on very inadequate pensions. Is there any hope that people who were in the service in days gone by, and who retired on what are now inadequate allowances, will get any bonus under any Emergency Order to enable them to meet the increased cost of living?  As the means test in connection with old age pensions has been mentioned, I want to call attention to the attitude adopted by some officers in compiling the value of means.  I know that it is not the desire of the Minister, or indeed of the officials, to prevent these old people getting pensions, but some officials <Col N="2169" /> seem to read the regulations as if it was their duty to give as little as possible to applicants, when really it is the desire of the Minister and of the Department to give poor persons the benefit of the doubt.  I mentioned on a previous occasion the case of a blind pensioner who was told that he had means because he collected pence in the streets.  The case was a sad one. I consider that it is not right to take into account in cases of that kind what people who are begging receive.  That man was paying 5/- a week for a room, and he found it necessary to ask for pence so that he might pay the rent and be able to buy a penny dinner. When he had not a penny he went to the nuns and got a free dinner.  As a result of some misleading information that man was prevented from getting a blind pension.  In that case the Minister stated that the Department was not satisfied as to the extent of the blindness.  The man never got an opportunity of going before a doctor. He was disqualified on the ground that he had means.  It is to be hoped that the Minister will be able to do something in that case or that the applicant will get the opportunity of being examined by a doctor.</P>
      <P>What is to happen poor people between the ages of 65 and 70 years who are not entitled to unemployment benefit or national health insurance? I ask those in charge of the county home to remember that they are not paid to give the least possible aid to the poor but to do everything they can to help them.  They could not expect old people who are getting a grant of a half-crown weekly to exist on that amount at the present time.  I urge that there should be a more generous application of the regulations as far as the means test is concerned.  When the Minister's predecessor was replying to Deputy Hickey on a former occasion he stated that any means or money that was not belonging to a person as a statutory right was not to be taken into consideration in assessing means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Minister is concerned for the welfare of Dublin and its people, and now that he is restored to health, I join with other Deputies in welcoming <Col N="2170" /> him back to the House.  I know that he is ready to accept responsibilitiy, as well as criticism that he sometimes considers unfair, and I ask him to consider the condition of the poorest amongst us, who have to live on national health insurance, widows' and orphans' pensions and old age pensions.  I also direct attention to the horrible conditions that exist in some of the poorer quarters of Dublin, where children are going to school without boots or stockings and with very poor clothing.  I should also like to know if it is the intention to do anything about providing clothing and boots for these children.  I suggested some time ago that it might be possible for the Government to buy up 100,000 clothing outfits for boys and girls and, if necessary, to subsidise such purchases, so that they could be sold to necessitous people at moderate prices on the instalment plan.  To give a suit of clothes at 6d. or 1/- per week to a woman in the working-class quarters of Dublin who has 6, or 8 or 10 children would be a very gracious act on the part of the Government. They are about to do something by way of family allowances, but it is not enough.  Some time ago the Minister anticipated me by saying that we would not be satisfied with that scheme.  I am not satisfied with the allowance mentioned, but I do say that it is a great step in the right direction. I suggest to the Minister that he should take the matter in hands himself and see if anything can be done to provide clothes for the children of the City of Dublin whom we can see going round the streets barefooted and ill-clad, and who are living in tenement houses with broken windows without any blankets to cover them.  I know that the Minister did his best to deal with the housing problem, but the war came along and stopped house building from going ahead.  I appeal to the Minister to see that the women and children of Dublin will be given some relief from the terrible conditions under which they are living to-day.</P>

      <P>I want to add my voice to what has been said in connection with old age pensions.  It has been advocated that there should be an increase <Col N="2171" /> in the old age pensions.  I know that legislation would be necessary to bring that about, but I think this is a good opportunity to request the Minister to do something to relieve the distress among that section of the community.  I want also to refer to the application of the means test. It is very hard to understand how that test is applied in a great many cases. One Deputy spoke about the amount of interest that was taken into consideration when an application for an old age pension comes before a pensions committee.  On an investment of £100, the interest is taken to be 5 per cent., when one knows quite well that the interest is not half of 5 per cent. In many cases, if a man has a goat or some fowl, in applying the means test a certain amount of money is put down against that man as income.  Time and time again this Party has spoken against this means test.  They have referred to certain instances in which men and women have been paying into a superannuation fund in their trade union.  The moment they get beyond their labour, that superannuation allowance is paid to them.  But, when it comes to the time when they are entitled to an old age pension, in consequence of the fact that they are drawing a certain amount of money per week from the superannuation fund, their pension is reduced.  I came across a case recently in my constituency where a man who was out in the 1916 Rising received an I.R.A. pension.  When it came to the time to draw his old age pension, that I.R.A. pension was taken into consideration, and his old age pension was reduced accordingly.  Earlier to-day we were talking about gratitude.  I think that the country does not require the Government to be so ungrateful to men of that kind, who went out in Easter Week and who were prepared to risk their lives in order that the country should obtain its freedom.  As I say, when it comes to a question of giving such a man the old age pension, his I.R.A. pension is taken into consideration in order to prevent him from getting the full pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton spoke at great length on the question of civil servants, <Col N="2172" /> especially Post Office workers. I want to add my voice to what he said.  I cannot understand how the Minister expects to get good service in the different Government Departments, especially in post offices throughout the country, with the miserable wage that is paid to workers, especially the lower paid ones.  Deputy Stapleton instanced the case of auxiliary postmen who are only in receipt of wages ranging from 20/- to 30/- per week.  These men have been prevented by the Stabilisation Order made by the Government in 1940 from getting what might be considered to be a pretty reasonable wage.  I understand that, in consequence of the Stabilisation Order, a man whose basic wage is 20/- per week has been prevented from receiving a further 10/- per week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon talked about the dangers of inflation.  I submit that inflation is here already so far as the working classes are concerned.  Everything which they have to buy has soared rapidly in price, so that so far as they are concerned inflation stares them in the face.  They have been prevented by Government intervention from securing sufficient to enable them to cope with the cost of living, which is soaring rapidly every day. In Great Britain during the last war the cost of living increased by 108 per cent.  In this war, the cost of living in Great Britain has only increased by 29 per cent.  In this country, it has increased by 60 per cent.  Notwithstanding the fact that the cost of living has only increased by 29 per cent. in Britain wages have increased in some cases by 300 or 400 per cent., while wage increases here have been very small.  In consequence of Order 83, two or three years of the war elapsed before anybody was able to get an increase, and the increases given since are not commensurate with the increased cost of living, so that, regardless of what Deputy Dillon has said, we have inflation here already so far as the working classes are concerned.  Inflation is always used as a bogey by Governments and other people when it is a question of providing a worker with the means to live.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2173" /> I should like to refer again to the question of the means test.  It was brought to my notice the other day that, in the railway service, when a man reaches the age of 65 he gets a weekly allowance from the railway company.  When he reaches the age of 70 and is entitled to an old age pension, the railway company either takes his pension away altogether or cuts it down.  That is an example of other employers following Government lead. I suggest to the Minister that a company like the railway company, when a man who has rendered good service has been given a pension, should not be permitted to take away that pension or cut it down in consequence of the fact that the man had reached the age of 70 and was entitled to an old age pension.  It is the headline set by the Government that is responsible for action of that kind.  People who are drawing old age pensions at present are on the verge of starvation, and the country owes more to them than is being paid to them at present.  The means test is being applied in a very mean manner.  I suggest to the Minister that something should be done to remove it and that there should be an increase for those unfortunate people who are entirely dependent for a living on the old age pension.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne has referred to the position of persons who have been in receipt of pensions for some time past, whose rate of pensions was fixed when the cost-of-living was not so high.  Repeatedly, the Leader of this Party, Deputy Norton, has asked that some attention should be paid to these people, that some bonus should be attached to their pensions.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider their case.  These people rendered good and faithful service to the State, as Post Office workers, as teachers or as civil servants of some kind.  I do know that in Egland bonuses have been paid in respect of some pensions.  My attention has been drawn to the fact that a bonus has been added quite recently in respect of naval pensions.  These people rendered faithful service, and the Minister should favourably consider the question of giving a bonus <Col N="2174" /> on top of the small pensions which some of them receive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the appeal made by other members of the House in connection with old age pensioners, I wish to direct the Minister's attention to the position of old age pensioners in rural areas who are not allowed vouchers.  They receive only 10/- a week although they may be only 100 yards outside the boundary of an urban area.  I also wish to draw the Minister's attention to the position of forestry workers.  Forestry workers are engaged on work of national importance. Many of them have to travel nine or ten miles to their work. They have to supply themselves with bicycles.  Their maximum wage is 35/- a week.  I consider that the Minister might have some case if the price of timber were not increased, but that is not the position.  In County Wicklow, the workers who supply timber to the Dublin Corporation are in receipt of pre-war wages, while the Minister's Department is receiving prices much higher than pre-war prices for that timber.  There is no justification whatever for the position by which forestry workers receive less wages than agricultural workers.  The case was brought before the Wages Tribunal by the employees of a sawmill supplying timber to Dublin in competition with the Forestry Department.  The employers' case before that tribunal was that they were not in a position to increase their employees' wages, although they wished to increase them, simply and solely because the Government have sawyers, assistant sawyers and men, at a maximum salary of 37/- a week, while the trade union rate of wages of a sawyer in a mill not two miles away is 50/- per week for a 48 hour week, plus bonus.  They put up the case that the Government had their men working for such a small wage, against trade union regulations and everything else, and did not guarantee a full 48 or 54 hours' week.  The men are stopped for wet days.  The position of the forestry worker in rural areas very often is that he has only three days' pay in a week owing to wet weather.  I ask the Minister <Col N="2175" /> specially to consider the forestry worker.</P>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in the appeal made on behalf of the Post Office workers.  These men have given loyal service to the State.  How can we expect loyal service if we give such small wages?  We have the position in certain areas that although vouchers are given, the recipients cannot get milk for them.  I know an area at the present time where the dairyman refused to accept the voucher in exchange for milk.  That is a serious position for these people, and I want to know what action the Government are taking in connection with it.  The vouchers are there, but the people cannot get the milk unless they buy condensed milk.  The dairyman will supply the milk for cash but not for vouchers.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the matters that have been raised here this evening.  I would ask him specially to consider the cases of the forestry workers.  They have a great grievance, in that they are the lowest paid workers, considering the service they are rendering at the present time.  I have appealed to them many times to leave the forestry work there.  Unfortunately they are in such an economic position that they are unable to get to England and have no alternative but to accept this miserable wage that the Government have decreed must be their lot&mdash;35/- a week.  I have already indicated that, before the Wages Tribunal, mill owners who were prepared to increase the wages, pleaded the small wages paid by the Government to their employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister in reply will give some encouragement to those men to remain at their work by allowing them to have the rates granted to other workers who appeared before the Wages Tribunal who, in support of their claim, put forward the fact of the high cost of living.  I think it is most unfair for the Government to try to get a monopoly by paying small wages when other millers in competition with them have to pay trade union rates of wages, especially in <Col N="2176" /> view of the fact that the Department have increased their charges for the timber which they are selling to the people in the area or to the Dublin Corporation.  I hope that, as a result of the appeal made from all sides of the House to-night, there will be a different outlook on the part of the Government towards men who have suffered silently in the past year or two and that the Minister will do something to improve their condition.</P>

      <P>I take it that I have the permission of the Chair to reply to the variety of subjects which were raised, on the main Vote.  There was a number of subjects raised on the Supplementary Votes that are down to-day for discussion and for which I am responsible.  Deputy Davin raised a number of important issues.  I suggest some of the matters that he raised are not matters for which the Minister for Finance has any responsibility.  As the law stands at present, this House has no responsibility for one or two of the matters which Deputy Davin raised.  May I say, first of all, I thank Deputy Davin for his kindly personal reference?  As the law stands at present, the House has no responsibility for the joint stock banks, for their growing assets, if there are such, or for their liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Or their investments. I know Deputy Davin would like to have the law otherwise.  I know that he would like that we should have complete control of these matters as well as many other matters &mdash;I think I am not wronging him in that&mdash;that he would like that the Minister for Finance should be able to give any directions he pleased to the joint stock banks as well as to many other similar institutions in the country.  But, that is not the law at present and the Minister for Finance does not control the joint stock banks, even those that have their headquarters inside our territory.  He does not control them and he cannot interfere with the manner in which they conduct their business, in other words, how they invest their money, if they <Col N="2177" /> have money to invest, and what rate of interest they get for that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh yes.  The Minister for Finance is seriously interested there.  He is seriously interested in the rates that anybody from whom he is successfully able to borrow money wishes to charge him. He is very seriously interested there; that is true.  But with regard to the banks, having said that I have no responsibility&mdash;and I do not want to be taken as accepting any responsibility&mdash;Deputy Davin asked for some figures and such figures as are available for me at any time, I will be always glad to get them and to give them.  He asked for some figures with regard to sterling assets.  The figures I have got are that in September, 1939, the Irish banks' sterling assets amounted to £117.2 millions, and that their liabilities amounted to £55.8 millions; net assets £61.4 millions.  In September, 1943, the sterling assets were £195.9 millions, and the liabilities, £85.8 millions; net assets, £110.1 millions&mdash;an increase, roughly, of £40 millions.</P>
      <P>Now, as I say, not accepting any responsibility for them, but desirous, if possible, to acquire and give to the House any information that may be available from any sources to me, I am giving these figures to Deputy Davin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Davin's queries as to the activities of the Central Bank, it should be remembered that the bank is not very long in existence. It only came into official existence in February of this year, and, as to its activities, so far as its constitution permitted, they were reported, and the report was laid on the Table of the House.  I do not know whether Deputy Davin saw that report, or if he knew of its existence, but it was laid on the Table of the House in June of this year.  In any case, with regard to the questions asked by Deputy Davin as to the bank's activities, or such activities of the bank as are within its powers, as set out in the Central Bank <Col N="2178" /> Act, particulars will be found in that report, as I have said.  I rather think, however, that Deputy Davin was anxious to know what control, if any, had been exercised by the Central Bank with regard to the rate at which money could be borrowed.  Well, the powers of the Central Bank are limited in that regard&mdash;very limited.  There are certain powers relating to moneys loaned to certain bodies, such as local authorities and others, and the bank has powers to fix the rate of rediscount with regard to moneys borrowed in certain ways, but these are the only powers that the bank has, to control costs of loans and, so far as I know, an opportunity has not yet been offered to the bank to exercise those powers.</P>
    <P>With regard to fixing a rate of rediscount, there is a means there of influencing the value of money, and the rate at which it can be borrowed, but up to the present the bank has not been called upon to exercise the powers conferred on it by that section of the Act.  So far as my knowledge goes, the bank has not been called upon, so far, to perform its functions in that regard.  Accordingly, it may be said that, up to the present, the bank has not exercised, even so far as the legal power given to it is concerned, the influence that, perhaps, Deputy Davin might desire with regard to the question of cost of money.</P>

      <P>That may be Deputy Davin's view, but it might or might not be wise to let the bank have that power.  When the Bill was going through this House, the Dáil could <Col N="2179" /> have given that power to the bank, but evidently it did not think it proper to do so.  Deputy Davin also asked about the possibility of the introduction of a Supplementary or Emergency Budget during the present year.  There is no likelihood of it. There will be a Budget, please God, next May, but I do not see any likelihood of any Supplementary or Emergency Budget being brought in before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton gave us, at considerable length, the history of the cost-of-living bonus.  With its earlier history, of course, this House is not concerned. This State took over the system that existed in 1922, and that system remained in operation. Deputy Norton told us that the cost-of-living system worked up and down until some time after the outbreak of this war, when our Government decided, or when the Minister for Finance announced that the cost-of-living bonus figure was to be stabilised. That, in Deputy Norton's view, and in the view of others, as also, perhaps, in the view of some of those who were hit in their pockets by the stabilisation of the cost-of-living bonus, may have been a very wrong and unjust thing, but that decision was taken with full knowledge of the charges that might be levelled against the Government, and against the Minister for Finance as the mouthpiece of the Government: as to whether, for instance, it was proper and just to deprive the civil servants of the benefits that would accrue to them by allowing their salaries and wages to go up in accordance with the various rises&mdash;steep rises, admittedly&mdash; that have taken place in the cost of living since, and even before, the stabilisation in the cost of living came into being.  The sole purpose of the Government was to endeavour to control inflation: to endeavour to see to it that, particularly, the least well-off people of the community should be saved from&mdash;I think I can use the word &mdash;the horrors of grave inflation, as experienced not so long ago in many countries in Europe where inflation was allowed to run without control.  I think it is admitted everywhere, by <Col N="2180" /> anybody who has taken any serious interest in the matter, that if inflation were allowed to develop without control, and to any serious extent, in this country, the very first people who would be hit, and hard hit, would be the poor.</P>
    <P>The rich can look after themselves, but if inflation is allowed to get control of the currency machinery in the country, then the people who would be the first to suffer and suffer most severely&mdash;and there would be practically no remedy for their suffering&mdash; would be the poor and the lowly-paid people.  What the Government did in stabilising wages at a certain cost-of-living figure was intended as an endeavour to safeguard the position for the poor and the least well-paid people in the community as a whole, including civil servants.</P>
    <P>I admit that inflation to some extent does exist; it would be foolish not to admit it because it is obvious.  We are in a very difficult and complex situation, surrounded as we are by a world at war.  We are in particular relation to one country at war where money is no object, naturally, because the country is fighting for its life. Many of our workers, owing to the scarcity of raw materials in this country, have had to go there to look for a living.  They are offered big wages, increasing rapidly ever since the war started.  Much of the money accruing to Irish workers is sent over here and that causes a certain amount of inflation.  Here, on the contrary, on account of our special position, we have a very difficult situation.  The quantity of materials is growing less and less and it is becoming daily still more difficult to keep those who are working in continuous employment. Even when wages are increased, as they have been increased in many cases in this country, we know that it means, and must mean on account of our situation, that the tendency because of the increased amount of money put into circulation, is to increase still further the cost of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the opposite to that, then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2181" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position and Deputy Norton cannot deny it.  Wages have been increased, perhaps not sufficiently to satisfy some of the Labour Deputies, but there have been considerable increases given to workers in industry, to various classes of workers outside, and to some extent to our own workers &mdash;a modest increase, it is admitted&mdash; but even with those increases, though some may say they are inadequate, many of the people who got them are no better off.  They cannot buy shoes because the shoes are not there.  We experience difficulties in getting raw materials to manufacture shoes and clothes.  The same thing applies in England where the wages are very much higher.  The people there are restricted in what they can buy.  They get liberal wages and one reason, probably, why so much money is coming over here from Irish workers in England is that they can find no use for it there.  They can get only limited quantities of cigarettes and tobacco to buy.  Even in the case of beer, though I believe it is in greater supply proportionately than tobacco, people have to stand in queues in bars in England, where the money is so free and plentiful, in order to get what they regard as a sufficiency of that liquor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is our position in regard to the introduction of the cost of living stabilisation Order.  Deputy Norton may say that it has not worked and ask why not let these people have the full benefit of the increased cost of living.  If everybody were to have full compensation for the increased cost of living as compared with 1939, and if we were still faced with an insufficiency of supplies of various commodities that are generally regarded as necessary, some even as essential, to life, taking it all round, the people who got these increases would not be one whit better off and might be much worse off.  You would have started then on the high road to inflation, and if we started on that road it could end only in something like the position about which I am sure most Deputies have read if they have not had personal experience of it, that arose in some countries on the Continent after the last war. Nobody wants to see that condition of <Col N="2182" /> affairs brought about in this country, Deputy Norton I am sure least of all, but there is no other prospect before us if we with our eyes open allow ourselves to be forced to permit the free inflation of the currency here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>You can prevent it to a limited extent, and we have done so.  We have held our position fairly well.  As Deputy Dillon said here to-day, there are some things you can do and some things you cannot do even with regard to inflation.  We have held the position here fairly well, and if one considers what might have happened, how many people might be not only without shoes and clothes but without food of any kind to keep them alive, one must recognise that on the whole the country has not fared badly.  Individuals here and there may have suffered, and civil servants, of whom Deputy Norton spoke so eloquently here to-day, may have suffered more than others but, on the whole, this country, considering that we were situated in a most difficult position, financially and economically, has come through a very difficult situation in most troublesome times remarkably well, and with very little cause of complaint on any side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wages of workers in the Post Office of which Deputy Norton spoke, may in relation to present circumstances be lower than they were in 1939 and it may be harder for these people to face up to the difficulties of the times.  The wages in the Post Office service have always been low for certain classes of workers, but even these workers have some advantages that are not open to the ordinary worker in outside employment.  That fact has to be taken into account.  Deputy Norton asked to-day, as he frequently asked before: &ldquo;Why does not the Government control prices; if they attempted to control prices the situation might not be so bad as it is?&rdquo; The Government has attempted, with striking success, to control prices.  It has not put up anybody against the wall and shot <Col N="2183" /> him for black marketing, as has happened in countries in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Short of that extreme course, the Government has tried hard to control prices.  Even in countries where people have been shot, they have not succeeded in wiping out the black markets.  I do not think that this House would approve a law giving power to a Government to take life for such an offence but, even if it did, it would not stop attempts at black marketing and it would not help you to control prices.  Admittedly, prices are high.  The cost of materials of all kinds is high.  But there is a war on and the scarcity here is as great as, if not greater than, it is in any neutral country of which I know.  We have come through the war period with remarkable success for all sections of the community.  The poor, as well as those not so poor, know that.  We have spent some millions in addition to what was spent pre-war in an effort to meet the position of the poor and to enable them to live through these difficult and dangerous times.  I do not say that it will not be necessary for the Government to do more.  The Government has always the difficulties of the poor, particularly, in mind.  That is very close to its heart and it has acted accordingly. Reasonable men who calmly sit down and examine what has been done by the Government in an effort to meet the situation, so far as the Civil Service and the rest of the community are concerned, must agree that the situation has been fairly met up to the present. While many have suffered and many have had to live with less of the <Col N="2184" /> goods they thought necessary for life in days gone by, anybody considering the situation calmly must admit that it compares favourably with that of any other country, not at war, in Europe, without going further.</P>

    <P>D'iarr an Teachta O Briain orm an rabhas sásta leis an gcaoi ina gcaitheann Coláiste na hOllscoile an méid airgid a gheibheas sí on Dáil ar mhaitheas na Gaedhilge.  B'fhearr an cheist sin do chur ar an Aire Oideachais ach, ós rud é gur chuir an Teachta an cheist orm-sa, caithfe mé a rá nach bhfuilim sásta.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil éinne a bhfuil a chroidhe san Ghaedhilg sásta le staid na Gaedhilge sa Choláiste sin.  Ach ní féidir linn, san Tigh seo, cur isteach ar obair na hOllscoile.  Tá Coláiste Ollscoile Áth Cliath agus an dá Choláiste eile saor. Iarrann lucht na hOllscoile orainn suim airgid a thabhairt dóibh agus gheibheann siad méid áirithe i gcóir na bliana.  Ach tá an Ollscoil saor an t airgead do chaitheamh mar is rogha léi féin.  Ní féidir leis an Tigh seo ceist do chur ar lucht na hOllscoile i dtaobh conus a caithtear an t-airgead. Ach do chuir an Teachta Ó Briain ceist orm agus táim á freagairt agus ag tabhairt mo thuairime fhéin dó. B'fheidir go mbeadh seans eile againn an cheist seo do phlé.  Tá roinnt airgid sa mbréis á iarradh orainn agus ni féidir an t-airgead san do thabhairt gan <Col N="2185" /> údarás ón Dáil.

Tá údarás agam na rialacha do scrúdú. Má tá cléirigh a teastáil ón mBord, is éigin scrúdú oscailte do bheith ann agus, imease na n-abhar scrúduithe, caithfidh an Ghaedhilg do bheith ann.

    <P>Amongst the subjects that were raised often by Deputies on this Vote is the question of old age pensions. Some Deputies appealed for an increase in the amount of the pension, and others asked for improvements with regard to the administration of the Old Age Pensions Acts that would be of benefit to pensioners.  I would like to say that the old age pensions bill at present is a very heavy one, over £3,750,000, and is increasing.  The number of old age pensioners is increasing. I suppose the Minister for Finance should not be thankful for that, but I do not object to it.  In proportion to our population, we have a larger number of old age pensioners than our neighbouring country, so often referred to, Great Britain.  This year we had to add well over £100,000 to the Estimate because of an estimated increase in the number that will be drawing pensions.  Of these, nearly 98 per cent., I think, draw the full 10/-.  With all the talk as to the means test and how it is depriving people of the pension, nearly 98 per cent.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 21,492 in receipt of pensions under 10/- and 124,000 in receipt of the full pension. <Col N="2186" /> That does not fit in with the percentages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get the exact figures.  Last year, Deputy Davin suggested that, as a result of the confidential reports made to the investigating officers of the Department of Finance concerning the means of applicants, some cases were turned down and refused pensions.  I want to make it clear to Deputy Davin and the House that the Revenue Commissioners or their officers do not adjudicate on old age pensions: all they do is investigate the means of all claimants whose claims are sent to them by the Old Age Pensions Committees. In the year ending 30th June, 1942, the number of claims received and finally determined was 14,699.  Of these, 84 per cent.&mdash;12,400&mdash;went through without objection by the revenue investigating officers.  If the officer thinks that the recommendation of the committee is not proper or just on the information he has, he sends in an appeal to the adjudicating officers in the Department of Local Government. The number of appeals was 2,221, or 15 per cent., which is relatively a very small percentage.  What happened to those appeals?  The number of appeals decided against the claim, not by the officials of the Department of Finance but by the appeals deciding officers in the Department of Local Government and Public Health, was 1,163, or 52 per cent. of the cases appealed.  The number of appeals decided in which the claimants did not receive any pension was 812, or 37 per cent.  I will let the Deputy have a copy of the figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the figure is correct.  But what does that prove?  It proves that, in these cases, the people <Col N="2187" /> were not entitled, under the law, to receive the full pension.  The vast bulk of those who applied for old age pensions do get the 10/- a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wrong; I am sorry; it is 86 per cent.  Old age pensions are so numerous that even an increase of 1/- a week would mean a big amount.  An increase of 5/- a week, as suggested by some Deputies, would mean an increase of 50 per cent. on £3,750,000, or over.  The Minister for Finance and the Government have to consider where the money is to come from.  This country is already pretty heavily taxed. Our income-tax is 7/6 in the £.  Is that not a big tax on income?  The tax on commodities that are in general consumption, commodities which are suitable for taxation, is already pretty high.  The tax on beer and spirits is very high.  I wonder would it bring us in, relatively speaking, an amount sufficient to offset increased pensions if the taxes on these commodities were raised?  That is a matter that I have to bear in mind whenever the Budget is under consideration.  The tax on tobacco is very high.  It brings us in an enormous sum.</P>
      <P>If I were to increase old age pensions, to increase wages here and there, as I am asked to do, I would have to consider where I am to get the money. I have to get most of the money out of the taxpayer.  What am I going to tax next?  Where is the subject for taxation that will bring us in an extra £1,000,000 or £2,000,000?  These are the things the Minister for Finance has to consider.  I know it will be very difficult to find the sum necessary to finance the children's allowances that this House will be asked to consider in the next week or two.  That is going to cost a very considerable additional sum this year and, if we are to find money for that, I wonder where I am to turn to get that money, and also the money necessary to meet all the demands put up here.  Cases were made from various benches here for increases in relation to a variety of things that, perhaps, should be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2188" /> Some people say we can borrow.  You must not borrow for social services; you must not borrow for what are not emergency matters in any sense of the word.  There will be no decrease, but rather an increase, in social services and we must take the money for those services out of the taxpayers' pockets; there is no place else to get it.  If there are emergency services established, they are something that it might be reasonable to ask the next generation to bear a portion of.  It would not be unreasonable to ask the next generation to bear some portion of the emergency cost imposed upon us by this war, and some borrowing in that case is permissible, but we could not borrow for the type of social service on which we are asked here, sometimes eloquently, to spend very large sums of money.</P>

      <P>The Auditor-General in the Bank of Ireland has nothing to say to it.  If we are anxious to borrow money, people are entitled to look at our Budget to see whether or not we are paying our way properly.  I am torn between two loyalties oftentimes when I listen to appeals made here about old age pensioners, poorly paid workers, blind pensioners and so on.  I would like to be generous, to be just to everybody. To nobody in this House can it give greater pleasure than to me to increase generously pensions and wages for those who are entitled to an increase.  But, in the position of Minister for Finance, I have to look at the other side of the picture.  Some Deputies here may say, irresponsibly, that we should borrow.  If they were in my position they would not dream of borrowing for any service than cannot be considered an emergency service.</P>

      <P>It is not that I, do not want to.  This House would be entirely wrong in giving me permission to borrow for such services.  I think what I have said answers the points put about the necessity for increasing wages, salaries and social services. The answer is a general one, but it is one that to thoughtful people should be convincing.  Where a special case is made in respect of hardship of any kind to any set of officials, or any individuals, I am always prepared to examine it sympathetically.  I received a deputation from a Civil Service body about seven or eight weeks ago. <Col N="2190" /> I thought I would have been in a position to give them an answer at an earlier date.  I promised the deputation that I would personally examine the case they had made carefully and sympathetically.  I have carried out my promise to some extent.  I have not finished my examination yet, but when I have examined the case that they put up eloquently to me and the similar case made by Deputy Norton here to-day, I must look at the other side of the balance sheet.  If I can find that, without grave risk of increasing the dangers that do seriously exist when uncontrolled inflation is allowed to grow in a country, I can do anything to ease the situation for civil servants, particularly of the lower classes, and paid workers amongst them, I will be very happy to do it.</P>

      <P>In connection with this Estimate, is the Minister for Finance satisfied in his own mind that the State contributions to universities and colleges in this country are adequate for the requirements of those colleges.  It seems to me that in our circumstances one of the most vitally necessary things for us to do is to ensure that there shall be available to every section of the community, rich and poor, the <Col N="2193" /> highest possible educational facilities. Our universities have not the advantages which the old established universities in Great Britain, the United States of America and other wealthy countries have where vast endowments, which have accumulated over centuries, are available for scholarships and assistance of one kind or another to the students who are enrolled in them. In America, I think it is true to say that the State universities provide university education for the masses of the people without the payment of any fee at all.  I have had many friends there, working as domestic servants or in other capacities of one kind or another, who earned their keep while they availed of the university education that was to be had at the State university.  I may be wrong, but I would be interested to hear from the Minister if he has satisfied himself that the universities of this country, for which the community is responsible, have the equipment and advantages at their disposal requisite to provide the highest standard of education possible for the students enrolled in them.</P>
      <P>I take it that the Minister for Finance has an exceptional opportunity of satisfying himself on this score inasmuch as his colleague, the Taoiseach, is Chancellor of the National University of Ireland and will, no doubt, from time to time make eager representations to him that more generous provision should be made for the institution of which he is Chancellor. I would be glad to have details from the Minister for Finance of the latest and most vigorous representations which the Taoiseach may have made in recent times, or whether we are to infer that the Chancellor is of opinion that the university is getting plenty as it is, or whether he thinks that it ought to get a bit more, and how far the Minister for Finance is getting ready to give way to his influential representations.</P>

My job is to try to get the money that I am obliged to pay over to the universities.

      <P>This Vote and the next one might be regarded as unprecedented seeing that we hope they will be discontinued shortly.  I know that the Minister is bound by the terms of the Act, which laid it down that damage done to property necessitates a claim being made within a certain period.  There is an engine of destruction employed now known as the &ldquo;delayed action bomb.&rdquo;  We have no experience of such action and I take it that the Minister might, in the exercise of his discretion, not feel bound by the terms of the Act, and could make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment in the event of anything occurring.  The second point upon which I should like <Col N="2195" /> information is whether, in connection with the next Vote, No. 73, any case has come to his notice where claims have been ruled out on technical grounds.  I take it that when we passed these Acts it was not the intention to rule out claims on technical points.  If any such cases in connection with the administration of these Votes occur, I take it that the Minister would be disposed to make <i>ex gratia</i> payments.</P>

      <P>It has been brought to the notice of the Minister that owing to a misunderstanding an application was not received as a result of what occurred at Campile and the person concerned is getting no compensation. The man's house was almost blown down.  An official of the county council and of the Board of Works visited the place at the time, and told the applicant that he would be all right and need not claim.  As a result he cannot get compensation under the Act.  I ask the Minister to consider that case because it is one of real hardship.</P>

      <P>Are there many or are there any claims under the Damage to Property (Neutrality) Compensation Act outstanding for a long time or have all claims been disposed of? In regard to Vote 73, Personal Injuries (Civilians) Compensation, do merchant seamen who suffer injury as a result of attacks made on Irish vessels by foreign aircraft, identified or unidentified, qualify for compensation under the terms of that Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Merchant sailors are entitled to compensation.  As to the question raised by Deputy Cosgrave, 100 claims have been turned down because they were not in at the date specified.  Deputies will remember that when discussing the terms of the Damage-to Property (Neutrality) Compensation Bill, a very determined effort was made in the Dáil to see that no time should be lost in settling these claims, and it was eventually impressed upon me that I should give a promise to the House that all claims should be completely dealt with inside 12 months.  If claims were to <Col N="2196" /> be dealt with inside 12 months, they had to be in before 12 months, and we had to fix 12 months as the period for making claims.  There are 100 people whose claims have been ruled out by the Attorney-General as impossible of consideration, amongst them, the case mentioned by Deputy Allen.  If I am correctly informed the officials who went to see that applicant told him that a claim must be made.  Foolishly he did not make a claim until 15 months afterwards.</P>

      <P>Up to September 30th, 1943, 2,577 applications were received and 2,386 offers of compensation were made.  Every applicant to whom an offer was made was at liberty either to accept the offer or if he refused it, to apply to the Circuit Court for compensation.  Only one such application went to the Circuit Court so far, and the case is still <i>sub judice.</i>  In 143 cases we refused to make any offer of compensation.  In these cases the persons concerned were entitled to go to the court if they wished, but only six applicants have done so and, in the three cases that have been decided by the courts, the applicants failed to establish their claims.  Every claim had to be disposed of by my Department by an offer of compensation or by refusing to make an offer within 12 months from the date of receipt.  The Dáil insisted upon that being done.  That obligation has been fulfilled, and the great bulk of the claims was dealt with in a much shorter period than the Act allowed. Twelve months after the passing of the Act claims continued to be received at a fairly even rate right up to 23rd September, 1942.  All these cases have now been dealt with.  The fact that it was found possible to dispose of the vast majority of the cases without appeal to the courts enabled claims to be met much more rapidly than would otherwise have been the case, and the fact that the claims taken to the <Col N="2197" /> courts were negligible in number is proof that the Department's offers were fair and reasonable.</P>
      <P>I have a note of the number of applications made received from the different places where incidents occurred. At Campile, August, 1940, 18 applications were received and 18 offers of compensation accepted; at Sandycove, December, 1940, 30 applications were received, 27 offers of compensation accepted, one offer was refused and two not yet accepted or refused; South Circular Road and Terenure, January, 1941, 463 applications, 435 offers of compensation accepted and nine not yet accepted or refused; North Stand, North Circular Road, Summerhill and Phoenix Park, May, 1941, 1,866 applications, 1,666 offers of compensation accepted, one offer refused, 43 not yet accepted or refused.  There were 200 other applications, of which 174 accepted offers of compensation, one offer was refused, and nine not yet accepted or refused.  Arising out of the administration of that Act, and the work done by the officials who were told to take charge, I should like to say that they have done a difficult job with great ability and great expedition. They have done a most satisfactory job, and the Minister is most grateful to them, and I think the Dáil should be grateful also.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £10,450 has already been granted by means of Votes on Account.  The sum now asked for is required to complete the total of £15,631, which is the estimated expenditure <Col N="2199" /> for the current year.  Last year the Estimate was for a sum of £15,012, and accordingly there is a net increase this year of £619.  Under sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;totalling £14,621, there is an increase of £549, due largely to normal incremental charges and provision for bonus thereon, including emergency bonus for the lower grade staffs.  The provision in sub-head B&mdash; Travelling Expenses&mdash;amounting to £200, is the same as for 1942-43 and the two previous years.  The provision of £120 in sub-head C&mdash;Incidental Expenses&mdash;is the same as last year. The main items provided for under the sub-head are newspapers and other publications, uniforms for messengers, laundry, postage and carriage of parcels. In sub-head D&mdash;Telegrams and Telephones&mdash;the provision of £340 shows an increase of £70 as compared <Col N="2200" /> with last year, and is measured by reference to the latest quarterly accounts furnished by the Post Office for calls and rent charges.  There is no change in the provision of £350 in sub-head E&mdash; Allowance to Taoiseach for motor car. The sub-head includes all expenses incurred by the Taoiseach in using his private car for official purposes, except wages and uniforms of chauffeurs.  It is usual on this Vote to go no further than I have gone with regard to the details, but to await criticism of the Department, statements on general policy and so on.</P>
