      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether his attention was directed to the article relating to Social Insurance published in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on March 21st, 1943, and whether the writer was Mr. P.S. O'Hegarty, Secretary of the Post Office; and, if so, whether the article was published with the previous knowledge or with the consent of the Government; further, whether he will state if there is any regulation or rule relating to the publication by high State officials of signed articles containing comment or criticism on matters of current political interest, and if there is no such rule, whether he will take steps to ensure that when publishing articles of this nature such officials will make it clear to the public that they are expressing personal opinion only.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the article referred to, which was written by the Secretary of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Neither the Government as a whole nor any member of it had seen the article before publication or was aware of the intention to publish it. Obviously, therefore, the Government was in no way responsible for the views expressed in the article.  There is a Civil Service regulation which forbids civil servants to &ldquo;contribute to newspapers or other publications any letters or articles conveying information, comment or criticism on any matter of current political interest.&rdquo;  The Secretary of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has been informed that the publication of his article was a breach of this regulation, and one of which the Government has taken serious notice. He has expressed his regret and given an assurance that there will be no repetition of the incident.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that Mr. Arthur Fagan, whose home, 157 North Strand Road, was wrecked in the bombing and whose wife was <Col N="1745" /> killed, has been refused any compensation for the loss of his wife, and if he will cause his claim to be reinvestigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the affirmative.  The answer to the second part is that the case has already been fully investigated and that the question of reinvestigation does not, therefore, arise.  Compensation has not been paid in respect of Mrs. Fagan's death because no evidence has so far been brought to my notice which would justify my deciding that any person was dependent on her within the meaning of the scheme at the time of her death.  I might add, for the Deputy's information, that arrangements for Mrs. Fagan's funeral were made by the Dublin Corporation, and that a claim by them for recoupment of their expenses is under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Operations on the Royal Canal are confined to by-traders who, so far as I am aware, have no standard rates of charge.  No national turf has been transported over that canal and consequently I have not the information asked for at (a) of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1752" /> The cost of transporting turf by road depends on the distance of the bogs from Dublin which in the case of Longford varies between 60 and 90 miles. Taking County Longford as a whole, the average cost of transporting national turf from that county to Dublin by road is 29/10 per ton.  This figure includes loading of lorries, discharge, and delivery.</P>

      <P>Some time ago my Department, in consultation with the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, the Department of Agriculture, the Irish Sea Fisheries Association, and certain commercial firms and experts, examined very closely the question of the production and refining of fish oil, and numerous experiments were carried out.  While it is established that there is machinery in the country which could be used for the purpose, the conclusion reached was that the production and refining of fish oil would not be warranted by the results which it might be expected to obtain. The chief factors operating against the proposal are:&mdash;The uncertainty of supplies of fish at various seasons and at different parts of the coast; the difficulty, particularly in present circumstances, of transporting the fish to the refining plant; the extremely high cost of refined fish oil; and the practical impossibility of deodorising the fish oil. In view of the conclusions reached <Col N="1754" /> regarding the question of fish oil, the question of using the residue as a fertiliser was not examined in detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware of the serious and increasing loss to the town of Youghal by reason of the condition of the bridge over the Blackwater River at Youghal, and if he will take steps to ensure that the preliminary work of preparing plans for the erection of a new bridge is put in hands at once, and whether meantime, in order to facilitate vehicular and cattle traffic to and from the town of Youghal, he will direct that the obstructions erected on the bridge be removed while maintaining the present speed and weight limits for vehicular traffic across the bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to a similar question on the 10th <Col N="1756" /> December, 1942, in which it was stated that the existing bridge carried a normal traffic up to a limit of 3½ tons, and if there has been any restriction of business transactions between Youghal and County Waterford I do not think it can be attributed to the condition of the bridge.  The cost of reconstruction of the bridge, including the cost of preparation of plans, will be a charge on the councils concerned subject to whatever grant may be allocated from the Road Fund.  In the present condition of the Fund there is no possibility of making any such grant.  On the understanding, therefore, that the Road Fund is not in any way committed, I would be willing to consider proposals for the preparation of plans for the erection of a new bridge.  It would be necessary, however, that a definite assurance be given by the councils concerned that they will be prepared to bear the cost incidental to the making of preliminary surveys and the preparation of plans, which would probably amount to over £10,000.</P>
      <P>As regards the latter part of the question, I understand that the obstructions referred to are barriers erected with the object of preventing drivers of vehicles from exceeding the speed limit which the local authorities found it necessary to impose on vehicles for the protection of the existing bridge.  In the circumstances I would not be prepared to suggest the removal of these barriers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that, while the local authorities agree that there is a necessity for a restriction of the speed limit over the bridge, they do not agree that it is necessary to erect approximately 35 barriers in a zig-zag fashion, the effect of which is that owners will not attempt to take cattle and horses across the bridge because of the manner in which the barriers are constructed and the colours in which they are painted?  Will the Minister, therefore, consider sympathetically the question of removing or substantially reducing the number of barriers so as to permit the flow into the town of Youghal of trade which formerly was <Col N="1757" /> proper to that town, but which is now diverted elsewhere because owners of cattle and horses will not take the risk of trying to drive the animals across the bridge on account of the obstructions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must be really misinformed as to the attitude of the local authorities in regard to these barriers.  The first thing that the officer of the local authorities concerned reported was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For checking speeds&mdash;and this is of vital importance&mdash;either Guards on continuous duty must be employed, or the roadway of the bridge must be so obstructed by barriers that speeding will be impossible.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The commissioner for County Waterford subsequently passed a resolution:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the county surveyor be authorised to erect the necessary weighing machine and such barriers or gates as may be necessary for the protection of the existing bridge, and the regulation of traffic, and the checking of weights and speeds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The County Council of Cork passed the following resolution:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That we, the Cork County Council, approve of the recommendation made by the county surveyor for the restriction of weights and speeds of vehicles passing over Youghal bridge, as detailed in his report.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have no reason to think that the barriers erected are not in accordance with the recommendations of the responsible, county council officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister will see if he reads the question, my object is to maintain the present limits of speed and weight across the bridge, but the maintenance of the present limits of speed and weight does not at all render necessary the maintenance of the present 33 or 35 obstructions on the bridge.  The Urban Council of Youghal &mdash;the body vitally affected in the matter&mdash;are perfectly satisfied that they can maintain the speed and weight limits if the barriers are removed or <Col N="1758" /> substantially reduced.  I had an opportunity of inspecting the bridge, and I know what I am talking about.  The Minister did not inspect it.  Even if he did, he would know no more than be knows now.  Apart from that, will the Minister kindly look into the matter with a view to abolishing these obstructions or substantially reducing them, so that the town of Youghal, which is suffering very materially from the maintenance of these obstructions, will be permitted to carry on fairs in the town which were formerly carried on, and which provided a substantial source of revenue to people who are now completely deprived of that revenue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state with reference to the disease known as &ldquo;ear blight&rdquo; on wheat, which was described by Dr. R. McKay and Dr. H.A. Lafferty at a recent scientific meeting of the Royal Dublin Society, (a) what efforts have been made by his Department to control and prevent the increase in the incidence of the disease; (b) whether mercurial dressing of seed kills the fungus Gibberella Sanbinetti; <Col N="1763" /> (c) why farmers are not advised to grow red varieties if white seed is more susceptible; (d) the counties comprising the infected area; (e) why wheat is permitted to be grown in the infected area if the disease is a menace to wheat-growing and the infection spreading; (f) whether seed containing the fungus can be identified when sent for germination test, and, if so, what instructions have been issued to local seed-testing stations with reference to the matter; (g) what measures have been taken to warn farmers of the danger of this disease and the necessity of having seed tested for germination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The disease known as &ldquo;ear blight&rdquo; is found in many countries.  It is caused by one or more species of fusarium which produce on the ears of cereals a conspicuous red colouring.  Outbreaks of the disease have occurred periodically in this country over a long period.  They have been most prevalent in wet seasons and in wet districts, but their occurrence has not been restricted to the latter. The principal fungus responsible, which was first identified here in 1918, again made its appearance on wheat in 1942 in a more severe form.</P>
      <P>The disease attacks other cereals as well as wheat, and no variety of the latter is known to be immune.  Whilst it is believed that the disease is seed-borne, this is not the only means of spreading it.  The application of mercurial or other dressings to affected grain has been found to be ineffective in checking the spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>Badly-affected samples showing the characteristic red colouring of the disease can be distinguished, but not all affected samples can be easily identified.  Diseased samples usually have a low germinating capacity, consequently the testing of seed before sowing is the most helpful measure which can be adopted to lower the incidence of this and other diseases.  The desirability of testing seed wheat for germination has been brought to the notice of farmers and others on numerous occasions.</P>

The question of the retail price of butter is one for the Minister for Supplies.</P>
      <P>As regards meat, the position in regard to supplies of live stock in the country is constantly kept under review, while exports of beef, veal, pork, mutton and lamb are controlled by a licensing system.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Questions No. 18 and No. 19 together.  I would refer the Deputies to my answers to their questions of 24th ultimo.  The additional milk supplies were distributed <Col N="1765" /> in the main through wholesalers who, in turn, distributed them to meet requirements on the lines I have already indicated.  It would not be possible, even after elaborate inquiry, to furnish details of the ultimate disposal of the additional supplies.  The biggest individual requirement was that of the Dublin Corporation Schools Meals Scheme, for which about 6,000 gallons of milk are needed weekly. Approximately half this requirement was met out of the Milk Board's supplies; the remainder was met by the contractor to the corporation.  The needs of the scheme were fully supplied. Certain institutions were also fully supplied as occasion arose.</P>
      <P>A slight shortage of milk for Dublin in the early weeks of this year was envisaged. The actual shortage was about 14,000 gallons per week, of which from 10,000 to 11,000 gallons were made good by the additional supplies, leaving the net shortage at about 4,000 gallons per week out of a normal weekly consumption of about 300,000 gallons.</P>

      <P>I am aware that Acting Corporal John J. McMahon, enlisted in the forces in 1924, transferred to the reserve in 1927, and called out on permanent service in September, 1939, was committed to Monaghan Mental Hospital on the 12th August, 1942, under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1925, immediately after having been in hospital for five weeks suffering from neurasthenia. While in the hospital he also complained of stomach and foot trouble.  I understand that he has since been discharged from the mental hospital, and that, having regard to the circumstances under which he was discharged from the Army, it was not considered desirable to avail of his subsequent offer to re-enlist.  Ex-Corporal McMahon's claim for compensation could not be considered under either the Army Pensions Acts or the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme, but it will be open to him to renew his claim when the Army Pensions Bill, 1943, becomes law.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that an appointment as postman at Balla, County Mayo, was offered to Mr. Michael James Reddington, boy messenger at Ballina, and that a Civil Service certificate was issued in his favour to enable him to take up the appointment, whether he is aware of the fact that the offer of appointment was subsequently cancelled, if he will state on whose authority the <Col N="1775" /> offer of appointment was so cancelled, and why; whether he is aware of the fact that the non-application of the Civil Service certificate in Mr. Reddington's case is resulting in loss of wages to him, and whether he will take steps to remedy the obvious injustice which is being inflicted upon Mr. Reddington.</P>

      <P>I am aware that in October, 1942, an appointment as postman at Balla, County Mayo, was offered to Mr. Michael James Reddington, that a Civil Service certificate had been issued in his favour and that the offer of appointment was subsequently cancelled.</P>
      <P>The appointment was not proceeded with on my instructions, but I was not aware at the time that the matter had reached such an advanced stage, as otherwise the cancellation would not have taken place.</P>
      <P>Boy messengers have not any claim to be appointed to a particular post, and Mr. Reddington was offered the next suitable vacancy which occurred at Castlebar in January, 1943.  He, however, declined this appointment as he preferred to await another vacancy at Foxford to which he is being appointed on 11th instant.  This is the most that can be done in the matter.</P>

      <P>There is no answer to &ldquo;why&rdquo; there.  Is that not so?  The Minister's reply is very unsatisfactory, but I am somewhat handicapped in asking a supplementary question because, of course, the real culprit is unfortunately not present.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister if he would state on whose authority the offer of appointment was cancelled and why.  This question is one month old and the Minister should be able to answer this simple question: why was the appointment cancelled? Does he know that this officer was offered an appointment at Balla by the Post Office authorities, that normally this case would not go to the Minister but that, in fact, political representations were made in the case and the Minister intervened in such a way as completely to depart from the normal code of Post Office procedure? Does the Minister further know that the effect of the intervention in this matter is to deprive this officer of six months' established service?  Does he know that a further effect of the intervention is to deprive this officer of a wage increase of 2/6 per week since January 1st?  Furthermore, does he know that, having caused a mess in this case, the Minister is now responsible for a situation in which the Post Office are demanding that this officer refund unemployment insurance contributions which were not paid by him while the Civil Service certificate was in operation, and which are being demanded now to save somebody's face even though the demand, as the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will tell him, is completely illegal since a demand for unemployment insurance contributions cannot be made unless the contributions are deducted at the time of payment?</P>

      <P>I find here some notes which may answer part of the Deputy's question.  The Minister found that a married man with four children would be displaced if this appointment were proceeded with. That is the reason the appointment was cancelled.  The decision was come to on compassionate grounds because the appointment would mean the displacement of a man with four children for a boy of 19.</P>

      <P>Sub-postmasters are required to provide out of their salary whatever assistance is required for the working of their offices and any assistants needed outside their families are employed by the sub-postmasters and not by the Department. Most sub-postmasters have a shop business in addition to the post office, and sub-office assistants employed by them would, in the great majority of cases, also be employed to assist them in their private business.  The Department endeavours to ensure that a reasonable wage is paid by sub-postmasters to their assistants but the question of remuneration is primarily one between the sub-postmaster and the assistant.  While I appreciate the intention of the Deputy in the matter, I could not lay it down as a hard and fast rule that portion of the emergency bonus should be passed on to the assistants in view of the nature of their employment and the many difficulties involved.</P>

      <P>I understand that the motion before the House is that the Bill be received for final consideration. I object to that motion.  On the 3rd March when the Bill was first introduced the Minister indicated that he would like to have the Second Reading on the following day, and said that he did not think that it could be regarded as a very intricate or controversial type of Bill.  Nevertheless, there was no objection on the part of anybody in the House to taking the discussion on Second Reading on the following day.  When the Bill appeared, it was clear at a single glance that it contained some very serious defects.  The Minister, in replying to some of the criticism, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The extent of the period between my setting out to bring this matter to its present position and the present time is due to the fact that the Bill had to be carefully considered and discussed and rediscussed, and this represents the result of that consideration and discussion.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister thus indicated that a very considerable amount of consideration, discussion and rediscussion had taken place before the Bill was presented to the House.  A serious defect in the Bill was pointed out to the Minister on Second Reading.  Nevertheless, <Col N="1781" /> when we came to consider the matter on Committee the following week, no attempt was made by the Minister to meet the point raised on Second Reading, or to assist the House in any way in the serious discussion of an important measure which had involved him in a considerable amount of consideration, discussion and rediscussion. Four out of every five men in the Army to-day are men who joined the Army in response to the national call&mdash;a call made by every Party in the House, and supported by the whole of the people.  Their response to that call rendered them liable either to lose their lives or to lose their ability to maintain themselves and their families&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If you are accepting that motion, I want to say a few words on it.  The Minister told us on the previous stage that he has no proposals amending this Bill to bring before the House.  I, therefore, oppose the taking of the Fifth Stage now, because I think the Minister should consider between now and Wednesday next whether, in justice to the House, to himself, and to the men who have been asked to serve the country and the families depending on them, he should not reconsider his position.</P>
      <P>The country, as I have just stated, called men of all classes and all ages to the Army to defend the country against military dangers to which it was possibly exposed.  We have an Army now in which four out of every five are men who left their ordinary avocations and joined the Army, thereby exposing themselves to the possibility of either losing their lives and leaving their families to be cared for by the State or by somebody else, or incurring permanent disability, rendering themselves incapable of supporting themselves and their wives and families and leaving them to be cared for by the State or by somebody else. The Minister has indicated that he has reviewed this matter at considerable length.  When the Bill came before the House, as I have already said, we found serious defects in it, although the Minister suggested it was uncontroversial, and now as we look at the measure we find that the Minister's suggestion that the Bill is not intricate is anything but a correct description of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I realised the unsatisfactory nature of the provisions being made for the wife and children of an officer or man who was completely disabled, I sought to be allowed to remove these provisions from the Bill and to introduce an amendment by which the married pensions to be paid in respect of the wife and children of a disabled man or officer would be fixed by regulations to be made by the Minister for Defence, after consultation with the Defence Conference.  That amendment was ruled out of order because the implication was that it would impose an increased charge on the State; but, <Col N="1785" /> although the Minister considered the whole matter, he never consulted the Defence Conference, or any members of it, in connection with these proposals, and he has not in fact consulted this House.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the discussion on Committee Stage, I drew attention to the basic position of certain officers and said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under the 1923 Act, if an officer was 100 per cent. disabled, he became entitled to a pension of £200 a year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, with regard to Section 3 of this Bill, I went on to say that while, under the 1923 Act, if an officer was 100 per cent. disabled, he became entitled to a pension of £200 a year, this section contemplates that an officer who is permanently disabled in the present emergency may only get £120 a year.  The Minister, in effect, told me that I had completely misinformed myself on the question of officers' pensions, or, more or less, that I had not read the Bill or had some ulterior motive for the criticisms I made.  He implied that the criticisms of the Bill from these benches were dictated by unworthy motives, but in reply to a Parliamentary question yesterday my suggestion or interpretation of Section 3 was quite borne out by the Minister's answer.  I did say that, under the 1923 Act, the minimum pension that any officer suffering from disablement would get would be £200, but according to the reply that was given to me by the Minister yesterday the amount payable to an unmarried officer, suffering 100 per cent. disablement attributable to service in the forces during the emergency, would be, in the case of a second-lieutenant, £120, both maximum and minimum; in the case of a lieutenant, a maximum of £153 6s. od., and a minimum of £120; and in the case of a captain, a maximum of £197 2s. od., and a minimum of £153 6s. od.&mdash;all substantially below the £200 mark.  The attitude of the Minister, generally, was that he was not going to take part in any discussion or explanation as to the Government's attitude in this matter. I think it is regrettable that we cannot discuss in this House in any constructive <Col N="1786" /> way the provision to be made for the wives and children of people who have been disabled as a result of taking their part as soldiers in this emergency.</P>
    <P>I should also like at this stage to ask how many of the Deputies who are sitting behind the Minister, who have voted for every section of this Bill, really understand what the Bill provides for.  I think it is a unique Bill. The Minister said, justly, that a Bill, of this kind would be accepted by everybody in the House, but when we came to look at it, the result was that there were 13 divisions called on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  As a matter of fact, every line of the Bill was challenged, but in all of these divisions nobody walked into the Lobby in favour of the Minister's proposals except his own supporters.  Even on the Money Resolution, only three people, who were not supporters of the Minister, voted for it, and they voted, either inadvertently or, possibly, for some other reason.  Therefore, I suggest that there is reason for reconsidering this Bill in the light of the attention that has been called to it.  Does anybody here realise what this Bill means?</P>
    <P>Let us take, for example, three instances. Let us take the case of two men who, at their country's call, joined the Army and became second-lieutenants, and let us say that one was unmarried, but with a mother dependent on him, whereas the other was married and had a wife and six children. According to this, they both would get £120 as their basic pension.  The man with the wife and six children would get an addition of £30, in addition to the £120, whereas the pension provided for a mother who was entirely dependent on a second-lieutenant would be added to by the amount of £52 a year.  Does anybody realise that under this Bill, if a sergeant of the Army and a member of the L.D.F. are both killed while engaged on military duty&mdash;both men, let us say, leaving a widow and six children&mdash;the widow of the sergeant in the Army will get 28/6 a week for herself and her six children, while the widow of the L.D.F. man will get 48/- for herself and her six <Col N="1787" /> children?  The sergeant in the Army who loses his life will leave his widow and six children depending on 28/6 a week, while the widow and six children of the L.D.F. man will have at least 48/- a week.</P>
    <P>Under Section 7 of this Bill certain arrangements are made for special grants to certain classes, irrespective of whether the people concerned were officers or not, but under Section 7, &ldquo;the appropriate annual sum&rdquo; for a widow and six children is £140 8s., whereas under the provision made here the widow and six children of a sergeant would only receive an annual provision of £74 2s., while the annual provision for an L.D.F. man would be £125.  We ought to be able to say what kind of principle we are working on.  I do not understand why, under Section 7, £140 8s. should be considered the appropriate amount for a widow and six children while, under another section, £74 2s. should be considered the appropriate amount that this House considers for the maintenance of the widow and six children of another type of man, or that £125 should be considered the appropriate sum for the widow and six children of an L.D.F. man.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask whether any of the people who supported the Minister in the 13 divisions that we had here on this Bill realised that there are these inconsistencies, this injustice, and this sort of lack of mercy in respect of the men who have been called upon to join our Defence Forces under the present circumstances.  If they did not understand that, I ask them now to consider what they are proposing to do for the dependents of these people, and I suggest that they should support me in asking the Minister to think over this matter until next Wednesday, at least, and ask him to give this House an assurance that before the Bill leaves the House radical changes will be made in it.</P>
    <P>On a former occasion in this House, we had an Emergency Order postponed in connection with compensation for bomb damages.  On that occasion, we were met with the same kind of unrelenting <Col N="1788" /> resistance to discussion in this House.  We were told the country could not afford to give more than 30/- a week to the widow and family of a man who had been killed as a result of bomb damage.  As far as we here were concerned that was the way the position was left by a vote of this House.  Happily&mdash;however inadequate the change may have been&mdash;when the matter was taken to the Seanad it was changed.  We will have something more to say if the Fifth Stage of this Bill is leaving this House without any further guarantee from the Minister, but I do not think the House ought to leave it in the condition in which it is at the present moment and be in the disgraceful position that we were in with regard to the consideration of the question of compensation for victims of bomb damage, when the Seanad had to come in and make the necessary change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the question of saying what a man should get because he is prepared to answer the call of his country, I should like to say to the Minister that there is something even deeper than that to be considered, and we here as a Parliament should have some guiding principles as to what provision we should make for the family of that man.  I think it is about time that we should apply some of the social teachings of the Church to our legislation.  What I have really taken exception to in the legislation passed in this House over the number of years I have been here is the fact that there is no application of the social teachings of the Church to our legislation. I did not like to hear the Minister saying a while ago, when I asked him whether he would make the necessary changes, that he would make no changes.  I do not view a Bill like this passing through this House without having regard to underlying principles that should guide us here as legislators passing legislation dealing with the families of the nation.  I would make a final appeal to the Minister to make the desirable changes in the Bill.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was being considered by the House, I scarcely realised how narrow was the scope of some of its provisions. Paragraph (3) of Part IV reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where no allowance is payable under the terms of the immediately <Col N="1790" /> preceding paragraph, one allowance shall be payable to such one of the dependents mentioned of a deceased soldier as the Minister may direct who was mainly dependent on such soldier.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understand that, under the Army separation allowances scheme, allowances are not paid to mothers who have unmarried sons serving in the forces.  That means that a mother cannot <Col N="1791" /> qualify; in other words, Irish soldiers have not any right to have mothers.  Deputy Mulcahy, a few minutes ago, was drawing a distinction between a wife and a mother, and pointing out the alleged generosity to a mother as compared with a wife. The mother to whom he was calling attention would be mainly dependent and, so far as the ordinary soldier is concerned, that just cannot happen.  I understand that the Army will not recognise any case where a mother has an unmarried son serving as a soldier, a son who is prepared to make a small allowance out of his pay to his mother. Therefore, the mother is not considered as mainly dependent, and, to continue the full sweep of the vicious circle, the mother cannot draw an allowance.  I do not think other Deputies realise that the terms of the Bill have been drawn so tightly as that.</P>
    <P>It would be invidious for me to make comparisons between the mothers and wives of Irish soldiers and the mothers and wives of soldiers in other armies; but I would like to say to the Minister, with all the earnestness of which I am capable, that he has not made a sufficiently generous allowance &mdash;in fact, he has not made any allowance for mothers who have unmarried sons in the Army.  We can quite understand that the Army cannot pension wives and mothers and other dependents, but at least they might allow a soldier to opt between having a wife and having a mother.  I suggest that in later years it may come to be regarded that during our time here an Irish soldier was not allowed to have a mother.</P>

      <P>Is it possible to have provision made in this Bill&mdash;or is there any hope of another Bill embodying such provisions being introduced&mdash;for the members of Casement's Brigade?  I understand that representations have been made to the Minister in connection with this matter, but no Military Service Pensions Bill has been introduced here so far that gave any recognition to the members of Casement's Brigade.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that anybody who has made an effort to understand this Bill will realise, from some of the things said here, that there are many bad points in it, but, until Deputy Dockrell spoke, I did not realise that the Bill could be as bad as he suggests.  In Part III we have a reference to a mother, a father over 60 years of age, or incapacitated by ill-health, a permanently invalided brother, or permanently invalided unmarried sister, and grandparents.  It is set out in that section of the Bill that an allowance shall be payable to one or more of the dependents mentioned of a deceased officer, who, in the opinion of the Minister, were wholly dependent on such officer. Then, further on, it is declared that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a dependent's allowance granted to any person under the terms of this Part of this Schedule shall be an annual sum of £52.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It would now appear that a mother or father is not going to be regarded as wholly dependent on the son because, while he is a soldier in the Army, the Army takes no cognisance of the fact that he has a mother or father dependent on him.  If the Bill is as bad as that, then it is worse than I thought it was, but that particular aspect is just in keeping with the rest of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe I would be right, then, in saying that if, during the emergency, there are two second lieutenants, one of whom has a mother and the other a wife and six children, they will get the basic allowance for themselves and, in respect of the mother, one man will get £52 a year, and the other with the wife and six children will get £30 a year. When I see some of the things that are <Col N="1793" /> in this Bill, I feel that perhaps I have got a little bit twisted in my mind and I am not representing things exactly as they are, but I am endeavouring to indicate certain things that are in this Bill as I see them.</P>
      <P>I will take first the basic rate put down for a single officer of the rank of lieutenant or captain who becomes permanently disabled.  The provision comes in under Section 3.  Under this Bill a lieutenant, who is 100 per cent. disabled, gets a personal pension of £120 a year.  I stated before that, under the 1923 Act, that man would have got a pension of £200.  In connection with that we have to consider not only the nominal comparison between these two amounts but the value of £120 now to that man in keeping him.  The cost of living in 1923 was 186.  In 1942 it was 273.  Money to-day has only 68 per cent. of its 1923 value. Therefore, when we compare actual cash values, a pension of £200 under the 1923 Act to a second lieutenant now becomes £82.  Deputy O Briain indicated on the Committee Stage, when I was referring to the cost of living and its bearing on these proposals, that these proposals would continue whether the cost of living went down or not.  It is generally taken that the cost of living post-war will not be reduced below 25 per cent. of what it was before the emergency.  On the basis of a cost of living 25 per cent. greater than it was in 1939, the value of money to-day, as compared with 1923, would be 78 per cent., so that the £120 in 1923 terms would be only £93 10s. Od.</P>
      <P>However, the man has got a pension of £120.  The British provision under Royal Warrant of January, 1943&mdash;Command Paper 6419&mdash;would give a second lieutenant £195.  We here are offering a second lieutenant £120.  So much for that as a basic proposal.  In the case of a man, whether he is a sergeant, a corporal or a private, the present proposals are that, if he were 100 per cent. disabled, he would get a personal pension of 42/- a week.  That is the figure the 1923 Act contains, but when we express it in terms of 42/- in 1923 its actual value to that man is only 28/6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1794" /> If we consider a cost-of-living level that is 25 per cent. over the pre-war level then, in relation to the 1923 position, the value of the 42/-, in these circumstances, would be 32/7.  At any rate he is getting 42/- under these proposals. In Great Britain, under the same Royal Warrant that I have just quoted, the lowest grade in the British Army would get 37/6, the next 40/10, the next 44/2, the next 47/6, the next 50/10, while a warrant officer would get 54/2.</P>

I will be very glad to hear him, or anybody else, on some other comparisons that I am going to make. I am dealing with basic things because I think we ought to be clear as to what the basic position is for officers and men.  That is necessary in order that we may be able to ask ourselves whether, out of the £120 a year paid to a second lieutenant who is completely disabled, and out of the 42/- a week paid to a sergeant or private&mdash;a sum which is the equivalent of £109 odd per year&mdash;a man will have anything to spare towards the maintenance of anybody else, after providing himself with such amenities in life as one who has given the whole of his physical capacity in the service of his country might reasonably be expected to enjoy.</P>

      <P>I will deal first with basic things.  If the Deputies opposite will compare these basic sums with other basic sums, I want to ask them this: whether, out of these sums, a man who is 100 per cent. disabled will have anything left over, after providing for himself, which he can devote to the maintenance of some other person?  I come now to the case of the married man.  In addition to that basic proposal, provision is made under Section 3 for what is called a &ldquo;married pension&rdquo;.  I consider that this &ldquo;married pension&rdquo; is an utter and complete disgrace to this Bill and to this House as an Assembly.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is entitled to interfere in any kind of way that he wants to on this.  I am dealing with facts, and with conditions as they are to-day.  I want to say that if we here do not put ourselves to the trouble of exercising our minds, then the proper and the right thing to be done will be worked out in misery and suffering by the people outside.  The proper and right thing will be worked out, and it is not fair to ask the wives and children of men who become injured, or who lose their lives, to bring us, through their sufferings, their complaints and their bitterness, to doing the right thing.  We are here for purposes of considering and discussing, and I am putting these facts before the House, in order that there will be no excuse for anybody to say that he did not know these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an officer is married and has six children, he gets his basic allowance&mdash; in which I have suggested there is not <Col N="1796" /> much left for supporting anybody else &mdash;and in addition to that he gets &ldquo;a married pension&rdquo; of £30 a year, which is 11/6 per week.  If a man were on unemployment assistance, in addition to the basic rate that he would get as a single man, he would get 12/6 a week additional in cash, he would get 14/- additional in food vouchers, and he would even get cheap fuel.  At any rate, he would get, in addition to his basic allowance, the value of 26/6 a week.  If he were a member of the L.D.F. who was injured in the same way in military service, then he would get, in addition to his basic allowance, 31/6 a week for his wife and children. If he were in the British Army he would get 65/9 a week, and as well as that, in respect of any child between eight and 18 years of age, who was suitable for getting education of a particular type, he would get an additional grant per child of £40 a year.</P>
    <P>Under the 1923 Act, the grant would have been 15/-.  The 11/6, at cost-of-living comparison with 1923, is only 7/10.  Now, we ought to consider here whether 11/6 a week is a sufficient addition to the basic pension of a married officer who has a wife and six children, in order to maintain properly the wife and children who must look after themselves and who cannot be looked after by the father of the family because he has lost his ability to do so, in the service of the State.  I said that, if the officer were in the British Army, he would get the equivalent of 65/9 a week and additional grants for his children between eight and 18 of £40 a year per child.  If his circumstances of disability were such that he had to have constant attendance, he would also get a grant of £90 a year to pay for that attendance.  In the case of a sergeant, a non-commissined officer or a private, who loses his life and who had a wife and six children, the position is that there is 12/6 granted for the wife and for the children, a total of 16/-; even if there were eight children, it would be only 16/-.  Therefore, 28/6, under Section 7, of the 1927 Act, which is made use of in Section 5 of this Bill is all that is provided for the family.</P>
    <P>I pointed out before that such a person, if on unemployment assistance, <Col N="1797" /> would get 26/6, in addition to a basic allowance.  In the case of an L.D.F. man who had lost his life, such a family would get 48/6 as against 28/6 for a man in the Army.  In the case of a man who lost his life in the British Army, the total for the widow and six children would be 63/6.  In addition, she would get an allowance for each child from eight to 18 of £40 per year and in addition according to his rank&mdash;first class private, second class or third class&mdash;she would get anything up to 10/- additionally. Under the 1923 Act, the widow and six children of a man would get 40/-, and for children between 12 and 18 years of age there would be an educational allowance of £35 a year. You have there the comparison of the position in which the widow of a man who lost his life would be, with six children, getting 28/6 to keep the whole family, as against 48/6 in the case of L.D.F. men, 63/6 plus generous educational allowances if in the British Army, and 40/- plus educational allowances under the 1923 Act.</P>
    <P>Now, in the case of a widow of an officer with six children the position is that, under the present Bill, the widow of a lieutenant or a captain would get £60, and for the children there would be a total of £64, making a total of £124 for the family.  In addition to that, educational grants would be given for children between 11 and 18 years of age, of £30.  Under the 1923 Act, the widow and children would get £230, as against £124 under this Bill, and the educational grants from 12 to 18 would be £35.  If it were a case of the widow of a lieutenant, an Irishman in the British Army, the widow and children would get between them £308, and there would be additional allowances from eight years of age to 18, of £40.</P>
    <P>I did not give the position of a married man with six children.  He would get a basic allowance and a married pension of 10/- a week.  I compare that with the 26/6 additional he would get if he were on relief.  I compare it with the 31/6 that a man in the L.D.F. would get.  I compare it with the 43/4 that a man in the British Army would get&mdash;where, in addition, educational allowances would be given <Col N="1798" /> for children who were suitable for getting that education, between eight and 18 years of age, of £40 per child, and where, in addition, if his circumstances were such as to require permanent attendance, he would get an additional allowance of 18/- a week.  Comparing these cases with what a man would get in addition to his relief grant, what a man in the L.D.F. would get and what a man in the British Army would get, and comparing them with the terms of the 1923 Act, there are very serious questions to be answered on the point of comparison alone.</P>
    <P>If we take the full position, including the basic rate of a sergeant in the Army, or a member of the L.D.F., each totally disabled with a wife and six children, the Army sergeant would have a total income of 52/- and the member of the L.D.F. a total income of 61/6.  These are only some considerations of the extraordinary things this Bill discloses, and when the Minister says that the proposals in it had to be considered and re-considered, discussed and re-discussed, we ought to have been able to get from him more of the fruits of that discussion to guide the House, first as to what the Bill actually means, and secondly as to what principles it was formed on.  We ought to be able to get some explanation of any shortcomings that there are in the Bill.  Apparently the structure of the family was considered when, in the new Part III inserted in Section 5, it was taken into consideration that men in addition to supporting families very often have to support relatives. But if there is any basis for the amount fixed in the new Part III of Section 5 for the dependents of men, surely there must be some basis as to how much was required to sustain the wives and children of disabled men.  In respect of officers and men, those who have joined up for the present emergency are the people whose position we have to consider, because they are the kernel of the trouble.</P>
    <P>We have all kinds of generous planning, shall I say, in certain Articles of the Constitution.  Article 42, where the question of education arises, states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1799" />&ldquo;The State shall, however, as guardian of the common good, require in view of actual conditions that the children receive a certain minimum education, moral, intellectual and social.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How could any social education be given to the children of a man who has given his life for his country who, no matter what their number, with their mother, are asked to live on 28/6 a week or in the case of children who have to live on a pension of 10/- a week provided for their mother and themselves because the father had lost his ability to care for them due to the service he gave to the country?  There are many other inconsistencies in the Bill, but this only shows how necessary it was that this Bill should have been discussed in the House and how necessary it would be that we should have the help of Deputy Cooney or Deputy Fogarty to discuss it, or to help to bring about a situation in which it could be discussed.  I think one of the results of this Bill will be that, if two men join the Army for the emergency, one becoming a second lieutenant and the other a sergeant, there is discrimination between their families in the matter of provision for the education of children.  The Seventh Schedule of the Army Pensions Act of 1927 applies in respect of officers and provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Repayment of amount proved to have been in fact necessarily and properly expended in educational fees, but not exceeding £30 in any one calendar year in respect of any one child.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That can be given for any number of children of which the Minister approves in the case of deceased officers, but there is no such provision in the case of deceased men, in the Act.  Deputy Cooney does not think much of that Act, and I never thought much of it.  It brings about this situation: that if two men of equal class, or of any class, joined the Army for the emergency, and one became an officer and was killed, and the other became a sergeant and was <Col N="1800" /> killed, provision is made for the wife and children of the officer, and there are also educational facilities, while for the man who became a sergeant such educational facilities, while vided for the children.  I think there would be no desire in this House for discrimination of that kind.  If there is one thing that wants to be looked after, in addition to securing main tenance for the wives and families of men, whether killed or disabled, it is education.  Deputy Cooney wanted to know whether it was fair to compare the rates proposed to be paid here and the rates paid to Irishmen who joined the British Army.  I think the comparison is fair enough, and, in that connection, I should say in relation to the rates paid in Great Britain that a very considerable agitation is developing over there, that the rates are not sufficient.</P>
    <P>Definite attempts are being made to establish the principle that the dependents of men who lost their lives, and particularly disabled men who have to live without any capacity to help themselves or their families, are entitled to receive from the State not only adequate sustenance, but additional comforts and amenities over what might be regarded as adequate sustenance because of the fact that it was in the service of the State they gave all.  I ask Deputies to consider these amounts, to visualise a sample case, and ask themselves, in the case of a man who has been completely disabled and who has a wife and family, whether in the light of the provision that is made here his children will ever be able to buy a book, ever be able to go to a concert, ever be able to feel that they are the respected and comfortable citizens they ought to be because of the service of their fathers, and not paupers.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a challenge to the whole of our outlook on society.  The manner in which this Bill has been discussed is a challenge to this House as to whether it is either a representative Assembly or a consultative Assembly.  In my opinion, it is neither one nor the other.  It has utterly failed to represent the spirit or the wishes of the people.  It has utterly <Col N="1801" /> failed to discuss this measure properly or to make itself a consultative Assembly, in relation to it.  I oppose this measure and I am perfectly satisfied that, when it is marked as having passed the Oireachtas, it will be a different measure in very many respects.  It may not be all that everybody would want to have it, but it certainly will not be the discreditable thing which it is now.  I think that this House has discredited and disgraced itself by the way it has approached the discussion on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy deserves the thanks of every National Army man and his dependents, and of every man in this country who stands for justice, for the manner in which he has fought this Bill.  From the facts and figures he has put before the House we must come to the conclusion that it is nothing more than a hash of a Bill.  The amounts to be given by way of pension do not show justice. The basic figures are on a wrong basis. It is up to the Minister to right these matters before the Bill is passed.  If we rush a measure like this through, it shows that our Constitution is nothing more than hypocrisy.  After all that we have heard about our famous Constitution the Minister should not come to this House with such a Bill to provide for the men and the dependents of the men who gave us the right to sit here, namely, our soldiers.  If that is the march to freedom, if on every mile of the road we are leaving a human wreck, is it worth fighting for freedom at all?  Why should the men who took the risk of losing their lives or of being maimed be treated in this despicable way?  We know the basis on which pensions were fixed for other men who took very little risks and whose position is secure when they retire into private life.  I do not blame those who talk about the way in which this House can look after itself when people who gave it the right to look after itself are to be left as living wrecks.  We can find money for everything else, but we cannot find it for the men who gave us the right to sit here and to legislate for ourselves and our country.  In my opinion, this is a typical Fianna Fáil Bill, because never <Col N="1802" /> in the last 25 years had they much respect for our Irish Army.  In fact, we had to force respect for it on them. We did not really appreciate the services which these young men gave to the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister has the proud distinction of being a 1916 man who fought with Pearse, Connolly, Collins, and the other great men, but when he attains the position of being a front bencher to fight for the rights of the Irish soldier, he will not stand up and fight for those rights.  I do not think he is one of those who would leave himself in the hands of civil servants or anybody else.  At the same time, there must be somebody pulling the strings out of his hands.  He has seen our own comrades left as wrecks, some of them dying in the poorhouse, others living on the dole and home assistance with their wives and children starving. This country should not have treated these men in that way.  It shows, a poor mentality on the part of a soldier Minister.  I expected more from him. I speak as one who was right through the whole movement for the last 20 years, one who was in armies and out of armies, and I always saw the trail of wrecks after every emergency.</P>
      <P>It does not look as if we will have many disabled soldiers after the emergency&mdash;I hope we will not&mdash;but the needs of the few we will have should be looked after in every way. If money can be found at all, it should be provided for them and their dependents, so that we can look back with pride on the fact that we treated them well.  Our soldiers expected more from an Irish Parliament and an Irish Minister.  They certainly expected great things from a Minister who fought in 1916.  I expected more from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take back this Bill and make such provision for these men as will do them justice.  We expect that from him; the country expects it.  If we expect to pull this country through it all, it is only on these lines we can do it.  We hear of the great plans for the future that are being made in other countries.  I believe this country is also to have a Beveridge plan.  Surely we ought to start with this Bill and put up a plan <Col N="1803" /> for the Irish soldier.  In doing that we would be doing nothing but mere justice.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the whole position and fix proper amounts for pensions so that those in the fighting line will have some hope that, when they come back to private life, if they are so unfortunate as to be disabled during service and are not able to work for a living, the State will look after them and their dependents.</P>

      <P>I certainly did not intend to intervene in this debate.  I merely want to point out to the House that since Deputy Mulcahy became a politician he has been known to fill many extraordinary roles.  But I think this is the most extraordinary role that he has ever been known to fill in this House.  Deputy Mulcahy is an ex-Minister, even an ex-Minister for Defence, and a member of a Party who sponsored the 1923 and 1927 Acts.  Yet, in a serious tone he criticises this Bill which, in practically every line, is a definite improvement on the two previous Acts.  I interrupted the Deputy in the course of his speech to ask him did he consider it fair to draw a comparison between the figures which he quoted in regard to the British Army and the figures for our Irish Army.</P>
      <P>I think it is entirely dishonest. There could be no just comparison between the two countries.  One is a vast empire with vast resources and the other a small State.  If the Deputy were serious he could have sought figures from countries which would compare in respect of population and resources with ours.</P>

      <P>I am saying that, if the Deputy were honest, he could have sought figures for countries which would compare in respect of population and resources.  He did not do so.  I hope the Deputy did not deliberately use this occasion to make a recruiting speech for the British Army.  The comparison between the British Army figures and the figures for our own Irish Army was stressed and restressed by the Deputy.  Therefore, it <Col N="1804" /> was made quite clear to any gullible Irishman: &ldquo;If you want to take up an Army career as a profession, by all means go to the British Army.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>I hope the Deputy did not mean it.  I would not believe that he did.  I do not think it was an honest speech.  We have also the Deputy's Party and every public organ in this country representing the Deputy's Party criticising the Government as having indulged in an orgy of expenditure.  I am sure when the Budget comes on, we will have the Deputy criticising the lavish, foolish and extravagant expenditure of this Government in respect of its Departments.</P>

      <P>A country that, in the present emergency, can improve the Acts which are at present on the Statute Book in respect of conditions of service is a country to be proud of. In so far as comparison between the L.D.F. and the Army is concerned I would point out that the L.D.F. is an emergency force and that many of the young men and middle-aged men who have manned that force have left their various occupations for life whereas the Army is a career adopted by young men.</P>

      <P>There is a permanent Army in this country and there is an emergency service known as the Local Defence Force.  There is no just comparison between them.  Yesterday, the Deputy challenged many divisions here and he could only rally into the Lobby about half a dozen members of his own Party.  We know from himself that he has opposed this Bill from the very outset.  Again, I do not wish to be unjust, but I feel that he is rather jealous of the fact that another Minister has been able to bring in a much <Col N="1805" /> better Bill and a Bill which, I am sure, will do credit to the Minister and to the Government and will satisfy every impartial and honest soldier in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not attempt to follow Deputy Mulcahy in the maze of words which he has woven around his obsession&mdash;an obsession which arises, apparently, out of the fact that I did not consult the Defence Conference.  I am very sorry if I have hurt the Deputy's feelings by not doing that. I am sorry that he should have allowed it to drive him to take the action which he has taken in respect of this Bill, which is so urgently required by so many people who are in grave need and want at the present time.  Less than half a dozen members of the Deputy's own Party have taken any interest in this discussion, and, as Deputy Cooney has mentioned, the Deputy has been accompanied into the Lobby by a few straggling followers who had taken practically no interest whatever in the Bill.  Possibly that is because it is realised that the Bill contains something that is decent, something that is an improvement on the past, and something which Deputies could stand over. It has been amazing to me to find that Deputy Mulcahy divided the House on provisions of this Bill which in many respects were never brought before this House before.  There was never before brought before this House a section of any Bill which would provide pensions for nurses.  Yet Deputy Mulcahy considered it the correct thing to do to divide this House on the question as to whether or not nurses should get pensions, and he was able to influence members of the Labour Party who, probably through ignorance of what they were doing, who, probably, did not understand what they were voting for, followed him into the Lobby to vote against pensions for nurses who might contract disease, or who might be injured while serving the nation.  He went further than that.  He divided the House against a section which was providing for 1916 men.  I am directing the attention of Deputy Giles to this, to show him that my interest in the 1916 men is what it ought to be.</P>

I set out, because of the things I discovered as a result of these letters, to do through the medium of the Bill what I hope will be done when this Bill becomes, in fact, an Act.  I had not to be forced to do it.  I saw a situation developing and I took steps to deal with it.  Deputy Mulcahy did not have to come along and tell me to do it, nor did I consult Deputy Mulcahy about the matter. That is the only cause I can see for his wanton and wilful opposition to the Bill.  I call it wanton and wilful opposition for the simple reason that there are to-day a number of relatives of deceased soldiers eagerly waiting for this Bill to go through in order that they may receive the compensation which this Bill will afford them.  What does Deputy Mulcahy do?  He delays this Bill by word, deed and act, by every means in his power.

      <P>There is another point I want to make clear and on which the Deputy's mind does not seem to be <Col N="1809" /> clear.  That is the point that total or any other degree of disablement is not related to a man's economic but to his physical capacity.  The fact that a man is totally disabled does not necessarily mean that he is incapable of earning his livelihood.  There are men on the pension register who are drawing 100 per cent. disablement pensions and who are yet earning large salaries.  Take the case of the men disabled in the Glen of Imaal accident.  There are several of these men receiving at the present moment 100 per cent. pensions, but these men are capable or will be capable, of following some profession, trade or craft in which they are being instructed at the present moment.  Before these men left to go to St. Dunstan's, one of them sent me a letter which he himself had typed as a result of the instruction which he was then receiving in St. Bricin's.  It was a well-typed letter and he expressed the hope in the letter that as a result of the intensive training which he would receive in St. Dunstan's, to which he was being sent, he would be able to take up some position when he came back.  As far as I am concerned, I shall see, so far as it is humanly possible, that when that man does come back, he will be given a position which he will be capable of filling.  The same remarks apply to his colleagues who are also being trained, one of them, I think, in telephony. The other, I think, was taking up some form of gardening.  The main point is, that the impression that a 100 per cent. invalided soldier cannot earn his living is completely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain sum was allotted to me as a result of my discussions with the Government, a sum with which I was allowed to do what I liked, and the total sum, as dealt with in this Bill. worked out at 52/- per case a week.  I could, if I so desired, have left the 26/- there.  That would have been a simple expedient for me.  I could have divided the remaining 26/- as a wife allowance or a children's allowance, but I want to point out to the House that the average family in the Army-and we have taken a census of this-is two-and-a-half children.  I had to ask myself this question: was I <Col N="1810" /> going to penalise, the single soldier by giving him only 26/- a week and prevent him, if he felt like it at some later stage, from entering matrimony?  I had to ask myself was I going to leave him with 26/-, or if he never entered into matrimony, was it fair that he should be compelled to exist on 26/-? I answered that question by saying that I did not think it was fair in view of the fact that the average family was, we shall say, three.  I understand that the average family in the case of the Widows and Orphans' Pensions Act is also three.  I understand further that analogous figures in the census of 1936 are 2.7.  If all these figures are correct, I think I was fully justified in taking the action which I eventually took&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of converting the 26/- into 42/- and making 10/- available for a wife.  There will be introduced, I hope, at some period in the existence of this Government or whatever Government succeeds it, some system of children's allowances or family allowances. If that is brought about, the situation which the Deputy has been contesting for the last couple of weeks will have righted itself.  The children will automatically get the allowance and they will not be prejudiced by reason of the fact that they are benefiting under this Bill.  Their allowances under this Bill will be there and the children's allowance under the other system will be there also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make clear that if, by any chance, any of these men died, the widow would be entitled to the same allowance which, as a married woman, she is getting while her husband is alive.  In other words, she would get the married allowance granted to a serving soldier, so that, so far as she is concerned, she would be no worse off financially by the death of her husband, save that she would lose whatever assistance he might have been able to give her.  But she would get the same pension or marriage allowance she was getting before he died.  I might inform Deputy Mulcahy <Col N="1811" /> that that allowance was recently increased by this Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked if Section 8 could take away any allowance or pension granted to a widow and children either in their own right or by way of a military service pension or in virtue of the service of a deceased soldier by way of allowance.  The answer is &ldquo;No.&rdquo; There is no such intention and there is no such power.  The section refers explicitly to gratuities and to gratuities only.  It empowers the Minister to recover gratuities already given <i>ex gratia</i>, or otherwise, in respect of death or injury.  It is the Minister for Defence who will decide.  I have my own feelings about that and I am sure that, if Deputy Mulcahy were Minister for Defence, he would have similar feelings.  The question is left to the discretion of the Minister for Defence and not to that of the Minister for Finance, so that, in that respect, I should be prepared to say that the position was fairly safe.</P>
    <P>Section 9 merely provides that the widow and children of a deceased officer shall not be entitled to a double pension in respect of the same bereavement-one under the pension scheme and the other under this Bill.  For instance, the widow of a lieutenant is already entitled, under certain circumstances, under the Defence Forces Pension Scheme, to £45 a year.  Under this Bill, she might become entitled to another pension of £60 a year.  The object of Section 9 is to ensure that she cannot draw both.  Naturally, she is entitled to draw, and would, of course, draw, the larger sum.  Under this Bill the sum is larger to the extent of £15.  She would, therefore, be drawing £15 more than she would draw by way of the pension to which she would be entitled by reason of her husband's service.</P>
    <P>I have no apologies whatever to make to anybody in regard to the improvements which have been introduced by this Bill.  I am very proud to have been the instrument through which these improvements have been <Col N="1812" /> brought about.  I am very proud that I have introduced for the first time pensions for nurses.  I am more than proud to be the instrument of providing pensions for men who fought in 1916 and who have now become incapable by reason of age or illness, or for any other reason.  I am proud to be able to say that they will be entitled, for the first time, to a pension of the type described in this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that, during the last three-and-a-half years, I could have brought forward any of the matters I brought forward here.  I have explained that, at the Defence Conference, I repeatedly stated that the 1927 Act could not stand.  The Defence Conference exists simply for the purpose of getting national unity behind the defence effort.  It has nothing to do with the administrative affairs of the Army or of the other voluntary forces.  We had no reason to think that the Minister was not approaching this matter in a reasonable way.  In the winter of 1940, when the first Emergency Order dealing with compensation in connection with the emergency was issued, I challenged the basis of the Order here and, with the assistance of the criticism offered in the Seanad subsequently, succeeded in getting that Order changed.  I have been urging since that the L.D.F. and A.R.P. would have to be provided for and that the 1927 Act could not stand.  I just want to make that definite statement in view of the Minister's suggestion to the contrary.  I did not want to discuss the matter or apologise in any way but, in view of the Minister's positive statement, I think I was entitled to say what I have said.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is due to my stupidity, but I think the Minister was not quite categorical in his reply. If an unmarried soldier who has been making a contribution of a few shillings a week to his mother, dies, will the mother be able to contend that, up to the extent of that contribution, she was dependent upon him or will she be told that she was not mainly dependent on her son's contributions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say on this Vote, but I am interested in the fact that the Department has now taken over control of both carrageen and kelp.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the House whether the fact that <Col N="1820" /> the Department has taken control of the purchase and sale of kelp will adversely affect the market?  While he may tell us if that is not so, will the Department be the only purchaser; will competition be excluded?  The same applies to carrageen.  I should like to know definitely whether or not the control of carrageen refers to carrageen for human food or carrageen for industrial purposes.  Industrial carrageen is sold in bulk; you take it at its face value.  I sincerely hope that, in taking control of the entire production of carrageen, the Department will see that a just price is paid to the gatherers.  I should like to have an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that the taking over of control of the carrageen industry by the Department is not purely with the object of excluding competition in the buying of carrageen from the people who gather and save it.  That would be a very arbitrary step to take.  Seeing that competition is excluded, and the Department has taken control of the entire industry, I should like to know how the price will be arrived at? Will the Department take a standard price and pay accordingly, or, when selling the carrageen in the British market for industrial purposes, will it endeavour to secure the best price from the people who use it and pay a proportionate price to the gatherers? I should like to know, too, how the price of carrageen for human food will be arrived at in the absence of competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to kelp, I do not see why the Department should exclude from the market people who come in and buy kelp without a test, provided they pay the gatherers and burners what those gatherers and burners consider a good price&mdash;a price apparently better than the Department will be prepared to pay, because otherwise the kelp would not be sold to the Department's competitors in the market.  The people who buy it without a test are taking their own risk.  I should like to know why they are being excluded. They are not getting an article about which there is any deception; they are buying in bulk, and taking their own risk.  If the kelp were being sold to those competitors of the Department <Col N="1821" /> as something other than it actually is, I could understand the position, but when there is no test applied to it, I do not see why these people should be put off the market.</P>
    <P>I am very curious to know the reason for it.  Perhaps it is that the Department want the entire production of the country for the purpose of manufacturing fertilisers.  If that is so, one can see the importance of it, and the justification from the national point of view.  With regard to the export of it, if, in fact, any of it is being exported, I do not see why any limitation should be put on competition.  It is all right if the Department is selling a high-class article of a specified grade; it is then for the Department to see that the article sold is what it purports to be, but I suggest that if other people intervene in a manner which helps to raise the price of kelp, if they are anxious to buy it in bulk without any test, if there is a surplus which can be exported and which commercial buyers are prepared to purchase, I think it would be a hardship not to allow them to do so, and I cannot imagine that the Department would take such a step arbitrarily in order to put competitors out of the market and keep the material to themselves.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear more with regard to the supplies of raw material for the spinning mills.  Assuming no addition is made to present stocks, over what period would those stocks permit the mills to run?  As to the new machinery which was to be brought into the country for the purpose of treating Irish wool, I should like to know if it will be suitable for treating Scotch wool, the wool of black-faced sheep suitable for use in Gaeltacht tweeds.  Are steps being taken to enter the market and purchase as much of this wool as will keep the mills going for at least two years?  The price of wool now, seeing there is no export market for the wool of black-faced sheep, is moderately low.  Relating the price of tweeds to the price of wool, one can hardly see any justification for it.  The wool of black-faced sheep is not bringing more on the market than in pre-war days, and the price of tweeds is almost treble what it was then.  I should like to know has <Col N="1822" /> the cost of production gone up to that extent.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be a sound policy for the Department deliberately to inflate the price of our tweeds as against tweeds produced from imported wools or Merino wool-deliberately to inflate the price in order to make an extra profit, because the opportunity presented itself.  That would not be a sound policy.  If the Department can produce a tweed at a reasonable price and take a reasonable profit from it, it would be more desirable.  I should like an explanation of the price of raw wool in this country as related to the increased price of tweeds, and I should also like to know what are the prospects with regard to the spinning mill that is on loan, according to the Parliamentary Secretary's statement.  Will it be capable of producing all that is required?  What is the position with regard to the supply of dyes?  Has the Department the variety of dyes essential in order to keep up the high class quality of these tweeds?</P>

      <P>The satisfactory progress which has been made in this Department and which has been continued particularly during the past few years is deserving of a tribute, and in paying it, it would not be out of place to add the predecessor of the present Parliamentary Secretary.  The increase in the amount of wages paid is shown in the figures that have been submitted in the statement read out by the Parliamentary Secretary this evening.  In 1935-36, the wages in the woollen Gaeltacht industries were £9,802 and the wages for last year were £58,100.  In regard to sales, the figures for 1935-36, were £34,432 and last year they went up to £177,513.  This is a very remarkable tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary and it is reflected in the industries throughout the country, in the increased earnings of the workers and the increased income from the sales of the manufactured goods.</P>
      <P>The amount voted for these industries has increased by leaps and bounds in the last few years, and it will be generally conceded by those in touch with the industries that the money is very well spent.  There is very little one can say by way of criticism of this Estimate, but there is just one point that I would like to make.  In his statement, the Parliamentary Secretary refers to the difficulty that will be experienced in regard to materials.  He tells us that they have been very successful in this matter so far and that every effort is being made to maintain supplies, though it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain the materials. For some years past, some people outside this House, and some inside it, have been asking the Gaeltacht Department not to depend so much on outside supplies of machine-spun yarns but to try to develop the hand-spun and hand-woven cloth.  If the Department concentrated entirely on machine spun yarn they would undoubtedly have to depend on such yarns when there is a scarcity of material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is plenty of wool available in the country, and there is no reason why the Department should not now <Col N="1825" /> depart from their previous policy and develop that business and manufacture a hand-spun, hand-woven cloth.  That industry was existing in Donegal in Gaeltacht areas, but for some time past it has been practically dormant owing to the scarcity of material.  For some months past, the industry has been booming again.  There is no reason why the Department should not anticipate events.  They should not allow the excuse that there is a scarcity of materials to cause a lag in any way in the furthering of the hand-spun, hand-woven industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of the hand spinners and weavers in south-west Donegal to express their appreciation of the action of the Gaeltacht Department in putting at their disposal some plant that the Department had, and was not using, and which is used for the carding of wool for the hand-spun material.  It was a very gracious act of the Department, and one which was very much appreciated by the hand spinners and weavers.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter.  I notice here an increase of £734 in sub-head D (1), which refers to the salaries of charge-hands, etc.  Deputy Breslin has referred to the workers in the toy industry at Crolly, and has made a plea for them.  I would like to join in that plea and include in it the weavers and workers in the various spinning centres throughout the country.  It is common knowledge that the people engaged in the knitting industries of private firms were granted a bonus some weeks ago. I do not know whether the Department has given that increase to their workers or not.  If not, they should follow the lead.  It was given by a tribunal set up by the Department of Industry and Commerce, and that bonus is to apply to the workers in the knitting industries and weaving industries. I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and his predecessor on the splendid work that this Department is doing for the Gaeltacht industries.</P>

      <P>Sé seo céad mheastachán na bliana seo.  Ní misde a rá gur meastachán tábhachtach é, mar baineann sé leis an nGaeltacht. <Col N="1826" /> Tuigimíd an chaoi ina bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta agus an cruadhtan atá acu, leis an mbochtanas talmhan agus mar sin de.  An t-airgead atá á chaitheamh againn ar an nGaeltacht, ní hairgead in aisge é, mar tá rud á fháil thar nais againn ó na daoine atá níos luachmhara ná airgead&mdash;an teanga agus an cultúr a bhaineann leí.</P>

Maidir le ceist na ceilpe gur dhein an Teachta Mac Partholáin tagairt dó, ní mór dom cur síos ar sin i mBéarla mar do labhair an Teachta Mac Menamin ar an rud céana.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though it can be seen that the Estimate for the Gaeltacht Services this year is much less than it was last year&mdash;£24,979 as compared with £59,968 last year&mdash;that is not to be taken as indicating that there is any contraction of activity or any diminution of expenditure in connection with <Col N="1827" /> our work in the Gaeltacht Services. On the contrary, the gross total expenditure in the Gaeltacht shows an increase of £1,666 on last year, the figure this year being £217,699 as compared with £216,033 last year.  I think the best criterion of all, the best way in which to judge whether we are making progress or not in connection with the Gaeltacht Services, is to examine the wages that we are paying.  Deputy Brian Brady referred to it.  Last year we paid £47,270 in wages and this year we estimate that we shall spend £58,100, nearly £11,000 of an increase. All that money goes into the pockets of the people in the Gaeltacht, and as Deputies will see from the Estimate of £24,979, for every £ that this House makes available for the Gaeltacht there is nearly £3 going into the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin and Deputy Bartley referred to the question of kelp.  We have taken over control of the kelp and carrageen industries.  We thought it was necessary to do so in order to preserve them.  This Department first began to take an interest in the kelp industry in 1931 and 1932.  At that time there was a market for iodine with the result that the price of kelp made it worth while for the gatherers in the Gaeltacht to engage in the industry.  Owing to circumstances which intervened, the bottom fell out of the kelp industry after a couple of years, and the situation remained like that until 1941.  In that year, owing to the scarcity of artificial manures, a demand arose again for kelp, the result being that many people who never before had engaged in the kelp industry are now anxious to get into it.  We would not mind so much how many people went into the industry to derive a living from it if the genuine article was turned out in all cases, but what happened, due to the demand for kelp and the price that it was fetching in the market, was that people began to adulterate it, to include extraneous matter in it so as to make it bulky, as well as more money for themselves.</P>
    <P>It has been decided to keep all the <Col N="1828" /> kelp available in the country as a fertiliser. Of course, it is the farmers who will be using it in the end.  We want to make sure of two things: (1) that nothing will happen to discourage or undermine the industry or give it a bad name; and (2) we want to make sure that, when the farmers get this kelp as a fertiliser, they will be getting the genuine article.  That is why we have taken control of the kelp industry. As I said in my opening statement, the average price of kelp this year will be £8 per ton.  Some of it, I believe, will go to £10 per ton, but the average price will be £8.  The price compares very favourably with the price per ton paid for it last year, which was about £6 10s. per ton.  This year's price, therefore, represents an increase of 30/- per ton over last year.  I think the people in the Gaeltacht will be very well pleased with that price, and it should be an incentive to them to produce more.  So much for the kelp.  I have given the House a justification for the giving effect to the Emergency Order which controls the output and management of kelp.  Our Department, of course, will be the sole purchaser of kelp.  Deputy Bartley made reference to the question of agents.  There will be no outside agents from this on.  The kelp will be purchased through this Department and by its officials.  By that means we shall make sure that the people of the Gaeltacht who engage in the kelp industry will get as much for their labour as it is possible to give them.  As Deputies are aware, Seirbhise na Gaeltacht is not a profit-earning concern.  We do not want to make a profit on anything.  In fact, we do not even make ends meet.  We do not balance our budget.  There is always a margin on the wrong side, our policy being to put as much money as we possibly can into the pockets of the people in the Gaeltacht.  In this connection I should mention that no consideration of sparing money will be allowed to come between us and the carrying out of schemes in the Gaeltacht provided those schemes have a reasonable chance of success and will give reasonable employment.  But the difficulty is to find those suitable schemes.  It will tax our initiative and resourcefulness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1829" /> We shall continue to carry out that policy and I am sure that in taking control of kelp we will be able to ensure that the people of the Gaeltacht will get a higher price for it.  Of course there are different grades, and the value differs according to the iodine content.  Deputy Bartley referred to the test which is being applied to kelp. It is certainly an iodine test, because many people believe the iodine test is a fair one, and also an easy way of testing the commodity.  But we are not tied to that kind of test, and if there is a general demand for an alteration to a potash test instead of iodine we shall consider it favourably. There is a good deal of potash in kelp, from 18 to 20 per cent., I am told, and if people thought it advisable to have a potash instead of an iodine test I do not see why we should not have it, even though it is a more laborious way of testing it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin mentioned carrageen. We propose to purchase 44 tons of carrageen this year for the purpose of putting it on the home market as food.  Of course we shall purchase the very best quality but, as against the amount we propose to purchase, the great bulk of the carrageen will be exported, because there is not a sufficient market here for it and there happens to be at present a great market across the Channel.  We had also to take control of that industry owing to the increased price being paid for carrageen.  People were getting into the industry who never had anything to do with it; people who did not know anything about it, with the result that in many cases they were not handling it properly.  In some cases I understand people deliberately damped down the carrageen so as to make it heavy and get more money for it.  We are very much concerned about the carrageen industry as a whole, because we believe it is a source of revenue for the Gaeltacht.  For that reason we cannot allow anything that people might do because of carelessness, or in an endeavour to make more money, to interfere with the good name that the carrageen of this country carries.  That is why we have taken over that industry.  For the quantity we will buy <Col N="1830" /> we will pay a reasonable price.  When I say a reasonable price I mean that we want to put carrageen on the home market at a price that the people can pay, but for the quantity that goes out of the country, which will be 15 times as much as we keep at home, the owners will probably get a higher price than we could give.  The higher it is the more pleased we shall be.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin also referred to supplies of material.  We are not badly off as regards supplies of material.  Up to this we have been lucky enough to secure a fair share of supplies.  Of course, if the war continues for a long time we must naturally expect that a time will come when supplies will go short.  That being so, we have to husband our supplies very carefully, and that fact precludes us from expanding existing industries as we should like.  Deputy Brian Brady mentioned the question of supplies of wool and yarn for Donegal.  In that branch of the Gaeltacht Services we have confined ourselves to supplying weavers in Donegal with mill-spun yarn.  We have nothing to do with weavers in Donegal who make home-spun yarn.  People have been trying to persuade us that we should also take control of the home-spun industry, or, as Deputy Dillon mentioned in the House, do something in the way of giving an opportunity to those who make home-spun yarn to use mill-spun yarn on the warps, but seeing that we ourselves have not a great supply of yarn, since we have not succeeded in getting machinery for the mill at Kilcar, I do not see how we could lend ourselves to that suggestion. Neither can we compel mill owners to do so.  If there are weavers in Donegal who can weave and make use of home-spun yarn, and weave it into certain material and get a market, I do not see why they should not continue doing so.  It is a tradition with them in Donegal and I do not see why we should interfere.  There are plenty of sheep on the hills of Donegal and I understand there is a fine price for wool.  Any article they turn out there at present will fetch a good price on the market.  I do not think I should let this occasion pass without <Col N="1831" /> paying a tribute to the people of Donegal for the way in which they have preserved the weaving tradition. But for that we would be in a very bad way to-day.  The people of Donegal, and those who represent them, should feel proud of the fact that we have to depend on them, to a great extent, for materials.  Donegal certainly is the cradle of the weaving industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the bonus for the workers in the Irish statement I made.  At the commencement of this year all these workers got a rise in pay.  There was a revision of their rates of pay.  It was not a flat rate all round, as some got more than others, according to the circumstances of their work.  The revision was carried out in accordance with the general scheme of increases for people engaged in work for the State.  They were given a rise in pay to meet emergency conditions.  Whether an occasion has since arisen for another rise in pay is another matter.  I do not think it has.  In any case we cannot tie ourselves to that at the present time, because the cost of living will, I dare say, be going up, but these matters can be considered from time to time in the light of the circumstances then obtaining.  I do not think any other point was raised in the course of the debate.</P>

      <P>Last year, arising out of criticism, I referred to the cost of the Office of the Minister for Justice, and I think I made it pretty clear that, although it appeared to cost more than in 1927, it was due to the fact that certain branches of the Department had been abolished as separate entities and incorporated in the Minister's Office, such as the Prisons Board. There was also a separate branch administering the affairs of the district courts.  This is all done now by the Minister's Office.  If these are all taken into consideration, the actual cost of the Office of the Minister for Justice will be found to be less than it was in that year.  But, as it appears in the Estimate, of course it looks more.  A comparison was made between the cost of the Gárda some years ago and the present cost. Actually, including the 71 I mentioned to-day as having been recruited, we have 49 Guards fewer than we had last year.  But the cost has gone up, because every year there are increments for a number of men.  I think Deputy O'Higgins last year took for comparison the year 1927.  At that time the majority of the Guards were young men.  They were almost on their commencing pay.  They had got only a few increments.  In addition, only a small proportion of them were married.  Since then a large number of them have come up almost to their maximum and 4,000 more are married and are getting a rent allowance.  Naturally that would cause a big increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also another very big new item to which I must refer, and that is the Local Security Force which is provided for in the Gárda Estimate.  Undoubtedly, there is that increased cost, but these are the <Col N="1833" /> reasons for it.  We have not got sufficient mean in the force.  As I mentioned in reply to a question to-day, as a result of the recent examination we got only 71 recruits when we expected to get at least 100.  Therefore, I am making a new Order, which is only to last for two months, whereby 120 of those who failed to qualify in that examination will be re-examined.  By that means it is hoped to get up to 100 extra men.  As I say, the force is really under-manned.  Of course, all that cannot be done without extra cost, but it is up to me to explain the reason.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to say that crime is still on the increase.  Last year I referred to the stealing of bicycles and the larceny of goods in short supply. I am sorry to say that there has been a very big increase in these crimes in spite of the efforts of the Gárdaí and the help that the L.S.F. have given. Up to the year 1938, the average number of indictable crimes reported to the Gárda authorities each year was about 6,500.  In 1938, the actual number was 6,769.  The figures for subsequent years were:&mdash;1939, 8,202; 1940, 9,014; 1941, 13,180; 1942, 17,322.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Nearly three times as many.  The increase is accounted for almost entirely by an increase in the number of burglaries, house-breakings and larcenies.  Burglaries and house-breakings increased from 1,093 in 1938 to 2,510 in 1942, that is, more than double the number.  Larcenies increased from 4,370 in 1938 to 12,865 in 1942.  Nearly 60 per cent. of these crimes were committed in the Dublin Metropolitan area.  As might be expected, the percentage of prosecutions has fallen with the increase in crime. During the ten years from 1929 to 1938 inclusive, prosecutions were instituted in respect of approximately 72 per cent. of the total number of indictable crimes reported to the Gárda Síochána.  So far, prosecutions have been instituted in respect of only 54 per cent. of the crimes reported in <Col N="1834" /> 1942.  That is unsatisfactory as compared with the years prior to the war, but it shows an improvement on the years 1939, 1940 and 1941, when the percentages were 49, 50 and 51 respectively. It compares very favourably also with the percentage of prosecutions shown in the criminal statistics for Great Britain before the outbreak of the present war.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputies will understand that it is practically impossible for the Gárdaí in cases of that kind of larceny to keep track of them.  They do their best when they are reported. People do not commit these crimes when the Gárdaí are looking on.  Most people know what the reasons are. People are short of commodities and I am afraid our morality is not as deep-seated as it ought to be.  People who never had any record of crime unfortunately are being now drawn into the net.  The explanation of that may be shortage of commodities and perhaps the loosening of moral standards which generally occurs during war time.  But the fact remains that that type of person who was never known to the police is unfortunately becoming known to them now.</P>
      <P>A type of larceny which has increased lately, particularly in Dublin, is the stealing of overcoats from restaurants and hotels.  In the Dublin Metropolitan area, for instance, there were 507 cases of overcoats being stolen from restaurants and hotels.  Of course, the police could not possibly prevent that.  People controlling hotels will have to be very careful.  I think they ought to adopt special measures for dealing with that, such as the ticket system, or something like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the House was very interested in the position with regard to the larceny of bicycles.  I should like to give the figures for the present year and for some of the preceding years.  The number of bicycles reported to the Gárda Síochána as having been stolen in 1938 was 1,160; in 1939, 1,402; in 1940, 1,532; in 1941, 2,779; in 1942, 3,395.  There has been a slight improvement in the Dublin Metropolitan area, where fewer have been stolen than last year.  In 1941 <Col N="1835" /> in the Dublin Metropolitan area there were 2,140 bicycles stolen; last year there were 1,976 stolen.  Of course, that is still an enormous number.  I must pay tribute to the L.S.F. for the help they are giving in dealing with this matter.  In addition to their other work, they are going around to parking places and inspecting the numbers on bicycles.  In that way they are helping to recover a number of stolen bicycles.  They are giving valuable help in that respect.  They are also doing patrol work.  As is known, they have also the powers of arrest.  The same powers have been given to them as can be exercised by the Gárda up to the rank of sergeant.</P>
    <P>But, in spite of all the help we are getting from the L.S.F., there has been a very big increase in crime, which is very disturbing indeed.  It is not very pleasant for me to have to say that it has increased in my time.  The only excuse I can make is that it is war time and that I was unfortunate enough to come into office at a time when these things were more likely to increase than otherwise.</P>
    <P>Then in regard to political crime&mdash; last year I was able to say that, happily, no political murder had occurred during the year.  I am sorry to have to remind the House that, since last year, three members of the Gárda were foully murdered.  In one case a man was sentenced but in the other cases, so far, the culprits have got clear.  The police had suspicions of certain people but they have been unable to lay their hands on them.  In one case a man was tried and was acquitted, but the police had some suspicions of people whom they were not able to catch.  There were also four attempted murders, one only quite recently.  A man is lingering between life and death and I do not know if he is out of danger yet.  A very young man is suspected of having shot him.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious situation.  One of the most alarming things that I see about it is that there is a very young, irresponsible body in the city of both boys and girls, and they are very, very <Col N="1836" /> dangerous.  We have had to intern some of them.  I do not know what their objects are at all.  It is not the I.R.A.  They have some new name for themselves.  I suppose they do not think the others are extreme enough for them.  We suspect one of these of having shot this last man.  I am not happy about the position at all.</P>
    <P>This organisation is not very numerous. There are very few in the country but they are very dangerous.  Everyone knows that apparently they are prepared to stop at nothing.  During the year the Gárda succeeded in seizing a large amount of arms. 101 machine-guns, mostly Thompson guns, were seized in County Mayo, as Deputies may remember.  They were practically all new Thompsons that had never been used.  Some of them were in cases with books of instructions, just as they left the factory.  There were 34 rifles captured during the year, 101 revolvers and pistols, and over 5,000 rounds of ammunition as well as quantities of gelignite, blasting powder and large numbers of detonators and grenades.  I have no idea how much ammunition they may have, but, apparently, if they want to murder anyone they are never short of a gun.</P>
    <P>On the 31st March last, there were 99 members of the I.R.A. in custody, under sentence; 83 were serving sentences of penal servitude.  On the same date there were 536 men and 18 women detained under the Emergency Powers (No. 30) Order, 1940, that is, interned.</P>
    <P>I must say I am very sorry to be in the position of having to say what I have said.  Last year I was hoping we would not have to deal with any murders, anyway, but, unfortunately, this year, my hopes were not realised.  We had these three murders and four attempted murders.  As far as that organisation is concerned, as I have said, it is not numerous, but it is dangerous to that extent.  I am inclined to think that it is breaking up and that some of these things are being done by individuals.  At least, I am hoping that is so and the police are of that opinion. Sometimes organisations of that kind become more dangerous when they start to smash up.  I may be wrong there.  I think everything that the <Col N="1837" /> police and the Government can do to grapple with it is being done.  We have met with a fair amount of success in getting arms from them.  We did capture some of the people engaged in the murders but there are others we did not get.  I hope it may be possible yet to lay hands on them and, if it is, we will deal with them as they ought to be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister finds himself in the unfortunate position of having to tell a very pitiable story of the social conditions of the time in this country.  I do not think any blame can be laid either to him or the officers of his Department in reference to the condition of affairs that exists.  He has dealt with a number of matters to which I had intended to draw attention because they ought to exercise and very seriously concern the minds of the public in this country at the present time.  We have been used in discussions on the Department of Justice Estimate for many years to deal almost exclusively with political crime.  Those crimes, serious as they are even yet, form, I think, the minor part of the Minister's statement to the House.  The really serious condition at present in the social life of this country is the appalling and alarming spread of ordinary crime among practically every section of the community and, as the Minister has pointed out&mdash;it is a matter that has struck everybody who has been watching the progress of affairs in this country for the last two or three years&mdash;the amazing thing is the number of people who are now charged with and convicted of crimes who have never before had a criminal record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The picture that the Minister has presented of crime being increased practically threefold in a period of four years is one that ought not to be let pass without very serious consideration in this House.  I think there is something wrong with the social condition of the country which leads to that state of affairs.  The Minister gives as the only excuse or justification that he can find for the condition, the war.  I think the war cannot be blamed, at least to any very great extent, for the condition we find in this country at <Col N="1838" /> the present time.  I am afraid it is really due to a complete lack of respect for the law which is creeping into every section of the community.  If that is so, then, I think, we are faced with a very serious position indeed.</P>
    <P>Our Circuit Courts, the Central Criminal Court, and our District Courts are at the present time cluttered up with work.  Every court, I think, dealing with criminal matters is largely in arrear.  The Minister has referred to the greatly increased number of burglaries and larcenies, thefts of bicycles and of overcoats. He did not refer to the still more striking increase in the number of what I may call ordinary murders as distinct from political murders.  I think there is nothing more startling in the social life of this country than the murder trials that have been held in Green Street from time to time in the last few years.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not blame the Minister or the officers of his Department or the Guards for the state of affairs that exists, but I think something will have to be done, not merely to punish the crimes that are committed, but to bring about some condition of public opinion whereby crimes can be prevented rather than punished.  The ordinary courts of the country, as I have said, are cluttered up with work.  Juries are overworked. They are sitting practically continuously. If all the work were to be reached, there would have to be sitting in Dublin, and probably in most centres throughout the country, a criminal court of some kind or another, dealing with big or small crimes, every day throughout the entire year.  I do think that is a state of affairs which calls for the most serious consideration of all sections of this House and all sections of the community who desire to see this country in a state of ordered progress. I do not think that the war can be solely blamed for the condition of affairs that exists at the moment.</P>
    <P>We have the condition that a large number of our people have gone to England.  In a state of actual warfare in England, the great majority of these people, so far as we know, <Col N="1839" /> are able not merely to obtain work but to work hard and to live in a state of complete honesty.  It is an extraordinary contrast, therefore, that so many of our young people can go abroad and live, in an atmosphere of practically total war, honest, decent, hard-working lives while here at home in a Catholic country, a country with every facility for keeping on the right path, we have the condition of affairs which everybody knows to exist and which the Minister has described in his speech to-day.  For some months past I have pondered on this problem from my own point of view, endeavouring to find out what was the cause or whither we were going.  I have wondered whether we have not by our Acts in this House created far too many offences.  Even a lawyer earning his living by his profession is unable at present to keep up with the vast number of offences that have been created in recent years by statute, by regulation, by order and by rule.  I think I said last year, in the course of some debate here, that it was practically impossible for even the most law-abiding citizen at present to go through an ordinary day doing his daily work in a decent way without committing an offence of some kind, probably unknowingly.  We are surrounded by a body of rules, regulations, orders, and statutes, creating all sorts of petty offences.  I do think that the multiplication of offences that has been created by the legislative machine is, to some degree at least, responsible for the rather strange outlook on the legal position, and is to some extent responsible for the disrespect in which the law is held in this country.  It may be that economic conditions at home drive young men, when they are not able to get work, to endeavour to pick up easy money by way of bicycle stealing, coat stealing or any form of petty theft, but large numbers of hitherto decent, respectable citizens have, for whatever reason, found themselves in the dock in Green Street and in the Circuit Courts throughout the country for the first time in their lives.</P>
    <P>I cannot think that it is merely the <Col N="1840" /> atmosphere of the war, which has touched us so very little in this country, that is responsible for that outbreak of crime.  I base that view on the contrast I find between workers in this country and people working and living in an atmosphere of total war in another country who are apparently able to live their lives honestly without resorting to any forms of petty theft.</P>
    <P>Apparently the same stock can go to a foreign country and live honest, decent lives under war conditions, but here living under totally different conditions a very large number of our young people are not able to live honest, decent lives.  It may be that one of the reasons I have given is responsible&mdash;that atmosphere of disrespect for the law.  It may be that economic conditions here are such that young people are not able to get employment at home of such a type as will enable them to keep themselves in decency or honesty.  It may be that some of the people who are responsible for the growth in our criminal calendar do not want work.</P>
    <P>I have said repeatedly that, so far as my experience goes as a politician and in social work, the vast majority of the people of this country are anxious for work.  I have come across very few people who shirk work.  The real tragedy lies in the inability of people to get work.  I think there is a very serious problem facing us here in the conditions that have been described by the Minister.  I do not profess to be in a position from the point of view of social science to put any sort of finger upon a definite cause for it, but this is a problem that has been operating in my mind for months past, irrespective of this Vote, and I do think that the war is not responsible for it, that there must be some more deep-seated reason for this disease of bicycle-stealing, coat-stealing and all the other forms of petty theft, burglary and larceny which have manifested themselves in recent years and which are, in my view, a symptom of a very serious disease in the body politic.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister, the Gárda <Col N="1841" /> and all of us should bend our minds to the prevention rather than the conviction of crime.  The conviction of crime, I do appreciate, is a necessary element in the preservation of the social structure but, so, far as I am concerned, I would prefer to prevent the commission of one crime rather than secure the conviction of a dozen crimes.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us from the statistics which he has in his Department how the record of what might be called petty crime compares with that of more serious crime&mdash;that sort of crime which is dealt with by the district justices by way of summary jurisdiction. How has that increased and how does the increase compare with greater crime?  I have a belief, which I may say is not founded on any accurate statistics, that the Guards are more concerned in the discharge of their duty with the capture of petty criminals rather than the prevention of big crimes.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason I should like the Minister to consider what statistics he has as regards the increase in what are called petty crimes, dealt with summarily by the district justices.  How many of these have been recorded in this Department?  How many prosecutions have been brought and in how many have convictions been obtained? How does the increase in that crime, tried summarily, compare with the extraordinary and amazing increase in the more serious form of crime?  It may be that the Minister will be able to set my fears at rest but I do say that I have a firm conviction that more energy is being expended in bringing children to so-called justice for robbing orchards or in prosecuting men for not having lamps on their bicycles at night than in the prevention of crime, as distinct from the conviction of people who commit crime.  I certainly want to be reassured on that point, and I should be glad if the Minister were able to give sufficient information to show that the belief I have is not well founded.  I think it would be far preferable to let a certain amount of that sort of petty crime pass by, to wink at it if you like, in certain circumstances.  We have so many offences of one kind or another <Col N="1842" /> on the Statute Book at the moment, that it is impossible to ensure that the law is observed in its entirety.  I do, therefore, suggest that, so far as possible, the Minister should take steps to secure that public opinion be fully informed of the gravity of the present situation.  I do not think that the public really realise the serious condition which exists from the point of view of ordinary crime.  If the public are fully informed in that regard, it may be that a better public opinion will back the Minister in his efforts to prevent and punish crime.  My inclination has always been not to secure merely the conviction of criminals&mdash;I recognise the necessity for that, of course, not merely from the point of view of punishment but from the point of view of its deterring effect&mdash;but to prevent crime if such can be done.  My view has always been that the really primary object of the criminal law is not to punish, and not so much to deter from as to prevent crime.  I do not regard it as any great credit to the Gárda to be able to say: &ldquo;We have secured&rdquo;&mdash;a word I detest&mdash;&ldquo;convictions in so many cases.&rdquo;  I am sufficiently imbued with the conservative traditions of my own profession to dislike the attitude of prosecutors which is fashioned on that of a certain advocate&mdash;to use a joke current in my own profession&mdash;who used to go out after prosecuting in criminal cases and say: &ldquo;We won all those cases.&rdquo;  My view is that a prosecutor for the State should act perfectly fairly and impartially, put all the facts before the judge and jury and let the judge and jury discharge their respective responsibilities. I do think that I see in the conduct of prosecutions in this State rather a tendency to &ldquo;win&rdquo; cases.  I see, or think I see, in the conduct of prosecutions by the Gárda, a tendency to secure&mdash;to use a word I dislike&mdash;convictions rather than to prevent crime.</P>
    <P>My appeal to the Minister is that he, the officials under him and the Gárda, for whom he is responsible, should bend their energies not to securing convictions for petty forms of crime, not to securing convictions against young children for robbing orchards or against adults for not having lamps on <Col N="1843" /> their bicycles, but to preventing the commission of crime.  Without the co-operation of the public, the efforts of the Minister and the Gárda will be futile.  To secure the co-operation of the public, it is necessary to create, since it does not exist at present, a healthy public opinion.  The public will have to co-operate in connection with the protection of their own property. They will have to co-operate in connection with the prevention of crime.  One of the reasons for the situation which exists at present is the extraordinary number of ridiculous offences we have created by statute and regulation. This has tended to bring about a disrespect for the law.  It is not right to pass by this serious problem, simply saying: &ldquo;There is the problem; it is probably a result of the war; we cannot do anything about it until the war is over.&rdquo;  I say that the condition that exists at present is not&mdash; certainly not to the extent of the greater part&mdash;due to war conditions. It is due to some more deep-seated cause in our own people&mdash;lack of moral sense, lack of education or economic conditions.  It is due to some extent to the failure of young boys, who have left school, to obtain work.  It is due to the cost of living, to the low wages paid for work when it can be obtained, to the tendency to depress wages at a time when prices are soaring, coupled, perhaps, with the notion that there is a lot of money knocking around somewhere. These factors tend to create a state of unrest amongst young people and a desire for easy money.  The problem is deep-seated and is social in character.  It will have to be tackled unless serious injury is to be done to our country.  I do not think it can be dealt with merely by saying that the war is responsible for it.  I am not criticising the Minister for that statement. Many people have that view, and it is against that attitude of mind I have spoken this evening.  It is easy to say that the war is responsible for the alarming increase in crime amongst all sections and for the attitude of most sections of the community towards crime, but that is merely shirking the serious problem which confronts the Minister and the country.</P>

      <P>The picture which the Minister has painted this evening is, indeed, a very sombre one so far as social and economic conditions in the country are concerned.  The Minister must be truly alarmed by the statistics which he has given to the House and by the deductions which can be drawn from the statistics.  I know, and the House knows, that the Minister for Justice is a Minister with a very high standard of civic rectitude and that he would not countenance any type of negligence which would allow such a condition of affairs to develop. So far as one can judge from contact with them, members of the Gárda Síochána are zealous and enthusiastic in the discharge of their duties.  One cannot see that, in respect of their activities, there is any cause for complaint in this House.  I think that these crimes&mdash;multiplied crimes, if one is to judge by the Minister's statistics&mdash;arise out of conditions which, if not actually attributable to the war, have, nevertheless, their roots in the war and in the emergency situation.  In that respect, I do not entirely agree with Deputy Costello. I think that it is perfectly true to say that the general deterioration in economic conditions has produced a condition of affairs in which persons unable to get adequate wages to support themselves, their wives and children, succumb to the temptation of endeavouring to get, in the form of negotiable goods, a type of income which they could not get by following an honest occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole economic position has seriously deteriorated in the past four years.  Evidence of that is furnished by the substantial increase in the cost of living.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been compelled to admit that the cost of living has increased by, approximately, 60 per cent. since 1939, and that wage rates have increased by less than 10 per cent. in 12 important industries dealing with transportable goods.  If you have a situation of that kind, in which the £ will buy only 12/6 worth of goods, as compared with the position in 1939, you, inevitably, create social conditions in which masses of underpaid people are subject to the temptation to <Col N="1845" /> steal, and in which their economic life is such that they have to choose between being honest and hungry and being dishonest and, probably, being saved from the worst pangs of hunger.  The Government's economic policy is contributing in a very substantial way to the creation of conditions of that kind. Money can be saved at too high a price. One can economise at too high a price.</P>
    <P>I think the drift of the Government's whole economic policy is such that it is depressing the standard of living of large masses of the people, and that, in order to escape from the worst ravages of the Government's social and economic policy, as expressed in their outlook on wages, persons are resorting to theft, who, in ordinary circumstances and in normal times, would probably be able to maintain themselves and their families in tolerably decent conditions without resort to dishonest practices.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true, of course, that a new type of crime has arisen in recent years.  The shortage of bicycles and the impossibility of buying them, except at very high prices, has provided a temptation to steal bicycles.  I definitely believe that this is a wartime vice which will probably subside when bicycles again come on the market and when they are within the purchasing power of the mass of the people who require them; but we nevertheless have a very serious situation&mdash;one in which economic conditions are contributing to make criminals of persons who formerly were honest citizens and one in which the shortage of certain types of commodities is producing a dishonest outlook and a dishonest frame of mind on the part of hitherto honest citizens.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be gravely concerned with the statistics he quoted to-day, but the most unfortunate part of the Minister's statement, as I see it, is that there does not appear to be any indication as to the steps to be taken to curb the present very dangerous tendency.  I know that the Minister is as anxious as anybody in the House, or as every other high-minded citizen, and probably more anxious, to be able to report in a much more favourable <Col N="1846" /> way on social conditions in the country, but I listened in vain for any indication from him as to the steps he was taking to curb the present highly dangerous tendency.  I hope that, before the Vote passes, the Minister will give us some idea as to the direction in which he proposes to travel.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello has referred to &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; murders in this country.  I do not think anybody in the House or outside it will deny that the public have been presented during the past 12 months with details of the most revolting murders with which it is possible for any country to discredit itself.  We have read in the papers of the most dastardly murders carried out with a premeditation which simply gives rise at once to the question of whether we are civilised people at all.  Cases were reported in the papers months ago, the details of which were positively gruesome. It is scarcely possible to believe that these crimes could be committed in a Christian country and in a country in which approximately 93 per cent. of the people profess the Catholic faith. I think it is a very alarming state of affairs and, unfortunately, from all appearances, we are not at the end of that state of affairs.  There are in fact new vistas of murder opening up before us and I think the Minister and the whole House must be concerned with such a situation.</P>
    <P>We saw in our own life-time the experiences of the last war, during which the moral tone fell so disastrously that murder was quite a common-place thing.  Happily, in this country we have not yet been visited with open warfare, but there is no doubt that war produces a type of excitement and a lowering of the moral tone which inevitably lead to murders, to outrages, to theft, to larceny and to general disregard of and disrespect for the normal majesty of the law.  The problem before the House, the Minister and the Gárda Síochána, is: what can we do to arrest that tendency?  This, after all, is not a cannibalistic island; it is not a country in which the people profess no faith. This is&mdash;and let us always remember it&mdash;a country in which our people have an anchorage in tenets of faith, in <Col N="1847" /> which our people have a philosophy of faith and a philosophy of life.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that some serious and concerted effort ought to be made, by the use of the Hierarchy, if necessary, by the use of all organisations in good standing throughout the country and by the use of the influence of local authorities and public men of goodwill, to appeal to the philosophy of our people, to their concepts of life and religion, in order to try to lift the nation out of the morass of crime into which I am afraid it is unfortunately falling, if one is to judge by the Minister's figures.</P>
    <P>I believe it is necessary to initiate a campaign of appealing to every citizen to regard dishonesty, burglary, larceny and assaults on one's neighbours or one's neighbour's property as something as detestable as treachery to the nation.  Our people will never desire, and no people desire, to be branded as traitors.  What we are doing, judging by the criminal statistics read by the Minister, is raising a question as to our fitness to be regarded as a civilised community, and I think the Minister might well take the line of utilising all these agencies of good, all these agencies of public well-being, in order to endeavour to initiate throughout the country a campaign which will reverse the direction in which we are travelling and bring conditions of life in this country back to the relatively happy position in which they were before 1935.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that in that direction the Minister will get an abundance of co-operation. The Estimate of the Department of Justice is not a political Estimate.  Every good citizen and every member of the House is as anxious as the Minister to try to put down crime, and the Minister will get an abundance of co-operation and goodwill in any effort he makes in that direction.  I for one do not want to blame the Minister because of the increasing crime and nothing is further from my thoughts than to blame the Gárda Síochána.  I know that both the Minister and the Gárda are doing their best in very difficult <Col N="1848" /> circumstances&mdash;circumstances not of their creation, but which are crowding in on them and making it impossible for them to exercise efficiently that type of supervision, prevention and detection which is so necessary, if we are to maintain civilised conditions in this country.  I hope the Minister will indicate that he is desirous of utilising the beneficial influences of the high personages and organisations to which I have referred and I hope he will be able to see his way to do that, and avail of the goodwill which is there for the asking.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one matter which I think is of considerable importance from the standpoint of the rights of all the citizens.  In the early days of this State, in the early days of its new-found liberty, it was apparently thought necessary, because of the effervescent condition in which we were then living, to deprive members of the Gárda Síochána of a vote at election times.  I have never been able to understand why a Civic Guard was deprived of his vote.  The only persons who are deprived of votes in present circumstances are imbeciles, inmates of workhouses and criminals in prisons.  Every other citizen is entitled to vote, but the only persons who are lumped in with imbeciles, inmates of workhouses and criminals are members of the Gárda Síochána, probably the most law-abiding people in the country.  Whatever case might have been made for depriving the Gárda of votes in 1923 and 1924 or even for continuing that restriction in the rather yeasty years which followed 1922, I do not think it is possible for a civilised community&mdash;particularly one in which the democratic way of life still obtains&mdash;to justify depriving the Gárda Síochána of the right to vote at elections. I think that in Great Britain or in the Six Counties the members of the police force are permitted to vote, and I do not know on what grounds, under our Constitution, the Government of this House can justify depriving a member of the Gárda Síochána of the right to vote.</P>
    <P>We had a speech recently from the Tánaiste&mdash;the Minister for Finance&mdash; in which he said that any citizen who <Col N="1849" /> did not take a serious interest in politics was a worthless citizen or an imbecile; that, in fact, taking an interest in politics amounted to taking an interest in the science of life and the science of Government.  He applauded every citizen who took an interest in politics, and he simply derided, and wrote down as low-class people, those who did not take an interest in politics.  Now, there is probably no member of the Gárda Síochána who has not an interest in politics.  Some of them may want to vote for this Government&mdash;although God knows why they should wish to do so&mdash;while others might want to vote for the Fine Gael Party or for the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, I would say that that would show the high-water mark of their intelligence. In any case, I hold that they are entitled to vote.  We allow them to vote at a local election, and yet we deprive them of the right to vote at a general election.  I think that the law in that respect is out of tune with our Constitution, and I think that now, in the year 1943, 21 years after the establishment of the Irish Free State, the Minister ought to acknowledge frankly that members of the Gárda Síochána are law-abiding citizens, that they are intelligent people, that they can be trusted to go into a polling booth, mark a ballot paper, and take an interest in their country, and that, in fact, there is no reason to-day, or never was any reason, for depriving these men of a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, I think, is a democrat, and I do not know how he can possibly justify depriving the Gárda Síochána of votes.  Nobody wants to see the Gárdaí made a plaything of any political Party.  I certainly do not want to see anything like that happening, but I certainly do not think that they should be bracketed with the other unfortunate people whom I have mentioned, and who are deprived of a vote to-day. <Col N="1850" /> I hope that the Minister will deal sympathetically with this matter, and that he will hold out some hope to the members of the Gárda Síochána that they will not be regarded as a kind of political &ldquo;untouchables&rdquo; when it comes to the matter of recording their votes at an election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement fell into three compartments, so to speak.  First, there was the comparison of the cost of his Department, on the various services which he administers, compared with the cost some years ago.  Secondly, he dealt with the incidence of what has been described as ordinary crime, and of political crime, within the last few years.  I think it would be well that an expression of sympathy should go out from this House to the relatives of the members of the Gárda Síochána who have lost their lives in the execution of their duty during the last twelve months, and, in fact, during a much longer time.  If my recollection is correct, there was a good deal of criticism, some 11 years ago, regarding the cost of the Gárda Síochána, and the public were told that if a change of Government took place, very remarkable economies could be effected and that that institution could be run at a much smaller cost.  Unfortunately, those very optimistic pronouncements of that time have not materialised. We were told at the same time that if there was a change of Government we would have quite an improvement in the political situation, and that political crime would cease, but unfortunately that has not taken place either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to disagree with my colleague, Deputy Costello, in so far as he seems to think that the incidence of crime is not due to the war.  In so far as shortages have occurred&mdash;and they are the rule rather than the exception just now&mdash;to my mind, they are very considerably responsible for quite a number of the larcenies that have taken place.  As a matter of fact, it has surprised me how honest people in country districts have shown themselves to be.  For instance, where there are wooden gates, or where trees are <Col N="1851" /> available, and these people are short of timber&mdash;particularly considering the very high price that is charged for fuel at the present moment&mdash;I think it is a great tribute to the honesty of the people that things have not been worse.</P>
    <P>From my experience also, I have to differ with my colleague, Deputy Costello, as regards the influence of the Gárdaí.  As far as I can judge, their influence is directed almost as much towards the prevention of crime as towards its detection.  Of course, Deputy Costello has more knowledge of these matters than I have, but that has been my experience.  Now, there is, at any rate, in this House to-day a very different approach to the rule of law and to public order from what there was from 1927 down to 1932. There is no Party in this House now giving any countenance whatsoever to outrages, whether political or otherwise. That was not so from 1927 down to 1932, and I think we had better admit that these are national defects and that we should admit whatever faults we have committed ourselves, since the inception of this State, so far as the rule of law and of public order in this country is concerned.  It is regrettable and lamentable that after two decades of freedom in this country there are people so misguided and so wrong in their outlook and approach to anything in the nature of national culture that we should have the name and fame of our people disgraced by the shooting of police officers or peace officers in this State.</P>
    <P>Now, for many years past, we have been told that there is only one Party in this country standing for national culture.  What is national culture?  I should say that in this State, or any other State, the basis of national culture would be the good character of the people.  In so far as the Minister's story to us here this evening is concerned, there is a marked deterioration in our national culture, so far as our national virtues are concerned, such as honesty and truth.  In some of the bishops' pastorals, particular and special attention was paid to those two <Col N="1852" /> matters.  I think we are very much indebted to their Lordships for dealing with that matter.</P>
    <P>It comes far better from them than from politicians.  Quite an amount of the time of politicians is devoted towards minimising the virtues of their opponents, assuming that they have any.  Their Lordships do not do that. They confine themselves to the denunciation of sin. Unfortunately, we are not rivals of theirs in that connection.  A period of war in the world usually promotes, certainly stimulates, disorder. The Minister, I am quite sure, has read or heard of Saint Augustine's definition of States.  He said that all States are founded on wrong-doing&mdash;of course, it is a very long time ago since St. Augustine made that statement&mdash;and he urged in support of that statement the retort of the pirate to Alexander the Great, when he said: &ldquo;I, who rob with only a small ship, am called a pirate, while you, who rob with a great fleet, are called an Emperor.&rdquo;  One of the things that give rise to a loosening of morals at a time when there is a scarcity of various commodities amongst the people is the contemplation of the huge profits being made by others.  That is what we call black-marketing.  We have miserably failed to solve that problem in this country.  There is scarcely a person one meets who cannot tell of transactions in that market, and of the enormous sums of money which have been made in it.  Another disability that we have &mdash;I am sure the Minister appreciates it&mdash;is the existence of the Border.  All the trafficking that goes on across there has a demoralising effect on the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately.  I notice from the figures which the Minister gave us that a rise in those petty crimes&mdash;I suppose that is what one would call them, larcenies, house-breakings and so on&mdash;was noticeable from 1938.  May I tell the Minister that in the year 1938 only 1,000 persons were <Col N="1853" /> added to the lists of those in employment? It was the first year since the foundation of the State that the number was so small.  In the five years, 1927 to 1931, there was an average of 11,400 people added each year to the numbers in employment.  Those figures may or may not offer an explanation, but they do certainly show that there must have been a larger number of persons unemployed in the year 1938 and in the following year than in any other year since the foundation of the State.  I would suggest to the Minister the need for some kind of an inquiry. Let it be formal or informal; let it be a commission or a committee, but at any rate let it be composed of people who will bend their minds to this problem&mdash;the problem of the prison system; whether there can be an improvement in that system; whether in any cases where convictions have taken place and persons have been sent to jail those persons have deteriorated there; in other words, whether what one might call the unbaptized criminal gets baptism there and goes on with his work when he comes out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 40 years ago there was a notorious criminal in Great Britain. I will not mention his name, so that none of his relatives, if there are any of them left, can feel in any way aggrieved.  He had powerful influence, and the Government of the day said in Parliament that the law officers of the Crown knew no law under which he could be prosecuted.  One member of the Opposition mentioned a particular section of an Act, and the gentleman was arrested that evening. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to seven years' penal servitude. His solicitor went down below to have an interview with him before he was taken away to the penal settlement, and the criminal was seen to put his hand to his mouth, and he then fell dead on the floor.  What was the sequel?  Within a fortnight, three other cases of suicide occurred, and in each case the same poison was used. At that time the particular poison was practically unknown, but the name of it was disclosed in connection with the first case.  I wonder how far the reporting of cases of murder or of <Col N="1854" /> burglary or of larceny, and the various places where those things take place, has an effect upon weak-minded people who might not otherwise think of those crimes?  Would the Minister consider it wise to include on that committee, if he gets one, a journalist or two, in order to get their views on that subject?  Looking back over the last six or twelve months, unless my recollection is entirely at fault, there have been two or three murders of very much the same type, or at least having some of the same characteristics. I noticed the same thing many years ago in Great Britain.  I think the first of them was the Moat Farm murder, and within five or six months several others of the same type had taken place.  Those cases had been fully reported in the Press.  The reporting of those cases may not have had any effect, but it is rather an extraordinary coincidence that there should be three or four murders of the same sort.</P>
    <P>In connection with those small crimes such as larceny and housebreaking, I think the Minister ought to have in his Department or in the Guards some officer who would go into the circumstances of the individual in each case where there has been a conviction, in order to discover what are the pre-disposing causes, if any; whether the crime was committed merely to get money; whether it was due to want; whether it was that the person concerned had not got an overcoat or something of that sort.  It is a very strange thing that the stealing of overcoats only started when there was a shortage of materials or overcoats.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister's experience has been in the last few years, but I never got as many applications from people in all parts of the country for old clothes, boots, overcoats, and so on.  I would require to have a wardrobe which would rival that of the Queen of Sheba in order to be able to supply all the demands that have been made in that connection. The only recommendation I can make to the Minister is that he should endeavour to secure&mdash;I think he will not find it impossible&mdash;the support of the <Col N="1855" /> ecclesiastical authorities in connection with those matters.  Public honesty and truth should be the very foundation of our national culture.  Sometimes I am appalled when I hear or read of certain phases of history given expression to by untruthful historians. One is disposed to wonder what type of mind is likely to result from the reading of these untruthful accounts, either of history or of other events.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the advantage that there is in this country more general support for the rule of law and order than there has been since the foundation of the State.  It may be that it will still take a long time to let people see that, if the country is going to be built up, it will be built up more firmly and securely through the co-operation and assistance of all classes in the community than through those spasmodic interruptions and those slaughterings of peace officers of the State.  The responsibility for improving the condition of affairs in this country is widespread. It is not the responsibility of any one section.  No section of the community can evade its responsibility in that connection. I think it would be advisable, if it were only for the purpose of getting information, to have an inquiry into this matter and see how far, if at all, the circumstances under which we live and the influence of the cinema, of which I have no experience whatsoever, but reference to which I do hear occasionally, affect the minds of the people.  If the cinema has a deteriorating effect upon the public, then it is the duty of public representatives to take their stand against it and to correct any evil tendencies that may exist.  It is our duty and responsibility, having got the freedom that we have got, to prove that we are worthy of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the debate on the Vote on Account, I expressed alarm, not so much at the increase in the Estimates for the various services, but at the meagre results which were being obtained notwithstanding the increase in expenditure. I think the various services that come under the Minister's Department have <Col N="1856" /> increased very considerably during the last few years, and, while the Minister will never accuse me of being unduly sympathetic to his efforts, either in the administrative or the legislative sphere, I certainly do not attach full blame to him for the pitiful story which he has had to tell to-day of increases in every type of crime.  The increases have been all around.  There has been an alarming increase in petty crime, an increase in political crime, and a very alarming increase in the number of murders of the worst kind. These murders can be described as political and ordinary murders, although it would be very hard to attach to some murders which have been committed during the past few years the term &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; because, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, they have been of a most dastardly kind.</P>
      <P>Taking the more serious matters first, I think that Deputies not only feel sympathy over the members of the Gárda who have given their lives in the defence of law and justice, but they also have a deep sense of respect for such worthy officers of the State. Those men have laid down their lives in order that the simplest and feeblest citizen might be in a position to record his vote.  They have laid down their lives to protect the rights of all the people, rich and poor, feeble and strong, and it is only right that every section of the House should join in expressing deep respect for those men and in expressing the feeling that is universally felt by all responsible parties in the State&mdash;a feeling of condemnation for all crimes of a political nature.  There will be, I expect, an opportunity in the near future for members of all Parties to take a share in the formation of public opinion and I hope that when publicly expressing their views they will make it clear that under no circumstances will political crime ever again be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next in the order of magnitude we have an enormous increase in murders and other major crimes.  It is hard to believe that this country is Christian when one reads the reports of such crimes.  We are entitled to ask ourselves what is the cause of such an <Col N="1857" /> increase.  It may be due to the present unrest, though it is hardly likely.  It may also be due to the fact that owing to the disorganisation of supplies and the demoralisation caused by black-marketing, the moral standards of the people have been lowered.  It is very easy to pass from small offences and petty crimes to the contemplation of more serious offences.  A big responsibility rests, not upon the Minister, but on his colleagues who have so mismanaged the supply and distribution position.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that there are other causes which must be taken into consideration in addition to the present emergency situation.  The strongest force which could operate in support of the maintenance of peace and order is the moral standard of our people.  The moral standard of our people rests mainly upon the education which our people receive in early life.  By education I do not mean the education which is imparted in our schools and colleges, but the education which young people acquire through their occupations or lack of occupations and through their various forms of amusement.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that nothing is more conducive to serious crime than to have young people, scarcely out of their teens, allowed to remain at a loose end, not having regular steady employment and thereby acquiring habits of idleness and vice.  The main consideration, therefore, should be to ensure that our young people are given the opportunity to acquire a taste for industry and steady work.  They can only do so in early life.  There is no doubt that many of our young people to-day are not compelled to engage in industry and in steady employment to the same extent as in former years. The opportunities for steady employment do not exist.  In addition, I think the Minister should bear in mind that, in the formation of character, the influence of the cinema must be taken into serious consideration.  Nobody considers for a moment that such amusements do any injury to adults or even to young people in steady employment, but, in the case of young people who have practically no employment, <Col N="1858" /> who have nothing to do all day and who at any and every opportunity spend their time in picture houses, thereby having their mental make-up formed by what they see and hear in such places, the cinema certainly has not a good influence on them.  I think the Minister should look into that aspect of the difficulty with which he is faced.</P>
    <P>It has frequently been pointed out in the District Courts, in regard to minor crimes, that the motive behind their commission was to get money for the purposes of amusement, particularly to attend the cinemas.  The real cause behind those crimes was that the moral character was built up by frequent attendances at those places of amusement without having it at the same time counterbalanced with a sufficient amount of useful employment. It should be possible to ensure that, for the future, our young people will be given more work and a better training in life, that they will be given opportunities to engage in steady employment from their school-leaving age until they reach manhood and womanhood, so that there will be no intervening period of idleness or lack of control.  The latter is, I think, the real cause of the growth of crime here. Whatever may be said about the moral character which our people acquire in schools and colleges, and which is built up by their religious training, it is, I suggest, offset to a great extent by the type and character of the amusements which are being provided for them, as well as by the failure of the State and of the community to provide our young people with steady work.</P>
    <P>The Gárdaí, I think, have been grappling with this menace of growing crime to the best of their ability.  It is rather discouraging to find, at a time when so many of our citizens have come forward to give their services to the State through the Local Security Force, thereby assisting the Gárdaí in the carrying out of their ordinary duties, that their public spirited action has not resulted in any improvement in the maintenance of the law.  That ought not, however, to discourage the Minister from continuing to call upon <Col N="1859" /> the best of our citizens to give their services to the Gárdaí, because whatever difficulties may arise, there is no doubt but that the latter will be strengthened in every possible way by having respectable and responsible citizens co-operating with them in the maintenance of order.</P>
    <P>In regard to the ordinary duties performed by the Gárdaí in the prevention of crime, I have expressed on a former occasion the view that the methods employed by police in this and in perhaps other countries are not sufficiently up-to-date to be effective in dealing with the clever type of criminal.  We must, of course, remember that at the present time crime has extended to all sections of the community, to people in every stratum of society, so that the Gárdaí are up against very clever criminals.  I think I suggested before, in regard to the patrolling of our cities and towns, that instead of having only uniformed Guards on beat duty, there should be more frequent and more active patrols of plain clothes members of the Gárdaí and of members of the Local Security Force.  These should be provided with bicycles to enable them to get from place to place silently and speedily, thereby making the operations of criminals, such as burglars and housebreakers, far more difficult than they would be if they only have to deal with uniformed members of the force. In regard to serious crime, I think the methods of investigation could bear improvement.  I believe that as in other countries, where serious crime is committed, especially if it is of the organised type of murder, that all persons likely to have any knowledge of the crime either before or after its commission, or any knowledge of the circumstances relating to it, should not only be questioned by the Gárdaí, but that machinery should be set up through which they could be brought before a court of inquiry.  That would not entail fresh legislation.  It would only mean bringing the regulations for the holding of inquests up to date, having, perhaps, a more efficient type of investigator at the inquest and a <Col N="1860" /> full shorthand note taken of all the evidence given.  I think that such a practice prevails in other countries. If it were adopted here it would get over a lot of the difficulty which arises in regard to statements taken by the Gárdaí, which, subsequently, are often the subject of much questioning as to the manner in which they were obtained. This is not a Party matter, as every Deputy is anxious to be helpful to the Minister, and to do everything possible to co-operate with him in establishing respect for the law, and in bringing to justice those who violate the law.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that this Estimate was taken so early because it has brought a certain amount of gloom into the House.  The Minister in his statement painted a very gloomy picture.  We all know that he is a worthy Minister and that he enjoys the respect of every Party in the House.  He is one of the Ministers for whom I have great respect because he is a man of his word and always speaks what is in his mind.  If other Ministers acted in the same way it would be for the good of the country. The story that the Minister told us was a sad one in regard to the increase of crime.  We could understand that in a war situation.  In view also of the scarcity of goods and the black market there is bound to be a certain amount of petty larceny prevalent, as it is easy to get money in that way.  That situation will disappear I believe when the war ceases.  I am, however, concerned with the foul murders that were committed in this State during the last 12 months.  To describe them in their true category, they were foul political murders.  The time has come when the reason for such political murders should have died out.  It is unfortunate that there is a certain type of people in this country who resort to such foul murders and who attack police officers who are only doing their duty.  The Government must, however, take a certain amount of blame for a good deal of what has happened since they came into power.  If they would repudiate their own past or if the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>There is at present disillusion with regard to the independence of this country and about social conditions.  It is my belief that if social conditions were tackled in a more energetic way, in the proper way, both by the previous Government and by this Government, we would have got rid of many social evils.  Work and wages are what will bring about contentment amongst the people. If they had work and wages there would not be so many petty larcenies or any political disturbances. It is because there is no work for them that some of our people are unsettled.  I believe that the majority of our people are good people.  It must <Col N="1862" /> be admitted that a certain amount of civic responsibility is lacking amongst them.  There are many criminals abroad who could be brought to justice if the people did their duty and assisted the Garda.  I know that many people are hedging and shelving their responsibility in that respect and, as a result, the Guards cannot do their duty as they would wish to do it.  If there was a sound sense of civic responsibility abroad, and if there was not so much crawling and cowardice on the part of some people who are afraid to say what they know, many persons who are now outside would be behind jail bars and would not be sheltering in houses where they are not wanted.  It is an unfortunate state of affairs that some of the chief officers and men in the Civic Guards have to give their lives in the course of their duty on behalf of people who will not assist them.  If the Guards got a little more help crime would disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that we should have more investigation into the origin of the crimes that have occurred for some years past, to see how we could cope with them.  There has been great comment for some years on the fact that there seems to be no code of justice and that every judge seems to have his own ideas when dealing with petty larcenies.  One judge may give a person six months' hard labour for larceny, while another judge for a similar crime will let an offender off with a caution.  In other cases where one judge would impose a sentence of a year's hard labour another judge would for the same offence let the offender off with a caution.  In my opinion, we want a better code of law that would deal with crimes of a similar nature in a regular way.  If a person commits an offence there should be a certain sentence laid down for it.  That would help to create more civic spirit.  It was unfortunate that the Minister had to paint such a gloomy picture but, in view of war conditions and social conditions, I suppose we could not expect anything better.  Taking into account the foul murders that took place it <Col N="1863" /> would seem as if we were producing a lot of &ldquo;thugs&rdquo;, because these murders were the foulest and the dirtiest that it is possible to commit.  What is behind these murders?  Nobody can say why they were committed.  I tell the Minister that he will get every help from Deputies on all sides of the House and from the people in the country if he produces a new code of law, because the present code is bad and people are beginning to feel fed up about it.  They expect criminals to receive a sentence for offences that they committed but very often they find that offenders get off lightly or are soon let home, while offenders in petty cases are taken to jail in the Black Maria.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is deeply to be regretted that crime is on the increase in this country and that it is the sad duty of the Minister to comment on that increase.  So far as his responsibilities to the country are concerned, Deputies have promised to give him every possible assistance in trying to stamp out that crime and have condemned it in the strongest possible terms.  It is, of course, unfortunate that crime should be on the increase in a country like this where you would expect a very high standard.  However, I do not think we should try to exaggerate the picture, bad and all as it is.  There is a good deal of petty crime, due to the circumstances in which we live, the shortage of supplies, the fact that money is plentiful and that there are people willing and ready to pay any money for certain goods which are in short supply which is an incentive to people to rob and steal and plunder and by fair means or foul to get goods in order to get a handsome reward.  Possibly in a large measure the petty crimes and larcenies are due to that.  It will be very difficult to stamp that out while this emergency lasts, but it requires very strict control and rigid supervision to keep it down to the minimum at all events and, even more than that &mdash;what is sadly lacking, I suppose&mdash;the <Col N="1864" /> willing assistance and co-operation of the public as a whole.  I am afraid in a large measure that is absent.</P>
      <P>While I am inclined to criticise the Government rather severely at times in connection with other matters, I think it is very hard to lay any blame at their door, except perhaps that strict supervision and control of prices and distribution of supplies were not started in time.  In recent months they have tried hard to establish a proper and effective control and distribution of supplies.  Possibly better ways might be found, but to a great extent they have tried to do that.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate and a very sad state of affairs that very decent and capable members of the Gárda force have been foully murdered in the exercise of their duties, and we must join in sympathy with the Minister and with the members of their families.</P>
      <P>I am not so much inclined to agree with Deputy Cogan that this increase in crime is all due to the cinema, because it appears to me a rather strange situation, if it is due to the cinema, that there have been quite a lot of crimes in rural districts recently where you would imagine the cinema would not have any great influence&mdash; crimes mostly amongst the farming community unfortunately.  But we must face up to the situation that there have been a number of such crimes recently.  I do not think the Deputy can attribute them to the influence of the cinema.  There must be some other influences at work.  On the whole, I think, we ought not to be unduly alarmed about it, because I do not think there has been any serious increase in crime.  It is, of course, well to comment upon it and be ever on our guard, especially the Minister who is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two little matters to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  The first is the low pay of certain officers in county registrars' offices where there is a considerable amount of money passing through.  In many cases these are <Col N="1865" /> married men with big families.  It appears to me to be a scandal that the State should offer such a low rate of pay to men in responsible positions who are handling considerable sums of money collected by the county registrars for the Irish Land Commission&mdash;arrears of annuities on warrants, etc.  There have been two or three cases of men in such positions who have absconded.  In a great measure I think that is due to the fact that these people are underpaid. I think it is a very bad example for the State to give to the general community.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I wish to call attention is the pay of the Gárda, especially of recruits.  I think it is as low as £2 per week.  I suppose the Minister could not tell us off-hand.  If I had known that we were taking this Vote as early as this I would have put down a question to elicit some information from the Minister as to the pay of the Gárda, classifying them into various groups.  I think a commencing salary of £2 a week is shocking, particularly if you want to attract the best material in the country into the Gárda.  I think it is regrettable that a salary as low as £2 per week should be offered to any man in such a position.</P>
    <P>There is another problem that has struck me lately about the Gárda, and that is that there are a number of Gárdaí now well over 20 years in the service, possibly a figure round about 3,000 men, who within a few years will be due to retire.  I wonder has the Minister or the Department thought anything about that problem.  Are we to retire 3,000 men at once or will we spread their retirement over a period? It is time to be thinking out a scheme of retirement for the 3,000 men or so who were recruited when the State was set up over 20 years ago.  I am merely drawing the Minister's attention to what I think may be a problem if some consideration is not given to the matter before the time for their retirement arrives.  It may arise within the next three, or four or five years.  The emergency <Col N="1866" /> problems at the moment may be occupying all the attention of the Minister and his Department.  However, it is always well to be prepared for such a situation and have a proper scheme ready.  To retire a big number of men within a short period would not be to the advantage of the force, and some plan should be worked out now.  Possibly it might be well to begin to retire some men even now for the purpose of spreading their retirement over a long period.  It might be good policy to begin two or three years earlier than in the normal course of events.  I merely draw the Minister's attention to that problem, as he might be able to give the House some information on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to some small matters in connection with his Department. Of course, it is very necessary that the Minister should watch matters very closely because of the many powers which have been taken by Ministers.  But, while I have the highest regard for the Gárda, some things have happened lately with which I could not agree, and with which, I am sure, no ordinary human being would agree.  No matter what people are tried for, no matter what the offence may be, it is a frightful thing to keep a man in a cell for 75 hours and&mdash;if my information is right &mdash;not to allow him out during those 75 hours.  The Minister knows exactly what I am referring to.  I have made inquiries in the matter.  I think it is a frightful state of affairs.  I do not care who he is, if a man is put into a cell, he should not be kept there for 75 hours without being brought out. While I have the greatest admiration for the Guards and have always stood up for them, and will stand up for them to-day, I think that is a shameful state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that I would like to direct the Minister's attention to is in regard to recruitment for the Gárda. Many Deputies as well as I had letters in connection with recruitment for the <Col N="1867" /> Gárda on the last occasion that recruitment took place.  I am informed in regard to one case that a man who had his matriculation, leaving certificate and everything else, and who got his medical certificate and was called for early interview, was turned down and, after three months, was called up. I am liable to contradiction, but these are the facts as I got them.  When he was good enough three months later, surely he was good enough in the first place.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with the Gárda.  The position now is that the Gárda is open only to people with a university education.  A farmer's son who gets a decent education in a national school or monastery and who has as much intelligence as a university graduate is as much entitled to become a Guard as the university graduate.  I would ask the Minister to remedy that position.  The standard has been made so high&mdash;I do not know if the Minister is responsible but somebody is responsible&mdash;that it is only a university man who can get into the Gárda, a position which is paid at the low rate of £2 a week.  I heard Deputy Hughes referring to it.  I would warn the Minister that he will never save money by reducing the pay of the Gárda.  It is a difficult job.  The Gárdaí are liable to every temptation.  They have a good deal of leisure and, if they are not paid a fairly decent wage, they may get it in some other way, by blackmailing the trader.  Low pay would tend to drive the Guards into blackmailing the trader or someone else if they are stuck for £5 or £10.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have the matters I brought to his attention reviewed so that better conditions may be provided for the Guards and so that no man will be kept continuously in a cell for 75 hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice where film censorship is referred to, censorship of publications is referred to and I would like to ask the Minister does he not think it desirable, and that the time <Col N="1868" /> has arrived, for censorship of stage shows?  I do not have much time to visit theatres, but recently I have heard comments by people who are not by any means kill-joys or cranks who consider it is time we had censorship of stage shows.  I would be glad if the Minister, in replying, would give some indication as to what the attitude of his Department is in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as censorship of stage shows is concerned&mdash;I do not know if it is right to refer to it here&mdash; I have had no complaints about the position.  Unless there is a very big demand for censorship, my own personal inclination is, as far as possible, to keep away from it.  But, if there is a big demand for it, if there is great abuse of the stage, of course, it would be necessary then but I have had no complaints in that connection.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan referred to recruitment of the Guards.  I answered a question yesterday on that point.  The standard that was set for examination was rather high and there will be a conference between the Commissioner of the Gárda and the Civil Service Commissioners to consider the setting of a more reasonable standard.  In the meantime, most of those who were called for examination and did not come up to the required standard may be interviewed again and I think most of them, very likely, will be called.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to keeping people in cells for 75 hours, that is a very rare occurrence indeed and, if it occurred, must have arisen out of very special circumstances. I agree it is not a practice that ought to be resorted to.  It is not the practice.  I think it arose only in the very special circumstances of that particular case.  I quite agree that it ought not to be done.  It may be necessary to keep persons longer in Gárda stations on account of the difficulty of transport, but the idea of keeping a man in a cell for 75 hours&mdash;I am not admitting that that has been done but, if it did happen, I admit it would not be a thing that the Guards would like to do and it is not a thing that would <Col N="1869" /> be desirable.  I am not admitting that it did happen.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Gárda pay, there has been a change, as far as recruits are concerned.  For the first six months during which they are in the Depôt they will get £2 7s. 0d.  There has been an increase of 7/-.  When they leave the Depôt they will start at £2 17s. 0d. There is a rather steeper increase than there was some time ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what decrease the £2 7s. 0d. represents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I just cannot say.  I have not got the figures at my fingers' ends.  It was lower than it was some years ago.  I know they started at £2 10s. 0d. some years ago.  That was offset by increases in other directions, rent allowance, and things of that kind.  Deputy Giles referred to the different sentences imposed by judges. I think there is no way of getting over that.  It is not the law that is responsible for that.  The judge tries to make the punishment fit the crime according as the crime appears to him.  I would not agree that there should be a standard punishment.  That would be entirely wrong.  I think as long as we have judges they will have different ways of assessing the crime and the punishment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>But it was never given effect to, as far as I know.  On the general question of the state of the country, of course, it is very alarming to see such a big increase in crime and I am very much perturbed about it but <Col N="1870" /> I do not think we need be unduly alarmed because, whatever Deputy Costello may think&mdash;Deputy Cosgrave and others disagree with him&mdash;there is no doubt whatever that it is due to the war conditions which have created a scarcity of commodities.  I have no doubt whatever about that.  I think it is that people who have been used to having as much as they want of certain articles are not prepared to do without them.  I think the black market is the root of the trouble.</P>
      <P>Most of the black market operations are in goods that are in short supply. People engaged in the black market buy these goods, and so-called respectable citizens resort to the black market. We might as well face that fact.  People will not go without if they can get anything they require.  There is no use in saying that there is a wave of crime, or that any particular class of the community is responsible.  I believe myself that it is confined to very few individuals in the community, and I am quite satisfied, from what I can hear, that the increased crime is not due, as suggested by Deputy Norton, to the fact that some men are compelled to rob to provide for their wives and families.  It is largely due to people who want to get rich quick, not to those who want to provide for family needs.  If criminals did not get a ready market for stolen articles, I believe that there would be less of this class of crime.  I have heard myself of people boasting that they were able to get stuff that was in short supply.  There was only one way of getting these goods.  The people from whom they bought them did not steal them, but they bought them from some other parties who probably did steal them.  I have no doubt, as I say, that crime of this nature is due to the fact that people who were well accustomed to having certain goods in normal times are so selfish that they are not prepared to do without them now, and that they are prepared to pay enhanced prices for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some reference has been made to the desirability of asking the Church to <Col N="1871" /> help in this matter.  I do not think there is any necessity to do that, but anything that could be done in that direction is being done.  I am sure that the Church authorities are quite familiar with the circumstances, and in Pastorals and in sermons they are doing everything they can to discourage lying and dishonesty.  Probably it is due to the weakness of human nature that when people are up against short supplies they are not too scrupulous as to how they obtain them. Although I have stated that the number of crimes has increased by 17,000, it is not to be deduced from that that 17,000 individuals were concerned. One person might have committed ten crimes.  Some people make a habit of stealing, and one of these persons may be responsible for many crimes.  Taken over the whole community, the figures represent only one-half per cent.  In that way I think it need not be feared that we are a nation of criminals altogether.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave made a suggestion as to the desirability of curtailing the publicity of details of certain shocking crimes that have occurred in recent years.  He said that the publication of the details of these crimes probably resulted in the commission of similar crimes by other people.  I do not know what we can do about that.  I suppose the Press will always feature these sort of crimes.  They give very great publicity to them, but whether that has any effect in inducing other people to commit crime, I am not in a position to say, and I do not know that any good purpose would be served by going into a matter of that kind.  We have had unfortunately a number of these crimes recently, but let us hope there will be less of them in future.  There were, I think, four or five in the past year, and in proportion to the population I think that is not very alarming.  It is of course a very sad state of affairs to see them occurring at all, but I suppose in any community you will have people who will do things of that sort.</P>
    <P>So far as the prevention of crime is concerned, I agree with Deputy Costello that prevention would be <Col N="1872" /> better than punishment.  I must say that the Guards do all they can to prevent crime but it is very difficult to prevent people stealing.  When a man hangs up his coat in a restaurant, you cannot have a policeman there to see that the coat is not taken by somebody else.  The same remarks apply to bicycle stealing.  The thieves wait until the Guards are not about to carry out the crime.  I think that in these times people generally should be very careful about their property because undoubtedly there is that increase in crime and if people do not look after their possessions themselves one cannot expect the Guards to be everywhere. You cannot put a Guard in every shop, and it behoves people themselves to take more precautions to ensure that their property will not be stolen.  Some of the premises on which burglaries were carried out were very easily entered, and I think it would have paid the owners of these premises to employ a night watchman.  We cannot, as I say, provide a Guard for every shop.  The Guards are doing all that it is possible to do in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is all to the good that we have had such agreement in this House on the question of the prevention of crime.  I do not want to go back on the past, but I would have preferred if Deputy Cosgrave had not adverted to the attitude of this Party when in opposition.  I do not think it is correct to say that we ever countenanced crime, and I gathered from his remarks that that is what he suggested.  It may be that we were not very well trained in opposition and we may not have been quite as responsible as some people would desire, but I do not think it right for anyone to suggest that we at any time countenanced either political crime or any other form of crime.  I do not want to dwell to any great extent on that matter but I thought it rather ungracious on the Deputy's part to suggest that we ever did.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any evidence to support the suggestion of Deputy Norton that increased crime is due to the fact that some men have to resort <Col N="1873" /> to dishonesty in order to maintain their wives and children.  Unfortunately there does seem to be a big increase in crime as far as young people are concerned.  I have here a return, which I did not quote in making my introductory speech, which shows the number of cases in 1942 in which juveniles, that is, young people under 18, were concerned.  The number in 1942 was 3,340 as against 1,605 in 1939.  Generally it is not economic causes that make these young people steal.  It is rather extraordinary that Deputy Norton should say that the increase was attributable to the fact that men were compelled to provide for their wives and families.  I think most people are aware that it is people who have money, or at least a good number of them, who have been found guilty of larceny, people who want certain supplies and will not deny themselves. Unfortunately the poor have never been able to get all they want and now they are prepared to endure more privation than people in comfortable circumstances. I do not think there is any other point calling for comment on the Vote.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,430,394, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1944, for the <Col N="1874" /> Salaries and Expenses of the Gárda Síochána (No. 7 of 1925, No. 10 of 1926, No. 5 of 1937 and No. 19 of 1941); and for certain Expenses of the Local Security Force including Grants-in-Aid (No. 28 of 1939).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The net Estimate is for £2,178,394&mdash; an increase of £104,979 on the amount provided for the year 1942-43.  The provision made for the emergency bonus granted to nearly all the members of the Force is £129,346, so that but for this item there would actually have been a decrease of nearly £25,000 in the net estimate.  The sub-heads which show substantial increases are&mdash; Salaries, Wages and Pay: there is an increase of £103,858 caused by the grant of the emergency bonus.  The bonus is 7/- a week, and it is payable to all members whose total weekly remuneration does not exceed £7 13s. The civilian clerical staff at headquarters and the subordinate staff-cleaners, etc.&mdash;have also been granted a bonus involving an extra payment of £937.  Sub-head B&mdash;Allowances: An increased boot allowance&mdash;from £2 to £2 15s. per annum&mdash;is responsible for an increase of £3,088 on this sub-head. Sub-head C&mdash;Subsistence Allowance: The rates of these allowances have been increased, with the result that an increase of £1,500 in the provision is necessary.  Sub-head D&mdash;Locomotion Expenses: The increase here is £8,600. Of this amount, £8,100 is due to an increase in the rate of cycle allowance from £2 10s. to £4 per annum.  Sub-head E&mdash;Clothing and Equipment: There is an increase of £25,879 arising from the fact that no provision was made in 1942-43 for frocks, trousers, caps, chevrons and badges, as the wear of these items of uniform had been extended.</P>
    <P>The main decreases are: Sub-head H&mdash;Transport and Carriage: There is a fall in this sub-head of £16,680.  No provision is made for replacement of motor transport, for which £13,285 was provided in 1942-43.  Sub-head M&mdash; Compensation: There is a decrease of £3,000.  The Estimate is based on the expenditure for the six months ended 30th September, 1942, but any estimate <Col N="1875" /> in this matter must be conjectural. Sub-head O&mdash;Local Security Force, Expenses: There is a decrease of £23,468 due to the fact that it is not possible to obtain supplies of uniform cloth.</P>
    <P>Sub-head R&mdash;Appropriation in Aid&mdash; shows a reduction of £4,090.  It is estimated that the repayments of sums advanced to officers to enable them to purchase cars for use on duty will be lower than in 1942-43 by £1,350 and that the payment from the Road Fund will be £2,000 less.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say, in respect of the general position regarding larceny and robbery, whether any systematic attempt is being made to bring the whole personnel of the L.S.F. in the City of Dublin into active mental co-operation with the Gárda in regard both to reviewing the situation and helping to track down those engaged in these robberies and larcenies?  There is a great opportunity there to get additional eyes and ears developed in a systematic way to the advantage of the Garda.  If the general personnel of the L.S.F. were brought in completely, because of their contacts with the ordinary civilians, they would be able to develop a systematic attitude on the part of civilians in the city which would help the Garda a great deal.  In present circumstances, the Gárdaí must be in a difficult position <Col N="1876" /> and they cannot get as close to the general situation as they would if they could use the L.S.F. and, through the L.S.F., have contact with the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the matter which has been referred to on a Supplementary Vote.  I am not at all satisfied that full use is being made of the available material in dealing with the present position.  One cannot be satisfied with the present condition of affairs.  It is obvious that there is lack of co-ordination between the Gárda and the various auxiliary forces.  These should be organised to help one another.  I imagine that, if close contact were established between the Garda, the L.D.F. and the L.S.F. those responsible for offences which have become very common of late could be tracked down immediately. In fact, the machine would be so perfect that few people would risk the commission of such offences, knowing the probability of detection.  There must be utter lack of co-ordination between those organisations when these offences are committed in the numbers in which they are being committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that some Minister will have to review the entire position of the Gárda.  This House has passed much legislation which has been handed on to the Gárda for administration.  The offences in question are not appropriate to the duties of a police force. The House will have to take stock of what it has been doing for the past 20 years and consider whether the Gardaí are to carry out the function for which they were originally formed or whether they are to deal with matters which should be dealt with by the officers of the Department to which these matters relate.  In a small barrack, with three or four men and a sergeant, they are practically all kept running about discharging duties which are not police duties at all.  One could enumerate a dozen examples of such duties.  If an old age pensioner has to get a new book, it is the function of the Gárdaí to deliver it to him <Col N="1877" />&mdash;perhaps at a distance of five or six miles.  It is the function of the Gárdaí to see that there are no unlicensed bulls in any district.  The Gárdaí are so preoccupied with duties of this kind that they have little time to attend to criminal work&mdash;the work for which they are primarily paid.  It is high time that stock were taken of the entire position. It is quite useless to vote this huge sum of money if we do not co-ordinate all the available forces and forge them into a composite weapon to deal with the present wave of crime.</P>
    <P>I do not want to over-emphasise the position.  The Minister is as conscious of it as I am.  If the position requires energetic action, we should not shirk that responsibility.  It is opportune to do something more than has been done in the past.  I am at a loss fully to appreciate the causes of the present position.  If large numbers of our people had been engaged in the war and had accustomed themselves to bloodshed, one could more easily appreciate the position.  But that is ruled out of our consideration.  One is perplexed by the amount of crime in the country at present.  One could put forward various reasons, but they might be unjust.  It is for the Minister with all his officials at his disposal to arrive at a conclusion in the matter.</P>
    <P>On a former occasion, I pleaded for what Deputy Mulcahy has just put forward with regard to the co-ordination of these auxiliary forces and the Guards.  If some body of men put their heads together and arranged for their co-ordination, it would speedily bring relief to the Department and to the Guards, and would be a great source of assistance to the Minister in dealing with crime.  At this time twelve months ago, I felt that I should have dealt more fully with this matter than I did, but the House generally sat down and nothing of any particular importance was said, so I thought I should join in the general atmosphere of complacency which prevailed.  The events of the last 12 months make me feel remorse that, having arrived at certain conclusions with regard to events in the country, <Col N="1878" /> I did not deal with them more fully. However, I hope it is not too late to urge the Minister to take steps to adopt the suggestion which I put forward on an earlier occasion, and which has now been reinforced by Deputy Mulcahy.  The Minister will get the assistance and support of every law-abiding citizen in any steps he takes to deal with the position.</P>

      <P>I rise for a moment to voice my protest against the inadequate compensation paid to the widows and dependents of members of the Guards who lose their lives in the discharge of their duty, and to ask the Minister if he can do something to improve the lot of such people who lose their bread-winners in the course of protecting the lives and the property of the public.  The compensation paid is totally inadequate.</P>

      <P>With regard to the points raised by Deputy Mulcahy in relation to the L.S.F., I mentioned, when introducing the main Estimate, that in Dublin&mdash;I did not give particulars at the time&mdash;there are L.S.F. patrols varying from 120 to 130 per night on a minimum of three nights weekly.  In addition, selected men in each district, using a record of stolen bicycles, supplied by the Gárdaí, check up on bicycles in parking places at theatres, cinemas, etc., and in that way they have recovered a number of stolen bicycles.  In a number of cases, very efficient police work has been done by the L.S.F. and that movement is on the increase.  I think it has given good results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understood by the whole of the L.S.F. that they are part of that scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  An effort is being made to spread it all over the country.  As to the matter raised by Deputy McMenamin, there are two points of view about it.  I have often thought over the matter and I believe <Col N="1879" /> that in the future the Government will be inclined to give more work to the Guards&mdash;perhaps to have more Guards and to provide more money for them and to have fewer inspectors.  To carry out the amount of work necessary would mean multiplying the number of inspectors, and I think a movement in the other direction is more likely and more desirable.  There is a very high standard amongst the Guards, and I think the object will be to give them more duties, with probably more pay and a greater number of Guards.  A movement in that direction would be much more desirable than that they should be doing mere police work because in a large portion of the country there is very little ordinary crime.  We could not gather statistics about crops and so on unless we had Guards to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter over which I have no control whatever.  I brought a Bill in here last year and perhaps took an unusual line in prescribing that the Minister for Justice should make awards, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance. That was very definitely opposed in the House&mdash;so much so that I had to amend the Bill.  I was asked what right I had to deny the Guards access to the courts and I was practically forced by the Opposition&mdash;and I understand that the Gárda Representative Body itself desired the arrangement, too&mdash;to allow the Guards free access to the courts. These awards of compensation, which I am inclined to think are rather on the low side were made by judges after hearing the cases, and I am not responsible for them.  I think I said in reply to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney during the discussion on that Bill, that he could be satisfied that so far as any Minister for Justice was concerned, he would try to get as much compensation as he could for men under his control and <Col N="1880" /> that he could be relied on to stand up to the Minister for Finance; but the view of the House was that it was far better to leave the matter to be dealt with by the courts.  Unless there is some amendment of the law, there is nothing I can do.  In regard to the last case which came up, a case has been stated by the judge and the matter will be tried in the Supreme Court.  That, however, is purely a matter for the courts to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the tone of the Minister's remarks that he is not satisfied with these awards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter whether I am or not.  The fact is that it is not a matter for me.  When I tried to get the other arrangement accepted, it was turned down.  It was said that it was a new principle and that the courts were the body to decide this matter.  Whether I am satisfied or not does not arise.  It is the law which counts now.</P>
