      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the dissatisfaction caused by the awards to victims of the North Strand bombing; if he is aware that no compensation has been paid to the parents of Miss Lily Behan, aged 21 years, who died on 22nd August from injuries received; and if he will cause her parents' claim to be reinvestigated and compensation awarded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.  The answer to the second part is in the affirmative. Compensation under the Emergency Powers (Compensation for Personal Injuries) (Civilians) Scheme, 1942, has not been paid to Miss Behan's parents, because no evidence has so far been brought to my notice which would justify my deciding that her parents were partially dependent on her within the meaning of the scheme at the time of her death.  If such evidence is forthcoming, however, compensation will, of course, be payable. I might add, for the Deputy's information, that payment of £22 15s. 0d., the amount claimed in <Col N="791" /> respect of the late Miss Behan's funeral expenses, was made on the 15th November last.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the late Miss Behan was buried alive for eight hours after the North Strand bombing; that, even after the removal of clay and debris, and after stimulants had been administered through the mouth for a period of four hours, and also by injection, when taken away in the ambulance she was in a state of collapse and suffering from very severe shock?  Having regard to these facts, irrespective of what was the assigned primary or even secondary cause of death, does the Minister not consider that the terrible ordeal to which this girl was subjected as a result of the unfortunate bombing incident undoubtedly accelerated her death?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there not evidence that this girl contributed a substantial sum to the household, paying at least 7/- towards the rent, and as she was 22 years, was she not of some value to her parents?  I think the Minister should reconsider the case in view of all the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that Mrs. Christina Byrne, of Richmond Cottages, one of the persons injured during the bombing at North Strand Road, has been awarded £21 6s. 0d., which has been refused to her because she was in receipt of 7/6 per week national health disablement benefit; if he is aware that the 7/6 national health benefit is being paid to her for a disability which occurred to her seven years ago and which is not associated in any way with the injuries caused by the bombing, and if he will cause her case to be reinvestigated and reasonable compensation awarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 12 (1) of the Emergency Powers (Compensation for Personal Injuries) (Civilians) Scheme, 1942, as originally framed, provided for the deduction from compensation awarded to injured persons of any sums received by them under the National Health Insurance Acts during their period of disablement and it was due to the operation of this article that compensation was withheld from Mrs. Byrne.  It had not, however, been the intention that, where national health insurance was being drawn for a cause other than a qualifying injury within the meaning of the scheme, recipients of compensation under the scheme should have their compensation affected by payments of national health insurance and, when this defect became apparent, I took steps to have the matter remedied in the amending scheme which I recently made.  Such deductions will, therefore, be made only if the amounts payable under the National Health Insurance Acts are specifically referable to the injury in respect of which compensation is being paid.  Mrs. Byrne's case has been revised in accordance with the amending scheme, and has retrospective effect, and the compensation awarded to her is now being paid without deduction.  The arrears withheld have been paid in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if that has been done since the question was put down?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to a week ago the 7/6 a week which this woman was getting was deducted.  According to a letter which she has had from the Department, she was told that she would get nothing, and that the national health money was to be deducted from the total amount of the claim.  The national health money exceeded the amount of the claim, which meant that she got nothing. Can I have a promise now from the Minister that she will get something? She was blown out of the window and received serious injuries, and all that she was offered was £21 or £22.  According to what she tells me, by the taking back of the national health money, she owes the Department £9.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will cause the claim of Miss Jennie O'Rourke to be reinvestigated; if he is aware that Miss O'Rourke received serious injuries when the house 160 North Strand Road was bombed; if he will state if anything is being done to improve her condition; and whether the 30/- per week compensation awarded to her, which was to cease in December, 1942, has been increased and renewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is that this case has already been fully investigated and that the question of reinvestigation does not, therefore, arise.  As I already informed the Deputy, on the 5th November last, in reply to his previous question concerning this case, I am aware that Miss O'Rourke was injured as a result of the North Strand bombing.  Since the 8th December last she has been undergoing treatment in a private Dublin nursing home under the direction of the Army Pensions Board in consultation with a Dublin specialist, and I understand that she is making good progress; her condition is under continuous observation.  The cost of treatment is being borne by the State.  The <Col N="794" /> award of compensation made to her has been continued to the 9th December, 1943, and will be continued thereafter should her condition so warrant. Her compensation is at the highest rate payable under the Emergency Powers (Compensation for Personal Injuries) (Civilians) Scheme, 1942.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether this lady, whose future has been ruined, will get any substantial cash allowance from his Department or from any public authority that collected moneys for the bombed victims? The Minister for Finance is aware that when I last raised a question here about her she had been discharged from hospital although not cured.  Her compensation was to be stopped in December, 1942, and only I raised the question here she would not have been taken back.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware of the fact that persons employed by the Turf Development Board, County Kildare, are paid the same rate of wages as the turf workers who are housed in turf camps; and that the non-camp workers do not receive any allowance for food and receive no payment for broken time due to weather conditions, although an allowance is made to the camp workers; and whether, in view of the anomalies thus created, he will cause inquiries to be made in the matter with a view to equalising the wages and conditions of the local workers in relation to those of the camp workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The concessions to migratory workers on the camp scheme in County Kildare, referred to by the Deputy, are regarded as a recompense to those men for having to leave their homes and family surroundings to take up employment on the Kildare bogs.  Local workers employed by the board are engaged almost exclusively on road construction and maintenance, and their wages and conditions of employment are similar to those of road workers employed by the Kildare County Council.  It is not proposed to alter this arrangement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister realise that it is most anomalous to <Col N="800" /> have two sets of workers doing precisely the same work and paid at entirely different rates of wages?  In one case, the local workers get a wage of 35/-, while the workers in the camps get 35/- plus board and lodgings.  The outside worker loses pay while he is out of work through inclement weather, whereas the camp worker is paid 5d. an hour.  In view of the discontent which anomalies of that kind cause, will the Minister consider equalising the wages and conditions of the two groups of workers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is obvious that the circumstances of the workers living in camp are different from those of the workers living in their homes. The County Kildare workers employed by the board on road work are doing the same class of work as road workers employed by the county council, and I think the Deputy will understand that it is necessary to maintain uniformity of conditions for both those classes of workers.</P>

      <P>It is anticipated that a minimum quantity of 45,000 tons of artificial fertilisers will be available this season, consisting of 28,000 tons of 30 per cent. superphosphate and 17,000 tons of 1943 <Col N="807" /> compound fertiliser.  The guaranteed analysis of 30 per cent. superphosphate is 30 per cent. soluble phosphate and the guaranteed analysis of 1943 compound fertiliser is 20 per cent. soluble phosphate, 2 per cent. citric acid soluble phosphate, 2 per cent. insoluble phosphate, 2½ per cent. nitrogen and 1 per cent. potash.  The price of 30 per cent. superphosphate is £13 per ton and the price of 1943 compound fertiliser £14 per ton, ex railway or canal station nearest to the premises of the vendor. 30 per cent. superphosphate will be distributed through the usual trade channels on the basis of one ton against each ton of emergency compound fertiliser supplied to farmers in the 1942 season.  Compound fertiliser will be supplied to farmers who have contracts for the growing of sugar beet on the basis of four cwts. to each statute acre under this crop.  About 5,000 tons of 1943 compound fertiliser will be reserved for seed production and for allotments.  The exact amount of the subsidy per ton in respect of each class of fertilisers cannot be determined until the end of the manufacturing season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if it is the intention of his Department to make available for farmers who reside in urban areas the full agricultural grants and other concessions given to farmers in rural areas, of which those who live in urban areas are deprived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the allocation of the agricultural grant is not a matter for my Department, but I have been informed that it is not the present intention to make available for farmers who reside in urban areas the full agricultural grants.  This would necessitate amending legislation.  With regard to the remainder of the question, I would point out that residents in urban districts are not debarred from participation in the schemes centrally administered by my Department. As regards the agricultural schemes administered by the county committee of agriculture, the functional area of each such committee is defined by the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1934, as being the county exclusive of any urban districts comprised therein.  Section 3 of the latter Act also provides that no advantage under the agricultural scheme of a committee of agriculture shall be offered in respect of land, live stock, etc., situated or kept outside the functional area of that committee unless under <Col N="809" /> and in accordance with the express provisions of such a scheme.  This means that, unless in cases or in circumstances expressly approved by me, the schemes of the county committees of agriculture do not apply to residents in urban districts.  I am not prepared to agree to an alteration in that position, as urban districts are excluded from the area in which the agricultural rate leviable under the Agriculture Acts, 1931 and 1941, for the purpose of these schemes is raised.</P>

      <P>With regard to item No. 2 on the Order <Col N="822" /> Paper, I wish to move an amended form of the motion, notice of which has been given to the Chair:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>the cause of the fire which occurred during the night of Tuesday, 23rd February, 1943, at St. Joseph's Orphanage, Main Street, Cavan, and the circumstances in which loss of life was occasioned by the said fire, and to make such recommendations in relation thereto as the tribunal may think proper.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In view of the terms of this motion, Sir, I think it would not be proper to say very much about the circumstances which have made it necessary, and which we all regret.  The purpose of the resolution is to ensure that there will be an investigation to establish the circumstances under which this grave loss of life occurred, primarily with a view to devising measures to prevent a recurrence of such fatalities in future.</P>

      <P>the cause of the fire which occurred during the night of Tuesday, 23rd February, 1943, at St. Joseph's Orphanage, Main Street, Cavan, and the circumstances in which loss of life was occasioned by the said fire, ...&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepting these words, it seems that the remarks made by the Minister with reference to recommendations would indicate that the tribunal would restrict itself to recommendations designed to prevent such occurrences happening in the future, but as the motion here reads, it would seem to refer to recommendations in regard to a fire that has actually taken place.  I thought that the Minister might mean that a reference would be made to matters of compensation or other questions of that kind.  I should like to be clear as to what exactly the tribunal will be asked to cover in this matter of recommendations.</P>

      <P>My main point in setting up this tribunal is not to find scapegoats or to attach blame, but rather to ascertain what were the real causes of this fatality, with a view to devising measures to prevent a recurrence of such things.  The tribunal will be more concerned to ensure that, so far as human foresight and regulations can encompass it, this sort of thing will not happen again.  We all know that there are numerous institutions in the country, not of this particular type only, where you have a large number of inmates of one sort <Col N="825" /> or another, and, in view of this great disaster, we want to have an examination made in relation to all such institutions, and also, I should say, in relation to the facilities for dealing with fires which exist in our smaller towns, with a view to making them, so far as we can, adequate to overcome any dangers that may exist.  Therefore, as I say, I have advisedly left the terms of reference as wide as possible; but no aspect of the matter will be overlooked.</P>
      <P>The next point that was raised was about the constitution of the tribunal. It is my intention to have as chairman a lawyer of long standing.  He may be a judge, or a practising member of the Bar.  That will depend upon the circumstances of the time.  The courts may be fully occupied, and the judges may be going out on circuit, which may mean that we shall have to fall back on a practising barrister, but whoever the chairman will be, he will be a person of standing.  It is also my intention to have as a member of the tribunal a person with experience of fire fighting and fire prevention, and the third member of the tribunal, I think, will be a lady&mdash;perhaps an inspector of industrial schools.  That is the type of tribunal I have in mind &mdash;I am not yet pinned down to any particular person, but that is the sort of tribunal I want to get.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that I have not given the usual notice to the House with regard to this motion, but this is the first opportunity we have had to ask the House to adopt the necessary resolution.  I think that the Seanad will be meeting next week and we hope to get the corresponding necessary resolution adopted there.  If this inquiry is to be effective, we should have as little delay as possible in setting up this tribunal.  That is the reason for the short notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill has been brought in at the request of the Dublin pawnbrokers.  It appears that, under a very old Act of the Irish Parliament of 1788, four auctioneers were appointed and it was not legal for them to sell outside their divisions.  In practice, however, they had been doing so and, in one particular case, the sale of pledges had been carried on by one auctioneer outside his division for at least 70 years up to 1934.  The office was then closed down and another premises taken in the same street in 1941. Shortly afterwards, an action was taken in the district courts.  That action was not proceeded with, but the pawnbrokers say that their business would be very much affected if the auctioneers were compelled to confine themselves to their particular divisions, which are scarcely recognisable now.  These divisions were arranged for police purposes in the time of Grattan's Parliament and they are very hard to define now.  There seems to be no point in confining the auctioneers to these areas and, at the request of the pawnbrokers, who urged that their business would be seriously handicapped if they were compelled to comply with this old Act, I brought in this Bill.  Some other Minister for Justice will probably overhaul <Col N="828" /> the whole pawnbroking code&mdash;I hope it will not fall to my lot to do it, as it is a very difficult job&mdash;but, in the meantime, this Bill is brought in to wipe out what the pawnbrokers feel is a threat to their business.</P>

      <P>I am surprised to hear the Minister say that the Bill was brought in at the request of a certain small body of people, presumably in their own interests and not in the interests of the general public.  Whether rightly or wrongly, the members of this Party feel that the Bill has been brought in as a result of action taken about two years ago by a gentleman known as the City Swordbearer.  That action went through the courts and was subsequently withdrawn as a result of some agreement which was supposed to have been arrived at between the contending parties and which was never announced to the public.  Could the Minister say if that is a correct assumption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers possessed by the City Swordbearer at the time have apparently been altered, and it is now suggested that some other individual should get these powers, without any inquiry as to whether the legislation in operation for such a lengthy period should be revised.</P>
      <P>I listened to a discussion of this matter some time ago and a very strong case, in my opinion, was made for a public inquiry into the administration of the Act of 1788 and the powers at present possessed by pawnbrokers, as well as the powers possessed by the City Swordbearer, in Dublin and elsewhere.  There is a very strong case for a public inquiry.  If there was a good case, as I agree there was, for setting up a select committee to inquire into the operations of moneylenders, I feel that there is an equally strong case for setting up some kind of committee to inquire into the general administration of the 1788 Act and into the operations of pawnbrokers generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asked to press the Minister <Col N="829" /> very strongly to postpone the further consideration of this Bill, which is brought in only for the purpose of conferring a privilege upon one, two or perhaps three individuals, with a view to giving serious consideration to the suggestion that a select committee consisting of members of both Houses should be set up to inquire into the general administration of the Act.  Any Act passed by a Parliament in 1788 is certainly due for revision in some shape or form, and this Bill should not be pushed through the House without some consideration of the general question of the administration of such a very old Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy commented on their position in relation to the Bill.  I should like to approach it from a slightly different angle, namely, that of auctioneers.  I cannot understand why there is some extraordinary difference between a pledge sold by a pawnbroker and the sale of ordinary goods which are put up for auction.  I could agree with the Minister that this Act of 1788 is an anachronism, and that the Minister's seeking to give these divisional auctioneers powers to auction outside their own districts is all to the good.  The Minister says he does not want to go into the question of the legislation affecting the pawnbroking business, and I think that he is probably quite right; but this is a question of the sale of pledges, and I cannot see that there is any difference between that and the sale of goods by ordinary auction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister ought to approach the matter from the point of view that it ought to be possible for an ordinary auctioneer to sell these pledges, in accordance with the wishes of the Minister and under Government safeguards.  The Government in recent years have tried to tighten up the system with regard to the security that auctioneers give and the service that they render.  I suggest to the <Col N="830" /> Minister that this is an occasion on which the question of selling these pledges ought to be thrown open for the ordinary licensed auctioneers just as if this was a public auction.  Why should unredeemed pledges be looked upon as being in a water-tight compartment so that only divisional auctioneers can sell those pledges?  I say to the Minister that, if an ordinary licensed auctioneer is not fit to sell these pledges, he ought to bring in some safeguards and try to improve their education so that they can sell them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister why he is dealing with this Act in a piecemeal way.  It is an Act which for very many years has been due for overhauling.  At present we have four divisional auctioneers in the city who have certain powers bestowed upon them.  This Bill may result in a boycott of one or two or even three of these people and a monopoly for the selling of pawnbrokers' pledges being given to one auctioneer.  If those who have such goods to sell want to sell them in one general auction room and if the other three auctioneers who have certain privileges and rights bestowed upon them are driven out of business, some compensation should be given to them for being driven out of a business in which they have been engaged for many years.  This Bill as it stands opens the door to that.  If the pawnbrokers think fit to sell only in one auction room or two auction rooms or three auction rooms, any auctioneer with whom they may have a difference in the past can be driven out of business. There is nothing in this Bill to provide compensation for such a man who, under the Act, is operating under a licence and doing business for pawnbrokers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill may be a desirable one. Like Deputy Davin, I noticed that the Minister stated that he had introduced it at the request of a certain body of people.  Did he consult the others?  Did he consult the auctioneers who have certain rights?  Did he consult the assistants in the auction rooms?  If not, will he now consult with these people?  He may have been misled <Col N="831" /> into dealing with one side of the matter only without hearing the other side. There are four auction rooms and four sets of men dealing with this business. If any of them are to be driven out of business by this Bill, there ought to be some compensation provided for them. I put it to the Minister as a reasonable suggestion that if any people are driven out of business that they should get compensation and they have a right to be heard by the Minister. The City Swordbearer or the City Marshal is involved in the matter and has some rights.  I think it is the City Marshal who has to render an account regularly to the municipality with regard to pawnbrokers' pledges as to the amount realised for them at public auctions.  He has to notify the people whose goods were sold.  If somebody puts in a pledge as security and it is sold at three or four times the amount given on the pledge the difference has to go to the person who pledged it.  I think the Minister would be well advised before he proceeds any further to consult with the City Marshal and City Swordbearer, the law agent of the Dublin Corporation, the four divisional auctioneers concerned and their assistants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us what the licensed pawnbrokers and also the particular divisional auctioneers put before him.  Might I try to put to him the point of view of the man who, fortunately, has so far managed not to have recourse to these gentlemen, and who is in complete ignorance of the purpose of this Bill or the intention behind it and who is as ignorant now as before the Minister stood up to explain it?  Here is an Act which has been operating for almost 150 years with presumably reasonable satisfaction to all parties concerned.  The Minister is now presumably taking a small portion of that Act and amending it.  To my mind, at any rate, he has not given us any indication as to what the effect of this amendment will be on other provisions in the Act or as to how it will affect the position, as Deputy Byrne mentioned, of the four divisional <Col N="832" /> auctioneers.  The whole thing, so far as I am concerned, is quite unknown to me; I do not understand it at all. Like Deputy Byrne, in the course of my duties in the Dublin Corporation, I have learned something of the duties of the City Marshal and the City Swordbearer in connection with these divisional auctioneers.  I take it the original idea was that they should receive no fees of office as such and that they were given this privilege in lieu of these fees of office.  That, I believe, is the position, although I may be quite wrong there.  Is this Bill likely materially to affect their position? More important than that I think is the question of why this change is being made.  The Minister may have explained, but he did not explain in simple enough language for me what is the purpose behind it.  Why make any change in the existing procedure at all, which, from the Long Title of the Bill, apparently requires that the present divisional auctioneers must sell in their own divisions?  Now the Minister's intention apparently is that they may move into another division.  I do not know what the effect will be, or what the intention is, but I think, before we are asked to proceed any further with this Bill, the Minister should try to give us a little more of the background which has caused the introduction of the Bill. Simply to come to the House and say that he is doing this at the request of the pawnbrokers I do not think is sufficient reason to ask us to legislate in this way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all.  I think I mentioned this point when introducing, that the position that has obtained <Col N="833" /> for the last 100 years is the position that I want to continue.  I do not see how I am in any way interfering with anybody else's rights.  These auctioneers have been selling pledges in this particular street for at least 70 years and, I am told, for 100 years. That right has been challenged after 100 years of practice.  Whether they were legally entitled to do it or not, they were allowed to do it and I think it is only fair that they should be allowed to continue to do it.  In regard to Deputy Davin's point about setting up a commission to inquire into the administration of the 1788 Act, I would certainly be prepared to consider that if it were put up to me but, in the meantime, I do not see why a state of affairs which has been allowed to exist for 70 years or 100 years should not be allowed to continue.  It is hardly fair for somebody to come in at the end of that time and challenge their right.  I think I am thoroughly justified in bringing in the Bill if for no other reason than that.</P>
      <P>If any Deputy were to put himself in the position of people who have enjoyed that privilege for so many years he will, I am sure, feel that they would have a strong grievance now if that right were to be challenged.  There are four auctioneers&mdash;the City Marshal, the City Swordbearer and two others who were appointed by the Lord Lieutenant, or, after him, by the Minister for Justice.  I think the last appointment was made by my predecessor some years ago.  Their rights are not interfered with.  Pawnbrokers can send their pledges to any of the four they like.  I can see no grievance there at all.  I said at the beginning that there is need for consolidation of the Acts and undoubtedly there is but this is an interim arrangement which I think is called for because it is hardly fair to expose people to the risk of being challenged in their right to do a thing that they and their people before them have been doing for nearly a century.</P>

Is it a fact that four divisional auctioneers were, in actual practice, working outside their own divisions and that they were challenged by the law, that then the law was <Col N="836" /> resurrected and is now hanging over their heads; and that the Minister seeks to amend the law so as to give them by law what they had actually by practice?</P>

      <P>I agree, as Deputy Davin has said, that the time has come for consideration of the whole pawnbroking system, but I think, in the meantime, that threat ought not to be hanging over the heads of people who have had that right for a great number of years.

I thought they were extortionists, and all that, but I got another view of the matter when I heard the other side of the story.  I am told that they are really a very useful institution.  I was given to understand that the public interest might be very much interfered with if they could not have their pledges sold by the people in whom they had the greatest confidence; that they should not be forced to send them to people in whom they might not have as much confidence as they have in others; that the result might be that the public interest&mdash;the interests of those who had pledges with them&mdash; would not be as well served.  I thought that was a reasonable case.</P>

    <P>There were two changes inserted by the Seanad.  When the Bill left the Dáil, the position was that on weekdays licensed premises could open from 10.30 a.m. until 10.30 p.m., with a split hour from 2.30 until 3.30 in the county boroughs.  The opening hours on Sundays were 2 to 3 and 4 to 7 in the County Borough of Dublin and, in the other county boroughs, the hours were 1 to 3 and 5 to 7.  In the Seanad this Bill was debated at considerable length.  I do not know whether the debate there was quite as long as the debate we had in this House, but the Bill was recommitted in the Seanad and they made some changes.  They went back to the 10 o'clock opening in the cities and made the opening hours 10 a.m. until 10 p.m., with the split hour in the middle of the day.  I did my best to stick to the 10.30 arrangement, although my original proposal here was 10 o'clock; I made the best case I could for what was decided in the Dáil, but the Seanad were determined not to have that and they brought the position back to what it was originally&mdash;that is, from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., with the split hour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> With regard to places outside the county boroughs, the position is the same as when the Bill left the Dáil, except that in winter the hour goes back to 10 o'clock.  I made a special case in that connection in the Seanad.  I said that the decision arrived at in the Dáil was influenced mostly by country Deputies who pointed out that in the cities the people were accustomed to new time, while in the country only old time was observed.  The case made here was that the country people would be just leaving their work at the time the public houses would be closing.  The Seanad decided on 10.30 for the country areas in the summer time and 10 o'clock in the winter.  That means that the country public houses would have an advantage of half an hour over the boroughs on weekdays in the summer months.  Following the decision of the Seanad, the position in the county boroughs is that the opening hours are from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., with a split hour from 2.30 to 3.30.  Outside the county boroughs the public houses will open at 10.30 a.m. and close at 10.30 p.m. in the summer time and at 10 o'clock in the winter.</P>
    <P>As regards Sunday opening, the decision arrived at here was as I have already indicated, but in the Seanad, after a great deal of debate, and some divisions, they finally decided to have the opening at 1.30 p.m. and a closing at 3 p.m. and, following a two-hour gap, a further opening from 5 to 7. There is a difference between the Dublin Borough and the other boroughs of half an hour later opening for the first portion of the day. After hearing the arguments from all sides, and taking everything into consideration, I do not think there is much chance of improving the Bill, and perhaps it is just as well to leave it as it is.  I would like to have uniformity if it could be got, but I am still satisfied that there are circumstances existing in the City of Dublin which justify a difference in the first portion of the day.  There was a compromise in the Seanad, and there was a fair amount of agreement there.  I do not think it would be fair to ask me, after all the trouble I have taken with this Bill, to go back again to the Seanad.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather surprised at the attitude the Minister is adopting.  He says the Bill has come from the Seanad in fairly good form and that there was general agreement on it and he would not like anything to happen that would oblige him to take it back to the Seanad.  Did not the Seanad do the very thing that the Minister brought in this Bill to stop&mdash;make a discrimination in the hours between two different areas?  Is this not the actual position now, that you will have one public house 100 yards away from another and it will be entitled to remain open for a half an hour longer? If you fix the hours indicated by the Minister for a county borough, the public house at the end of the county borough will have to shut at 10 p.m., but the public house a short distance away, outside the borough boundary, will be entitled to remain open until <Col N="843" /> 10.30 p.m.  The Seanad, by their uncalled for meddling with the very good job that was done here, have brought the position back to what the Minister did not want at the start.  The one thing on which there was absolute agreement was the closing at 10.30 p.m.  There was no criticism from any side of the House in that connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy was a bit vocal about hotels, but I do not recollect his voting against the 10.30 proposal.  There were proposals to fix the closing hour at 11 p.m. and the Minister suggested that we should split the difference and the 10.30 closing hour was generally agreed upon.  Now the Seanad have taken off a half hour in the cities and allowed it to remain for the country areas.  Of course, that is a thing for which Deputies representing rural areas are thankful, but does the Minister not agree that it is a pity that there should be any alteration in the closing hour&mdash;that there should be any difference between any two areas so far as the closing hour is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister really think there was a genuine demand for altering the 10.30 arrangement in Dublin?  Will he not admit that the Deputies here who dealt with that particular section of the Bill are more entitled to have their views considered than are most of the members of the Seanad?  I suggest they are, for the reason that the people who were dealing with the Bill in this House have more contact with the realities of the situation than members of the Seanad have.  I am satisfied that Deputies on the opposite benches, on the Labour Benches and on these benches have a far more commonsense idea of what would be a better licensing code than the people in the Seanad who took away the half hour.  I suggest it is perfectly obvious that the Senators who decided to take away the half hour in the county boroughs are people who lead quiet and more secluded lives possibly than the average Deputy here.  I am quite sure that they felt they were doing the best thing possible, but I doubt very much if their <Col N="844" /> outlook on this matter is anything as realistic as that of members of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>When the Bill left this House for the Seanad there was general satisfaction with it as far as ordinary opening hours were concerned.  I am satisfied that publicans, the assistants, and the consuming public were quite satisfied with the hours in the Bill as it left this House.  I think the Minister will agree that it would be far better to have a levelling of hours all round rather than to have any discrimination in that respect.  That was the Minister's original idea.  If we are going to have the position where one house will be open half an hour later than another, that means that something like the <i>bona fide</i> traffic will appear again. That is the black spot in the Bill.  It is a silly idea.  I do not think there would be any resentment if the half hour extra was given to the boroughs. As far as Dublin is concerned, it is the metropolis, and it is unreasonable to suggest that houses there and in the cities should not remain open as long as houses in rural districts.  On the different stages we objected strongly to discrimination against rural dwellers as regards facilities for Sunday, and city people have an equally strong case in objecting to discrimination against them owing to the fact that the business hours are shorter. The Minister got a good Bill as it left this House.  I am glad to be able to say that he made a good fight in the Seanad against the amendment that was inserted there.  The Seanad did not improve the Bill that left this House but introduced a bad feature in arranging different hours.  Even at the expense of returning the Bill to the Seanad, the Minister would be well advised to stand by the original hours and to have 10.30 closing all round&mdash;in boroughs or outside them.</P>

      <P>I want to remind the last speaker that when I spoke previously on this Bill the Minister had precedence and I could not continue. But I was vocal on every stage of the Bill.  I agree with Deputy Linehan that there should be uniform closing. There is no demand from the consuming <Col N="845" /> public for an extension of the hours. The whole atmosphere of the debate about this Bill has been a publican's atmosphere, and a Dublin publican's atmosphere, and they do not care a <i>thraneen</i> about the rest of the trade.</P>

      <P>There must be some kind of telepathy.  When I spoke about the rights of assistants under this Bill on a previous occasion Deputy Davin was surprised when I mentioned that assistants would be on their feet from early morning until all hours in the night. Without being controversial, I say that it is all right when speaking of towns, where assistants have trade union branches to see that they get their rights, but I should like to know from <Col N="846" /> Deputy Davin what will happen to those who are serving an apprenticeship in shops 15 or 20 miles from a town.  Parents are glad to get their boys to business in order to serve their time to the grocery trade and the bar trade, but in country districts, where there are no police barracks and no trade unions, what is going to be the position?  I calculate that the extension of the hours by one half-hour means four or five extra hours' work for assistants in country districts. That is a retrograde step.  It is not right, and the general public do not demand it.  I was blackballed here when I spoke about one aspect of this Bill, I bowed to the decision of the Chair then.</P>

I will go this distance with Deputy Davin, that I would be in favour of 10.30 opening in Dublin and 10 o'clock closing, because we are dealing with the metropolis, with a population of over 500,000 people.  Distances do not seem so great in the city as in the country.  There are rights which the people in the metropolis should have. I differ from Deputy Corry on this Bill.

      <P>I am sorry that the Minister is asking the House to depart from the great unanimity that we had reached on this Bill before it left this House.  I hope he will not force a division on this matter.  When the Bill was originally before the Dáil, the Minister met the arguments of Deputies from all sides of the House very fairly.  One of the most obnoxious sections in the Bill, as originally presented to the House, was, in my opinion, the one that created a difference in hours between the rural and city areas.  I am as much opposed to that now as I was heretofore.  I still think that we ought to adhere to a uniformity in hours.  As Deputy Linehan has pointed out, everybody knows what the position will be if there is a difference in the closing hours as between the rural and city areas, which, in some places, may be separated by only a quarter or half a mile.  If a position of that kind is to be created now it will, in my opinion, undo all the good which the Minister hopes to achieve by this measure. People in the country with whom I have discussed the matter are in favour of having uniformity of hours.  They are of opinion that the opening and closing hours in, for example, the County Boroughs of Limerick and Cork should be the same as the opening and closing hours in the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy suggested that, for the sake of uniformity, we should get back to the hour of 10 o'clock.  I would be altogether against that.  In my view, a 10 o'clock closing hour in the rural areas would be much too early, especially during the period of summer time.  In reality, it would mean closing at 9 o'clock, old time.  During this year the people engaged in the agricultural <Col N="848" /> industry will be working in the fields, saving hay or gathering the harvest, almost to that hour.  If we were to go back to 10 o'clock it would practically mean closing the public houses altogether, so far as the rural workers are concerned.  I am in favour of the amendment which proposes to restore the position to that which existed in the Bill when it left this House.  I hope the Minister will not be tempted by any arguments that were made in the Seanad to go back on the decision that was arrived at by the members of this House.</P>

      <P>I am amazed at the acrobatic feats of my colleague, Deputy Kennedy, who now wants a levelling up of hours, but when the Bill was before the Dáil previously, he wanted so many hours allowed for this city on Sundays that a man could go from one public house to another in O'Connell Street for his pint, while the unfortunate farm labourer in the country would have to walk three miles before he could get one.  That was the kind of levelling up the Deputy wanted for the country areas.  The Deputy is very anxious about the assistants, but what about the unfortunate farm labourer who has no hours at all?  He has to be up at a quarter to six in the morning, and is working in the fields until 9 o'clock at night.  Deputy Kennedy wants to have the country public houses closed against him when he goes to get a pint in the evening.  The Deputy is also in favour of making that man, who is tired on a Sunday after working all the week, walk three miles in order to be able to get a drink.  In my view, there is no levelling up in that kind of game.  I would like to see uniformity, but I am definitely opposed to the taking away of any little privilege that the órdinary worker in the country enjoys at present.  As Deputy Bennett has pointed out, men will be working in the fields this year up to 8 or 9 o'clock at night saving hay and saving the harvest.  If the proposals here were agreed to, they would find the country public houses closed against them at the end of their day's work.  Many of us would like to see the boys, after working a couple of hours overtime, being able to go down <Col N="849" /> to the local public house to get a drink. I think it would be very unfair to close the public houses against them.  It is a small privilege they enjoy at present, and it should not be taken from them. Perhaps, after this year, Deputy Kennedy may change his mind on this. The Tillage Order is now going to be enforced in the County Meath, so that the boys there, who heretofore had all day to drink, will have a bit of work to do and will be very glad to have an hour in the evening in which to get a drink.  My experience of the County Meath has been that the men there do not get up until about 11 o'clock or start the day's work until 12 o'clock. I suppose the day does not end too early with them either.  They had not much to do anyway, but now, with the enforcement of the Tillage Order, the boys there will have to work and cannot afford to spend as much time lying in the ditches reading the papers.</P>

      <P>There is more in this than the question of civic rights. As I understand it, this Bill was introduced mainly for the purpose of rectifying a position that was said to exist in certain country areas.  In my contributions on the earlier stages of the Bill, I kept that in view.  The obvious way to remedy the matters complained of was to link up the closing hours in the cities with the closing hours in the partly suburban areas by reducing the gap to such an extent that it would not be worth people's while to travel from one area to another for the purpose of getting drink.  I think it is most unfortunate that the Minister should have consented to this amendment in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>This matter of remedying the abuses that were said to exist in certain areas outside the city was put forward, when the Bill was originally before us, as one of the keystones in the measure.  If that is to go now, there is not much object in the Bill.  It is really only a machinery Bill.  That, of course, is by <Col N="851" /> the way.  It is quite obvious that, if this amendment is accepted, and a differentiation made in the times of closing the public houses in the urban as distinct from the rural areas, we will have a repetition of the incidents and complaints that were put before this House by the Minister when he introduced this Bill.  If this amendment is accepted, the public houses in, say, Rathfarnham, or any of the other outlying parts of the city, will be closed at 10 o'clock.  Let us assume that, at 10 o'clock, there are 100 people in three public houses in that area.  The whole lot leave and go a couple of hundred yards outside the city boundary, arriving at a licensed premises there.  They have the right to go in there for half an hour, and they rush in for three or four more drinks.  They will be put out at 10.30 and then the Guards will have to deal with them.  We will then have a repetition of the incidents which brought about this present Bill.  There will be an outcry from clergymen and civilians as to the conduct of people in those areas, and the Guards will be blamed as they have already been blamed in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told on the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage of this Bill that if the Guards did their duty there would be no trouble at all, and the incidents complained of would not take place.  In my opinion, so long as that set of circumstances is permitted to obtain, the Guards cannot remedy the evil.  It is utterly impossible for them to do so.  We have to put the necessary machinery into the hands of the Guards.  If we fail to do that, in my opinion it is unjust and improper to blame the Guards for being unable to put an end to the scenes that have been complained of. If this amendment from the Seanad is accepted, the evils complained of will be accentuated.  The shorter space of time available will result in an accentuation of the evils.  Those people will rush out of the public houses in the extreme suburbs of the city, go into the nearest public house outside the boundary, and rush three or four drinks in that half hour. <Col N="852" /> Then they will come out, and we are asking the Guards to deal with the scenes that will arise.  I think it is a monstrous suggestion.  It is utterly unjust that the House should place such a burden on the Guards.  I did not read the report of the speeches in the Seanad, so I do not know the grounds on which they based their arguments in support of putting in this amendment, but, if the Seanad further considered the evils which necessitated the introduction of this Bill by the Minister, I think they would be very slow in fixing different closing hours for public houses in the urban and rural areas.  In my opinion, the Minister should boldly reject this amendment.  I think he should have rejected it in the Seanad. We had complaints that men and women could not travel in buses or be out of doors anywhere in those suburban areas without being insulted, and in my opinion the amendment inserted by the Seanad would only lead to a repetition of those evils.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that this amendment has been discussed at great length, I do not intend to delay the House for more than a minute or two.  I resent what Deputy Kennedy said, when speaking here earlier, that the whole atmosphere of the debate in this House was the Dublin publicans' atmosphere.  I think I am entitled to express resentment at that, in view of the fact that the majority of those who took part in the discussion on the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage of the Bill were not associated in any way with the Dublin publicans.  The nearest approach to the Dublin publicans sits on the Independent Benches in the person of Deputy Alderman Byrne. Evidently he is still living in the age of Queen Anne, because he wants the hours to remain at 2 to 5 on Sundays. In view of the fact that the Minister put forward from his Department strong evidence showing the abuses which the <i>bona fide</i> traffic has caused, and brought in proposals to remedy that, one would have expected that Deputy Byrne would address himself to that question, but he did not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> I want to make one point in favour of the amendment proposed here.  I want to make the point&mdash;Deputy Linehan made it, I think, on the Second Reading&mdash;that we have to make laws which can be enforced.  We should not create an impossible situation for the Guards.  In the suburbs on the border line of the city and county area the Guards would be in an impossible position if the amendment proposed here is not accepted.  I listened attentively to the discussion in the Seanad, and I agree with Deputy Linehan who said that Deputies in this House did everything possible to help the Minister to make this a good Bill.  In my opinion in regard to this particular section, it was a good Bill leaving this House.  The people who brought in the amendment in the Seanad have not the same contact with public opinion as we have, and have not the same sense of responsibility, because we are directly elected by the people outside, and, therefore, we are more responsible to the community as a whole.  In the interests of the community as a whole, I hope the amendment proposed here will be accepted.</P>

      <P>I think I was the only Deputy in the House who opposed the extension of half an hour so far as the city areas are concerned.  I opposed on the grounds that there is a distinct difference between rural areas and city areas, inasmuch as in the country areas the people go by the sun's time, whereas in the urban areas the overwhelming majority of the people abide by summer time.  Therefore, the extension of half an hour in the evening was unjustifiable as far as the city areas are concerned.  Therefore, I should like to congratulate the Seanad on altering the Bill, and to congratulate the Minister on accepting this amendment.  It has been repeatedly said that the Bill as it left this House was a good Bill.  On the last occasion when it was before the House, I said it was a bad Bill, and as far as it has been amended by the Seanad I think it has been definitely improved.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooney has moved me to intervene.  I thought I had <Col N="854" /> said all that was necessary during the last debate on the Bill.  The Deputy referred to me as having a knowledge of the licensed trade.  I have a good knowledge of the licensed trade, and of the conditions of the workers generally in that trade.  I may say that any one who is a member of the licensed trade must have a good character. The Guards investigate his character for years back to find whether he is a proper and suitable person to get a licence If he has done anything wrong that has drawn the attention of the Gárdaí to him, he will not get a licence.  I, therefore, have nothing to apologise for in being associated at one time with the licensed trade.  There are men in that trade who would do honour to this House, or to any other assembly, not alone in this country, but in any part of Great Britain.  They are conducting a clean, honest trade. They despise the drunkard, and they do not want the drunkard's money.</P>

I still object to the alteration in the hours, not alone on behalf of the assistants but also on behalf of members of the licensed trade who would like to have an hour or two after 12 o'clock Mass before opening their premises, and who would also like to have an opportunity in the evening to bring members of their family for a tram ride or a bus ride.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the Dáil amendment now before the House.  I think from the arguments that have been put forward, on the grounds of uniformity alone, that the Minister should accept the amendment. Taking this State as a whole, we are a small community and conditions do not vary very much, as far as the population is concerned, between one part of the country and another.  I see no reason in the world why the city should be put in a different position from that of the country.  As has been already pointed out, that would only give rise to difficulties in administration for the Gárdaí who will have to enforce this Act.  I have always thought the different trading hours which exist in certain contiguous areas in England, Scotland and Wales, rather absurd.  In these countries, I understand certain local councils or borough authorities have the right to fix the hours for certain areas and the fact that there is no uniformity as between one area and <Col N="856" /> another, has given rise to great difficulties and grave abuses.  That is recognised over there by everybody connected with the trade.  I should like the Minister to accept this amendment as by doing so he will establish uniformity and every citizen will know the exact position.  The amendment will also make it possible for the Guards to enforce the licensing laws with greater ease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated at the beginning that I said in the Seanad that I would prefer uniformity but there was a very strong feeling in the Seanad on this matter.  I do not agree with Deputies who have said that Senators were out of touch with public opinion.  I felt more in touch with public opinion in the Seanad than I did in this House and I had to express regret there that I did not get the same reception here as I got there because undoubtedly the point of view which I expressed on this Bill was shared by several members of the Seanad.  I did point out, however, there that it would be very advisable to have uniformity in the hours.  There was a very strong feeling, as I have stated, on this amendment and any division that existed there, as far as I could see, was not on Party lines. The amendment made by the Seanad was carried by 24 votes to 12 votes, the minority voting to leave the Bill as it came from the Dáil.  At a later stage, the Seanad had another amendment dealing with the country, and I appealed to them to leave the country hours as they were adopted by the Dáil because I pointed out that the case made for the country licensed houses was that country workers worked by the sun.  In the city, we all know that workers work according to the official summer time.  I appealed to Senators to leave the country hours as the Dáil had fixed them, and the Seanad agreed to that course.  As I was anxious for uniformity, I suggested that they might agree to make the closing hour 10 o'clock in the winter time and they also agreed to that course.  Now the Dáil wants to change the hours so that we shall have a similar closing hour in the city and in the country&mdash;that is 10 o'clock in winter time and 10.30 in summer time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> I am inclined to accept the amendment which has now been put forward, but I do not like to have to go back to the Seanad to argue over the matter of half an hour.  I am not, however, prepared to agree to the next amendment which is being brought forward here.  The case for this amendment, however, has been made pretty well, and it happens to coincide with my own views.  Another point which I mentioned in the Seanad was that the gap between the closing hour in the city and those during which <i>bona fide</i> traffic could be carried on outside was being enlarged by the Seanad amendment.  I do not like that two-hour gap, and on the whole I am inclined to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a really lengthy discussion on this amendment already.  I thoroughly agree with the amendment which the Seanad made. There is no demand in the city for an extension of the closing hour to 10.30 at night.  Nobody ever demanded it. As good a case could be made for an 11 o'clock or a 11.30 closing as for a 10.30 closing.  There has been no public demand for a 10.30 closing, and no worker is really inconvenienced by a closing hour of 10 o'clock.  City workers who finish their work at 6 or 7 o'clock have a reasonable time afterwards to get refreshments up to 10 p.m.  In the country the position is somewhat different because the workers there work by the sun, and very often after they finish their work they have to travel a considerable distance if they wish to visit a licensed premises.  That is not the position in Dublin.  The difficulty there is that licensed premises are sometimes found too easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another consideration in connection with the matter.  A very large number of persons employed in the licensed trade in Dublin, because of the nature of the trade, are compelled to work late hours.  Whenever the licensed premises are open up to 10 o'clock, the assistants are required to stay on until 10.30 in order to clean up the place.  If the premises were open until 10.30, it would be well <Col N="859" /> after 11 o'clock before they would be able to leave.  The Dáil should have some advertence to the conditions under which these assistants work and should not capriciously impose on them an obligation to work until 10.30 when 10 p.m. would be adequate for everybody.  The Minister knows that there is no public demand for the <Col N="860" /> later hour and that the Seanad, when it inserted this amendment, was much more closely in touch with public opinion than this House was.  I hope the Minister will resist this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As this amendment, and the following amendment, standing in my name, deal <Col N="861" /> with a similar matter, I think that we might discuss them together.  This amendment relates to Sunday opening in this city alone.  When the Bill left this House for the Seanad, the hours which had then been arrived at were 1 to 3 o'clock and 5 to 7 o'clock.  The original arrangement was from 2 to 5 o'clock, but, as a result of certain discussions, the hours of 1 to 3 o'clock and 5 to 7 o'clock were fixed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, we got the Bill back from the Seanad with hours which were not the hours in the Bill when it left this House.  The difficulty that arises in connection with the whole matter, as I understand it, arises not from the Intoxicating Liquor Act itself but from the interaction of the particular hours here stated and of the conditions of the Shops Act.  The situation as it has been explained to me is that if the hours be kept as they are in the measure coming back from the Seanad, the assistants are entitled to a particular type of compensatory half-holiday.  If that compensatory half-holiday is to be given, there does not seem to be any reason why the extra half-hour of opening should not be allowed and that extra half-hour of opening, during the mixed discussions we had here on a variety of hours, seemed to have the approval of the House.</P>
      <P>The only objection made was in relation to the impact of the earlier opening upon Gaelic athletic games and the particular times required for these games.  I understand that that objection was, to a certain extent, waived&mdash;it certainly was not made a great deal of in the Seanad&mdash;and the position then would appear to be that if anything over three hours in the way of opening on Sunday is granted, there has to be a compensatory half-holiday given to the assistants and it has to be given under such conditions, taking the whole effect of the two Acts together, that two evenings have to be given, which will mean a considerable extra cost to those in possession of licensed houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> There are two alternatives here. One is to go back to the 2 to 5 o'clock period, in which case there will be no compensatory half-holiday.  If it is necessary to take other hours than the old hours, move back from 1.30 p.m. to 1 o'clock, which will not disturb the conditions which will be necessitated by the impact of the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act. The only thing that will happen will be that in return for giving a half-holiday, those in the licensed trade will get an extra half hour's work out of the assistants.  Either of the two is a better arrangement than what is before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support this amendment on grounds somewhat similar to those advanced by Deputy McGilligan.  When the Bill left this House, it provided a four-hour opening period on Sunday.  The Minister was apparently quite satisfied to accept the Bill as it left this House, but the Seanad has seen fit to change it in such a way as to alter its provisions as compared with its provisions when we last saw it here.  The effect of the Seanad amendment is that the assistant who works on Sunday is going to have his conditions of employment seriously worsened inasmuch as he is to be compelled in future to work until 10.30 at night, and, instead of having to work on Sunday from 2 to 5 o'clock, is to work from 1.30 to 3 o'clock and from 5 to 7 o'clock.  That is a considerable extension of his spread-over on Sundays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are going to do that deliberately to the assistants, in order to provide additional drinking facilities on Sundays, we ought frankly to acknowledge that we have some obligation to the assistants.  Whether we accept this amendment or whether we leave the Bill as it stands, we are still imposing a hardship on them, inasmuch as we are spreading out the Sunday attendance, and we ought at least to provide some compensation for it and give the assistants some bargaining power with their employers by providing in the Bill for a four-hour attendance on Sundays.  I would prefer to see the Sunday opening <Col N="863" /> hours from 2 to 5 o'clock as formerly. I do not think there is any great demand for the opening hours proposed in the Bill when the Minister introduced it; I do not think there is any great demand for the hours proposed by the Seanad, or even for the hours suggested in this amendment; but if we are going to alter the hours on Sundays and to worsen the conditions of the assistants by increasing the spread-over, the least we ought to do is to give them some bargaining power with their employers in respect of their altered conditions.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGilligan points out, a three and a half hour attendance on Sundays will enable assistants to secure a half-holiday, but if the hours are extended to four hours, they will be able to get a whole day off in respect of working for those four hours. As we are definitely worsening their conditions, the least the Minister ought to do is to extend the hours and fix 1 to 3 o'clock and 5 to 7 o'clock for Sunday opening, instead of the three and a half hour period provided in the Bill.  That extension will enable the assistants to bargain with their employers in relation to what compensation they are to get because of the alteration of their conditions under the Bill.  I should imagine the Minister would be glad to accept this amendment, because it is in tune with the viewpoint he expressed when the Bill was last before the House, and, seeing that he has accepted the previous amendment, which he said was also in tune with his views, I hope he will have no hesitation in accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is said that there is more joy in heaven over the conversion of one sinner, etc., etc.  I feel very happy this evening to hear Deputy Norton, the Leader of the Labour Party, delivering, in substance, the speeches I made on the Second and subsequent Stages.  Notwithstanding the fact that I was then denounced as a renegade both in the House and outside it by some of the Deputy's new-found friends, I feel very happy, whether this amendment is <Col N="864" /> accepted or not, although I hope it will be accepted for the very specific reasons I advocated then.  I saw the position clearly.  I was speaking, as I told the House, as one with an inside knowledge of the business.  I knew the bargaining power was there in the hands of the operatives, and I knew further that it was in the best interest of the community that this county borough, the capital of the State, should have a 1 o'clock opening on Sunday.</P>
      <P>This capital of the State is the Minister's native city, and I know that his strongest objection to the 1 o'clock opening on Sunday is his conviction that it would seriously hamper the progress of the national games.  With your permission, Sir, I should like to read an extract from a speech delivered by Senator Foran in the Seanad in connection with that point:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With regard to the hours set out in the amendment for opening in Dublin on Sundays, we had a good deal of discussion on that matter on former stages of the Bill.  The playing of hurling and football in Dublin entered largely into the discussion. The proposal in the amendment is that public houses in Dublin be permitted to open at 1.30 p.m. I would appeal to the Minister to go back to the 1 o'clock opening.  I am reliably informed by people interested in the games that the opening of public houses at 1 o'clock on Sundays would not seriously interfere with the G.A.A.  The 1 o'clock opening would also ensure that the assistants would get the benefit of the Shop Hours Act in the sense that they would get an extra half-day in consequence of having worked four hours.  They will get no recompense for working three and a half hours.  That is a very important consideration for the assistants generally and I appeal to the Minister to take it into consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again this is a repetition in substance of the case I made on the Second Reading and the Committee Stage. I do not think I have anything further to add, as Deputy Norton has taken up his stand and decided to follow me into the Lobby.  If I am permitted <Col N="865" /> to vote as a free lance, I shall vote for this amendment, but I do not know what the Minister is determined to do in the last analysis.</P>
    <P>There is one further comment I should like to make.  The Minister paid a tribute to the Senators which I think was overdone, if I might say so. I think that the Deputies on all sides in this House gave as generous and sincere help to the Minister as was within their power and knowledge. Again I repeat that they speak in this House with a greater sense of responsibility and knowledge of the consequences that may flow from their actions than Senators have to face.</P>
    <P>It will be unfortunate if the Minister is determined to stand by the hour of 1.30, because otherwise we have what, in my opinion, is almost, as far as human ingenuity can go, a perfect Bill&mdash;that is, so far as it is possible to have a perfect Bill.  The other three boroughs are given the hours of 1 to 3 and 5 to 7.  One would almost imagine that the national games do not figure at all in any of the other boroughs.  What about Cork?  I am surprised that Cork Deputies have not taken up the cudgels and said that the hours of 1 to 3 would not injure the national games there.  However, we may hear from them later.  I do not know what proportion of the employees in Cork play the national games, but I have a fairly good knowledge of the number of those employed in the licensed trade in Dublin who play the national games.  I have further knowledge that, so far as these are concerned, there would be no difficulty whatever in ensuring that those who play the national games would be facilitated in every respect.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to put the Capital of this State on the same basis in regard to licensing facilities as the other three county boroughs, and I hope he will agree to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Inasmuch as the assistants and the licensed traders and everybody else seem to want the hours of 1 to 3 and 5 to 7, why not give them to them?  However ill-founded the assistants' belief may be that this additional half-hour on Sundays <Col N="866" /> will not give them certain rights under the Shops Act, and if they believe that they require to work this extra half-hour to acquire those rights, let them fall into the trap they made for themselves. It might be that this half-hour would not be necessary to qualify them for the benefits of the Shops Act. Whether it is or not, if they themselves want it and if the publicans want it, and if everybody wants it, why not give it to them?  Nobody seems to be threatened with any serious danger in this connection.</P>
      <P>Personally, I want it for a reason that nobody has mentioned.  I want to get at the clubs, holy and unholy, that are operating in this city.  There is a vast number of clubs functioning in this city, as I say, holy and unholy, whose principal function is the distribution of drink during the hours when the ordinary respectable public house cannot distribute it.  One of their most profitable periods of activity is when people come out of Mass on Sunday. Holy clubs get a great run on that occasion, and the common or garden publican should have a licence to go into competition with the holy clubs, and let the porter be dished out across the publican's counter and the marble-topped tables of the holy clubs on an equal footing and let the best man win.  If I know anything of the trade, the publicans will get the best of the trade in the heel of the hunt, given a fair run.  I want a 1 o'clock opening for them, and I want fair competition between the holy clubs and the publicans, because they are both engaged in the same trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the 5 to 7 o'clock opening is concerned, I understand these are good hours for the publican's trade. If the publican is to give the assistants a compensating holiday during the week under the Shops Act, I think he will have to give that no matter how the cat jumps under the amendment. If he has to give that, the assistants themselves will be anxious that the hours fixed for Sundays are those which will bring in their employer the best revenue that is available on that day and, as I understand it, the hours of 5 to 7 o'clock are the best hours in <Col N="867" /> the evening for the publican's trade.</P>
    <P>Now I am an unrepentant opponent of split hours.  If a man is working behind the counter&mdash;I refer to the publican and to the assistant, and I have worked in both capacities as an assistant and as a publican&mdash;I think he has enough work on his hands at the end of the week without having split hours to work on Sunday.  If you tie an assistant down to come in from 1 to 3 o'clock and 5 to 7 o'clock, you might as well tie him down altogether, because to require to be in from 1 to 3 o'clock and to be back at 5 o'clock means that he has no free time.  Take a publican who has worked hard all the week.  Sunday comes, which ought to be a day of leisure, and you tell him that he has to open his house from 1 to 3 o'clock and to reopen from 5 to 7 o'clock.  That means that he has to be on duty, in effect, from 1 to 7 o'clock.  I think that is wrong.  I think it is no justification for the principle of split hours to say that there are a few people who will get drunk on Sunday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know there is only one argument put up in justification of the split hours, and that is that the Commissioner of the Gárdaí says that there are certain types of toper who will sit on the bar stool from the moment the public house opens until it shuts, and the only way to get them out, or to keep them sober, is to kick them out by law.  I do not accept that as a justification for the principle of split hours.  I think the split hours system is a bad one, and that we will have to have some other means of dealing with the chronic &ldquo;drunks&rdquo; besides imposing on those engaged in the trade in every city and borough the obligation of working, in effect, from 1 to 7 o'clock every Sunday. However, on the assumption that the principle of the split hours is accepted, I urge on the Minister to accept the hours set out in the amendment of 1 to 3 o'clock and 5 to 7 o'clock.  They please everybody, they vex nobody, and <Col N="868" /> they have the highly salutary additional benefit of bringing the holy clubs into competition with the <i>bona fide</i> publicans and providing these respectable business men with no advantage, but freedom from a handicap so that they can enter into competition with clubs, which are, in effect, public houses, but which are masquerading as centres of piety and religion in the midst of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as these amendments are concerned, I would be in favour of the one which brings the hours into line with the other boroughs.  Personally, I think the strongest argument in favour of making the hours 1 to 3 o'clock and 5 to 7 o'clock is the fact that since the Bill was brought in originally these hours have applied to Cork, Limerick, and Waterford, and nobody in these three cities had the slightest objection to them&mdash;the assistants, the publicans, the Guards or the public.  As a matter of fact, when the Bill was introduced, and before the terms of the Bill were made known to the House or to the public, the people in Cork, Waterford and Limerick did, in fact, ask for these hours.  So far as the G.A.A. is concerned, I do not know whether, proportionately to the size of the cities, there would be as many assistants in Cork, Waterford and Limerick playing these games on Sunday as in Dublin. There was one strong argument made in favour of this question of the national games.  I am afraid that the people who used that argument are inclined to overlook what should be the basic principle behind legislation of this kind, and which is the basic principle that Deputy Kennedy overlooked when he made his attack on the people who, he said, were merely introducing the Dublin publican atmosphere into this House.  These people completely overlook the fact that the licensed trade is as much a social service and a catering service for the community as buses, trains, or anything else like that.  When the Bill was being debated in this House, I think that 90 per cent. of the Deputies who dealt with it dealt with it from that point of view.  We were no more concerned with the Dublin publican <Col N="869" /> than with the Cork assistant or with the consumer in Mayo.  That is the attitude of people like Deputy Kennedy or Deputy Cooney, who comes in at the last minute and holds himself out as the only man who resisted the insidious efforts of Deputies on both sides of the House to make the liquor trade more easy. Deputy Cooney takes very good care to absent himself from the Division Lobby.  It would not do for a man of Deputy Cooney's standing now to go down the country, or even to come to Dublin, and say he voted against an extension of half an hour for the Dublin borough, but it would be very nice for Deputy Cooney to be able to leave certain people under the impression that he took no action in it and to go and tell the other people&mdash; and I might describe them in Deputy Dillon's words&mdash;the holy and unholy people&mdash;who criticise everybody who advocates anything like a good licensing Bill in this House&mdash;that he stood out as the one archangel against Deputies on all sides of the House who were trying to make the Irish people a race of drunkards.  That type of loose talking does more harm than anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told there is no demand for these hours.  What do they expect? Do they expect the people in the trade, the assistants, the consumers and everybody else to come up individually and collectively and parade outside Leinster House until they convince people that there is a demand?  The strongest argument that the hours are correct is the fact that there was a demand for their preservation in the three boroughs where they were left and nobody for a moment has questioned them since, either when the Bill was going through the Seanad or through this House.  I do not like pressing the Minister about anything in connection with this Bill, because, from beginning to end, he handled it very fairly.  I disagree entirely with Deputy Dillon about the question of split hours.  He is, he says, an unrepentant opponent of split hours. As far as I know, from studying the matter and reading reports of commissions in various parts of the <Col N="870" /> world, the split-hours seem to have been adopted in a number of countries and have always been held to be one of the great causes in the reduction of insobriety in those countries.  To my mind, that is a very strong argument but, in view of the fact that the assistants are in a good position if they get the four hours, in view of the fact that the trade are quite agreeable to have the four hours, in view of the fact that the other boroughs have it and are satisfied with it, I think the Minister ought to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words in support of the amendment. First of all, I feel the public are entitled to some consideration in the matter of the Sunday hours.  I know the difficulties with which the Minister has had to contend and, in fact, I feel every member of the House is in the same position, of trying to please everybody.  That is impossible.  The question of the hours has been a matter of considerable controversy and various points of view have been put forward. In regard to the City of Dublin, I feel that the city has been out of line with the country in connection with the Sunday hours of opening.  I think it has been a disgrace to the State that <Col N="871" /> on many occasions during the year there have been large crowds coming to Dublin in connection with national games and no opportunity was given them of getting refreshments although such opportunities are available in other centres.  That led to a considerable amount of abuse.  The Minister knows the difficulties the Gárdaí had in maintaining the law and, from that point of view, I think the adoption of this amendment would go a long way towards ending the abuse and would give the Gárdaí an opportunity of dealing with it if the hours that are decided upon are properly recognised by everybody.  I can well appreciate the Minister's difficulties in the matter, but I think that these hours, that is, 1 to 3 and 5 to 7, would give general satisfaction.  I think the public would be glad to have these facilities accorded to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose this is the last opportunity I will have to state that I am an unrepentant opponent of the split hours.  Again I say I think it has been a retrograde step.  We got on so well in Dublin for so many years with the 2 to 5 opening that I think the Minister should have kept to those hours.  It was quite long enough time for anybody who wanted a drink.  By breaking the hours; you are spoiling the assistants' day; you are spoiling the licensed traders' day.  I am satisfied that if there had been a vote of assistants and licensed traders on the matter, not half a dozen licensed traders would ask for the extended and broken hours that are now being imposed upon them.  The assistants fought for many years to get reasonable hours on Sunday.  They succeeded in getting the hours fixed at 2 to 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a retrograde step to bring back the split hours.  The day is completely spoiled for both assistants and licensed traders.  By the time they get a cup of tea and clean up the shop, it will be 7.30 or 7.45 and it will be too late to go to Church, to the pictures, to the seaside or any place of amusement.  From that point of view, I say the Minister has done wrong.  There may be good points in other parts of the Bill, but I want to <Col N="872" /> enter my final protest against the retrograde step of giving extended hours for drinking on Sunday and especially against the split hours. which will spoil the whole life of the assistant and the licensed trader.  It is also giving extended opportunities for drinking to the Dublin worker who would otherwise go home at 5 o'clock in the evening to have his Sunday cup of tea with his family.  You are now trying to break him away from that by extending the hours to 7 o'clock, and I oppose that proposal.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Byrne, I am opposed to any increase of the opening hours in the city, apart altogether from the fact that no similar concession has been made for the rural districts.  No real case has been made for an extension of the opening hours.  Deputy Dillon put forward a very strong argument with regard to the hours for the sale of drink in clubs.  That is an evil that ought to be dealt with.  I think it could be dealt with more effectively by restricting the hours of opening in the clubs rather than extending the hours of drinking in the public houses.</P>

      <P>An extension of the hours of drinking in the public houses is not the most effective, the most reasonable or the common-sense method of dealing with this abuse.  I think the Minister is wrong in so far as he is providing for a split period on Sundays.  I think three hours is a reasonable period, and if the Minister stuck to three hours there would be no occasion for a split hour and there would be no occasion for the inconvenience and the embarrassment which are being caused to the licensed trade and the assistants through having to close licensed premises twice on the same day and in the course of a short period.</P>

If he thinks the existing hours 2 to 5 are not suitable, he could fix from 3 to 6, or any other period he thinks best.  He should, however, adhere to the period which formerly obtained, and which was found satisfactory in every respect.  I think the Minister has been too susceptible to pressure both here and in the Seanad.  If he is introducing another Licensing Bill, I suggest he should take the precaution of providing himself with a Churchill tank.</P>

      <P>I should like to mention that when Deputy Dillon was referring to clubs he pointed his finger specifically at one club&mdash;the Catholic Commercial Club of this city.  I want to have it put on the records of the House that that club has a restaurant, and it serves approximately 200 lunches per day.  It has not sufficient building space to acquire a residential club licence.  I suggest that it should not be numbered among those clubs which are nothing better than drinking dens.</P>

      <P>My original proposal for Sunday opening was 1 to 2 and 4 to 7. A deputation of the assistants came to me, and they objected to the 7 p.m. closing.  Subsequently, G.A.A. representatives, the representatives of the <Col N="874" /> Co. Dublin Board, came with one of the officers of the assistants' organisation, and they appealed to me not to destroy the Gaelic games in Dublin. They reminded me of a thing I was aware of&mdash;that they were the bulwark of the G.A.A. in this city.  I do not apologise for feeling very concerned about that.  The position is not quite the same in Cork.  I think it could be said that the core of every club in the city is formed by these assistants. Therefore, in view of the strong representations made, I changed the hour to 2 o'clock, because otherwise it would affect a very large and important section of the community&mdash;the G.A.A.</P>
      <P>With regard to the position of the assistants or the publicans, I know that the assistants are protected by law; they have a 48-hour week and it is a matter of arrangement between themselves and their employers as to how those 48 hours will be worked.  I am more concerned with the public interest, and that is what is involved here.  I agree with Deputy Doyle that the public interest is served by having a later closing hour on Sunday.  It was in order to meet the point made, that a lot of trade that would otherwise go to the publican would go to the club, that I agreed to a compromise between 1 and 2.  That was how we arrived at the 1.30.  That is the way the Bill left the Seanad and, so far as I can gather, there has been a change of attitude on the part of the traders.  They seemed to be satisfied with that arrangement then, but now they have changed their minds, and apparently others have, too.  At any rate, I had another deputation again this week&mdash;the Dublin County Board of the G.A.A.&mdash;and they told me they doubted if the half-hour was sufficient, but that they would try to carry on.  I am sticking to that arrangement and I believe I am justified. If this matter goes to a division, I shall have to resist the amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a consequential amendment on No.1, and, as we have altered that by the amendment that was carried, I will have to ask permission to make a change.  As drafted, this amendment assumes the passing of the other amendment from the Seanad.

      <P>I move: That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 31.  In page 13, before sub-section (2), a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) A person who is at the one time the holder of a six-day beerhouse licence and the holder of a seven-day beerhouse licence shall, on application at any sitting of the justice of the district court in whose district are situate the premises to which the six-day beerhouse licence is attached, be entitled to have the seven-day beerhouse licence transferred to the premises to which the six-day beerhouse licence is attached, but subject to the condition that, on such transfer being made, the six-day beerhouse licence shall not be renewed <Col N="878" /> and the premises to which the seven-day beerhouse licence was attached before such transfer shall, for the purposes of the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, be deemed never to have been licensed.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to enable the holder of a six-day beerhouse licence to transfer to his premises a seven-day beerhouse licence irrespective of where the premises are situate.  Under the Bill as passed by the Dáil a seven-day licence could be transferred to premises to which a six-day licence is attached only if the situate in the same or in adjoining districts of the district court.  There are only four six-day beerhouse licences in the whole of the country and the amendment will not, therefore, make much difference.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is merely to extend for another year the Seeds and Fertilisers Act of 1942.  In addition to that, it validates the action which has already been taken by county councils to provide seeds and fertilisers in time for the winter wheat sowing season.  Last September the county councils were advised to consider the provision of these facilities for small cultivators. As in previous years, all counties have adopted the scheme.</P>

He has fixed a maximum retail price for seed wheat, a very proper thing to do, but when the retail distributor who sought to have supplies ready to meet applicants under this scheme went to the wholesale distributor to get supplies of seed for retail distribution, he was informed by the wholesale distributor that the Minister for Agriculture had fixed no maximum price for him and, therefore, the wholesale distributor said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the administration of the Minister for Agriculture.  The reason why there is no seed is, that when the retail distributor goes to the wholesale distributor he is informed by the latter that he will not sell seed wheat to him one penny less than the retailer is constrained by law to sell the seed to the farmer.  The result of that is that the retailer is required to pay, free on rail to Dublin, the same price for seed wheat that he is permitted by law to sell it at in Tuam or elsewhere.  The rehandlers from whom the retailer buys the seed wheat are charging the same price per barrel for seed wheat, free on rail to Dublin, Wexford or Waterford, as the retail distributor, who is supposed to distribute the seed under this scheme, is permitted by law to charge in Cahirciveen, Dunmanway, Ballaghaderreen or Castleblayney. That is the position of shopkeepers and of retail distributors who are anxious to co-operate with those whom the scheme is designed to assist &mdash;the small men who cannot afford to send a large order for seed wheat direct to a rehandler.  This scheme has been designed to assist the small farmer. The big farmer can deal directly with the rehandler because he can send him an order that is worth rehandling, but the small farmer who buys perhaps a cwt. or a couple of barrels of seed wheat must deal with the small distributor, and it is to help him that this scheme was evolved.  In the places to which the persons who should benefit under this scheme go to get their seed, there is no seed.</P>

Somebody has to pay the carriage between Dublin and Ballaghaderreen.  Somebody has to pay the carriage from the station to the shop.  Somebody has to pay for opening the bag, shovelling out the wheat, and weighing it out to the farmer.  How can anybody meet those charges if he is constrained to pay 3/3 per stone f.o.r. Dublin and sell at 3/3 per stone ex-shop Ballaghaderreen?  Of course, what happened is that the distributors who should have operated this scheme threw their hands in the air and stopped distributing the seed. Surely it is reducing the proceedings of this House to a farce if we are going solemnly to sit here and compliment each other on this beautiful scheme. The Opposition says it is a lovely scheme, and the Minister is to be congratulated upon it.  The Minister says he is very happy to be of assistance to the agricultural community, and we all shake hands around the House, while those of us who live in the country know damn well that the scheme cannot operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;either of two things is happening.  Either uncleaned seed is being sold as clean seed, to the great detriment of those who are buying it, or the persons who are distributing it are distributing it at no profit at all. I do not know how they could do that, and I do not believe they are doing it.  There may be certain cases where unscrupulous merchants are simply buying whatever wheat they can get locally and, without taking any precautions, are selling it as seed wheat at 3/3 a stone.  If they are, then this scheme is not only a fraud but a menace, because men are sowing seed which ought not to be sown at all.  But where the seed is properly cleaned, where it is assembled and tested before it is sent out, I say it is physically impossible for small distributors in 90 per cent. of the towns in this country to distribute seed at all. It seems to me utterly indefensible and shameful, in face of that acknowledged fact, which the Minister for Agriculture admitted himself in this House only a fortnight ago, that nobody in this House seems to give a damn, nobody seems a bit surprised, nobody <Col N="886" /> seems a bit shocked, nobody seems to see anything wrong in this state of affairs.  I think it is monstrous that we should be paying Ministers to do a certain job when those Ministers throw their hands in the air and will not do it.  Surely some other Deputies know the facts surrounding the sale of seed wheat in rural Ireland as well as I do.  Let them stand up and deny if they dare the facts which I have mentioned.  They cannot do so.  If the facts are as I allege them to be, surely it is a shame that Dáil Eireann should be renewing a scheme of this kind and at the same time washing its hands of all responsibility for the job of ensuring that adequate supplies of proper seed wheat will be available to the poor people who take advantage of this scheme and go to their local merchants to try to get seed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very brief.  Deputy Dillon has given us a great outburst of eloquence on this matter, and, as I come from the same county as the Deputy, I should like to put him on the right track.  It is possible that what Deputy Dillon states is quite correct as regards Ballaghaderreen.  It is possibly a non-wheat growing or non-cereal growing area, and they may have to get their seed from outside. But I should like the Deputy to ask the Roscommon County Council in how many cases applications for seed wheat have not been granted.  Have any complaints been made to him?  There have not.  In the area in Roscommon which I come from there is any amount of wheat growers and assemblers, and there is excellent cleaning machinery. The farmers of Roscommon are not such duffers as to sow weeds or any other kind of rubbish they are given. They have been growing very good wheat.  As far as the Act is concerned, it is a rather small gesture towards the small grower.  Those are the facts.  If encomiums are earned by the Minister or anybody else, let him have them. <Col N="887" /> The Act provides facilities for very small farmers in each county, and it was said here last year by the Chairman of the Cork County Council that, for the small farmers in Cork, it was the best Act ever passed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Dillon has said as regards the price of seed from the assemblers is quite true.  They will charge that price in Dublin, but I do not know anybody in Roscommon getting seed from Dublin or any other part outside the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to defend the Department of Agriculture's scheme for the provision of seed wheat, but I think the Deputy is rather mixed in this matter when he talks about a wholesaler and a retailer.  The Act does not recognise any wholesaler.  It envisages a situation whereby a number of assemblers are licensed to assemble seed wheat all over the country.  They were licensed prior to last harvest.  A man who got that assemblers' licence obviously would make provision for sample wheat at that time.  He could buy wheat at a premium over 60/- and he still had a margin of 15/-, in my opinion an ample allowance.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that is the ideal way but it is the method which the Department has adopted.  The two or three merchants in Ballaghaderreen who were licensed to assemble wheat were licensed prior to last harvest and they were in a position to take any suitable wheat that was offered.  They were also permitted to offer 2/- or 3/- over and above the fixed price.  As far as the seed apparatus is concerned, that apparatus is a very crude affair in a great many districts.  It is merely an ordinary winnowing machine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be quite good but it should be possible, even in a remote district like Ballaghaderreen, to assemble wheat at 65/- if a man were buying at the right time.  I agree with <Col N="888" /> Deputy Dillon that this scheme, so far as providing credit for the agriculturists to meet any expanding system of food production is concerned, does not meet the problem.  On that ground, I have already criticised it. It was merely eye-wash; it was merely an excuse on the part of the Government. It did help a number of small people to the extent of £10 or £15 each but that was the outside figure.  It did provide credit for people who were unable to get facilities from merchants. In my constituency there is no great problem of that kind because the local merchants, who are licensed to assemble and to sell the seed and manures that are available, are prepared to give credit where a man is creditworthy at all.  The disadvantage of that is that the purchaser is unfortunately tied to the man who gives him credit and has to sell back to him again in the harvest.  He has not a free market.  That does not matter so much under a system of guaranteed prices.  The objection in that case is to a great extent eliminated.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that so far as making any credit provision for the production of more food is concerned, the Act is no great help.  A man who has not very much capital but who has a fair amount of land with very little equipment, is involved in a considerable outlay in the production of food before he gets any return.  No facilities whatever have been made or no provision is being made to cover cases of that kind. That is the reason I have condemned this scheme in former years, that it has not attempted to provide that type of man with credit facilities during an emergency of this sort when there should be ample credit facilities provided. I agree that it does in a small way make some attempt to provide facilities for the type of man who cannot get credit from anyone but he is a very doubtful type.  The local authority provides him with the necessary facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy Dillon's complaints as to his difficulties in getting seed wheat from the seed assembler and I do not wonder that he has experienced some trouble, because I am sure wheat does give <Col N="889" /> Deputy Dillon a wide berth on all occasions.  I do not wonder at the seed assembler's reluctance to give him facilities to sell as a retailer.  I do know, however, that one of the largest assemblers in Ireland happens to reside in Wexford, and I am sure if Deputy Dillon will communicate with him he will get the necessary facilities. I refer to the Shelburne Cooperative Society.  This talk about the price being fixed, and no provision being made for the wholesaler and retailer, is all hot air and nonsense. As Deputy Hughes has pointed out, there is a margin which enables the seed assemblers to sell to any retailer who makes application to them, if they wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a number of them in the last fortnight providing themselves with seed wheat from some of the large seed assemblers.  On the whole, I think this Act has done a lot of good.  It is not an emergency measure.  Deputy Hughes is aware that this Act was in operation for a number of years before the emergency. The Act which this Bill proposes to continue was of very great service to <Col N="890" /> a number of people.  The amount which may be advanced to any one grower is a matter for the local authority.  Deputy Hughes's local authority was absolutely free to advance up to £60 or £100 to particular farmers if it wished to do so.  The Act did not tie it up in any way, and I am aware that in certain counties, the county council advanced up to £100 to individuals.  The amount to be advanced is a matter which is left to the discretion of the particular county council.  To say that it did not give any facilities to any one is not in accordance with the facts because quite a number of people did take advantage of it.  At the present time, however, when such a good price is ruling for corn, seed merchants do not require these guarantees.  They are prepared to give credit to any one who is willing to sow corn.  In fact, merchants throughout the country are tumbling over one another in their anxiety to give credit to growers of wheat and barley.  There is not much advantage in such circumstances in this Act as the merchants are prepared to give credit without guarantees. The system operated under the Act is, however, a good sound system, and this Bill which proposes to continue the Act should have a ready passage as it is a Bill that will operate to the advantage of a large number of small growers throughout the country.</P>

      <P>This Bill, as far as I know, mostly affects counties in which small farmers are in the majority.  It is a valuable Bill and it would be a great pity if any hitch arose in operating it.  If, as Deputy Dillon suggests, some hitch has arisen I think the Deputy has done a good service in bringing it to the notice of the Dáil. If there is any hitch in working the Act, it should be put right now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience of farmers getting credit for growing crops is not quite as rosy as that of Deputy Allen.  I know of an unfortunate woman who wanted to get credit for the spring crop.  She could not get it from the seed merchant.  She tried to get a small loan from the Agricultural Credit <Col N="891" /> Corporation, and was turned down without any reason being given. Everybody is not in the happy condition that Deputy Allen speaks of.  I regard this as a boon for small farmers in certain counties, as they can get credit through the county council, and it would be a pity if any hitch occurred. I am afraid that some seed merchants are selling seeds of a very inferior quality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just calling attention to that.  Perhaps the Minister for Agriculture will have to deal with it.  There is a great loss by sowing inferior wheat seed in County Cavan. There is very little time to spare now, and these things should be examined by the Minister or by the Minister for Agriculture before it is too late.  I have heard Deputy Allen say that every man has his seed in now.  That is not our experience in County Cavan. Those who have to get it from the county council will be looking for the seed in April, and it would be a great mistake if they had to sow inferior seed then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand Deputy Dillon at all.  I am sure there is no Deputy who appreciates more precisely than he does the exact nature of any proposal put before this House &mdash;that is, provided he has studied the proposal.  The terms of the Principal Act, which this Bill proposes to extend, are familiar to every member of the House.  This Bill never has been introduced as a measure to improve or develop agriculture or to assist agriculture. It has been brought in entirely as a measure to enable small landowners to grow grain for themselves, their families and their stock.  In that sense, therefore, it is not an agricultural measure but a social measure. Accordingly, there is no use in Deputies rising here and telling the Minister for Local Government and Public Health what the merits or demerits of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, may be.  It cannot affect me.  I am charged only with the administration <Col N="892" /> of this particular measure, and naturally, like all wise administrators, I have to stick to my own Department, and see that it is run properly and as efficiently as possible.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I would not like the House to lie under the impression that this Act was not effective in enabling small-holders throughout the country to get seed wheat last year, because that would be quite contrary to the facts.  As a rule, people who avail of this measure want to grow oats and potatoes mainly.  In these last two or three years&mdash;because of the difficulty in getting sufficient flour &mdash;they have gone in for wheat growing. The staple seeds upon which these moneys were expended were seed potatoes and seed oats.  Let us look at the figures.  In 1942, 683 tons of oat seed were purchased under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not very exciting. As Deputy Allen has pointed out, it has not been necessary in these last two seasons for people to avail of this scheme to anything like the extent to which they might have availed of it in less prosperous times from the farmers point of view, when merchants might be chary about granting credit to small farmers.  In 1942, 683 tons of oat seed and 622 tons of seed potatoes were purchased. Of wheat seed&mdash;which Deputy Dillon has told the House it was impossible for these small farmers to obtain&mdash;582 tons were sold.  That is a very close correspondence; people bought almost equal quantities of seed potatoes, oat seed and wheat seed. When we bear these figures in mind, the case which Deputy Dillon was making collapses completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not prepared to say that, here and there, there may not have been difficulty in getting wheat seed.  I will take the Deputy's word that, in his particular area, there was such difficulty, but no representations have been made to my Department to that effect.  Persons come along now and say that <Col N="893" /> there is no use in prolonging this measure, giving the county councils authority to carry out these schemes this year because the seed which it was intended to assist these small-holders to purchase is not available.  It has been pointed out to us that there has been a very much decreased demand for facilities.  Of course, the price has been good and every person who grew wheat had the certainty of being able to sell it if he wished to do so, and merchants are finding it possible to extend credit very liberally, as Deputy Allen has said.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the point made by Deputy McGovern, who said that this scheme has been found expensive.  On the contrary, it was not: the gratifying feature of this seeds and fertilisers scheme has been that&mdash; though it has done a great deal of good, particularly in the poorer areas of this country&mdash;the cost has been comparatively small.  I think that, in the year 1939, the total loss incurred by the county councils was about £97.  In 1941 about £700 was outstanding on the date upon which the accounts were closed, but the farmers continued to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, over the whole country.  This scheme has been a beneficial one, from the point of view of the people who avail of it.  They have appreciated it and have met their commitments under it.  It is quite true that, in County Carlow, for instance, it has not been extensively availed of at all&mdash;there were only 42 recipients there &mdash;because apparently the County Carlow people did not require the scheme.  On the other hand, in Cork 490 persons received loans under the scheme, in Mayo 768, in Roscommon 565.  For the other counties the figures ranged from 26 for North Tipperary&mdash; which I think was the lowest&mdash;right up to the peak figure in Mayo.</P>

All that, however, points to one thing, and that is that this is not, as Deputy Dillon and Deputy Hughes seem to believe, a scheme to assist agriculture: this is a social scheme designed to assist the small agriculturist&mdash;the subsistence farmer&mdash;to produce food for himself and for his stock.</P>

      <P>In so far as this is designed to assist the subsistence farmer, surely the Minister would not be going outside the ambit of his authority if he were to make some inquiry as to whether these things would be available in the places where these farmers ordinarily go.  Would it not be possible to ensure that these supplies will be available in the shops to which the beneficiaries of these schemes would be ordinarily expected to resort?  That is all I want.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Dillon's point, I may say that I am very chary about putting my nose into other people's business.  These schemes, in fact, are county council schemes.  We give them the authority to proceed, but they draw up the schemes themselves, and I do not believe that any of the county managers who have been recently appointed, or any of the county councils that have been recently elected, are going to launch schemes in which they do not believe, or which they do not think would be of any practical value.  I am perfectly certain that if, for instance, the Roscommon County Council, or any other county council in the country, adopt a scheme, they will ensure, in so far as they can, that the seed wheat will be available, and that, if it is not available, they will make representations to the proper quarter, and that is to the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main purpose of this Bill is to extend the period prescribed by the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Act, 1940, by the deletion in the definition of the expression &ldquo;the prescribed period&rdquo; of the date &ldquo;the 30th day of September, 1942&rdquo;, and the substitution in lieu thereof of the date &ldquo;the 31st day of March, 1945&rdquo;, and by the deletion, in the definition of the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo;, of paragraphs (a) to (d), and the substitution therefor of the paragraphs set out in the present Bill. Originally, the date was fixed as 30th September, 1942, and the Bill now before the House will enable a similar remission to be granted in respect of houses completed before 31st March, 1945.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another provision in the Bill relates to the definition of &ldquo;residence&rdquo;, and the intention is to ensure that, where a remission of rates has been granted <Col N="897" /> in respect of a dwelling constructed, or an improvement made, under any of these Acts, a man will not qualify for a further remission if any further improvement is made to the dwelling. The reason there is that once a grant has been made, and once a remission of rates has been granted, no further concession would be justified in respect of the enlargement or improvement of the house which had already benefited under the various Housing Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister how this would operate in the case of a house that has been already subject to the remission of rates, and which now comes in under sub-section (2) of Section 2.  I am concerned with cases where the rates have been remitted for some years, and I wish to know whether it is the intention under sub-section (2) that all these rates would be classed now as unpaid arrears of rates, and written up against the owner of the house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the new Bill, you have a new definition, and you want to make sure that no remission will take place where a grant has been already given, but what I want to know is, what will happen in the case of a residence, which was already the subject of a grant.  Will it mean that a man, who has been enjoying a remission of rates for four, five, six, or ten years, will now have that curtailed or abolished, and not alone that but be charged with the arrears of rates for all these years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>For one thing, there is the fact that this was designed to encourage the building of new houses, and in many cases the amount of the grant was related to the floor area or the cubic content&mdash;I forget which&mdash;of the house.  It was a particular type of house, the building of which we were desirous of encouraging, and we granted a remission&mdash;which is granted, remember, at the cost of the local authority&mdash;of rates in respect of that dwelling.  Some of the local authorities have found this rather onerous, and, in addition to that, we have a situation in <Col N="900" /> which persons who come under one Act would be disqualified from getting this remission in respect of enlargements or improvements which persons under another Act, as the law stands, might be entitled to get and might succeed in recovering.</P>
      <P>We want to make the position uniform and to ensure that henceforward once a person has got his concession in respect of an improvement or enlargement which he has already carried out, or a new house which he has already constructed, he cannot come along again and get, as of right under the law, a further remission.  So far as we are concerned our position is that we realise that these remissions are granted at the expense of the local authority and we feel that there must be a definite limit to the things we can concede at the expense of other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister has considered a point which occurs to me.  There may be no substance in it, but the Minister is familiar with the practice in rural Ireland of making over a house to young people, the old people going into a room.  It has been a not infrequent practice in certain parts of the country when the old people are determined to retire to the west room, to build a west room as an annexe to the house, and you will very often see a thatched cottage with a slated portion added, the historical explanation of it being that it was originally the room.  I regard it as a good social practice, and I wonder if this new arrangement prohibiting the family from getting any rating advantage on such a structure would in any way interfere with it?  To tell the truth, I should not be prepared to certify that this new departure would adversely affect that practice.  I had never thought of it, but I wonder if it has occurred to the Minister's Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that they never did get a remission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Allen says that in these circumstances they never did get a remission of rates, but a great number of houses have been built all over the country in the last ten years <Col N="901" /> in respect of which this remission was, no doubt, forthcoming.  Under this proposal, if these people build an additional room, there will be no remission of rates in respect of it and, in fact, there will be 100 per cent. rates as from the date the new room is completed. I do not know whether that is a desirable arrangement or not. <i>Prima Facie</i>, it does not seem very desirable to me, but possibly I take an unduly grave view of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's decision not to give additional relief in respect of an annexe to a house which has already got a relief of rates, as well as a Government grant, is a sound principle.  It is possible that there will not be very many such annexes or additions built to houses which have already received a Government grant or a remission of rates.  They may be few in number in the normal course, but what I want to ask the Minister is how long this principle is to continue? It has been the practice in the last ten or 15 years to give a remission of rates in respect of new houses, but many local authorities are objecting to it, and are losing revenue each year as a result.  They find that many old houses are condemned and allowed to fall down, while some houses are built, and that their revenues are decreasing owing to the operation of this relief of rates Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State has been fairly liberal to people building new houses in the way of giving grants from the Central Exchequer. The system has been availed of, and it originated through pressure being brought to bear on the Government or on somebody else, by speculative builders who reaped the full advantage of this remission as the incoming tenant paid in full.  The speculative builder, whom the Government quite rightly were interested to encourage to build new houses, reaped the full benefit of the relief which was not handed on to the tenant.  If a private person built a new house, he reaped the benefit, but in the case of men building 100, 200, or 1,000 houses, the incoming tenant paid in full, while the speculative builder was enabled to reap additional benefits in the way of <Col N="902" /> rates relief, in addition to his profits on building and his ground rents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>How did he reap the benefit of rates remission?  He never paid rates as he did not enter into possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan knows quite well that he can reap the benefit. It is fairly well known how it can be done.  If the rates remission arrangement did not exist, he would not get so much for his houses when selling them, or for his ground rents.  That is a well-known fact.</P>
      <P>I want to know from the Minister whether this policy is to continue in the future.  We all hope that after the war there will be a lot of building done.  Private persons have built something near the same number of houses as local authorities in the last ten years, and that is a considerable number.  If the war is over and settled conditions come about within the next five or six or seven years, we hope that a new impetus will be given to the building of houses.  But, if this policy is to continue over the next ten or 20 years, I put it to the Minister that it will mean a very serious impost on local authorities, both urban and rural.  It is a matter for consideration and it should not be done hastily.  Private persons or speculative builders should be given a fair warning over a number of years that this provision will cease in 1945 or 1946, or whenever it will cease, and will not be renewed, that that will be the definite policy of the Government. Many local authorities are up in arms against this at present.  They find their valuations dropping year by year and the rate impost is increasing on the ratepayers.  Therefore, I hope that the Minister will announce a definite policy as to the continuance of this relief of rates for persons who build new houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot to be said for and against this Remission of Rates Bill.  Like Deputy Allen, I think that some of its effects could be questioned.  In a great many cases big business houses find it absolutely <Col N="903" /> necessary to extend their premises.  I suggest that these are not cases in which the Remission of Rates Act should apply, because when these people extend their premises they are able to make large profits in consequence of the extension, and the smaller ratepayers in the towns or county areas have to pay for that extension without consideration of the profits that may be made from the business carried on.  I think there should be a line drawn.  I should have thought that the object of this Act would be to stimulate building, not only from the point of view of the speculative builder but of the person who would be building a house to live in.  As to the speculative builder, I know of cases where people have built houses and, when fixing the rent of these houses, they have included the full rate that prevailed at that particular time.  They charged a certain rent and the full rate was included in that rent, although they only paid to the local authority the particular proportion of the rates provided for in the Act.  I think there should be some method by which the Minister or somebody in his Department would have access to the books of such a man to find out what profit he is making on the actual building of that house. He should be given a decent profit, but he should not be permitted to charge 100 per cent. of the rates to the person who has taken the house, and only pay the proportion laid down in the Act to the local authority. That has happened in a great many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned before in this House certain cases which I believe should get relief under this Act but my proposal was turned down.  I refer to cases of people who buy houses from a local authority under a system of weekly payments extending over a number of years.  These people get no relief in rates.  Some of them are a good deal poorer than those who are in a position to put up a certain amount of money, augmented by a grant from the Government, to build their own house.  I suggest that persons buying a house from a local authority by means of a weekly sum <Col N="904" /> should get relief in rates.  Their case is more pressing than that of those people who are being given relief of rates under the Act in operation and who will be given relief under this new Bill. Therefore I ask the Minister seriously to consider the case of persons of that kind.  There are many artisans and tradesmen who are buying their houses from a local authority under the system of weekly payments.  They are charged full rates, while their neighbours, who are perhaps better off, and who are able to put up a certain amount of money to build houses with grants provided by the Government and the local authority, are only paying a certain proportion of rates over a certain period.  I think that is very unfair.  These are the people we should try to relieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With a great deal that has been said as to the disadvantages which arise from the granting of this remission of rates I am in agreement, but the position we are in at the moment is that there is so little building going on that, in order to provide employment, we are prepared to extend the existing concessions with regard to building operations for an additional period of two years.  We anticipate that by 1945 the future will become clearer and possibly there will be a complete reconsideration and revision of the whole of the housing and rating code.  At the moment it is quite clear that, in ordinary prudence, we should not remove any inducement which has been customary for the past ten years from persons who are prepared to undertake the construction of these new buildings.  The object of the Bill is mainly to ensure that there will be no greater impediment placed in the way of people who are prepared to build and to give employment than existed prior to the occurrence of the emergency.</P>

      <P>That in view of the increased cost of living and the inadequacy of the benefits payable at present to unemployed persons, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the Government should at once introduce proposals for increasing substantially the rates of benefit under (a) the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and (b) the Unemployment Assistance Acts.</P>
      <P>It is gratifying to note that both before and immediately after this Government came into office they accepted the principle that it was the duty of the State to provide work for all its able-bodied citizens or, failing that, a decent standard of maintenance for those for whom it could not provide decent employment.  I think many sentences can be quoted from the speech made by the Taoiseach in this House on the 29th April, 1932, to support that statement, and I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce has no intention of challenging the accuracy of my statement on this important matter.  When what is known as uncovenanted benefits, or what is equivalent to unemployment assistance, was first introduced, not in this country, but in England, it was clearly understood to mean the provision of assistance of a temporary nature to maintain a person who was leaving one job while he was waiting to find another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Never was it admitted by the members of this Party&mdash;and I dare say it was never claimed by the Minister or his Party&mdash;that the benefits fixed in pre-war days for those who were entitled <Col N="906" /> to receive unemployment insurance benefit or unemployment assistance could be regarded as adequate or sufficient to keep the persons concerned and their dependents in common decency and comfort.  I know of many cases where those in receipt of the maximum amount of unemployment assistance, who had large families, were unable to maintain themselves and their families in pre-war days, and had to go to the local assistance officers or board of health authorities to supplement the miserable sum that they received.</P>
    <P>That is happening to a much greater extent in recent times.  I think the returns of the board of health authorities bear testimony to what I say.</P>
    <P>This proposal is based mainly on the ground of the increase in the cost of living.  Figures are available which prove that the cost of living has increased out of all proportion to the benefits which these people received in pre-war days.  The latest Government returns concerning the increase in the cost of living have been published in the <i>Irish Trade Journal.</i>  The mid-November cost of living figures show that the increase in the cost of living at the date when these returns were made was, generally, 58 per cent. above pre-war level. Anybody who knows anything about the responsibilities of keeping a house and family knows&mdash;and the Minister, I am sure, will be the first to admit it&mdash; that 58 per cent. is not a real representation of the increase in the cost of living, having regard to the actual cost of purchasing essential commodities for the household of an ordinary working-class individual.  The cost of living, I am sure, has considerably increased even since the figures which I have referred to were made up.</P>
    <P>Assuming that the cost of living has gone up by 58 per cent., it means that the wife of a recipient of unemployment insurance benefit or unemployment assistance would have to find 31/7 in mid-November last to purchase what she could get for £1 in pre-war days.  It is a fact that it is impossible to purchase many of the articles that were generally consumed in working-class homes.  The 58 per cent. has, <Col N="907" /> therefore, no bearing on the actual cost of commodities which must now be consumed by the working-class people. There are many commodities that cannot be purchased at any price which were available in pre-war days for ordinary persons at fairly reasonable prices.  I made inquiries recently as to the cost of a rabbit.  In pre-war days rabbits could be bought in shops in the constituency which the Minister represents at from 3d. to 5d. each. Where they are available, in the shops in that constituency or elsewhere in the City of Dublin to-day, they cost 1/11 each.  That is more than a 58 per cent. increase in the cost of one article of food which was commonly consumed by working-class people in pre-war days.  Deputy Hannigan tells me that it represents more than 350 per cent. increase.</P>
    <P>Many of the people who would be entitled to receive unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance are living on or outside the boundaries of our cities.  Taking the latest reliable figures that I could find, 60 per cent. of those on the live register live in rural areas and roughly 40 per cent. live in what are known as urbanised areas.  I am quoting from a document issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce dealing with the question of employment and unemployment in the years 1940 and 1941, and I am basing my 60 per cent. as against 40 per cent. figure on the figures that were published in table E, page 11, of the document issued by the Minister's Department.  I am also quoting from the figures for the month of January, 1941, when, I assume, no Employment Period Order was in operation.  I take it the Minister will agree that, generally speaking, 60 per cent. of the people in receipt of unemployment assistance live in the rural areas and 40 per cent. live in what are called urbanised areas.  The people who live in and around the boundaries of the urbanised areas generally have to pay as high a rent as those living within the urbanised areas and, for marketing purposes, they certainly have to pay the same prices as are paid by those who live inside the urbanised areas <Col N="908" /> where a higher rate of unemployment assistance is available than is available in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The allowance paid to those qualified to receive unemployment assistance is quite inadequate, especially in the case of unmarried men and women living in cities.  These people get no benefit from what is known as the voucher system which, I admit, has helped to some extent to enable families that qualified for the receipt of vouchers to tide over a very difficult period. During a recent discussion here on unemployment, and the failure of the Government to provide useful work for able-bodied citizens, there was an exchange across the floor of the House between the Taoiseach and Deputy Hannigan.  The Taoiseach very positively asserted that there was no such thing as destitution in the country, that hunger or destitution did not exist.  I presume he meant that nobody was living below the level which Christian people would be entitled to get in a country with a Constitution such as we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion referred to, I was more or less held up by the Chair when I was quoting from a speech made by the Taoiseach on the 29th April, 1932.  The Taoiseach observed that it would only be fair to him that I should quote the whole of a very long portion of that historic speech, which took up about two hours. That speech was delivered after he came into office in 1932.  There was apparently some doubt in the mind of the head of the Government as to whether people were living below the level of a decent existence in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> I will now quote some cases that were submitted to me recently by a person who is well known to the Minister, and who has a good deal of experience as a social worker in the city. These cases were reported to the public assistance authority at the time.  They deal with women workers not in receipt of the maximum amount now given to persons entitled to claim unemployment assistance.  The first case is that of a woman, an unemployed bag maker, idle for nearly two years, and suffering from incipient T.B.  In addition to an allowance of 8/6 she gets 4/- for nourishment from the Charles Street Dispensary.  The 4/- pays her rent, and she has the 8/6 on which to maintain herself.  I am not quite certain whether the Minister thinks that amount is sufficient to maintain a single woman in common decency.  The second case is that of a woman who has been receiving 12/- unemployment benefit for one and a half years.  Out of that she pays 7/- rent.  Dealing with the miserable conditions under which she tries to exist on this allowance, she writes: &ldquo;Only God and myself know how I live.&rdquo;  The third case is that of an intermittent worker.  Out of a 12/- allowance she pays 6/6 for rent.  The allowance was recently reduced to 8/6, and this lady has had to apply for supplementary relief.  All these women, by the way, are single women.</P>
    <P>The next case is that of a person in receipt of unemployment assistance. This person gets the minimum allowance, and she has no vouchers to assist her in the purchase of food.  She used to live with her sister, an old age pensioner, who recently died.  She has been two years out of work, and her 8/6 allowance was stopped because she did not sign at the labour exchange on the morning of her sister's funeral. Another bad case is that of a woman who has been two years idle.  She lived with two brothers, one of whom is blind; the other joined the Army recently. This woman found it impossible to pay the rent, and she has had to look for work in England.  That meant putting her blind brother into an institution.</P>
    <P>I quote these cases in order to have them put on the records of the House, <Col N="910" /> and I invite the Minister to say whether he stands for a system of maintenance which places single women in the position that these women now occupy.  These cases, I hope, will help my argument in favour of a better standard of maintenance for single women who cannot find work and for whom the Government have been unable to provide work.  There are many instances of unmarried male persons living in the cities and not receiving vouchers, and single women being placed in such a position as I have indicated. There is a clear case, I submit, for increasing the cash allowance paid to such people.  I appeal to the Government, during this critical emergency period, to extend the voucher system to all citizens who have the misfortune to be unable to find work.</P>
    <P>It is just as difficult for the person who lives in a small village to try to eke out an existence on this miserable pittance.  The people who live in non-urbanised areas, small villages and towns, have to pay a high rent for their houses and the cost of living affects them very considerably.  I was looking up a list of the non-urbanised areas where unemployed persons live.  I found that a considerable number of registered unemployed persons live in small towns like Granard, Ennistymon, Kilmallock, Newcastle West, Cahirciveen, Dingle, Killorglin, Listowel, Carrick-on-Shannon, Ballinrobe, Swinford, Manorhamilton, Killybegs and Dungloe.  I am quoting a list of towns where the number of unemployed registered in December last was, with two exceptions, in excess of 500.  Out of the 14 towns I have mentioned, the number of unemployed in five is well over 1,000 and, with two exceptions, the number of unemployed in the remaining towns is over 500.  Rents are very high in these places.  After paying their rents, these people are left with a very small amount to purchase the necessaries of life.  There is a clear case for an increase in the cash allowance paid to such persons under the Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance Acts.</P>
    <P>I assume I shall be asked by the Minister whether the workers who are <Col N="911" /> insuring under the Unemployment Assistance Acts would pay an increased contribution in order to make it possible that they should get increased benefits.  I will endeavour to answer that point.  On looking up the present position of the unemployment insurance fund, I received a shock when I found that a considerable sum is taken from this fund every year for the purpose of making up the allowance which is set aside for payment of unemployment assistance benefit.  If this fund was restored to its original financial basis, according to figures placed in my hands, it would be possible to pay increased benefit at the rate of 50 per cent., without forcing contributors to make any increased contribution.  Looking at the position of the fund for the years 1938, 1939, 1940 and 1941, I find that the total income, from all sources, in 1938, was £1,231,733, whereas the payments out amounted to £662,928, leaving a balance of £568,805; in 1939, the income was £1,266,210 and the payments out £663,308, leaving a balance of £602,902; in 1940, the income was £1,213,269 and the payments out £802,015, leaving a balance of £411,254; in 1941 the income was £1,235,846 and the payments out £836,619, leaving a balance of £399,227.</P>
    <P>The figures show that, during the four years 1938-1941, payments into the fund exceeded disbursements attributable to unemployment benefit by £1,982,000, the greater part of which was abstracted from the fund by the device of charging it with £300,000 for unemployment assistance and&mdash;this was education to me&mdash;increasing by 50 per cent. the charge for administration. When the Minister takes part in the discussion, I ask him to endeavour to justify the figure of 50 per cent. increase for administering the unemployment insurance fund.  I shall be very interested to know how the Minister will attempt to justify that increase.  Is it a device to reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for the payment of increased benefit to persons who contribute under the Unemployment Insurance <Col N="912" /> Acts?  I assert that if the fund was restored to its original financial basis, a 50 per cent. increase of the existing benefit could be paid without forcing contributors to make any increased contribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister will come along&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;with the claim that something has been done, since the motion was tabled by this Party, to give increased allowances to a certain percentage of individuals who are entitled to claim unemployment assistance benefit.  Some months ago, he introduced a scheme which enabled certain agricultural workers and unemployed persons living in turf-cutting areas to register and, if they would undertake to make themselves available, if required, for agricultural work and, particularly, for turf-cutting operations, they would, in some circumstances, be entitled to receive an extra 5/- weekly for having their names on the waiting register as men who might be considered suitable for turf cutting.  That is some advance.  I have not access to the register, but I should like to hear from the Minister what percentage of unemployed persons&mdash;particularly persons qualified to receive unemployment assistance benefit&mdash;are at present getting the benefit of that increased allowance.</P>
    <P>This motion proposes an increase in the amount of benefit to be paid in future to persons entitled to receive unemployment insurance benefit, and benefit under the Unemployment Assistance Acts and covers no less than 95,000 citizens of this State.  There are in round figures 90,000 persons registered as unemployed.  From the official figures I was surprised to see that 5,000 able-bodied young men between the ages of 18 and 25 have been refused unemployment assistance benefit by the labour exchanges because they would not join the Construction Corps.</P>
    <P>That is a mild form of conscription. If they do not join the Construction Corps, they are struck off the register, which would entitle them to receive unemployment assistance benefit.  I was amazed to find that the figures were as high as 5,000.  If on an average <Col N="913" /> 5,000 persons over a period of years were added to the numbers on the live register, it would mean that 95,000 citizens are concerned with whatever action the Minister may take as a result of this motion.  I read some journals that are published outside this country, but which circulate here, and it was stated in a recent publication that 150,000 citizens of this State are now serving in the British Forces.  I could quote the name of this American paper which stated&mdash;I think it was wrong&mdash;that about 400,000 citizens of this State are working on reconstruction work in England.  I do not know if the Minister read that statement in this American journal.  Personally, I think the figures given in it are grossly exaggerated.  But what is to be the position of the 150,000 persons now serving in the British Forces, and the equally high number of persons who, I am sure, are working on reconstruction work in England, when the war ends and they turn back to this country, either for work, if it is available, or for maintenance?  They will be coming back from a country where they were in receipt of very high wages, and where, if they continued to reside, they would be in receipt of maintenance allowance of a much higher standard than in present circumstances is paid in this country.  I do not envy the position of the present Government, if they happen to be in office, if they have to face up to that problem after the war.  At any rate, we want to keep our own people at home to do the work that is to be done here, producing more food and more fuel.  The Minister and his colleagues will have to make up their minds to provide these people with better wages for the work they are prepared to remain here to perform or, if unable to provide them with work at home, to provide more Christian standards of maintenance than are provided by the present regulations. I say: keep these people at home, put them to the work that is waiting to be done and pay them decent wages to get that work done. The reason for the mass emigration of our people during the past year or two is the inducement given them to go to another country where they can get three times the wages they got at home <Col N="914" /> in occupations in which they were previously employed.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister, in the most exciting speeches that he has been making in recent times from public platforms, seems to harp on the dangerous line that some people are advocating in this country.  He says: &ldquo;There can be no improvement in the social services unless there is an expansion of agricultural and industrial production.&rdquo;  Have I quoted the Minister correctly?  He must face up to the fact that he and his colleagues took responsibility publicly, and here in this Parliament got themselves elected as a Government on the undertaking that it was their duty to provide work for all our able-bodied citizens or a decent standard of maintenance for those for whom they were unable to provide work.  When the Minister talks of not being able to increase the social services unless there is an expansion of industrial and agricultural production does he relate what I may call that kind of Bank of Ireland argument to the increase in the cost of the Defence Services, to the increase in the cost of the Civil Service, and many other aspects of Governmental administration? We can increase industrial production and particularly agricultural production if we keep our own people at home to produce more food.  If we are going to do that we will have to give them a better standard of wages than they are being offered on the land by the farmers at the present time.

      <P>I wish to support the very eloquent appeal made by Deputy Davin for increased benefits for those who are suffering very great hardships at the present time.  I know, and I am sure other Deputies, especially those representing Dublin constituencies, know the difficulties that our unemployed people have to contend with, as well as people with small wages.  I received two letters this morning.  One says: &ldquo;I hope you will excuse me writing to you.  This is my first appeal.  My husband has to be away in eleven days owing to his being unemployed. He is in a very bad state at present for some inside clothes, and I would be very thankful, etc., etc.&rdquo; She finishes up by saying &ldquo;for the sake of my 12 children&rdquo;.  Her income is 25/-.  She has an unemployed husband. I say, definitely, that is starvation.  I have another letter from a woman who <Col N="916" /> says she is getting two children ready for Confirmation.  You know, she says, how difficult it is to get children ready for Confirmation.  &ldquo;My husband has only £2 5s. 6d. a week.  It is a terrible struggle.  I have 13 children altogether.&rdquo; There are two cases: 13 children in one family, and 12 in another.  The husband, in one case, has £2 5s. 6d. a week, and in the other the income is £1 5s. a week, unemployment assistance.  These people are being neglected at the present moment and something ought to be done to improve their lot.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon pointed out a few days ago the increase in the cost of clothing.  He mentioned that a few months ago a woman paid 4/- for a shirt for a boy of 12 or 14 years of age, and said that at the moment that shirt would cost 10/- or 12/-.  The price has gone up three times, but income has not gone up three times. One sees children in the City of Dublin going around wearing the remnants of summer clothing&mdash;clothing which has been washed threadbare. The cost of living has gone up so much that they are not able to get the ordinary requirements wherewith to clothe their children in a reasonable way.  If they apply, to the board of assistance for relief, it has, by the terms of its authority, to apply a means test which was never before applied to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred a few weeks ago to the case of the girl who had been in the children's hospital at Cappagh.  She has been referred to as the T.B. miracle of Cappagh.  She had been there for six years and came out cured.  When coming out, she was given 7/6 a week by the board of assistance to buy nourishment.  Her brother was living in one of the new flats provided by the corporation.  He was one of four, and got a job&mdash;carrying a butcher's basket&mdash;at 15/- a week. The income of the home was, in consequence, a little over the total allowed for four in a family.  The result was that the commissioners took the 7/6 a week from this girl.  She had been given that to enable her to buy codliver oil and other nourishment. This means test is being applied in all <Col N="917" /> kinds of cases to an extent that, I am satisfied, the Government do not wish. Therefore, I think something ought to be done to have word passed to the authorities that it is not to be enforced, and that everything ought to be done to give those people the benefit of the doubt.  As Deputy Davin's motion suggests, the allowances referred to ought to be increased, so that the people concerned will have enough to enable them to keep body and soul together.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to the cases of single men and single women.  A few weeks ago, I had a letter dealing with the case of six men&mdash;they are 65 years of age&mdash;who were staying in a common lodging house in the city, where they have to pay 6d. a night each.  Their only allowance is 10/6 a week each. They are not even given a free bag of fuel.  I thought they were entitled to that but it appears they are not.  That is the position of those unfortunate men.  Deputy Davin also referred to the case of the young man who had 10/6 a week from the labour exchange, and who was told that, if he did not join the Construction Corps, the 10/6 would be stopped.  That is definitely conscription.  There are plenty of men in the Construction Corps but they are there of choice.  If every young man of 18,19,20 or 22 years does not desire to join the Construction Corps of his own free will, it is not right that his 10/6 unemployment assistance should be stopped.</P>

I have already made reference to the fact that there are men in the Construction Corps of choice, fine, strong men, but men who feel that they are not fit for the heavy work in the Construction Corps should not be debarred, without an Act of this Dáil, from getting 10/6 per week unemployment assistance if they are entitled to it.</P>

      <P>I hope other Deputies will deal with that point.  Judging by the remarks of Deputy Keyes, he intends to follow on those lines, and put forward the claim that a man should get from the State the benefits to which he is entitled.  It is not right that his <Col N="919" /> 10/6 should be taken from him, or from his mother, because it is from his mother it is taken.</P>

      <P>I know that those boys who draw 10/6 a week will give 8/- or 9/- to their mothers.  By depriving them of their 10/6, it is the family you are taking it from, and it is not right or proper.  The allowances provided at present for single women who have given good service in some kind of employment, and who lose that employment, are totally inadequate.  You are forcing people to the relieving officer, and in some cases you are forcing them into hospital.  Forcing members of the Dublin working class, the tenement dwellers, into hospital in Dublin means forcing them into hospitals maintained by the municipality or the State.  They are forced into those institutions much against their will.  I do object to the kind of allowances provided at present. A man with 12 children who gets 25/- a week, pays 5/- or 6/- for rent.  One woman told me that a pair of stockings which she bought 12 months ago at 9d., for the confirmation of one of her children, cost 2/4½d. to-day.  How can they live on the allowances given, or in some cases on the wages given?  I know that other members of the House are saying to themselves: &ldquo;We all know similar cases.&rdquo;  I know that every member of the House knows similar cases, and would like to say so if he were free to do it.  In very many cases, conditions in Dublin at the moment are appalling, and I appeal to the Minister to do everything that is humanly possible to relieve the hardships of those people.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister does not relish being reminded in these days of some of the wild utterances he made in the good old halcyon days of Fianna Fáil electioneering. Some years ago, round about 1932, round about a period when there was world depression, the Minister and his supporters annihilated, physically and rhetorically, the members of the then Cumann na nGaedheal Government for <Col N="920" /> their failure to provide work or maintenance, when the Minister's Party manufactured the slogan: &ldquo;Work or Maintenance,&rdquo; and wrote &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo; under it, &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo; over it, &ldquo;Seán Lemass&rdquo; to the right of it, and &ldquo;Seán Lemass&rdquo; to the left of it. We now find that, after 11 years of Fianna Fáil Government, there are 90,000 people in receipt of benefits under the Unemployment Insurance Act and the Unemployment Assistance Act, benefits which do not even provide them with a standard of living which saves them from malnutrition in a vast number of cases.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was slightly perturbed a few weeks ago, when he was reminded that there was starvation in Dublin.  He denied that there was starvation in Dublin, but admitted that there were hunger and destitution. Some people would call that hairsplitting. In fact it would remind some people of the difference between Document No. 1 and Document No.2. Whatever about that aspect of the matter, there is no denying the fact that, since the famine years of the last century, there has not been as much poverty and as much destitution in this State as there is at the present moment.  According to the cost-of-living index figure, the cost of living has increased by over 50 per cent. during the past few years, but in respect of the poor, the very poor particularly, I think nobody could reasonably deny the fact that the cost of living has increased by very much more than 50 per cent.  Such articles of diet as lard, bacon, offals, margarine and many other such commodities that were readily procurable a few years ago are no longer available to the poor people.  Some of the commodities which I have mentioned are available at prohibitive prices.  In many cases people in receipt of State benefits in Dublin City at the moment are compelled to live on dry brown bread, coloured hot water described as tea and fats of one kind or another.</P>

      <P>The effect of the present low rates of benefits on our <Col N="921" /> economy may be described as disastrous. Men, women and children are under-nourished and their resistance to disease, particularly in the case of tuberculosis, is breaking down.  The present low income of the vast army of people forced to exist on unemployment benefits will have a permanent deleterious effect on the health of the rising generation.  It is a fact that the outstanding cause of tuberculosis is poverty.  The benefits, or the pittances described as benefits, on which the vast army of people to whom I have referred have to depend for their existence, have produced a state of under-nourishment amongst them that scarcely enables them to offer any resistance to any form of disease. There is now alarm in all quarters and in all places in relation to the high incidence of tuberculosis in this country.  As I have pointed out, the outstanding social cause of this disease is poverty, and that poverty is largely created by the absolute and dismal failure of the present Government to provide work or maintenance for the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin referred to the excessive cost of the administration of these schemes.  He pointed out that in recent years the cost of administration had increased by no less than 50 per cent. and that this increase was at the expense of the recipients of the so-called benefits.  I would suggest to the Minister that if economies must be effected in any direction, that is the direction in which they can most safely be brought about.  It will be a real economy to secure some saving in that direction.  I hope when it comes to a division on this motion, that members of the Fianna Fáil Party will ignore the Party Whips, and think of the position and the rotten conditions under which people have to live, huge vast numbers of them, by reason of these totally inadequate State allowances. I know perfectly well that in the forefront of the minds of most of the Fianna Fáil Deputies is the coming election.  If they do the right thing and walk into the right Division Lobby&mdash; in this case the left Division Lobby&mdash; when this motion comes to be decided, I can assure them that, having regard to the debilitated state in which the <Col N="922" /> Fianna Fáil organisation now is, there is not the slightest likelihood or possibility that any form of disciplinary action will be taken against them by the heads or leaders of that Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was expecting the Minister to have no hesitation in coming to the House to say that he had agreed to increase unemployment allowances.  He has already admitted the principle by granting increases in wages to men who are in employment. Those in employment having received certain small increases as a result of the action of the Minister, I cannot understand why he would not save discussion in this House and admit that people who are unable to get employment are entitled to a substantial increase in their allowances owing to the increased cost of living.  It has been pointed out to the Minister that the money to finance such increases is already there because the Government has raided the Unemployment Fund&mdash; each Government so long as I can remember&mdash;for other purposes.  Year after year they reduced the deficits on their Budgets by raiding the Unemployment Fund.  We suggest, therefore, that there is no necessity to go to any outside sources to find the money, and that sufficient is available to permit of a substantial increase in benefit for unemployed persons as well as extending the benefits to people unemployed in rural areas.  A big mistake which the Government made was to suggest that because a man lived in a rural area, there was work available for him in that area.  I know that in certain areas in my own county, the inhabitants are principally small farmers, and these small farmers are unable to employ anybody.  They have to look for employment themselves on the roads and on turf schemes, yet in these areas labourers were treated as if they were living in large industrial areas where work was available and were refused unemployment assistance for a particular period.  What was the result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The home assistance authorities were faced with the problem the following week of giving assistance to the unemployed men, where they were satisfied <Col N="923" /> they were unable to procure work. The Minister asked, during Deputy Hannigan's speech, what they did with the vouchers.  They do not receive vouchers in the rural areas.  It is as expensive to live there as&mdash;more so&mdash; in most portions of the City of Dublin. There is competition amongst the shops in the city, but there is none whatever in the rural areas, and a man is dependent on one or two shops.  The shopkeeper has extra expense in bringing goods by road ten or 12 miles from the railway station.  There is no necessity to put forward other arguments than those put forward here tonight. It is regrettable that a native Government could have 95,000 persons unemployed at the present time.  Certainly, if the Labour Party had taken another attitude outside this House, all the Construction Corps, all the Army and all the L.D.F. would not be able to prevent the unemployed from securing food.  But they come here, in a constitutional way, and ask the Minister to recognise the fact that these men are entitled to something more than promises and pittances.</P>
    <P>We have had references to the Construction Corps, and the Minister, on the information he had received, points out that, if an individual puts up a good case, he is not deprived of his benefit.  Unfortunately, the Minister was not aware of the facts.  I had a case where an individual had no parents alive, but was residing with his grandparents, who were very old. He was unable to take up work in the Construction Corps, and when he came to a certain age he had nothing but what he received from home assistance. He was unable to get any work, as his name was not on the list at the Labour Exchange.  So, it is not quite as simple as the Minister is advised it is.  Most of the people are deprived of assistance on the grounds that they are not willing to join the Construction Corps.  From what I have heard of the work by the Construction Corps in Glencree, I would not advocate the expenditure of public money on men joining the Corps.  If the Minister makes inquiries, he will, probably, find that some men have a reasonable objection to joining, <Col N="924" /> especially when they become closely associated with others in the district. That is not the attitude that all Irishmen should adopt towards one another, but there may be some men who are conscientious objectors.  Why should a man or his parents or grandparents be penalised?  Why should he be left off the register and not in receipt of unemployment benefit and without any chance of getting work offered by public bodies?  Those are regrettable facts which the Minister should consider.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to make any propaganda at all, I can say that we have had an increase in various sicknesses&mdash; in tuberculosis, for instance.  It must be admitted that there is widespread malnutrition, and no member of the Party opposite can dispute that.  If the Minister were in opposition he would be one of the loudest in condemning any Government which compelled men to exist on the pittances they have to accept to-day.  If men had to live on the unemployment assistance allowance for a short time only, it might be easier, but when they are continually living on it&mdash;except for a few weeks relief work at Christmas&mdash;the food they receive is not sufficient to give them the nourishment necessary to prevent disease.</P>
    <P>We know from the returns in connection with school medical inspections that there is a regrettable state of affairs, which we must do something to remedy.  I expected that the Minister would be the first to rise here, when the motion was proposed, to say that he recognised that these men were entitled to some assistance and that the Government was prepared to fulfil at least some of their promises.  We know that some individuals now in the Government made such glowing promises that they succeeded in getting into power.  Yet there are 95,000 unemployed unable to find work and 250,000 working in another country.  We are unable to export wheat and cattle now to a foreign country, but we are exporting human beings.  The emigration from the towns in my constituency is continuing, with skilled, hard-working men leaving to work in a foreign country, because there is no other <Col N="925" /> method by which they can maintain themselves and their families.  If the Minister would put his officials at work to try to find employment for these men, even for half the wages they receive in England, they would be willing to work at home instead.</P>
    <P>There are many useful schemes submitted by public bodies, which are held up under the excuse that the officials of various Departments have been transferred to the Department of Supplies or the Department of Defence for the period of the emergency. Rates have been raised by public bodies for some of these works, yet they have not been given a grant to enable them to give useful employment and to keep these men in the country.  Besides, we may require the co-operation of every man in town, city and country to save the harvest.  I suggest to the Minister&mdash;without individuals taking up a certain line&mdash; that he has no arguments to put up as to why the unemployed should not receive an increase in their allowance. It has been proved that the money is there and that the credit is there. While there are schemes ready for work on bog roads and on agricultural land the Minister should give some grant to enable the men to get some little extra money.  There is no use in painting a bad picture about the conditions, but I have seen the men and I know what they eat.  The Minister should go down in disguise to the bogs or roads where these men are employed and see the small wage they receive.  With the scarcity of various things, they are unable to procure the food that Deputies and others can procure in the shops.  The Minister would then have a different impression of what is going on in the country.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that it is according to your bank account or your orders that you get extras in the shops, over and above what your vouchers would procure.  There is a scarcity of butter at present.  I could show the Minister letters from very important and influential people in my constituency, who have sympathy for the poor workmen, and they point out that those who have the good bank account and can give extra orders, can <Col N="926" /> get substantial supplies of butter, where it is not rationed, but the unemployed man or the man on home assistance is unable to get a ¼ lb.  What we want in County Wicklow is to have the butter rationed as it is in Bray and in the city, so that everybody will get what they are entitled to, whether a ½ lb. or a ¼ lb., irrespective of their bank accounts. The Minister may say that we should be able to get sufficient in Wicklow. Wicklow is not in the same position as other places, because all the milk goes to Dublin and the farmers have to buy creamery butter themselves.  Without any further debate in this House, the Minister should take these matters into consideration and should admit the justice of the claim made by the movers of this motion.</P>

      <P>There is not much to which to reply. Deputy Everett was surprised that I did not stop the debate by announcing my acceptance of the motion moved by Deputy Davin and seconded by him. The motion asks the Dáil to declare that, in view of the increased cost of living, the Government should at once introduce proposals to increase substantially the existing rates of benefit.</P>
      <P>My objection to the motion is the implication which it contains that it has not been done.  It has been done. On more than one occasion, in consequence of the increase in the cost of living since the outbreak of the war, the rates of benefit payable under the Unemployment Assistance Acts have been increased.  Deputies should not ignore that.  Not a single Deputy has even referred to the fact.  I think the Labour Party tactics are fundamentally wrong.  This grotesque exaggeration in which they engage, this deliberately shutting their eyes to obvious facts, is getting them into the position where nobody credits anything they say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look after my reputation and leave the Deputy's reputation to himself.  Deputy Hannigan comes in and says there is <Col N="927" /> more starvation in Dublin at the moment than at any time since the Famine.  It is not true.  Nobody thinks it is true.  Not a member of the Labour Party, not even Deputy Hannigan, thinks it is true.  I suggest to them that they should keep their apprentice on the rails and learn, themselves, the wisdom of trying to stick as closely as possible to the facts.  As a Party in opposition, anxious to get increased power, a little judicious exaggeration or failure to deal with all the facts may be forgiven, but they have got altogether too far away from reality.  There should be, at least, a substratum of truth in what they say.  If they do not want to take my advice, they need not, but they have seven members in this House now&mdash;seven and a half counting Deputy Hannigan&mdash;and that is all they will ever have unless they try to deal with realities.</P>
      <P>The people of this country are concerned with realities.  They know what the realities are.  They are not interested in the flights of fancy of the members of the Labour Party.  They are interested, and we are interested, in any practical, constructive suggestion they have to make.  We have got none to-day.  We rarely get any from them.  Of course, it is an easy thing to say: &ldquo;Give out more money; increase the amount of unemployment assistance; give unemployment assistance to those who are not getting it now.  Give, give, give.  Do not bother about where you are to get it. That is only a detail.  Keep on giving.&rdquo;  Anybody could make that suggestion.  One does not even have to be elected a member of the Dáil to make that suggestion. People who have not been elected to the Dáil have made that suggestion in anonymous letters to the <i>Evening Mail</i> and other publications.  It does not get them anywhere.  We have to deal with this problem in a constructive, practical way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of money has been expended on unemployment assistance. The amount which is provided for that service has been increased substantially since the beginning of the war.  It is <Col N="928" /> quite true that the rates of unemployment assistance now in force do not provide against the possibility of hardship in the family of an unemployed man.  We never contemplated that they would.  We contemplated that the State should come in and, from the resources of the whole community, make available assistance to the man who was temporarily unemployed. That is why we called it unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation upon men, while they are in employment, to save against the rainy day of unemployment, or to adopt the usual precautions against the various mischances to which all human beings are liable. There is an obligation on them to avoid improvidence and to conduct their personal affairs rationally and intelligently. We accept the obligation to provide from the resources of the community help for those people during their days of misfortune within reasonable limits.  The limits are fixed by the resources of the community, by the willingness of the people to contribute through taxation for that purpose.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why should we deprive this man of his 10/6, and that man of his £?&rdquo; ask Deputies.  These 10/6's, these £1's, these hundreds of thousands of pounds which are, in fact, being provided for this service, are not dug out of a hole in the ground under this building. They are taken from Pat Smith, John Murphy and Willie O'Brien, the workers in Dublin and the ordinary people around the country who are finding it just as hard as others to make ends meet.  When we give 10/6 to an unemployed, single man in Dublin, or 30/- to 35/- to a married man, or provide increased assistance in some other form for those who need it, it means we are taking something from Pat Smith, John Murphy and Willie O'Brien, people who are fortunate enough to be at work, in the form of increased tax on their beer, tobacco or sugar.</P>
    <P>The money which the Government expends on these social services comes from the people.  The Government is, of course, quite willing to expend more upon social services.  It may be <Col N="929" /> a popular thing, approaching an election, to announce increased expenditure upon social services, higher benefits to those who come under the services, but at some stage the Government has to go to the people and say: &ldquo;Here is the bill.  We have been paying out this money on your behalf.  We have been promising these payments at your expense.  You have got to cash up now and that is going to mean another increase in taxation upon you, a higher price for taxable goods, tea, sugar, tobacco or beer.&rdquo;  At that stage the people will object and the members of the Labour Party will object.  In fact, if the Government does have to come to this House with proposals for increased taxes of these kinds nobody here will protest more strongly than the members of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>I have stated here that this motion is unnecessary.  It calls upon the Government to increase the rates of benefit provided under the Unemployment Assistance Act in consequence of an increase in the cost of living.  Let us get the facts.  Deputies in the Labour Party do not like facts but my job is to give them.  We base our policy upon facts.  The Unemployment Assistance Act was introduced in 1934.  May I remind the House that it was introduced by this Government, that, before 1934, there was no such thing as unemployment assistance in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to that time if a person became unemployed and exhausted his right to insurance benefit, there was no provision for him at all.  In fact, up to a certain time, even the home assistance authority could not give him help if he was an able-bodied man.  That is a matter of only a few years ago.  This development of our social services, which began with the advent of Fianna Fáil to office, has already worked substantial changes in the social life of this country.  Deputies are inclined to forget that.  Of course, they naturally do not want to credit Fianna Fáil with <Col N="931" /> anything.  But it is our job to see that the full facts are put, including those things which are creditable to ourselves.</P>
    <P>This Act was introduced in 1934, which was the first time in this country that unemployment assistance was made available on a nation-wide basis. It is true we had to lay down certain rules and tests in order to determine those who were to receive the benefit.  You cannot have, in relation to a nation-wide scheme of this kind, a judicial examination of the circumstances of each individual.  It is necessary to lay down certain broad rules and to say: &ldquo;Those who qualify under these rules get the benefit and those who fail to qualify are out.&rdquo;  We did endeavour to get the element of individual judgment introduced by bringing into operation the system of courts of referees, and any person who is refused unemployment assistance by the unemployment assistance officer has the right to go before the court of referees, a local court, consisting of a chairman appointed by the Government, a person chosen from a panel nominated by local employers and a person chosen from a panel nominated by the local trade unions.</P>
    <P>That tribunal examines his case and decides whether, having regard to all the facts, he is or is not under the law entitled to unemployment assistance. Most people who are refused unemployment assistance exercise that right of appeal, and a very large number of them have their unemployment assistance restored to them as a result of decisions in their favour by the local court of referees.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1934 established that new service and provided for the first time a statutory right to assistance in a large number of households where previously there had been real need of it.  The scales of benefit which were laid down in the Act were not represented as adequate to maintain a man and his family in the same circumstances as he would have been able to maintain himself if he had succeeded in getting employment.  The unemployment assistance provided was not <Col N="932" /> intended to be a substitute for wages. It was intended, as I have said, to be assistance from the communal resources to the individual family during the period of the unemployment of the breadwinner.  We did not think that we were providing means to enable individuals to maintain themselves and their families over long periods of unemployment.  The total amount which could be provided for that service was determined and voted, and, within the limits of that amount, we endeavoured to do the best possible, having regard to the relative claims of various individuals.</P>
    <P>The rates of assistance which were provided in the 1934 Act were increased by an Act passed in 1938, shortly before the outbreak of the war. They were increased, except in the case of single men without dependents, by 15 per cent. in urban areas and 10 per cent. in rural areas.  In August, 1941, the continuity rule was amended in favour of the unemployment assistance applicant.  I do not wish to go now into a technical explanation of what that meant, but it did involve a concession of importance in the circumstances then existing&mdash; circumstances in which a number of people were becoming not unemployed but under-employed, through the growing scarcity of materials and fuels and the inability of their employers to give them a full week's work in every week.  It did involve increased expenditure on the service.</P>
    <P>In September, 1941, the food voucher scheme was introduced.  That food voucher scheme was an attempt to do what this motion contemplates, that is, to devise a method by which the value of the assistance which the unemployed person received would very with changes in the prices of the most essential foodstuffs.  By giving him a right to a stated quantity of bread, butter and milk, irrespective of the prevailing prices of these commodities, we did in fact ensure that the value of the assistance he was receiving would continue to increase as the price of these commodities increased.  In September, 1942, the amount of food provided on food vouchers was increased again.  In that month, there was an <Col N="933" /> increase in the fixed price of bread. To offset that increase, the amount of bread provided on food vouchers was raised by 50 per cent. and the effect was to do much more than to offset for the persons receiving food vouchers the effect of the increase in the price of bread.</P>
    <P>In November, 1942, the weekly rates of unemployment assistance payable to persons with dependents outside the incorporated towns, that is, in the smaller towns and rural areas in which the food voucher scheme had not applied, were increased.  In fact the rates payable in respect of dependents of unemployed persons in those areas were increased in that month by 150 per cent.  There has been an increase in the cost of living, an increase which, taking one date with another, could perhaps be expressed as Deputy Davin expressed it, in terms of 58 per cent.  One could take different dates or yearly averages and get a lower percentage, but I am not going to quarrel with Deputy Davin's 58 per cent.  He said, of course, that the real increase in the cost of living was higher than the cost-of-living index revealed.  The reverse is the case, and I am going to demonstrate that that is so.</P>
    <P>The cost of living index is not really what its name implies&mdash;an index of changes in the cost of living.  It is an index of changes in the prices of certain fixed quantities of a limited number of foodstuffs.  In the year 1922, an investigation was carried out into the quantity of foodstuffs and other necessary materials which would be purchased by what was then described as a well-off artisan's family.  These quantities of foodstuffs at the prices then prevailing, weighted in accordance with their relative importance in the average household dietary, determined what was the basis of the cost of living index figure for that year.  As the prices of the quantities of foodstuffs taken into account in the calculation varied, the cost of living index figure was varied, and we are still working on that basis and still publishing a cost of living index figure which assumes that the average household is getting a cwt. of coal per <Col N="934" /> week, two and seven-eighths ounces of tea per week, so many lbs. of bacon and so many lbs. of butter per week, and which takes no account of the fact that a number of the foodstuffs in the schedule are not available, that others are severely rationed, and that people could not in fact buy the quantities of foodstuffs which are the basis of the calculation.</P>
    <P>That alteration of the circumstances has in fact upset almost entirely the validity of that index.  If we were to attempt to prepare another index now, to decide a figure which would represent the actual increase in the expenditure of a typical family, on the expenditure of which the figure is based, even making allowances for the fact that if they cannot get coal, they have to buy turf, and if they cannot get enough butter, they have to buy jam, and if they cannot get enough tea, they have to buy cocoa, coffee and substitute materials, it would reveal a change substantially less than 58 per cent.  The basic items have shown no change at all.  There has in fact been no change recorded in rents which absorb a high percentage of the average workingman's income.  The percentage increases in the main items are, of course, much less than the all-over average.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin spoke about the cost of rabbits having increased by 350 per cent.  That is quite likely.  The Government has been trying to encourage an increase in the price of rabbits in order to get people to trap them.  A very large number of these unemployment assistance recipients throughout the country are not as unemployed as they would like to appear.  They are busily engaged in trapping rabbits and making a good thing out of it.</P>
    <P>The more rabbits they trap the better we like it, because rabbits are a pest.  They do infinite harm to the harvest each year; they destroy possibly £1,000,000 worth of foodstuffs.  If we could wipe them all out, no matter what price we had to pay for rabbits retail, it would be a great national benefit.  But, although there has been an increase of 350 per cent. in the price of rabbits, Deputies or the public must not assume what Deputy Davin wants <Col N="935" /> them to assume, that that represents a typical increase in the price of foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>Take the price of bread.  Bread has gone up from 1/- per 4 lb. loaf to 1/1 since the outbreak of the war.  It was not until last year that the price of bread was increased.  In fact it might not have been increased at all but for the agitation carried on in the previous year by certain agitators throughout the country who were urging farmers to demand more and more for their wheat.  In the previous year the farmers got a substantial increase in the price of wheat, an increase which was not reflected in the price of bread by reason of the Government subsidy. The fact that the Government concealed the effect of raising the price of wheat led people to urge that the price of wheat should be increased still further.</P>
    <P>It was because it was necessary in the public interest that the public should understand what the rising cost of primary commodities was likely to involve in retail prices in the shops that it was decided to allow an increase of 8½ per cent. in the price of bread. There is far more bread than rabbits eaten in the average household.  While 8½ per cent. is no more typical of the average increase than the 350 per cent. mentioned by Deputy Davin, it is a far more important factor to the average unemployed worker that bread has only increased by 8½ per cent. than that rabbits have increased by 350 per cent.</P>
    <P>It may be that our pre-war standards of unemployment assistance benefit were not as high as we would have liked them to be, but, in so far as they were reasonable in the pre-war period, they are still reasonable.  If there has been a 58 per cent. increase in the cost of living, the fact is that the average family in Dublin, or in any of the towns where the food voucher scheme is in operation, which is depending upon unemployment assistance, has received increased unemployment assistance to a higher percentage than the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Take a man with a wife and five <Col N="936" /> children.  Deputy Byrne mentioned cases of larger families and, to an extent, it is true to say that the percentage increase in the amount of unemployment assistance rose in relation to the size of the family.  I am taking a family consisting of a man, with a wife and five children.  At the present price of foods made available under the food voucher scheme, the increase in the unemployment assistance given such a family since the beginning of the war is 61 per cent. in Dublin.  In Drogheda and Dundalk it is 85 per cent.  It goes up by various percentages.  In Balbriggan it is 100 per cent.  The highest I have on my list is Ardee with 108 per cent.  The reason why the percentage is higher in Balbriggan and Ardee than in Dublin is apparently because the rise in the cost of the commodities provided under the food voucher scheme has been greater in these towns than it has been in Dublin.  But there is the fact that if 58 per cent. represents the increase in the cost of living&mdash;and I suggest that, having regard to the basis upon which the cost of living index is compiled, the actual increase in the expenditure of the average family is not so great as that&mdash;then we have increased the unemployment assistance available to the average unemployed family by more than 58 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the case of the rural areas it was not practicable to provide increased unemployment assistance by means of the food voucher scheme.  The food voucher scheme could only operate effectively in comparatively large centres of population where there is a number of retail shops readily available. There is no point in giving a food voucher to an unemployed man in a rural area entitling him to milk, butter and bread, unless he has immediately available to him a retail establishment where that voucher can be translated into supplies of the foods mentioned on it.  For that reason we dealt with the problem in the rural areas by an increase in the cash benefits allowed in respect of dependents. We increased these cash benefits by 150 per cent.  That does not mean, of course, that the total amount of unemployment assistance going into the <Col N="937" /> average household was increased by 150 per cent., but it does mean that all over the rural areas an increase in unemployment assistance corresponding to the increase we had given in urban areas was effected by the Government Order of November last.</P>
    <P>Let us take that typical family I mentioned&mdash;a man with a wife and five dependent children.  At the present time such a man, assuming he has no means and is entitled to the maximum rate of unemployment assistance, in the County Boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Dun Laoghaire, receives £1 16s. 6d. per week in unemployment assistance.  If his family is larger than the maximum provided for under the Unemployment Assistance Acts, or if there are special circumstances in his case which make greater assistance necessary, then the amount provided under the Unemployment Assistance Acts can be supplemented, and is frequently supplemented, by the home assistance authorities.  In the county boroughs that typical family I mentioned receives £1 16s. 6d.  In other urban areas, that is, towns which are not county boroughs but have populations exceeding 7,000, the amount provided is £1 11s.  In other incorporated towns under 7,000 population the amount is £1 7s. 6d.  In the rural areas and in unincorporated towns it is 23/-.</P>
    <P>I think that, having regard to the total resources of this State, the fact that we are passing through a period of particular difficulty, that our national income is declining, that our total industrial activity is being seriously curtailed by a dearth of supply of materials and fuels, with the tremendous increase in expenditure necessary upon emergency and defence services, in making this provision for persons who are temporarily unemployed we are not doing badly.  It is only eight years ago since the Government introduced a novelty in the legislation of this country by enacting a minimum wage for agricultural workers.  Never previously in the whole history of this country had there been any attempt to prescribe a minimum wage for agricultural workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>56 hours per week.  A rural agricultural worker with a wife and five dependents, who is unemployed, can at the moment get 23/- per week.  If the rural worker is prepared to enrol on the special register, which, I admit, involves the acceptance of an obligation to take work anywhere it may become available in agriculture or turf production, he can get, in addition to that 23/-, another 5/-.  He can get exemption from Employment Period Orders and, during the periods in which he is not required in agricultural or turf production, he can get a preference for work on other Government schemes. That brings the remuneration which he is entitled to get when unemployed up to 28/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, of course, quite easy to urge that we should increase those rates still further.  Nobody would like more than the members of the Fianna Fáil Party to be able to guarantee to every family under all circumstances freedom from want, freedom even from hardship.  But we have to deal with facts.  We have got to deal with human beings in this case.  There must be an inducement to human beings to seek work and, obviously, therefore, there must be maintained a substantial difference between the amount a man receives when he is employed and the amount of assistance that is given to him by the State during the period of his inability to get work. These are the conditions that must determine the level of our unemployment <Col N="939" /> assistance rates.  We can, of course, easily manipulate the finances of the country so as to give out more money.  There is no difficulty about that.  We can give out £3, £10, £20, or even £30 a week, instead of £1.  We can give out £30 a week instead of the £1 we are giving now, by the simple process of inflating the currency, but it must be remembered that the £30 will not buy any more goods or commodities than the £1 will buy.  In that connection, there has been a lot of nonsense talked by the Labour Party, to the effect that by such a simple process as that, they can dispense with poverty.  That would only go down with an unthinking set of workers, but the fallacy of that has been found out, during our own lifetime, in almost every country in the world.</P>
    <P>After the last war, in many countries revolutionary governments came into power which were anxious to maintain their popularity with the working people, by giving the working people increased wages, and when the prices of commodities continued to go up as a result of that, the Governments of these countries endeavoured to meet that situation by keeping the printing presses going producing more and more paper money, until the whole financial apparatus of these countries collapsed.  Now, who suffered the most under these conditions? Was it the men of property, or the workers&mdash;the men of no property? It was the workers who suffered.  The shopkeeper who had goods on the shelves of his shop could make paper profits overnight if he did not sell them, and all he got for the goods he sold was bits of paper which might be worth nothing the next day.  When the worker got his week's wages, in the form of bank notes, he proceeded to spend them as quickly as possible, because, the next week, or possibly the next day, the bank notes would be only so much waste paper.  That is what the raising of wages, without some off-setting control, produced in many European countries in our own lifetime.</P>
    <P>Now, we have been trying to protect <Col N="940" /> the workers of this country against similar consequences here, and every Government in the world has been trying to do so by similar means.  It is easy enough to say that we can create more money by the operating of the printing presses, but the Government of a country must look further ahead than to its prospects at the next general election.  It must look to the dangers created by the war, and to the possibility of a complete collapse and the resulting destitution of the working people of the country&mdash;the men of no property&mdash;the men who never have known and never will know the security of property, and who have to depend on the wages they get to provide themselves and their families with sustenance, and I say that the Labour Party have failed in their duty during this emergency by not trying to work out a long-term policy for the workers and endeavouring to see for themselves what were the dangers that might ensue for the working classes of the country from the war situation. They should have urged upon the workers, as well as upon the Government of the country, the necessity for maintaining the checks upon inflation which the Government of this country has endeavoured to maintain, and which the Governments of practically every country in the world have endeavoured to maintain as a result of their experience of what followed from the application elsewhere of the principles which the Labour Party of this country are now expounding for the workers of this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin said here that the Taoiseach had expressed a doubt as to whether there were any persons in this country living below the level of a decent subsistence.  The Taoiseach never said any such thing.  He did say that there is no starvation in this country, and I also say that there is no starvation in this country.  I am not going to say, of course, that there may not be a leak, here and there, in any system of social services, by which one family might be affected.  We have many schemes of social services here, such as national health insurance, old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, <Col N="941" /> and so on.  I am not saying that all these schemes are all that we would wish them to be, but we have done the best we could within the limit of our resources, and we have laid on the shoulders of the various local authorities the duty of examining the circumstances of each particular case.  By these various bulwarks we have endeavoured to protect everybody against the possibility of starvation, but we cannot ensure that the whole machinery of administration will work so efficiently that in every household, assistance, to the extent required, will be provided.  However, we have done as much as human ingenuity can devise to see that the total resources available to us will be used to ensure that it will be provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean that they are limited.  There is only a certain pool of resources available in order to maintain the various national services that are required, and for the capital required for future developments.  That pool may be expanded.  It is fixed now for to-day.  It need not necessarily remain static for the future, but our ability to maintain a decent standard of living for our people, or to raise the level of social security for our people, depends almost entirely on ensuring an expansion of the resources available to us.  Deputy Davin says that there can be no expansion in our social security services until there has been an increase in our total capacity of production. That is not so.  To an extent <Col N="942" /> that a social service is a method of redistributing incomes it may be said that the only limit to its expansion is the willingness of the people to pay, through taxation, until we get a flat level of income for everybody. To the extent that it is true to say that a social service represents only a device for the compulsory insurance of workers, to cover the risk of their unemployment during certain periods, an expansion is only conditional on the willingness of the workers to pay, or to agree to deductions from current earnings to pay for future benefits.  We have got insurance benefits, but Deputy Davin wants the benefits, under that scheme, increased.</P>
