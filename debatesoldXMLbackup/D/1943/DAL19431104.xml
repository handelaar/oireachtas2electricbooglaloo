      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the general uncertainty in the public mind as to what articles may be brought into Northern Ireland, what are prohibited and, in particular, what are allowed in small quantities for personal use, he will see that articles taken by officers of the Customs and Excise from persons who have duly declared them will not be confiscated, but will be either kept for return to the owner on his return journey or allowed to be sent to his address in Éire.</P>

      <P>The answer is in the negative.  The suggestion that there should be any uncertainty on the part of passengers regarding goods prohibited to be exported cannot be accepted.  Full information regarding goods which may not be exported can be obtained from the Revenue Commissioners' office, or from any local officer of Customs and Excise.  Owing to lack of accommodation, it is not feasible to retain goods at frontier stations and posts until the return of the passenger.  Apart from considerations regarding shortage of staff and lack of accommodation the proposal to permit the return of the goods to the offender's private address would amount to an invitation to passengers to bring prohibited goods to the place of exportation in the hope that they might find an opportunity to export them irregularly without risking the loss of the goods.</P>

It is, however, not possible at the moment to grant any general increase in the allocations of kerosene for lighting purposes, having regard to the exceptionally heavy and growing demand for the oil from farmers engaged in tillage and in harvesting and threshing operations.  Limited allowances of kerosene to supplement the domestic ration have already been <Col N="1563" /> made available to registered dairy farmers who produce milk for human consumption in liquid form, and who have at least six cows milking during the winter months, but I regret that this represents the maximum provision which can be made for dairy farmers in present circumstances.</P>

      <P>Licences for the retail sale of paraffin oil under the Emergency Powers (Kerosene Rationing) (No. 2) Order, 1941, were granted by my Department in 1941 to traders who applied for such licences on or before the 25th August, 1941.  No additional kerosene retailers' licences were issued after that date.</P>
      <P>Mr. William Walsh of Multyfarnham first applied for a kerosene retailer's licence on the 2nd September, 1942, in respect of premises for which a kerosene retailer's licence was not in force.  As no licences for the retail sale of kerosene have been issued since the 25th August, 1941, his application was refused by my Department in conformity with standing practice.  I am not prepared to make an exception in favour of any individual trader.</P>
      <P>I am aware that three traders in Multyfarnham already hold kerosene retailers' licences obtained by them in August, 1941.  In the issuing of these licences no inquiry was made as to whether or not the applicants were also publicans.  The question of discrimination, therefore, does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have fully considered the effect on the dairying districts of the 37½ per cent. tillage requirement in 1944 and I am not satisfied that compliance with it will have the result suggested in the Deputy's question.  The production of cereals and roots on the land tilled by dairy farmers should provide them with feeding stuffs sufficient to <Col N="1567" /> compensate, particularly in the winter period, for any corresponding reduction in pasturage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>While the production of roots and grain might provide food for cattle over the winter period, the Minister must be aware that the greater proportion of dairying in this country is carried on on summer pasturage, and the reduction of pasturage, owing to the 37½ per cent. tillage, must affect the number of cows devoted to the production of milk.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>A way out of the difficulty might be found by a relaxation in this direction, that those dairy farmers who till in wheat a greater percentage than the stipulated ten per cent. of wheat required by the Minister would get a pro rata reduction in the 37½ per cent. tillage.  That would provide the additional quantity of wheat that we all desire, and would also make provision for the continued existence of herds of dairy cows for the maintenance of which this House has already voted considerable sums.  It would also make provision for the maintenance of supplies of butter which are already in a precarious position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are six paid probation officers in the Dublin metropolitan <Col N="1571" /> district and none in any other district.  The officers in Dublin have the assistance of a large number of organised voluntary workers.  The question of increasing the number of paid officers in Dublin is constantly kept under observation; the number has been increased gradually from one (in 1923) to six, and further increases will be made if necessary.  Outside Dublin I doubt whether the appointment of full-time, paid probation officers is the best solution.  The question was considered very fully in the case of Cork City, and in the result it was decided to avail of the provisions of Section 7 of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914.  Under this section, any group of persons interested in the supervision of young persons whilst on probation may form a society and may apply to be recognised officially and, upon being so recognised, they may nominate persons to act as probation officers and may receive financial assistance from the State towards their expenses.  I would like to see the same experiment tried in other large towns.</P>

      <P>Before going on with the debate, there is a matter that cropped up here last night on the adjournment, to which I wish to refer. The Chief Whip of our Party stated that we were not consulted as regards the adjournment last night by Deputy <Col N="1575" /> Kissane, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  Deputy Kissane consulted some members of our Party and our Chief Whip did not happen to be present at the time.  Therefore, the Chief Whip was right in the statement he made and so was Deputy Kissane.  We did not really understand what the Parliamentary Secretary requested; we understood that his request was that the House would adjourn on Thursday night and continue the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government and Public Health on the following Wednesday.  We did not understand that the request was that the debate was to finish on Wednesday night.  I hope that the explanation will be accepted by the Chair and the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>Continuing the debate from last night I hope it is not necessary for me to remind the Minister of the two main points I made in connection with Galway.  One is that the number of deaths in our county is only 17 per 100,000 lower than it was in the year 1875 and also that it is the highest return for the last ten years.  One may ask the reason for that.  If the Minister were down there and considered the position for himself, he would know the reason.  I know of a patient in my constituency who was affected with tuberculosis and who had to be taken away from her eight children.  No room was found for her in that makeshift of a sanatorium called Woodlands as no bed was vacant there, and she had to be sent into the Central Hospital, Galway, where she remained for nine months, until her death.  She was changed from ward to ward and sometimes was in a ward where there were 24 other patients.  That is the reason for the disease being so widespread in Galway at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I came into this House, no matter what issue was being discussed, you had the politician on the one side or the other giving his view; but in this case, we are all combined in one great effort, standing behind the Minister and asking him to do this work to save the nation.  There is no objection from any side of the House. <Col N="1576" /> I was delighted to hear even Deputy Dillon, a man of such wide views, coming forward and pushing you on; you have even the Labour Party, whom you called Communists in my area, pushing you on; and even myself, the Hitler and the gunman you spoke about, am pushing you on; and also you have the lambs of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael pushing you on.  Therefore, I appeal to you to save the nation from this dreaded disease.  It is in your hands to do it.</P>
    <P>I go back to the case of this woman who for eight months lay affected with this disease in our central hospital in Galway.  She is in heaven to-day, I hope, but I have no hesitation in saying it is this House and the Department that are responsible for that person's death, responsible for taking that woman away from her eight children. That is a terrible responsibility, which is the result of our not tackling the job as we should.  I do not blame the present or the past Government for the condition of the central hospital in Galway; both are responsible. In the time of the past Government, an estimate was made out for a new hospital.  It amounted to £330,000 at that time.  I think the engineer's fees alone amounted to £10,000 and were paid, and still we are without the hospital.  The people are lying on the floors; if the Minister doubts that, I would ask him to send down one of his representatives to see for himself. Surely, you cannot expect that a wide county like Galway can exist under conditions of that description.</P>
    <P>As regards the sanatorium at Woodlands, the county manager was asked to take over Masonbrook House for the time being.  The answer was that it was not good enough.  Certainly, it would have been better than nothing. I was delighted to hear Deputy Dillon's plea for the nurses, a plea which also came from the Labour Benches.  I was delighted to hear him say we turn out the finest nurses in the world and I would like to remind him that the vast majority come from the west.</P>
    <P>The condition of the roads, so far as the agricultural community is concerned, <Col N="1577" /> in my county&mdash;and perhaps in the province also&mdash;is unbearable.  We cannot travel on them, we cannot take a horse along them.  Some time ago, an order was made by the Galway County Council, of which I happen to be a member, asking the county surveyor and county manager to see that these roads are sanded along the margin at least six foot on each side, to allow us to travel.  That order was made, but it was not carried out.  A man with a horse and cart can gravel the side of a road two and a half miles in one day, so surely that could have been carried out, to give the people an opportunity to travel on those roads. We are told by the county surveyor that by leaving an untarred margin the road does not last, that the road ravels and is not of much use.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider this, that in the future when the roads are being tarred rough screenings should be thrown over a margin of four feet to six feet.  They would get a grip on the tar, and leave road users in a position to bring their horses safely along the roads.  Some time ago I wrote to the Department in connection with this matter, and in reply I got a long statement telling me all about the shoeing of horses, and how rubber could be attached to the horseshoes. There is no purpose served by mentioning that.  It would be just like mentioning artificial manures to the Minister for Agriculture.  There is not as much rubber in the country as would fix a bicycle puncture.</P>
    <P>Not so very long ago, in the Belclare-Corofin area, the people had considerable difficulty in getting out to the public road leading from Galway to Tuam.  They took it on themselves to lay down screenings on a margin three feet wide, so that they could put their horses on it.  Having completed the job, they were threatened by the county manager and informed that they would be prosecuted.  Our council decided that the matter would not be allowed to proceed any further.  I have here a letter from the county solicitor in Galway demanding £40 each from the people who put down the screenings so as to make the roads <Col N="1578" /> suitable in order to permit them to take home the turf.  The time was when we had to do something for the motor cars.  We were told about the Road Fund, and what motorists contributed. Motor cars are now a thing of the past.  In my county we see aeroplanes more often than we see motor cars.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a brief reference to rates.  It appears there is an Order that the first moiety of the rates must be paid on or before 1st October.  In the area where I live, if the first moiety is not paid by 1st October the rate collector refuses to accept it and insists on getting the first and second moieties together.  In the West of Ireland the few fairs we have are held between the 10th and 20th October.  In many cases people have to depend on those fairs to get in what will pay their rates.  I suggest that the Minister should change that Order to 1st November.  By doing so, he will be helping the ratepayers and he will be also helping in the collection of the rates.</P>
    <P>As regards tuberculosis, I suggest that two or three counties should be grouped together and one large sanatorium erected to accommodate their patients.  For the Counties of Galway and Roscommon we have a mental hospital which meets adequately the needs of both counties.  I think it would be advisable to group two or three counties together and in that way you will be doing something effective to curb that horrible disease.  The Minister occupies a unique position. All sides are behind him.  If we act now in a united manner we will do much to eradicate the dreadful disease of tuberculosis from this country.</P>

      <P>One of the most gratifying things in the Minister's statement was the indication that there was a decrease in the death-rate and an increase in the birth-rate.  We also got a review of the position so far as tuberculosis is concerned.  So much has been said on this subject that one hesitates to touch on it now.  I join with others in expressing the hope that the Minister will be encouraged in finding remedies to check this disease which is, unfortunately, spreading.  Everyone knows that the treatment of tuberculosis, especially in the City and County of Dublin, is inadequate.  One is frequently stopped in the streets by parents asking &ldquo;When are you going to get my child a bed in a sanatorium&rdquo;? The child in that case might be 25 or 30 years of age.  We read quite recently a statement by Dr. Harbinson relating to County Dublin in which he mentioned the inadequate accommodation.  There is really no accommodation to give patients early treatment.  In most cases people have to wait&mdash;these are not the words of Dr. Harbinson&mdash;until it is too late.</P>
      <P>The after-care of tuberculosis patients has not been touched on at all.  I have known cases where considerable sums were spent in improving the health of tubercular patients and sending them out cured but, unfortunately, they are often sent out to poverty-stricken surroundings where they are not given adequate food, clothing or shelter.  I suggest that attention should be given to the treatment of discharged tubercular patients. Some instructors from the Minister's Department, or almoners from the hospitals, might be requested to look after tubercular patients who have been discharged in order to see that they will be properly fed and clothed and that they will have proper shelter. Otherwise the amount of money spent on the maintenance of a tubercular patient in an institution will be simply wasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago I mentioned a case here of a girl who was discharged from an institution.  This girl was declared to be the miracle of Cappagh.  She was six years in bed and she came out perfectly <Col N="1580" /> cured.  She got 7/6 a week from the authorities to buy little necessaries. A brother of hers, living in a tenement quarter, got a job as a basket-boy in a shop and the 7/6 relief money was taken away.  Since I raised the matter, portion of the 7/6 has been refunded to the girl, who lives in very sad surroundings and is not adequately looked after from the point of view of clothing, shelter and food.  When these T.B. patients come out of institutions, if there is not a sufficiency of necessaries at home, it is the duty of some authority to see that they are properly provided for.  I mentioned here the case of a young man discharged from Crooksling sanatorium.  He wrote to me stating that he had been sent home without half-a-crown relief of any kind, to depend upon his stepfather's blind pension.  A young fellow of 21 is sent home to a tenement room to depend upon the few shillings which a blind pensioner gets.  He could not get 1/- relief from the authorities.  I wonder what is wrong with the authorities in charge of relief.  I ask the Minister to see that the whole system of relief is reviewed and that the miserable allowance given for the upkeep of those people be increased substantially.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the necessity for compulsory notification of tuberculosis.  In Dublin city there is no need for compulsory notification. The people are running to their representatives and informing them, openly and clearly, that a member of their family is infected with tuberculosis, and that they want a cottage, a flat, or accommodation in a sanatorium.  Until we are able to deal with those who voluntarily inform us as to the presence of the disease, and who are asking for treatment, there is no need to consider compulsory notification.  That splendid institution at Cappagh has done noble work for the children of this city and county.  Peamount has also done splendid work.  As regards Newcastle, if there is a choice, people ask public representatives to try to get them into Newcastle.  Whether that is due to the air or not, I do not know. What has gone wrong with Crooksling I cannot say.  The municipal council <Col N="1581" /> of Dublin are responsible for Crooksling. Most of us are satisfied that it is not a suitable place.  The air, or something there, has gone wrong, and the place is objectionable to Dublin patients.</P>
    <P>Scabies have been referred to by only one speaker.  There have been a number of references to rickets. Rickets, I understand, are due to lack of vitamins, caused by certain of our poorer people not getting sufficient vegetables and getting no fruit.  I am told by very eminent authorities that an improvement in children suffering from rickets could be effected by very simple means.  Unfortunately, there is a very big outbreak of rickets in this city.  The remedy which has been suggested to me is the opening of our dispensaries and the fitting of them with violet ray lamps.  These sunshine lamps are in some way helpful to children suffering from rickets.  The lamps are not very costly and rooms could be found in every parish, if not in every street, where children could receive this sunshine treatment, which would compensate to some extent for lack of vitamin C.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have referred to housing.  I am on the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation, which has done trojan work in this connection. Members of the committee have been vying with one another as to where they can get houses to rent and how they can provide proper accommodation for these T.B. cases.  Unfortunately, our activities have been somewhat curtailed.  If anybody wants to see the effect of that curtailment, I ask him to go to houses Nos. 34-35 Seán McDermott Street, 150 yards from the principal street of this city. If he goes to that address, he will be appalled by the conditions he will find. Every effort is being made to clear that place but not before it was due. At 9 and 10 Waterford Street, there are four-storey tenements without sewers, lavatory or water.  That is in the centre of the city.  The premises, 57 and 58 Corporation Street, just off Talbot Street, are collapsing.  The people there are imploring us to get them accommodation and we are doing <Col N="1582" /> the best we can.  If anybody has any doubt about conditions in the city, he should visit 34-35 Seán McDermott Street and several other houses in the same area.  He will obtain there some idea of our difficulties and of the necessity for speeding up our housing programme.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to home assistance.  The allowance these unfortunate people draw from the board of assistance is nothing compared with their requirements.  Unless their children are to be further troubled by scabies and rickets, something should be done to improve their position.  We have all heard that the national health benefits are insufficient.  Dental treatment has been stopped for a time.  In the case of widows' and orphans' pensions, the means test is too rigidly enforced. We debated a good deal the question of tuberculosis hospitals, but we did not emphasise sufficiently the scarcity of beds for Dublin patients in our city hospitals.  It is almost impossible to get a bed for a non-paying patient in this city.  I made inquiries and experts told me that the number of people who are coming to Dublin for major operations has not materially diminished.  Beds must be provided for them and they are welcome to Dublin, but it was suggested to me that it was because the new hospitals in the country were inadequately staffed it was necessary for patients to come to Dublin for major operations.  The new buildings are equipped in up-to-date fashion and, if they were somewhat better staffed, the present situation might be improved.  Fourteen months ago a deputation from a Dublin hospital went to the Hospitals' Commission to seek permission to provide 30 extra beds.  Two months after the deputation waited on the commission they were informed that the authorities could not allow the hospitals to go ahead and provide the extra beds.  One cannot talk about hospitals without talking about the conditions of work of the nurses.  Their position has been so well stated by previous speakers that I am hopeful of an early improvement in the pay, pension and working conditions of the nurses.  I hope the <Col N="1583" /> Minister will take the matter in hands and that he will secure a shortening of their hours of work.  Nurses have to work appallingly long hours, day and night. It is a regular thing with them.  I hope that the appeals that have been made by Deputies, on behalf of the members of the nursing profession, will not fall on deaf ears.  In fact, I do not think they will.</P>
    <P>About four years ago a commission was appointed to inquire into housing conditions, and housing generally, in this city.  When the Dublin Corporation was faced with any difficult problems in regard to housing they were told to wait for the report of this commission. They asked a couple of weeks ago for a copy of the report, and were told recently that it was not yet to hand.  Can Deputies imagine that a commission that was set up four years ago has not yet submitted its report to the Government? The position, therefore, is that the Government cannot give it to the authorities charged with housing conditions and with the fixing of rents, which, it has been stated, are too high in many cases.  Since we cannot get the report of the commission we do not know what its recommendations are going to be.  The Minister, in his statement said that the reconditioning of old tenement houses in Dublin was going ahead.  The trouble is that it is going ahead too slowly.  A very large number of people are appealing to the corporation for houses. The position is that we have no place to put people when we empty houses that are capable of being reconditioned.</P>
    <P>I think all the Dublin Deputies referred to the question of allotments for plotholders.  The Minister has very graciously given certain concessions to the unemployed who have plots which will be a great help to them in providing their families with food supplies.  A number of old-age pensioners applied for and obtained plots.  At first they were regarded as unemployed and were, therefore, able to get the plots at very small rents, and seeds at the special terms provided by the Minister. <Col N="1584" /> Suddenly, somebody in the Department discovered that under the regulations an old age pensioner was not an unemployed person.  The result is that he now has to pay about 20/- for his plot instead of the 1/-, 2/- or 3/- that he paid formerly.  In addition, he has to pay full price for the seeds he requires.  He is not being treated as an unemployed man.  I would ask the Minister kindly to extend to the old age pensioners the concessions which are being enjoyed by the unemployed who are plotholders.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the municipal council tried to get a little better treatment for our blind people.  The council decided to help by giving them a grant of 4/- to be added to their pensions. The Department of Local Government insisted that, instead of giving them the 4/- in cash, they should get it in the form of a voucher.  The corporation, on behalf of the blind, reluctantly accepted the voucher system.  At any rate, it was a step in the right direction. I understand there is a letter in the Minister's Department for the last few weeks asking that he should give his authority to the corporation to give out these vouchers.  The position up to this morning was that the vouchers were not available in South William Street for the 600 blind women who are being paid their pensions.  I do not know whose fault that was.  It may be our own.  At any rate, the food vouchers were not available, and I suppose the 600 blind men, who will turn up in the morning for their pensions, will meet with the same disappointment. I am not making any complaint, but I am appealing to the Minister to see that his consent goes out without delay.</P>
    <P>In the case of an unemployed man who wants to go to England to work, one of the things he requires is a birth certificate, and the charge for that is 3/6.  In nine cases out of ten he has to borrow the 3/6 from a friend or get it from his trade union, if he belongs to one.  In some cases these men do not belong to a trade union and are not in receipt of any kind of benefit.  I understand that when birth certificates are required to obtain national health benefits or insurance, they can be <Col N="1585" /> obtained for 6d.  I think a birth certificate should also be issued to those unemployed men for 6d.</P>
    <P>In this city we have a number of men between 65 and 70 years of age who are suffering great hardships.  A man of 65 years of age cannot get work.  He is not registered at the labour exchange and is in receipt of no benefit.  He is nobody's child when he is between 65 and 70 years of age, the latter being the age at which he will qualify for the old age pension. I appeal to the Minister to see that adequate allowances are made available through the board of assistance for such cases.  These men should not be left to suffer the hardships that they are suffering.  I will not say they are starving.  They can be seen any morning in the halls of convents where they get a dinner for 2d., and, in some cases, for a penny.  Even if they have no 2d. or a 1d. they still get their dinner.</P>
    <P>We are often reminded here that food, clothing and shelter are the essentials of life.  I am sure that every member of the municipal council, and many members of this House, must have had the experience of being stopped in the streets by decent types of men asking for some old clothes. Some of those people are going around in rags.  At present prices, they cannot get clothes, and they are really becoming patients for the hospitals.  There they will be properly treated and get clothing for the time being.  Something, I think, should be done to provide them with clothing before they are obliged to enter the hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is just one last matter I want to refer to.  I was told recently by a doctor that he could not get a free ambulance for a patient and as a result the patient died.  Had an ambulance turned out in time so that an operation could be performed he considered that the patient's life could have been saved.  I do not know if that is a matter for consideration by the Minister or by the corporation.  I am aware that there are other organisations with ambulances, but I suggest that a public ambulance should be at the disposal of the citizens of Dublin when urgent hospital cases arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1586" /> I believe the Schools Committee of the Dublin Corporation have asked the Minister's Department to sanction the provision of extra butter for the sandwiches that the children receive so that the meal will be more appetising. I am sure such application will have the sympathy of the Government.  In reference to the points that I have made, regarding the scarcity of clothing and scarcity of shoe leather for small children who can be seen ragged and bare-footed in the streets, and who are thereby subjected to pain and hunger, I think the time has arrived when the Minister should order a survey of the position, not only in the city but throughout the country.  If that survey is taken in hands and investigated by the right people, I am confident that the Minister would give sympathetic consideration to any proposal to improve the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F.H. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry to be placed in the position of having severely to criticise the working of the County Management Act.  The more I look into the County Management Act and see how it is working the more I wonder how it ever passed this House. In fact, I am positively certain that the day the County Management Act passed this House that day democracy went out of local government.  All Deputies have to do is to cast their minds back and to compare the county council system with the present system. I invite the Minister to contradict any statement I make when he is replying. Prior to the passing of the Act we had 1,600 or 1,700 public representatives in the form of corporations, urban councils and county councils.  They had the administration of a sum representing from £12,000,000 to £14,000,000.  I can recall from memory the work that county councils had to do.  There were meetings of the county council, of boards of health and mental hospital committees.  A board of health, with which I couple the board of public assistance, held on an average 26 meetings in the year, with two or three meetings to consider estimates.  The county councils sat about 26 times and had finance meetings, road meetings, forestry meetings.  The mental hospital committees held 12 different meetings, <Col N="1587" /> with possibly one or two to deal with estimates.  What is the position now? I admit that there is supposedly a county council.  I venture to say that the county council is there for no other purpose than as a cloak and to cover the fact that dictatorial powers have been given to 40 or 50 people to administer the whole local government of this country.  The council is supposed to strike a rate and then to hand the money over in the form of complete administration to the county manager to do as he likes.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the House I shall name a few of the things that a county manager has to do, and I ask Deputies to decide if it is humanly possible to get one man to do what he is supposed to do.  Take an average county council.  It is supposed to contribute £200,000 or £300,000 for public health&mdash;possibly £60,000 for mental hospitals, and another £60,000 or £70,000 for road administration.  The county manager has to find out what schemes are to be carried out under each heading.  He has to decide the tenancy of about 2,000 cottages in each county; he has also to look after the repairs to these cottages and to see that the rents are collected.  He has to look after possibly 600 or 700 patients in hospitals in each county, and in addition 600 or 700 patients in extern hospitals.  He has also to look after 800 or 840 mental hospital patients, as well as a staff of 150 in each hospital.  How that man could possibly pay attention to details of the administration for which responsibility is placed upon him knocks me into a cocked hat.  In fact, you would want an archangel to do it, and I do not think there are many archangels in this country.  I ask Deputies to follow what has been done under the County Management Act to its logical conclusion. Overnight we wiped out 1,600 or 1,700 public representatives, and in wiping them out we appointed 40 people in their place with dictatorial powers.  I am not saying that they are acting as dictators, but we know what human nature is.  They have dictatorial powers, and they have been armed with these powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> If we develop the position to a logical conclusion what do we find?  We find that it need only be extended to the Dáil, to which 140 Deputies are elected by the very same public.  It was by the same adult suffrage that from 1,600 to 1,700 public representatives were elected.  The Dáil has to deal with the administration of about £40,000,000, whereas 1,600 or 1,700 public representatives administered about £12,000,000.  I am attacking the Act because there is a tendency towards centralisation, and not alone that, but there is a tendency to forget democracy.  I differ from Deputy Cosgrave in a statement he made last night when he stated that the administrative side did not matter.  The Deputy was dealing with the treatment of tuberculosis.  I have nothing to do with administration, apart from democracy, but I am totally opposed to the managerial system as at present operated.  I say that the day that the County Management Act passed this House, that day was an insult to the Irish people, and not alone an insult but the people were told definitely that their representatives were not fit to govern.  That could be explained by saying that the same people were there.</P>

      <P>I do not want to criticise any particular man.  People may think that when criticising the Managerial Act I am criticising one particular manager.  I know the manager in my county, I knew him for 15 years as chief executive officer for Kerry County Council, where he was an able and efficient officer, but I hold that except we could get archangels we could not get managers to carry out the County Management Act in a satisfactory manner.  I am placed in a peculiar position, inasmuch as long before the Managerial Act was put into operation I favoured certain alterations in the county council.  I want to make a few suggestions now which, I think, could go a long way towards preserving not only the democratic side of the Local Government <Col N="1589" /> Department, but it would help managers in carrying out their duties. I would let a manager sit as managing director of a council, but the council should act as directors.  I would give the manager power to suspend officials, but I would take away from him power to suspend and replace.</P>
      <P>I would also give to him the decision in regard to tenancies of cottages.  I have qualms of conscience about public assistance, and I think some scheme could be devised for the administration of public assistance, without the interference of the county council and without the manager being the sole judge. I would leave to the county council the hospitalisation of the county, public health services, roads and other such matters.  I would allow them to direct and control such schemes, as I think it wrong that the manager should have such powers as he holds at present.  I would leave to the county manager the charge of the staff, including the workmen, and to the county council the operation of public health, services, mental hospital services, road services, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sworn inquiry has been held into the affairs of the county council in Kerry, and while I have been in favour of much more road expenditure than the county council has sanctioned, I do not think it fair that I should pass any comment on what attitude the Minister should adopt regarding that county council, in view of that sworn inquiry.  I should like, however, to draw the Minister's attention to the question of the treatment of patients in outside hospitals.  When I was chairman of the board of health in Kerry I found that there was no definite rule by which one could decide whether a patient should pay or not. The auditor came down, and in respect of small holdings fixed a valuation of about £8 or £9, over which valuation a patient should pay.  I have since discovered that along the east coast the valuation has been fixed at as high as £20 or £24.  I do not think it should rest with the auditor or with a local official to decide exactly who shall pay and who shall not.  The Department should frame definite rules and regulations. <Col N="1590" /> I hold that in the case of large numbers of patients who go from Kerry to outside hospitals, and who arc forced to pay out of very small incomes, they are financially crippled for years afterwards.  Not alone that, but there is the unfortunate feature that a patient lying in hospital feels that if he is in the hospital for another month he will not be able to pay, and that idea preys on his mind.  I ask the Minister to pay serious attention to it.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again that, in my remarks, I am not criticising any particular manager.  I say that things may have worked out a little better in certain counties than they have worked out in other counties.  That was all due to the fact that, by mutual agreement, the manager surrendered a certain amount of his powers.  I hold that these matters should not be arranged by mutual agreement but should be set down in black and white. The responsibilities which the county councils held in former times should not be completely removed from their shoulders, but a segregation along the lines I have suggested should be made.</P>

      <P>It will be generally conceded that a Minister for Local Government carries a very heavy burden. There is no Department of State which comes in contact, in its administration, with such a large number of the citizens of the State as the Local Government Department.  It comes in contact with them in a very intimate and serious fashion, and it is perhaps only just for me to say, before going any further, that the officials of the Department with whom I and others come in contact are capable, courteous and sympathetic officials, but there are many serious problems, many irregularities and many difficulties which they cannot remove, and it is with the intention of referring to a few of these that I intervene in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The administration of appeals in respect of old age pensions has been referred to adversely here and I think there is just ground for referring to it in an adverse fashion.  The Minister is the statutory arbitrator between the Department of Finance and the applicant for an old age pension.  The <Col N="1591" /> appeal comes before him and inherent in these arbitration provisions, there is the right of every applicant for an old age pension to have his or her claim examined by an inspector of the Local Government Department, so that a just and fair decision may be reached in respect of that old age pension.  Is the Local Government Department carrying out that statutory obligation placed upon it as the arbitrator between the Department of Finance and the applicant for an old age pension?  I think it is not.</P>
    <P>I had occasion a few days ago to refer here to two or three appeals which came before the Department and were before the Department for over 12 months.  We were told during all these months&mdash;other Deputies made inquiries as I did&mdash;that an inspector from the Department would be sent to investigate these appeals, and in one case, the application having been in cold storage for 12 months, the applicant died.  We were told by the Minister, the applicant being dead for some four or six weeks, that he would not be entitled to an old age pension.</P>
    <P>A post-mortem decision was reached in respect of that applicant.  I know the farm upon which that old man lived.  I have known it since I was a boy, and, outside of Connemara, I do not think there is a worse bit of land in the whole State.  Yet, six weeks after the man's death, we are told by the Minister that he is not entitled to the full old age pension.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a vivid imagination and a poetic fancy, but it will take the intensive exercise of both these attributes to satisfy anybody that this is not a report designed to whitewash his Department for not taking the steps it should have taken to investigate that case before the old man died. It will take a great fertility of imagination to convince the people of the district that that is not the real purpose of the report.  There is no use in blaming the inspector and no use in blaming the deciding officers in the Department. I put the blame definitely on the Minister because an inspector cannot travel the entire State when he is <Col N="1592" /> the only inspector to deal with the entire State.  The deciding officers cannot consider the report of the inspector when it does not come to them, but the Minister for some reason or other cannot collate the various services in respect of widows' and orphans' pensions and such matters, and get inspections made in these areas.  He cannot do that and he cannot appoint a second inspector, but he can afford to spend money in other directions not half as justifiable.</P>
    <P>In respect of national health insurance, the Minister has power to increase benefits under the National Health Insurance Act, from 1911 to 1934.  Some eight years ago there was an alteration made in national health insurance benefits and nothing has happened since.  Surely the Minister cannot contend that the cost of maintaining existence&mdash;because that is all it is&mdash;has remained stationary since these things were fixed some eight or ten years ago.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the case made by Deputy Corish for employees of local authorities&mdash;workmen, gangers, foremen, and such&mdash;who have given the best part of their lives and should be entitled to pensions in their declining years.  There is no necessity to stress that point.  The thing is so obvious that anyone can see the case for it.</P>
    <P>In connection with road workers' wages, I wish to refer to a case I know in particular.  Believe it or not, the road workers' wages in County Clare were the same 15 years ago as they are to-day.  I wonder is that justifiable.  The Minister frequently intervenes to see that fair play is given to employees on various public bodies. I know that he has intervened in respect of high officials.  I know that he has intervened in respect of other people.  Surely, in a particular case, where the wages of road workers have remained stationary for the last 15 years, it is time he exercised the powers vested in him to see that the workers get a fair deal.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister also to the manner in which the 48 hours week is operated in respect of road workers.  The usual practice <Col N="1593" /> is that they work nine hours a day fur five days and three hours on Saturday, but, in order to prevent them from getting the full advantage of the 48 hour week, they are knocked off on Friday.  The position is that they work at the rate of a 54 hour week for a 48 hour week wage.  They do not get the advantage of the short day on Saturday.</P>
    <P>The mental hospital capitation grant was referred to by Deputy Sullivan.  I ask that that should be reconsidered. In respect to the Ennis Mental Hospital, they are the worst paid staff in Ireland.  I would like that their position should be considered by the Minister, and that they would be given a fair trial.</P>
    <P>I shall refer now to a matter of very great importance, which has been discussed very extensively, not only here, but throughout the country.  The Minister opened his remarks here a few days ago with a eulogy of the Managerial Act.  He told us what a beautiful thing it was and how well it made towards effective administration where managers were operating.  I claim that I can take a detached view of that because in the County Clare we have not a county council, we have not a board of health, we have not a mental hospital committee or a home assistance committee.  All these functions are concentrated in one individual. I remember that at the end of the 1914-18 war there were certain countries which, we were told, had not reached a certain state of civilisation and which were put under the control of the Great Powers.  They were called mandated territories.  In the matter of local government, County Clare at the present time is a mandated territory. It has not reached such a state of civilisation that it would get a local government authority of its own.  We have to be led up to the heights at which we would be able to take over control of our own affairs.  The person selected to do that is a manager.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Crowley, I am not making any charge against any particular official.  I am making the charge against the Minister in respect of the abolition of the Clare County Council. There was a sworn inquiry held.  I do <Col N="1594" /> not know whether there was a report issued to the Minister or not, but we never heard of it.  Twelve months after that sworn inquiry was held, the Clare County Council was dissolved over the air.  There was not even a communication sent.  It was dissolved over the air and the county council has not since been re-established in the county. I do not know what we did out of the way.  I do not know what any member of the county council did.  I do not know what any of the subsidiary bodies did&mdash;the county board of health, the committee of the mental hospital, or any of them.  I do not know whether the Minister knows what we did as a result of which we were dissolved.  Of course, we have several very serious sins to answer for.  We elect the Head of the Government and probably we deserve condign punishment for that.  But I suggest that even for the election of the Head of the Government to this House, we pay too heavy a price in the dissolution of the Clare County Council and subsidiary bodies.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to try to realise the position in Clare at the present time.  A poor woman in Carrigaholt who wants home assistance has to get into touch with the great &ldquo;totem pole&rdquo; in Ennis, the county manager. The &ldquo;totem pole&rdquo; outside the savages' village was the symbol that they were reaching some stage of civilisation and the witch doctor performed his ministrations on the unfortunate individuals at the &ldquo;totem pole&rdquo;.  The same thing applies to us in County Clare.  The poor woman in Carrigaholt seeking home assistance has to come in and touch the &ldquo;totem pole&rdquo; in Ennis, and the county manager has to perform his ministrations at the &ldquo;totem pole&rdquo;. The man in Whitegate, 80 or 90 miles away, who wants his cottage repaired, has to come to Ennis to touch the &ldquo;totem pole&rdquo;.  Anyone in the district of Meelick who wants seed potatoes or anyone who wants a child removed for special treatment in a hospital in Dublin has to make representations to the &ldquo;totem pole&rdquo; in Ennis.  That is the position at the present moment.  In what fashion is home assistance administered?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" /> It is true that the county council in Clare that was abolished was a bad county council.  I need only tell the House that the majority of the members were Fianna Fáil members to inform them that it was a bad county council.  The terms are synonymous.  But, I would sooner see a bad county council, I would sooner see even a Fianna Fáil county council in Glare than no county council at all, because, at least, there would be some opportunity for the human element to operate in dealing with these cases, such as the distribution of vouchers, and the transport of invalid children.  The manager has nobody but officials who take the official point of view.  He has no means of testing these things himself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fred Crowley indicated what a manager would have to do where there is a county council.  I listened to other Deputies talking about the difficulty in managing where there is a manager plus a county council, but I ask the House what are the difficulties where there is a manager minus a county council&mdash;where there is nobody you can approach, no person with whom you can come in contact, but the one man to administer all the affairs of the county.  I ask the Minister does he seriously consider that that state of affairs makes for effective management and effective administration of local government anywhere?  I ask him how soon does he propose to change it?  I put it to him that he is not doing the managerial system any good&mdash;if he believes in the managerial system&mdash;and that he is rather putting it in the position that it cannot operate as effectively as it might, when he leaves a manager in charge of the whole administration of a county such as Clare without giving him a county council or committees of some kind to help him.</P>
    <P>Now, a good deal has been said about housing, and I want to refer to the position of cottages in County Clare.  In that connection, I want to read a letter that I have here with me. This is only one example of the kind of letter that I get by every post, every day in the week, in connection with home assistance, bad housing conditions, <Col N="1596" /> and so on.  My point is that it is almost impossible for these people to get in personal contact with the county manager or his officials.  In former days, they could get in touch with the local members of the county council, and the human element was preserved thereby; but as things are at the present moment, people holding such positions as that of county manager are actually not able, by virtue of the extensive duties which their office demands, to give a really sympathetic hearing to local cases. The letter, for instance, to which I have referred, and which was addressed to me, is to the following effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I respectfully submit a report to you with regard to my home, which is a labourer's cottage.  It is one of the old cottages and is in a dilapidated state.  I have been a tenant of this cottage for the past five years and when I took it over it was in bad repair.  I approached the board of health about repairs and got the deaf ear.  So long as I keep paying the rent it will remain the same way. My cottage is not the only one in this district that is in bad condition. There are six others.  If this is allowed to carry on without investigation, we will only have to evacuate them and live on the roadside.  I have eight in family, and I find it very hard to rear them in a house that has not got a window or a door, or even a decent bedroom to sleep in.  They are every other day sick from the constant draughts.  Both outhouses are completely knocked down and I haven't a place to rear a pig or anything.  Trusting that this will meet with your kind consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is only one example of the many letters that I receive in connection with the condition of these cottages in County Clare.  I wish it were possible to take the board of health into court and make them responsible for the death of a woman, whose death was alleged to have been due to the bad condition of the cottage in which she resided, and to which no repairs had been made.  It is all very well for Deputies to put down questions <Col N="1597" /> here, asking how many of the occupants of such cottages are not paying their rents.  I think it would be better to put down questions asking how many of these cottages, actually, are not even habitable because of the bad condition in which they are and the lack of repairs.  I am credibly informed that it would take anything from £15,000 to £20,000 to put such cottages in County Clare into a habitable condition.  Is that a state of affairs that the Minister can stand over?  Has the Minister told his county manager in Clare that that state of affairs exists, and that it should not be persisted in; and has he asked his county manager how that kind of thing could be remedied?</P>
    <P>As I have said, the question of housing has been referred to extensively in this debate, and I want to make a few further remarks in that connection. For one thing, I wish to refer to the way in which housing accommodation for the working classes is provided in the towns and cities, and to the discrimination that is made as between the working classes and other people. The houses for the working classes bear the imprint that they are different from the houses provided for other people in the community.  They are barrack-like; they are badly constructed; in many cases there is a low ceiling, and only a low roof, nor is there any provision for the necessary things that would be required in a kitchen.  There is no provision, for instance, for a bathroom or a hot press. In the majority of cases, you could step from the threshold to the first step of the stairs, and you have only a very thin wall to keep out the cold.  One man, for instance, told me that it was not so much a question of having blankets or quilts to keep himself and his family warm, as to having some way of keeping the cold from penetrating into the house.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is the Minister's mentality in connection with such cases, or whether he thinks that things are as they ought to be, but it appears to me that these houses ought to be constructed differently, and I want to suggest to the Minister, in reference to the building of houses, which is at <Col N="1598" /> present discontinued because of the lack of building materials, that there is no use in delaying much longer in this matter of trying to provide proper housing accommodation for our people. My friend, Deputy Flanagan, in a series of questions last week, in respect of a number of houses that had been erected in the Ennis and Kilrush area, for the last ten years, was told by the Minister that the number of houses erected between 1922 and 1942 by the Ennis Urban District Council was 60.  Now, in Ennis, at the present time, we want from 300 to 500 houses erected, and is the Minister taking steps to deal with this urgent problem in that area?  Of course, we are told that we shall have to wait for building materials to become cheaper when the war is over, so as to enable us to construct houses.  There are many intellectual poseurs who talk about post-war construction, but we had these problems before this war started, and I am afraid we shall still have them long after.  My point is, that if 300 or 400 houses are required to be provided in the town of Ennis, all the materials for the building of such houses are already there.</P>
    <P>There are stone quarries available in the district, which could be quarried, and there is also plenty of sand and limestone to be burned into lime. Local labour could be employed in developing the use of the stone, sand and limestone that are available in the neighbourhood.  The stone could be dressed by local masons, and a good deal of employment could be given to people in the neighbourhood in erecting these houses, without having to wait for the import of building materials after the war.  Instead of doing that, it seems to me that we are just sitting down and waiting until the war is over, before we do anything.  I put it to the Minister that it might be a good idea to start immediately to avail of the things we have at hand instead of waiting for ten or 15 years after the war.  Why does he not force the local authorities to get going in this matter and to try to construct houses with the materials that they have at hand already?  Why should we have to wait for the import of concrete, <Col N="1599" /> when we have everything at hand already, in the district to which I refer, such as stone quarries, sand and lime, and the limekilns also?  Are we going to condemn another generation of our people to live in stables and hovels, as a great many of them have to do at the present time, or are we going to try to provide proper housing accommodation for our people?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in answer to a recent question, informed us that there were 223 people unemployed in the town of Ennis.  Now, in that connection, there has been a great deal of talk here about the scourge of tuberculosis.  Deputy Dillon was very eloquent on the matter yesterday, and as to what should be done he said that we should have a medical, surgical and nursing unit, around which would be grouped the people suffering from tuberculosis, so that they might be treated properly.  But is not that getting at the wrong end of the matter? What, generally, is the cause of tuberculosis? Is it not, in 80 per cent. of the cases, due to low wages, bad housing conditions, insufficient clothing, and malnutrition?  Is the Minister taking any steps to see that the cause of this disease is stopped at its source? Take the position of an individual who has any predisposition to pulmonary disease of any kind, what steps is the Minister taking to avoid the spread of that disease?  Let us take the case of a man who is drawing unemployment assistance for a period of three months.  At the end of that period, he may manage to get some work, and his unemployment assistance immediately ceases.  That man may go in, in the middle of a wages period: in other words, his wages are paid every fortnight, and what is that man to do in the meantime?  He goes in at the beginning of the second week and he will not get any wages for the first fortnight.  That means that a period of three weeks elapses before he receives his first payment.  That man cannot get unemployment assistance or home assistance.</P>
    <P>The wives of such men have come to me and told me that their husbands have sometimes to go to these jobs <Col N="1600" /> without their breakfast.  The ravages of unemployment have left their mark on these men.  A man left without any income for three weeks is bound to be under-nourished.  When eventually he comes home with his 36/- a week, he has to pay 3/10 a stone for flour, 5/- for his house, 1/6 a stone for potatoes and, if he wants a pair of strong boots, which he must have if he is working on a sewerage or a drainage scheme, he will pay up to £4 for them.  Yet we say that we are in earnest when we talk about tackling the tuberculosis scourge in this country.  We are not. We can never be in earnest until we remove the source, which is bad wages, malnutrition, bad houses and the bad clothing which the majority of these affected people have to put up with.</P>
    <P>I put these things in all seriousness to the Minister, not in any spirit of carping criticism of his Department. I realise that he has a very heavy burden to carry.  He has to deal with many problems, for the satisfactory solution of which one man could scarcely be expected to be adequately trained.  I hope, however, he will examine those problems in the spirit in which I have put them before him. I hope, in particular, in respect to the housing problem he will give it that investigation which is necessary if we are to eradicate the tuberculosis scourge.  The wages problem is another matter to which I would ask him to devote special attention.  As I say, I put these matters to him in all seriousness, not in any spirit of carping criticism, but with the object of securing for them fair consideration, so as to ensure that some effective steps are taken to remove the causes of this dreadful scourge.  In conclusion, I want to ask the Minister does he propose to leave the people in County Clare without a representative body for any protracted period?  When does he propose to have an election for the county council, or can he not do something to introduce the human touch in the administration of the affairs of the county, by having the county council and the board of health reappointed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say a few words on the housing problem.  It is a many-sided <Col N="1601" /> problem, and this is one of the few occasions on which we have an opportunity of debating housing here.  Perhaps the Minister will say that he hears too much about it, but, be that as it may, there is no harm in referring to some aspects of the problem as one sees them.  The first question I should like to ask the Minister is: Has he ever considered the idea of making housing economic? I suppose he will immediately reply by saying that that is nonsense, and ask me do I not know perfectly well that there is a number of people who cannot pay an economic rent.  That, of course, is correct, but it is also true that at the other end of the scale there are people who can pay an economic rent, and I do not think the Government has taken sufficient pains to split the housing problem into its various sections.  There is the housing of the very poor, the housing of the poor, and the housing of the working classes. There is also the housing of what I might call the lower-class black-coated workers.  I listened very carefully to the Minister's statement, and I think he said that the authorities had sites for 10,000 houses ready here in Dublin. I hope that that is true, and that it is not a case of their being ready on paper.  By &ldquo;sites ready for houses,&rdquo; I mean districts in which roads are made and sewers, water, gas, and electricity mains laid on.  I should like to ask the Minister how far his 10,000 houses for Dublin come within that category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I answer the Deputy now?  I did not say that, but I shall tell the Deputy exactly what I did say.  I said that &ldquo;the Dublin Corporation is continuing the policy of planning and developing sites for future housing schemes and land has been acquired and, in fact, developed, for the erection of approximately 5,000 houses and 600 flat dwellings.&rdquo;  That is half the number the Deputy has mentioned. I said also that compulsory purchase Orders have been made and confirmed for the acquisition of land for the provision of approximately 4,600 further dwellings.  I added that plans were well advanced, therefore, for the construction of 10,000 new dwellings in Dublin as soon as conditions <Col N="1602" /> permit normal building operations to be resumed.  I did not say that we had land and sites developed for 10,000 dwellings.  We have them developed for 5,600 dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has corrected what I stated.  I only hope that the Minister in saying that the Corporation have plans ready for 5,000 houses&mdash;I am leaving out the odd numbers&mdash;means that the roads are made, and the sewers, water, gas and electric light equipment ready to be laid on.  Most people in talking about housing seem to think that it is merely a question of building the houses themselves, but I should like to point out that there is a cycle in house construction which is roughly made up as follows. It takes a year to plan a scheme, a year to acquire the site, a year to clear the site, and a year to build the houses.  I know perfectly well that people can upset my argument by telling me that certain things have not taken that time, or, again, have taken longer, but I give that as a very rough generalisation, and I make the Minister a present of it, because it serves to show that he has to face a period of three years, once a scheme is started, before he can start, to build houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about 19,000 families in single rooms and said that £11,500,000 had been spent on housing in Dublin.  I do not know just how many houses are supposed to be required for Dublin, but I would suggest that the high-water mark which the corporation have reached is about 2,000 houses per year.  If that is so, one can see by a sum in arithmetic that it would take about ten years to solve the problem for the people in single rooms.  That says nothing about tubercular people, people in houses that are falling down, and other things.  I would like the Minister to have brought some arithmetic to bear on this housing question.  We have got into a state of mentality in which we think that this country, when the emergency is over, will be flooded with people sent back from the other side.  I am not at all sure that that will occur.  I am almost certain it will not occur in the building <Col N="1603" /> industry, and I will state why.  There are supposed to be 4,000,000 houses required to be rebuilt on the other side, not to mention such trifles as alterations to factories, roads, public buildings and churches.  I think that the Government on the other side are thinking of a system of diluting the labour, in which case a lot of the tradesmen that we have sent across probably will be experts in mass production. Be that as it may, has the Minister thought of the labour necessary to put up 2,000 houses per year? I suggest it would take around about 6,000 men.  Will the Minister get that number?</P>
    <P>While there is a shortage of materials&mdash;and a very great shortage of certain materials&mdash;there are other materials almost going a-begging.  Irish gravel has not given out for concrete and, though Deputy Hogan spoke about mass concrete walls and the coldness of them, that is at the lowest end of the scale.  There are walls made with concrete in other forms that could be used in a palace.</P>

      <P>The thickness does not matter, it is the conductivity that matters, and whether they are cavity, double cavity, seamed, etc. There are a whole lot of other questions which enter into it besides the thickness and the composition of the concrete.  If you get concrete that is a non-conductor, it will keep the heat in.  That only goes to show how big the problem is.  Is there any reason why the corporation should not get on with the foundations and other matters?  There are cement, gravel and other things available.  I would like to ask the Minister how far he has gone to ensure the supply of labour and materials.</P>
      <P>In regard to the housing inquiry, I think it was Deputy Byrne who said it was held four years ago.  I would like to correct him: it was held four and a half years ago, on the 3rd April, 1939.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I do not like <Col N="1604" /> to suggest that an inquiry into housing which was taking place over four and a half years ago, and which is not available is not going to be much use to us in solving the housing problem. What is wrong with it?  I understand there is a staff still drawing salaries running into four figures.  It is preposterous to think that this staff can be maintained and the report not presented. As is usual when these things are delayed, rumour is busy&mdash;some people say that the Minister does not want to present that report, as there is some very damaging evidence given about the effect of tariffs on the cost of the housing industry.  That brings one to ask how far the Minister has considered the supply of materials in the post-war period.  I am not positive that all the labour that will be wanted will be available.  I may be quite wrong in that.  Be that as it may, they will not be of much use to us, if there is no material.</P>
      <P>The housing problem is a very intricate one and there are many sides to it.  The supply of materials is a very technical matter and I suggest that nobody engaged in the supply of materials at present knows how they will be situated after the war.  The Government had a plan for protection and, I think, very rightly.  They made some dreadful mistakes in not taking the tariffs off certain articles until after they had disappeared from the market.  But that is all passed and gone and we want to see now that they do not make the same mistake in reverse in the post-war problem, namely, that they do not leave their own people sown up in a sack as to what they are going to do about tariffs and supplies, while the whole world is scrambling for materials.  I can remember the time when our timber supplies used to come mainly from Russia.  One morning people got telegrams indicating that supplies were available and that their bids would be taken.  One and a half hours later the stocks of timber for the year had been purchased and anybody who had not got a supply had to suffer. Will the Minister tell me what would be the position of a timber merchant or some other supplier who got a telegram&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am talking about supplies for housing construction.  I suggest it is no good talking about housing if we have not got supplies, and I am begging the Minister not to fall, in the post-war period, into the same mistake as the Government fell into during the war period.  However, I do not want to labour that matter any further.  I will merely repeat that you cannot have houses if you have not got supplies.</P>
      <P>The biggest housing problem in this country exists in Dublin, and it is due to causes into which I need not now go.  The problems in the rest of the country form a smaller edition of the Dublin problem and they can be solved in an easier manner.  What I want to ask is, how far can the housing problem be broken up into the housing of the working classes and other dwellings. I hold that anybody who puts up a dwelling in Dublin City of a certain size is helping in the provision of houses.  Houses are very much like clothing.  They do a turn at different times for different sections of the community. We have streets that at one time held the wealthiest citizens in the land.  Then they passed on to a humbler section and ultimately to the very poorest section.  The same applies to clothes.</P>

    <P>I should like to remind the Minister that the money provided for the acquisition of small dwellings never was adequate.  The corporation pleaded, with a good deal of justification, that they were more interested in housing the very poorest sections of the community.  It is the Government's duty to consider how far this problem can be tackled from every angle.  There are numbers of <Col N="1606" /> people who really only want financing to help them to acquire houses; there are others, among the working classes, who can pay an economic rent.  Sufficient consideration has not been given to the breaking up of these problems into their constituent parts.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how far the Minister has advanced with the plans for erecting houses, whether there is any likelihood of advancing the housing programme a stage further than it was to have advanced according to the corporation plans, and how far the situation could be improved by bringing out a report such as the report of the housing inquiry, which is now four and a half years due.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that Deputy Dockrell should know more about housing materials than any other man in the city, considering the tradition of his family in that particular sphere of activity.  Questions have been asked about the housing activities of the Dublin Corporation.  During past years the corporation have published all kinds of documents showing the citizens what the housing problem is and how best to approach it.  We challenge the Minister on this subject.  We witnessed here an emotional display on the part of my friend, Deputy Donnellan.  He poured out his eulogy of the Minister as the father of the nation.  Some people might be inclined to think that it is a step-father we want&mdash;and that as quickly as possible. Surely, Deputy Dockrell knows Dublin City better than the Minister?  The Minister does not know anything about Dublin&mdash;but perhaps he does know something about the boroughs.</P>
      <P>Anyone who has followed the activities of the corporation must be aware that on the outskirts of the city there are grounds laid out, sewerage attended to, roads made, and everything ready to go on with the erection of 5,000 houses.  What have the public men in the city done to help to solve this problem?  What have men of standing and intelligence done?  Very little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Dockrell to the acquisition of small dwellings.  I was one of the pioneers <Col N="1607" /> in the matter of the acquisition of small dwellings some 30 years ago, but I think the day has passed for the operation of the Act.  Every speculator is out to make good for himself.  The corporation are anxious to build houses for the poor, and by the poor we mean those without any housing accommodation. Unfortunately, since the introduction of the managerial principle, the manager has taken to himself the right to fix the rent.  The corporation had arrived at the stage when they were able to fix an economic rent for a room, but that democratic right has been taken away from them.</P>
    <P>We did arrange to house the poor&mdash; and I mean not only the poor in material means, but the poor in spirit. We find that there is a lack of responsibility on the part of the citizens, a lack of what I call common honesty.  People take advantage of certain situations. We made certain regulations, but they have been abused.  I hope the Minister will help us in that connection when he gets the report.  I understand the report is drafted, but I do not know whether it has yet reached the Minister's office.  For four and a half years we have been waiting for that report. Two of the men who were on that commission have a deep-seated and long-sustained knowledge of the problem.  I cannot understand why the report was not issued before now.  There was a sworn inquiry held, on the suggestion of Senator Milroy and myself.  We sat for a long period, many months, in order to inquire into every aspect of this problem.</P>
    <P>Every time we ask that certain things be done or that we want to deal with the question of rents, we are told: &ldquo;We are awaiting the report.&rdquo; Nobody is more anxious than the elected members of the corporation to get the report.  Deputy Dockrell says that a cycle of years elapses before you get houses built.  He is incorrect and I am surprised that he should make the statement.  We took a virgin piece of soil and, in 11 months, we had 181 houses built by direct labour.  The Minister for Local Government then decided that direct labour would have to compete with the ordinary contract <Col N="1608" /> system.  We are still waiting to get the final figures of those two schemes.  The Minister concerned has passed to higher office.  I hope that the present Minister will analyse the results of the two schemes&mdash;that done by direct labour and that done by contract.  If we built 181 houses in 11 months, the problem is not as it was stated to be. If, within a period of 18 months, we get all the preliminary procedure carried through we can immediately start to work.  The Deputy was concerned about the technique.  As the debate is to close very shortly, I cannot go into that matter very deeply because I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House.  We have got the men.  We have got the technicians, whether they are from Great Britain or not, and we can turn to the problem as soon as we get the materials.  It is astonishing that, when you meet Ministers, particularly Ministers of extraordinary capacity, in their own opinion, you find that they do not know where these materials come from.  I sat down with a very eminent man and, to my astonishment, he did not know where our timber supplies come from.  Deputy Dockrell spoke about a particular source of supply.  The Minister will have some doubt whether he should buy timber from Russia.  Certain things might affect his future.  Like many more, he may adapt himself to the needs of the moment.  I suggest that we have timber in this country and that we cannot get any Department&mdash;the Department of Supplies, the Department of Local Government or the Department of Lands&mdash;to release this timber.  In some cases, it has been actually bought and yet the people who are waiting for the timber cannot get anybody to give them permission to remove it from the growing site to the saw-mill.</P>
    <P>After the eloquent plea of Deputy Dillon, I shall not enter upon the question of the conditions of work of Irish nurses to the extent that I should like. Deputy Dillon spoke of their willingness to give service to the community and of their capacity.  From what I know, they are willing to give their service at a price.  That is the reason why they leave their own country and sell their labour in another <Col N="1609" /> country.  There is one body of women who give service of infinitely more value to the community than that of general nurses.  I have been preaching to the general nurses publicly and privately for a long time to try to realise the property rights in themselves, but, owing to the fact that the leaders of their organisation suffer from political myopia, the nurses are in the same narrow circle that they were.  They have a vocation and education.  The men and women to whom I refer have a vocation, too.  Otherwise they would not be male attendants and women nurses in mental institutions.  It is not necessary to emphasise the argument in support of their claims.  General nursing is a tremendously high vocation.  The people practising it deserve the utmost respect.  The value of their service can hardly be measured.  But I appeal to the Minister to give the men and women who are attending the unfortunate beings who are patients in the asylums a measure of justice.  How does he do it?  I do not know that he has ever been in an asylum.</P>
    <P>For thirty years, I have been on the governing body of one of the most advanced mental hospitals in the world&mdash;a hospital which has given the lead to other countries.  I refer to Grangegorman and Portrane Mental Hospital.  Not only were there eminent men and women on the staff but we had representatives on the board who gave practically all their available time to the service of the community.  We were linked up with Louth at one time and now Wicklow and Dublin are combined.  All the men and women on that board gave more time to the service of those people than they did to any other section because they felt that there was a duly thrown upon them to do so.  What does the Minister and his Department do?  He gives us a manager who has to deal with all the complexities of city government.  He has to carry on all the functions which the Executive Government carry on, excepting the armed forces, in a minor way.  He has to deal with a revenue of £3,000,000 a year and he has all the functions and activations of the city to contend with. The Minister went out of his way to <Col N="1610" /> give him further responsibilities.  He is made county manager and, immediately, all the functions of the elected representatives on the Grangegorman Board are taken away.  A deputy-manager comes in to take charge of Grangegorman affairs. Within a week, a patient commits suicide.  A post mortem is held but we know nothing about it.  One of our functions was to look after the bodies and afford such spiritual comfort as was possible to those unfortunate people.  Yet, we were not allowed to attend the inquiry and we knew nothing of the circumstances which ended in that unfortunate being throwing his life away.  An attendant committed suicide and there was not even an investigation.  The Minister may turn to the Parliamentary Secretary but I speak what is true.  When members demanded the right to attend the inquiry on the patient they were told that it was not their function. There is a continuous fight going on with the deputy manager.  He is an able, competent man but he contends that he has powers which, in my opinion, he does not possess.  We are challenging those powers.  The city manager is an able man&mdash;one of the ablest in the country and a pleasant man to meet.  He went out of this country to study economics but no Hitler would give a Gauleiter the powers this gentleman has got.  No man could have the time or the energy to carry out the multifarious duties with which he is charged.  This House gave power to take away some of the powers of the ordinary members of public boards and those members have been succeeded by people with dictatorial powers.  I am sure that the people will ultimately demand the restoration of the right to govern themselves.</P>
    <P>In January, a deputation representing the men and women, and the union officials, waited on the present manager to point out the need for some improvement in the wage conditions of the men and women in the institution to which I have referred.  We had come to an agreement, after long debate. that married men should get 7/- a week increase.  The married women <Col N="1611" /> who are nurses and with families to maintain were to get 5/-.  It was against my convictions that I agreed to that, but we had to make a compromise. The single men and women living in the institution were to get 3/-.  The Minister, in his gracious way, did not even consult the manager on the matter.  He decided that he, as a little dictator, would not approve of this arrangement, provision for which had been made in the estimates.  He decided to pay only 3/- a week.  That was paid after a certain period, but not on the agreed date as between the manager and the staff. Last week the married men, some of them with families of five and six children, were notified that they would have to pay 50 per cent. more for their milk.  Some of the families consume five and six pints of milk in the day.</P>
    <P>The position is that you give them 3/- with one hand and take it away with the other.  I submit to the Minister that that represents a contradiction, even in the decisions come to by the Cabinet.  One Minister gives permission to private employers to pay a bonus up to 10/- a week to their workmen, but this is what the Minister for Local Government does. Speaking as a representative of industrial workers, I say that we could not defend the claim of any section of industrial workers as against the rates claimed for those men and women. There is no comparison whatever between the conditions of the outside industrial worker and the conditions under which those men and women have to live.  Take the case of those men and women in Portrane.  It is 13 miles from Dublin.  The institution is on a peninsula.  The attendants there are cut off from all social life.  The sickness rate amongst them is higher than it is among any other class.  The incidence of tuberculosis is also higher than it is in that of any other section of the community.  Those men and women are living under conditions that are against all human understanding. They are cut away from all touch with life outside, so that one can understand what the atmosphere of <Col N="1612" /> the place must be.  They entered into this contract of service, and in defiance of that, the Minister refuses even to acknowledge their claim to a measure of human justice.</P>
    <P>Take another point.  Some years ago a number of those people entered into another contract of service.  It was provided that after a certain period as probationers they should sit for an examination for the purpose of obtaining the medal of the Medical Psychological Association.  Even though many of them had not received a good scholastic training they pursued their studies, passed the examination and obtained the medal.  A week or two ago the Minister, without even consulting them&mdash;men and women who have given good honest service to the ratepayers&mdash; made a ruling to the effect that if they did not get the medal of the General Nursing Council and become registered they would be debarred from promotion. I submit that there is no law for that.  Some years ago, when the present city manager, with two other commissioners, was administering the affairs of the Dublin Corporation&mdash;it had been dissolved at the time&mdash;he decided to reduce the workers' wages by 10 per cent.  We took him into the courts and, possibly, we will have to take the Minister into the courts on this matter.  The courts decided that he had no right to reduce those wages. The result was that the 10 per cent. reductions made from the men's wages had to be restored.  In this case the Minister is wrong in law as well as in ordinary decency and ethics.</P>
    <P>Some of these attendants have had 19 or 20 years' service.  They are not as quick now to adapt themselves to receiving instruction from lectures as they were when they first entered the service.  They carried out their part of the contract by getting the medal of the Medical Psychological Association. Now they are told that before they can get promotion to the position of deputy charge attendant or deputy charge nurse they must go through another examination, and incidentally pay a fee of two guineas to sit for it. If they do not pass they will not get promotion and must remain as ordinary attendants.  I make an appeal to <Col N="1613" /> the Minister in this case.  I do not make many appeals to him, because sometimes I feel that it is a waste of effort.  I think the Minister ought to show some appreciation of the services which these men and women have rendered to the community.  It should be remembered that their lives are spent not in dealing with ordinary normal people.  In the ordinary hospital there is a sort of responsiveness always between the patient and the nurse, but what can one expect to get from poor human beings who have been deprived of their mental powers? There is one attendant in the institution with 25 years' service. He has had charge of a little child patient that was brought there from Louth 11 years ago.  He is a big rough type of person, something like myself, but one should see the way in which he looks after that child.  The child has lost the power of speech and the use of its limbs.  It has been in bed for the last 11 years.  If there is anything in the world that would prove to one that there is some good in humanity, it is the care that he takes of that child, and the way its eyes follow him about the ward.  He is a great, powerful brute of a man who comes, I believe, from Galway, City, and it is wonderful to see the way he looks after that child.  When a feeling of pessimism comes on me, I sometimes go down to look at that child and that attendant.  The experience gives one hope and inspiration.  That man is typical of the men and women who are giving their services in this institution. They are cut away from all human society, and from ordinary normal people.  Men and women have got to have a vocation for that class of work.  The percentage of cures there is very high, 16 out of every 100.  I appeal to the Minister to see if he cannot do something in the way of giving these men and women a better measure of life.</P>
    <P>There are many activities of the Department that I could speak on but I do not propose doing so.  I would like to know what the Minister proposes doing to try to correct the organised murder that is going on in certain parts of the country.  It has been exposed in the last few weeks.  I refer to <Col N="1614" /> these so-called child homes in Dublin. I do not want to go into the matter very fully, but I suggest that the registration of these homes needs to be tightened up.  In ordinary common parlance they are known as &ldquo;rabbit hutches&rdquo;.  We have them in Dublin. There was a case reported in the papers the other day of an old woman over 70 years of age who had five or six illegitimate children in her place. How many of them are living I do not know.  I heard of the case of a girl who had no less than five children through a man who is married with a grown-up family.  The girl in that case was the victim and the children were victims.  The five children born to that girl are all dead.  What has the Department done to tighten up the regulations and consult with the medical authorities as well as with the Department of Justice?  Something should be done about this matter.  It is becoming a dreadful menace.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which the Department might undertake and that is the question of port inspection.  I wonder is it realised that we have 30,000 cases of scabies in the City of Dublin?  Port inspection is not what it ought to be.  We are too careless in regard to it.  No matter how clean our own people may be or what the standard of cleanliness in the country may be, there are certain places where people may get contaminated, so that there is an urgent need for more medical inspections.</P>
    <P>I suggest, further, that the Minister might get in touch with the Minister for Supplies and immediately stop the importation of second-hand shoes and clothes.  One gentleman has advertised the sale of 500,000 pairs of second-hand military boots, probably taken from battlefields and military hospitals. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, who is a doctor, must know that disease is very frequently carried through shoe leather.  People develop this terrible scourge of scabies very quickly, and I think the country is being asked to pay too heavy a penalty because of the lack of port inspection There must be some reason for the spread of this disease and steps should be taken to check it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we might even <Col N="1615" /> go into Committee in order to get these matters dealt with.  I have occasion to cross the Channel and I realise that there is no inspection at all.  No country would allow the position that exists here to continue. Everybody coming to this country at the present time should have to produce some document showing that that person is in good clean health.  If that is not done I am afraid the situation may be a very serious one.  I ask the Minister to see that the Department concerns itself with the health of the workers, with conditions in private nursing homes as well as with inspection at the ports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieSnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>Many points have been dealt with exhaustively in this debate, and I wish to deal with the County Management Act, the administration of which has not been sufficiently stressed.  There has been a lot of talk here about democracy.  As we all know, democracy is a grand thing.  It was stated recently that the Irish people are natural democrats.  I agree.  With the coming into force of the Managerial Act some of the old shreds of democracy which lingered here have been destroyed.  I am a member of Roscommon County Council and I have watched the Managerial Act in operation.  The manager in Roscommon is a very capable and courteous gentleman, but I say that his powers are too wide.  To some extent they should be restricted.  It is most annoying for a member of a public body such as a county council to go to a public meeting and to have placed before him the manager's orders.  I notice on the agenda at the meetings &ldquo;manager's orders&rdquo;, but I received no circular and no hint as to the contents of these orders.  As a matter of fact, when I read the orders they have been already put into effect. My colleagues or I never have an opportunity of discussing these orders. They are actually law when we arrive at the meetings.  We are absolutely in the dark about these orders.  They may be good or bad, but we know nothing about them.  That is not right.  We are the elected representatives of the <Col N="1616" /> people, and I say that things should not be done in any underhand way. These orders should be discussed publicly before being put into operation.</P>
      <P>The functions of a county councillor are now very limited, but one function which should be reserved is the appointment of rate collectors.  Quite recently a rate collector retired on superannuation in Roscommon.  He was in receipt of a handsome income amounting to about £350 yearly.  My contention is that the county council should have the appointment of a successor but, by the powers that have been conferred on county managers, that function has been filched in a very subtle way.  The idea of my colleagues and myself on Roscommon County Council was that as this was a very good position, worth roughly £350 yearly, it should be divided into three parts, giving employment to three small farmers who could earn about £120 each, and in that way relieving unemployment.  Instead of that the manager in a very astute way divided the area in such a way that it was worked by three existing rate collectors. One of the collectors was in receipt of a very fine income from his collection and also owns 100 acres of land.  Another collector was an unmarried lady in very good financial standing and the third was a married woman, in comfortable circumstances. I think it was very unfair to take away the making of such appointments from county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to direct the Minister's attention to the system that has been adopted for the collection of rates.  In my experience it has been abused. The first moiety of the rates is due on or before 30th September, and the second moiety on or before 31st March. A friend of mine went to a rate collector with the first moiety about October 5th and the rate collector told him he could not accept it.  He said that the first and second moieties should be paid.  My friend protested that he was not in a position, owing to prevailing conditions, to pay.  The rate collector refused to accept the money and eventually the county manager was asked to intervene.  He <Col N="1617" /> promised to give whatever assistance he could.  He directed my friend to tell the collector to accept the first moiety, and with reluctance he did so but, when he handed out a receipt he included a six-days' notice for the second moiety.  I think that is not fair.  Prior to the coming into force of the Managerial Act things were different.  In my experience, when people made an attempt to pay their rate, even a month after the appointed day, the money was accepted.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister, in view of the position in which the farming community find themselves at the periods of the year mentioned, that they are not always in a position to meet their liabilities.  When small farmers sell calves that they have ready for fairs about the 1st November they pay their rates, their rent and the shopkeepers.  Accordingly the dates for the payment of the moieties of rates should be changed from the 30th September to 31st October, and from 31st March to 30th April.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention is the condition of the main roads in my part of the country.  It is at present almost impossible for horse traffic to continue there without inflicting disastrous losses on the farming community, and I recommend that margins of five or six feet should be left on the sides of the roads in order to make them safe for horses and cattle.  I have witnessed quite a number of incidents in my area which might have proved fatal to human beings.  Fortunately, that was not the case, but in three or four cases I have seen horses having to be destroyed, and carts and cars smashed.  That is a matter which the Minister should consider seriously, and I hope he will see that it is attended to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's impatience to have this debate finished, and also the anxiety of several members to get an opportunity of speaking, so that my effort will be to condense anything I have to say.  There are, first, one or two small points with which I want to deal.  I would not deal with the Managerial Act were it not that the Minister <Col N="1618" /> eulogised it in his opening statement. He might as well have allowed it to pass and let its effects be seen, but, as he opened up the subject, I shall admit straight away that I opposed it with all the energy at my command.  I do not regret doing so.  I believe it will eventually bring this country down to a worse position than ever it was in. Even the Minister's statement, that he believed there was very little opposition to that Act, shows that the people are taking no interest in and no notice of their own public affairs; and, in the course of time, if matters are not remedied, we will get down to the humiliating position of having governors up here and governors in the persons of officials, with the people themselves the governed.</P>
      <P>As to the administration of the Act, I wish to be perfectly fair, and to give my impression of it on the basis of a fair experience.  In our county council area, we happen to have the luck to have a manager trained in county administration, constantly associated with the members and with the activities of the council, who, in a word, has absorbed the whole atmosphere of a democratic body.  His procedure is to submit for the consideration of the council anything of a substantial nature which he intends to do.  The matter finds its way on to the agenda just as do the desires of any member of the council.  He is there as manager to hold and defend his point of view, but if there is any very strong opinion against his proposal, he has not the slightest hesitation in withdrawing it. He preserves, if you like, the control of the council over its finances, so far as the law will permit him and perhaps with a little stretching of the law; but it is not in the county council that the worst effects of the Managerial Act are felt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every representative on a county council feels that, in administering the affairs of his county, he is somewhat analogous to this House, in that he is dealing with big questions, more or less with principles, into which the human element does not enter to any great extent.  He is in a detached position.  In those circumstances, the mechanical idea of administration of <Col N="1619" /> the Act can work reasonably well.  It is when we come down to the services which both this House and the county councils were created to look after that we see its defects.  It is when we come to deal with the actual lives of the people, through the medium of urban councils, corporations, boards of assistance and boards of health, that we see the weaknesses of the Managerial Act.</P>

      <P>I shall answer the Deputy who interrupted me by saying that if he read and studied the debates when the Bill was going through, he would agree that at least I did my share in opposition to it.  This, however, is taking me away from my original intention not to deal exhaustively with the subject.  In these small areas of urban councils and corporations, <Col N="1620" /> the manager should be manager to the council and not manager of the council.  That is the great distinction which should be made.  It must be remembered that amongst members of a corporation or an urban council, there is the feeling not alone of being a representative but of personal ownership. It becomes part of oneself.  One represents one's own area and feels that one is doing work which is congenial, that is, the work of the public, and it is in such places that the mechanical, detached administration of the County Management Act has failed and will continue to fail, and, if not altered on the lines I suggest, will bring this country down to the position of which I have already spoken, in which there will be governors up here and governors in official life, the ordinary public being the governed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the payment of rates, Deputy Beirne made an appeal for an extension of the time for payment. I do not know whether he is aware that instructions have recently been sent down, or conveyed in some other manner, to the managers in different counties that the rate collection must be tightened up and completed by an earlier date, and that the time must be to close the collection by the end of the year, 31st March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a point I wish to put to the Minister, who may not be in touch with the affairs of county councils, as to the ability of rural or agricultural ratepayers to pay at a particular time.  As my friend has already pointed out, it is the usual system for farmers to carry their stock and calves through the winter and to put them on grass in May, June, and even to the 1st July. I have known cattle to improve as much in price in those few months as would pay the entire rates of the county.  I think I can claim, without presumption, that it was the fact that the Cork County Council realised that position and extended the time for the collection of rates as far as they possibly could, to allow owners of stock to hold them and to sell them to the greatest possible advantage, when it suited themselves, without the threat of a decree for rates, that rectified the <Col N="1621" /> affairs of Cork County Council.  I want to remind the Minister, when he is issuing instructions, that he is dealing with an agricultural community, subject to seasonal fluctuations, and cannot expect the payments that can be obtained in industrial areas.  I want him to consider this fact and to leave the local men, who are aware of local conditions, to judge whether people are able to pay their rates or not.  I agree that the dates for the collection of rates are entirely wrong.  I believe the date for the collection of the first moiety ought to be when men are able to sell their stock, which is primarily at the end of June or July, and the second moiety when their corn is threshed&mdash;although I know they are all due on the day the rate is struck.</P>
    <P>When I referred to urban councils and to the social services I should have mentioned mental hospitals, but I have undertaken to be as short and concise as I can.  I wish to refer to an acute controversy between the Department of Local Government and my council and the urban council of Youghal.  There is a huge bridge connecting the two counties which is at present in a bad state.  Its present condition is extremely detrimental to all trading, especially the Youghal area.  When the bridge was first found to be defective by our engineers we communicated with the Department of Local Government.  We had this reply from that Department:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to refer to the proposed reconstruction of Youghal bridge, and to state that the Bridges (Ireland) Acts, 1834 and 1867, apply for the purposes of the construction of a bridge between two counties.  Procedure should be by way of memorial to the Minister. The committee to be appointed must consist of eight members&mdash;four for each of the two counties....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We complied with the law and with the recommendation of the Minister. We nominated our committee and transmitted their names to the Minister. There the matter rested.  This was in November, 1939.  Nothing has been done.  The Minister has not sanctioned <Col N="1622" /> our committee.  Constant reminders have gone to his Department, and, at last, we got a communication telling us that we should proceed:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in regard to Youghal bridge, and I am to state that one of the purposes of the preliminary work referred to in your letter would be to determine the most suitable site for the erection of the proposed new bridge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has recently suggested that a sum of £10,000 should be provided by the county councils of Cork and Waterford for preliminary investigation and survey of sites.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question in the House last April as to why something was not being done, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In order to expedite the matter, legislation would be required, and that legislation is under consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister is not prepared to avail himself of the existing law.  The Minister has not actually introduced the new legislation, but he has sent down a suggestion that we should get a sum of £10,000 for survey of the sites.</P>
    <P>One of the vital things in the selection of a site is local requirements and local accommodation.  Why should we hand over to the engineers the sum of £10,000 for the selection of a site? Our whole quarrel is in regard to procedure. The difficulties of coming to an understanding are caused by the fact that the letters from the Department have confused financial responsibility with procedure.  I intend to deal with the two matters separately. I am dealing now with procedure.  Our objections to proceeding in the way in which the Minister has suggested are twofold: first, it takes away from local interested people any say in the selection of the site and hands that decision over to the engineers; secondly, there will be a survey of many places, which we think entirely unnecessary.  There are only three possible sites.  There is the direct <Col N="1623" /> route to the ferry point.  There is another called Ardsallagh Bank which it is believed has been inspected and recommended and which, it is understood, is favoured by the engineers of the Department of Local Government. That site would remove the bridge outside of Youghal by a mile and a half to two miles.  It involves the making of a new bridge at the Stone Bridge as the bridge there for many years has been restricted to certain traffic.  The two sites at Ardsallagh are entirely inside the county of Waterford.  I know the Minister has power, under the law, to bring the neighbouring counties, my own county included, into financial liability but if the erection of the bridge is to be a purely Waterford charge at an estimated cost of £300,000 it would mean a levy of £1 5s. 0d. in the £ on the rates of the Waterford people, This is a penal assessment and we do not want it.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to pay our share. We are prepared to do everything that is necessary to expedite the preparation for the building of the bridge. We realise that the bridge cannot be built until the war is over, until material is available but, at the same time, the preliminary arrangements have to be gone into and a site selected, and plans drawn.  We do not want any duplication.  The present bridge has the advantage of being on the accustomed traffic route.  The road is trunked one-third of the way across. I submit that a bridge commission when set up and sanctioned by the Minister will agree on the existing site and, when the site is agreed on, the Minister will find that he will have no trouble with the counties of Cork and Waterford in regard to paying a reasonable share.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the question of finance.  It is very difficult to get a fair picture of the responsibility. The Minister's letter says that it is primarily the obligation of the two counties to put up the necessary finance.  I admit that it is a primary interest of the two counties but I deny emphatically, and I hope to prove, that it is not the primary obligation of the two counties. <Col N="1624" /> Let us cast our minds back a few years and let us clearly visualise this matter from its foundation, when affairs were free from the intricate manipulation of finance we find around us to-day.  Not many years ago, even in my own memory, that bridge was built by the two counties of Cork and Waterford, unaided.  It was built to serve the traffic of that day, without help from anywhere.  There was no guarantee fund or road fund or anything else. They built it to facilitate themselves. No revenue-bearing traffic came in. With the advent of mechanical traffic, such as motor buses and lorries, the position was completely altered, and such traffic, which was unrestricted, and which was licensed by, and revenue-bearing to, the Minister, destroyed that bridge.  I want to make it clear that it was the unrestricted traffic licensed by the Minister that destroyed that bridge, by turning it into a national highway over which five-ton and ten-ton lorries or buses could pass.  Now, however, the Minister denies liability in the matter, but I think that the Minister, in endeavouring to justify the heavy traffic that he permitted to go across that bridge, and claiming that he had no responsibility when he permitted the bridge to be destroyed as a result of that traffic, is just as responsible as if he had allowed an individual or individuals to blow up the bridge.  The Minister would be equally justified in holding that he had no responsibility, when he permitted the bridge to be destroyed, as if he had employed people for the work of the destruction of that bridge.</P>
    <P>Now let us consider for a moment the question of finance, and the revenue that has been derived by the Minister from licensed mechanical traffic.  In the eight years whilst this traffic was going on, and during the three years before the destruction was noticed, the licence duty from petrol and from the licensing of motor vehicles amounted to, approximately, £21,400,000.  I am aware that the Minister allocated moneys received from licence duties to the repair and maintenance of roads affected by motor traffic.  He refunds to local authorities 40 per cent. of the cost of <Col N="1625" /> repair of main roads and, by doing so, he accepts the principle of liability of revenue from this licensed traffic for the repair of roads.  I fail to see why the Minister can repudiate liability for the destruction of the bridges connecting those roads when he acknowledges liability for the repair of roads from revenue derived from the licensed traffic that destroyed these bridges.</P>
    <P>The Minister now pleads that the Road Fund is not in a position to face this liability, but I suggest to him that if, during those eight years, he had not withdrawn from the Road Fund a sum of £1,600,000&mdash;in the circumstances, a harsher word than &ldquo;withdrawn&rdquo; might be appropriately used&mdash;for Exchequer purposes, there would have been a sufficient amount to deal with this matter without asking for any contribution from the rates.  As I have said, the Minister now claims that the Road Fund is not in a position to meet that liability.  How could it be, when, during the last eight years, the Minister has withdrawn from the fund £1,600,000 for Exchequer purposes? The Minister applied the money that was so withdrawn to Exchequer purposes, and surely he cannot deny that the first liability on the Road Fund was the repair of destruction done by licensed motor traffic from which he derives revenue.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the effect of all this has on you, Sir.  The question at issue is whether the Minister is proceeding according to law: whether he is proceeding either under the existing law or, as he suggested himself, under legislation that may be introduced in the future.  If he refuses to proceed under the existing law, then let us have immediately the introduction of legislation which will enable us to have everything in readiness when it comes to a question of the rebuilding of that bridge, because every area in the neighbourhood is suffering as a result of this.  Again, the Minister should bear in mind the enormous revenue which he derives and will derive from this traffic and which, I claim, should be used for this purpose. I am asking that justice should be done in this matter, and that this money should be devoted to the purpose <Col N="1626" /> for which it was intended.  Therefore, I ask you, Sir, to take this matter into serious consideration. Allow us to proceed under the existing law, or immediately introduce the necessary legislation to allow us to do so.</P>

I shall leave it to the Minister's own honour to do what is only fair and just in this connection and what, I think, the country would expect of him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of the discussion here in the last few days, there has been a certain amount of criticism of the managerial system as applied to local bodies.  Having followed with some interest the criticism by local bodies of the managerial system, and also having listened to the speeches of Deputies here along the same lines, it appears to me that one thing is outstanding, and that is that, while there may be some criticism of the managerial system as applied in certain cases, in actual practice there is a general feeling that the principle of the managerial system, in itself, has been well received.  The managerial <Col N="1627" /> system, gauged from ordinary business standards, could hardly be opposed by any reasonable person. No normal person, engaged in a business involving even one-tenth part of the moneys concerned with the management of even the smallest county council in Ireland, would consider, for five moments, that he was transacting his business efficiently unless he were to appoint two or three agents to act for him under one general control.  The managerial system, in so far as it passes that test &mdash;and it must pass that test before any normal-minded person&mdash;is in the same position as that of any well-conducted business.  When the Bill was passing through this House, I held that it had great potentialities.  I felt that it was a necessary development, and I wondered why it had not been conceived from the very inception of the principle of local government.  I held that that Bill, with its system of managerial control, would have led to the inception of a wider extension of control by local bodies, and from the criticisms of the system that I have heard in this House, as well as from the criticisms that I have read in the reports of various county councils, I feel confirmed that I interpreted the minds of those people correctly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of managerial control of county councils is accepted but, undoubtedly, there is a natural reaction on the part of the people, who have been elected by their local constituents to speak and act for them in the control of local affairs, to resent&mdash;and more power to their resentment&mdash;anything that, even by implication, would suggest that the elected representatives of the people were not honest men, or were men who were incapable of discharging their duties.  Any such implication, naturally, would draw from the elected representatives of the people very strong resentment.  It seems to me that that is the only real criticism to which the managerial system has been subjected during the course of the debate here.  With regard to local administrative bodies, I am quite satisfied, and was quite satisfied during the passage of the Bill, that even if, by implication, there was <Col N="1628" /> a suggestion that they were incompetent or dishonest people, they would get a very quick exit from public life. To my knowledge these men were great men.  They were men of great capacity, men who had the confidence of the people who elected them.  They gave valuable service over many long years and they brought intelligence and honesty to bear on the various problems that were theirs to decide. It was a poor compliment at the conclusion of that faithful service to suggest by implication that they were men who possessed qualities inferior to those which they actually possessed.</P>
    <P>In recommending, as I did during the discussion here on the managerial system, that the object for which that system was introduced could best be secured by handing over to these bodies, once the system was in operation, a wider control, I spoke from experience, and I am still more convinced than ever that that should be done.  Any man who has had experience of local administration will admit that interference by a centralised Local Government Department here in Dublin is a hindrance and an obstruction and definitely produces annoyance and delay in the operation of schemes locally.  Nobody will attempt to suggest for a moment that officials sitting here in the Custom House would have a better idea of the necessity for the adoption of a water scheme in a village, a sewerage scheme in a town, or the building of houses in rural areas than the local representatives aided by the advice of their manager plus the technical advice of their engineering staffs. I have had long experience of local boards operating under the British regime and under our own Government and I do know that the attitude of these centralised bodies in their efforts to control local administration has given rise to more annoyance to those engaged in local administration and to their officials than any other cause I know.</P>
    <P>Why should the necessity for building a labourer's cottage down in County Leitrim be decided by some officials in the Custom House in Dublin?  Why should the selection of a site be a matter for their concern? Why should the laying out of a water <Col N="1629" /> supply for a townland&mdash;a scheme which has not been adopted by the way&mdash; where a number of farmers have to carry water, since the beginning of time, for a distance of miles during periods of drought, be a matter for decision of the managerial and engineering officers at the Custom House?  Surely the local representatives and the local engineering staff are best capable of deciding a matter of that kind?</P>
    <P>We have had months of delay, I might say years and years of delay in other matters, in connection with the provision of a county hospital in County Leitrim, for instance.  The net result is that the county to-day is without an efficient up-to-date county hospital, not through any fault of the local council or of their engineering staff, but entirely due to some unaccountable delay or other on the part of the staff which controls these matters in the centralised body at the Custom House.  I have to meet the people of Leitrim day after day, week after week and month after month.  I have to meet patients ordered by their doctors for operations and <i>x</i>-ray treatment and who find that there are no facilities for such treatment in their own county.  Where are they to get it?  They look to Dublin.  Many cases have I on hand at the present moment of patients recommended by their doctors for treatment&mdash;surgical treatment, <i>x</i>-ray treatment and otherwise&mdash; and they cannot get this treatment just because there are no facilities in their own county while the Dublin hospitals are filled to overflowing for a long period ahead.  What is the use of telling these patients that somehow or other they cannot have such hospital treatment in their own county?  They look to the counties around them, most of which have got these facilities and they ask: &ldquo;Why could we not get them?&rdquo; I can only tell them that if we have not these facilities it is not the fault of the local representatives or their technical advisers or officials.  I am certain that were these matters left in the hands of the local people, these facilities would be available and those who now have to wait months <Col N="1630" /> and months for special treatment would have it within a reasonable time at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>While the managerial system in principle may be good, I feel that it can be made more useful if a wider control is given to local bodies, and if we have more decentralisation from the authorities in the Custom House where the wise men are assumed to exist.  In the opinion of the poor and those who suffer from their delay and&mdash;I will not say inefficiency &mdash; over-cautiousness, until control is taken from them and handed over to bodies who can administer local affairs more efficiently and effectively and for the benefit of the people concerned, no satisfactory results can be expected.</P>
    <P>On the question of housing, most speakers here have recognised that the possibility of continuing housing as we knew it in the past is not practicable at the moment.  My own opinion is that that may be a blessing in disguise. I think we were going along lines that were as badly conceived as they could have been and the fact that a halt has been put to our gallop is to the future good of housing development in the country.  I heard a Deputy here this evening quote a statement of the Minister that arrangements had already been made and plans had been prepared for the building of 5,000 new houses in Dublin and that there were many more on the way.  Now is it not time that this whole question of the erection of houses should be considered from the viewpoint of serious planned economic development all over the country? Are we going to waste public money subscribed by the ratepayers of Galway, Mayo, Leitrim, Donegal and elsewhere to build recklessly a number of houses here in Dublin simply because it is suggested that there exist at the moment in the city so many people living in houses which are not suitable for habitation?  Surely to goodness an economic survey, if properly planned, dealing with the country would be directed towards ascertaining what possible provision there would be in the way of employment for these people for whom it is <Col N="1631" /> proposed to build houses?  What will their employment be like and to what extent will they be able to pay a fair rent for these houses?  Having provided them with houses, are we going to continue subsidies, grants, doles and gifts from various sources to enable them to live in these houses and to provide for their families without regard to the possibility of providing employment for them?  On the other hand, it is suggested that you cannot spend enough money in Dublin. Are we going to make it the Mecca of the whole country?  If we are going to do that, let us say so&mdash;let us tell the country towns, so that people who are thinking of investing in houses there or in the building of new houses there will realise that it is bad business for them, as Dublin is to be the one centre of business for the whole of Ireland, as everyone in Ireland will be compelled to buy in Dublin and forget the local towns.  I would not agree with that, but if that is to be the plan, let us have it stated, so that nobody will be deceived.</P>
    <P>Why not consider the planning of houses?  Why not consider not merely the number of people living in Dublin, but the number living in the whole of Ireland?  What are the possibilities of providing suitable employment for a certain number of people in each town, in order to enable them to pay the rent and bring up their families in comfort?  Personally, I consider the whole scheme a bad one.  I think the plan that operates for the building of more and still more houses in Dublin and in each town, without a plan for the employment of the people there, is wrong.  The people who will ultimately have to pay are the farming community, who, in season and out of season, in healthy weather and otherwise, will have to continue to maintain this country in our periods of stress and depression.  Why not spend more in developing house building in rural areas?  Why should houses be built in provincial towns or small towns without an allotment of land attached to them?  Why destroy the old building or workhouse which is in a small space and then employ the ablest architects to utilise that <Col N="1632" /> space for building the maximum number of houses, in a small town surrounded with areas of land very often going to waste?</P>
    <P>There are roadsides where there are acres and acres of land going to waste. Why build these houses in a congested space without one-tenth of a rood left for tillage?  Having placed these people in homes&mdash;and home is an attractive thing, if there is a family&mdash;and having left them dependent on the amount of dole drawn from the community, as there is no employment for them, we wonder why they do not pay their rents punctually and, in turn, have to be evicted.  Why not give these people an alternative?  Why not give them a piece of land attached to the house? Why not give them the chance to initiate something themselves and utilise their energy on it?  Surely, that additional piece of land, to an energetic man, would mean the difference between the well-being of himself and his family, with ability to pay his rent, and the definite prospect of being evicted for non-payment, with his wife and children thrown out on the road? Why not have planning for the rural areas, if we are going to continue the tillage policy?  Do we not know that we must organise these tillage and other schemes?  Why not build our houses accordingly?  Do we not know that, if we continue the tillage policy, we will require a certain number of workers in certain areas, and that the sooner we zone our areas of tillage the better and the quicker we may plan effectively for the future building of houses?</P>
    <P>In regard to labourers' cottages, might I mention that I consider these buildings very useful.  I might suggest, however, that there should be some variation, that the sameness of these houses is a slur on the countryside and on those responsible for their erection. Surely our engineering staffs and architects are able to devise more than one plan for labourers' cottages from Cork to Donegal?  They are very nice houses and I think a little imagination would make them much more attractive than they are and much more helpful to those who live in them.</P>
    <P>I might find it convenient to refer to <Col N="1633" /> certain other parts of the Minister's administration, and I do not wish to appear cheap in saying things.  If I refer for a moment to the administration of the old age pensions I am certain I am not the first Deputy to do so. It is as clear to me as that I am speaking here this evening, that efforts have been made recently from some quarter to ensure that the old age pensioners shall receive lesser sums than they have received hitherto and that there shall be a closer and more stringent investigation of their means.  I make that statement, not from any information I have officially but from the ordinary inquiries I have seen from the various applicants all over my part of the country.  I wonder why an effort should be made to save financially at the expense of these people.  I thought that stage was passed years ago.  I am quite certain that the gift of 10/- a week will receive the moral support of the general public, which is the best support the Minister can have in the administration of any Act.</P>
    <P>No one wants to economise in this particular respect, but I suggest to the Minister that it is being done in recent months, and done very rigidly and to an extent that is quite unjustifiable. He has sitting beside him the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;a man who in this House did more than one man's part to ensure that the old age pensioners would have their rights many years ago.  I blame neither the present Minister nor his Parliamentary Secretary for any curtailment of those rights, but I do feel that there is a sinister influence coming from some direction which is doing a grave injustice and wrong and for which there is no moral justification. The voice of the whole people of this country will defend the giving of the maximum pension to those people without the strict investigation and unfair reports which very often deprive people of the amount of pension to which they would be entitled normally under the law.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said in this debate on the subject of public health.  The Minister was able to point to the improved position of the health of our people, but there was the suggestion that in another direction, <Col N="1634" /> in the matter of tuberculosis, the position is not so happy.  I have listened to speeches from various parts of the House.  The speeches were sincere and generous; they indicated a generous attitude from the point of view of dealing with the problem of tuberculosis.  In these circumstances, why is this problem not faced in a really serious fashion? There was not a speaker here who did not advocate wide, unlimited efforts to deal with the problem.  Deputies also indicated that it is not merely a matter of dealing with the disease; it is in its initial stages that it ought to be tackled.  The best time to deal with the disease is in the earlier stages.  There must be good housing, good food and a decent wage standard. Why is that not done?</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to make investigations into one matter bearing on this problem of tuberculosis. I am not giving this as orthodox, but I have had information that among the lower grades of civil servants the percentage of tuberculosis is abnormally high.  If that be the case, surely the Minister must take cognisance of it and he must make investigations to ensure that his immediate employees are properly considered.  Of course, the Department of Finance is directly responsible for the salaries paid to those lower grades of civil servants, and that Department must accept its own share of responsibility for whatever disease prevails amongst them.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the children in the country, who are barefooted and who have little protection in the matter of clothing.  Many of them have to tramp two or three miles to local schools.  On the journey from their homes to the county roads they cannot wear boots or shoes because the ground is in such a sodden condition that their feet are wet in the first ten yards.  These are things that contribute very largely to the growth and spread of this dread disease.  Why are they not remedied?</P>
    <P>An important factor in this connection is finance.  How is the money to be found?  We have a grand Constitution. People with fine minds all over the world have approved of that <Col N="1635" /> Constitution.  The Trinity is there and it is stressed that the foundation of the State begins with the family, and all our institutions are built up on that family concept, each helping the other.</P>
    <P>Take an average family.  If any member of that family is ill, and they cannot afford to employ a nurse to look after the patient, is it not the usual thing for one member of the family to stay up at night, and is it not customary for them to forgo some of their ordinary needs in order to provide the little luxuries that the sick member of the family may require?  If our Constitution is only, in its written form, a Christian Constitution, and if it does not apply that spirit Which it was intended it should apply, then we are merely living as hypocrites.  If this State does not possess sufficient resources to allow us to tackle these problems, to supply housing accommodation sufficient to meet the needs of the people, to provide the food supplies that may be required, to give the full award of old age pensions, and reasonable payment to our civil servants that will enable them to live without endangering their lives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Judging <Col N="1636" /> by the speeches I have listened to, I am satisfied that he will have the full support of Deputies in redressing the serious grievances that exist. There are two ways in which that can be done.  Perhaps our resources will not permit it, but there is another factor. Surely, charity is still strong enough among us, and if there are numbers of our people under-fed, under-clothed, badly housed and badly hospitalised, there are others who have in excess of their demands, and we can ask those people to, extend their charity to their poorer brethren.  Let us seek the charity of those who have goods in excess and give to those who are in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a few points which concern the area I represent and I shall try to condense my remarks so far as possible.  One of these points concerns the by-roads.  In County Mayo, our by-roads are fast slipping into a condition the righting of which will require large sums of money later. In the past, considerable sums were devoted to the straightening of county roads.  That work is not being carried on to the same extent at present.  My suggestion is that the Minister should divert a sum of money to the repair of by-roads equal to the amount expended in straightening the county roads in the last peace year, 1939.  I know a few cases in which by-roads, accommodating from 14 to 16 families, have so far deteriorated that a horse-drawn vehicle cannot be brought nearer to the houses than a quarter of a mile. That shows clearly the condition to which they have sunk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of steam-rolled roads with a very smooth surface, these <Col N="1638" /> are definitely dangerous to horse traffic and I agree with the remarks of several Deputies that a small strip of, say, five feet each side should be shingled to give a chance to ordinary traffic. Heretofore, accidents, which must have come to the Minister's notice, have occurred from time to time, and now that motor traffic has virtually disappeared the principal user of the road should be given a chance by the shingling of a strip of four-feet-six or five feet on each side.</P>
    <P>Another subject which has been much debated is that of tuberculosis. In County Mayo we have a sanatorium which, catering for a population of 161,000 in the county, has only 40 beds &mdash;20 for males and 20 for females. Deputy Donnellan referred to the case of a mother of eight children.  I shall allude to the case of a young girl who was found to have a small spot on one of her lungs and to be in the first stage of tuberculosis.  If she had been treated forthwith, the upper portion of the lung could have been collapsed very easily and she could have gone back to work in a few days.  She was sent home because no bed was available. Four weeks later, she went for a medical examination again and her condition had become very much worse. Still no bed was available&mdash;after four weeks.  A fortnight later she was showing signs of rapidly approaching the serious stage of tuberculosis and she went to a doctor for further examination. In desperation, her father took the very serious step of offering a bribe&mdash;&ldquo;bribe&rdquo; is a harsh word to use&mdash;and, strange to say, a bed was instantly available.  The father did that to save the life of his daughter and to prevent other young members of the family from being affected with the disease, from which the family had been free up to then.  What does the Minister mean to do about such cases? I place the blame definitely on the Minister for such a condition of affairs. In fighting this disease, he will have the wholehearted support of every section of the community.  In our county, a proper sanatorium would require to have, at least, 250 beds.  Any expense incurred in that way would be approved by every section of the community. Those are the points to which <Col N="1639" /> I wished to draw the Minister's attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment on only one or two points.  In the whole discussion on the question of health, one basic factor was overlooked. In their concern with figures, Deputies seem to have forgotten the conditions which have given rise to the growing incidence of various forms of disease.  One important point was referred to by Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;the need for trying to ascertain the amount of basic food required by a family, and seeing if we could provide that.  I want to bring the mind of Deputies back to that point, and to show that it was just as well the Minister did not exhibit complacency in the figures which he put before us.  He must be aware of the morass that lies under our feet, which is breeding disease from day to day.  In 1940, an official court of inquiry was held, and one of the points raised was the basic minimum wage required in Dublin for a man, his wife and three children.  We had a figure given to us&mdash;I do not know whether it is correct or not; it seems to be very small&mdash;of 71/- per week for 1938.  That figure was arrived at by a man who was quite competent and moderate in his views.  In 1940, to offset the increase in the cost of living, that figure would have to be increased to 84/6.  In 1943, the corresponding figure would be £5 10/- a week, to give the minimum quantity of food, clothing and shelter to this family.  Yet, in Dublin, in 1938, the average wage for labourers was 60/- a week.  To-day we find that these families, consisting of a man, wife and three children, are more than 50/- a week short of the amount required to maintain this basic standard of life.  That comprises a very large section of industrial workers. We must remember, too, that we have over 300,000 men, women and children depending on various forms of State charity, running from the 7/6 of the widow to the 23/- or 24/- of the unemployed. We must add 80,000 or 90,000 agricultural labourers with a wage of from 36/- to 39/- a week.  We can see, therefore, that no matter what statistics are produced, there is a <Col N="1640" /> breeding-ground for disease in this country.  I do not want to traverse that ground.  Deputy Maguire asked a question which he cannot answer, nor can Fianna Fáil answer it.  If we are all agreed on this problem of tuberculosis, if we are all animated by those sentiments of Christian charity, and are desirous of tackling this problem, why are we doing nothing, and why are the figures getting ahead of us all the time?</P>
      <P>Is it not a plain fact that the Government Party are not prepared to spend money, but are quite prepared to see this loss of life going on year after year?  I think that very shortly you will find a scheme being put to the Minister where on an estimate of outside £1,000,000 a year we could radically reduce the figures for the incidence of T.B.  I doubt very much if the money will be made available, and yet only a little while ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce twitted the Labour Party that if we could produce practical schemes for the provision of employment there was all the money available that was required to put the schemes into operation.  If there is money available to provide work for the people, why is there not money available to save the lives of the men, women and children who are dying from a disease that is preventable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other matter that I want to deal with.  It is something that has not been mentioned so far by the Deputies who have spoken.  There have been numerous references to the need for sanatoria and to the need of utilising empty houses for the purpose. I want to put to the Minister a suggestion which I have seen in practice elsewhere.  I do not want to say where, because if I did the Minister might not be prepared to consider the suggestion as being a practical one. There has been a system in operation abroad of utilising men's night sanatoria. These are small buildings or small houses with six, 12 or 20 beds in them, in which infected men in the early stages of T.B., instead of going to sleep at home with their families, spend the night.  A man does his work <Col N="1641" /> during the day, and may have his meals at home, but when night time comes, he does not go home because of the danger of carrying the infection to his family.  He goes to these night sanatoria, where he gets a proper meal and a good bed.  He goes to bed early and gets a good night's rest.  That is a very desirable method of dealing with the early stages of T.B.  It limits the spread of the infection by taking the person away from his family. Secondly, he is provided with a period of rest and recuperation.  That is absolutely essential before surgical treatment can be applied to these early cases.</P>
    <P>In Dublin to-day, and in other places throughout the country, we find doctors actually taking the chance of giving patients surgical treatment when they must know that the first essential is proper rest and food&mdash;the building up of the patient so that later he can take advantage of the surgical treatment. These night sanatoria could be established in many small buildings throughout our cities and towns.  It would not be necessary to employ an elaborate staff and no great expense would be involved.  Their establishment would help to keep the infection from spreading and would make it possible for the doctors to give the surgical treatment When the patients could derive benefit from it.  The doctors must know that patients cannot be cured by surgical treatment alone: that first of all what the patients need is rest, food and freedom from worry before the surgeon treats them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time at my disposal I do not propose to speak on hospitalisation although many resolutions have reached me from various public bodies asking me to do so. Neither do I propose to deal with the incidence of T.B. or the proposed remedies for it.  There are one or two items that I intend to speak on.  The first is the peculiar anomaly that exists in regard to the Old Age Pensions Act.  Secondly, I have some suggestions to make with regard to the cases of some ex-employees of the Cork Corporation.  I want first of all to call the Minister's attention to some of the peculiar anomalies that exist <Col N="1642" /> and of which, to my knowledge, he has been notified&mdash;resolutions must have reached him from various public bodies, including the Dublin and the Cork Corporations&mdash;on this question of the means test under the Old Age Pensions Act.  I want the Minister to concentrate particularly on this kind of case. I refer to the condition of the provident, prudent and good citizen, the man who, say, for a period of 40 years has been contributing to a trade union, an insurance society or some body of that character, a weekly sum of from 1/4 to 1/8.  At the end of his 40 years' service he receives a superannuation allowance of 15/- per week.  When he attains the age of 70 years he will not get the State old age pension of 10/- per week.  Take also the case of the decent employer who may give his employee a pension of 10/- per week.  The State will only give that man 6/- per week, because in no circumstances can he have more than 16/- per week according to the present law.</P>
      <P>I have given the case of the provident, prudent good citizen who has not cost the State or the local authorities a penny during his whole life.  Contrast his position with that of the improvident and imprudent person, the bad citizen, if you like, who over a period of 30 or 40 years has been in and out of jail for beating the police or some other crime against the community, or who may have been in and out of the casual wards of the local institutions, a charge on the local authority or on the national authority in which I include the judiciary, the police, etc.  That man, on attaining the age of 70 years, gets the full State pension.  That is an anomaly which, I think, should be remedied unless you want to put a premium on improvidence and imprudence.  In the case of the decent, honest citizen, simply because he has a pension of 15/- per week, to which during life he contributed, he gets nothing from the State, but the man who has been in and out of jail, and has been a menace to society, he gets the full State pension on reaching the age of 70.  In my view that is a source of scandal that should not be tolerated in any Christian community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the other matter that <Col N="1643" /> I propose to refer to, legislation, I understand, is in existence in the case of the Dublin Corporation employees. In the case of the Cork Corporation, we have ex-employees who have given 10 years' service.  These men were put off quite recently because they were considered to be too old to be effective in their employment.  They were labourers and sweepers&mdash;men usually engaged on the sanitary staff. They have been put off with a paltry allowance of 10/- a week.  All that the State can do for them is to give them 6/- a week.  I do not want to delay the House, but I would ask the Minister to look into this matter with a view to the introduction of legislation at an early date which will regularise the payment of decent pensions to these men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasCarter1921" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time at my disposal I want to ask the Minister kindly to consider the means test as it is applied to old age pensioners and to widows throughout the country.  I could say a great deal about hospitalisation but I have not time to do so now.  Deputy Larkin, senior, made a general appeal on behalf of children which, I thought, was very opportune. I ask the Minister to consider modification of the means test in the case of old people living in labourers' cottages. If one of these aged people works, the investigation officer puts a certain value on that work and that affects the amount of the pension.  If neighbours give these old people milk or butter, the officer places a certain value on such food and as a result the pension may only amount to 5/- weekly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that is going too far, and that people with small holdings of land should not suffer when the means test is being applied.  I know of a case of a man who has not slept in a bed for seven years who has been deprived of the full amount of the pension.  We have a county home in Longford that has been likened to the Black Hole of Calcutta.  No improvement has been made in the condition of that county home.  I consider that these homes are terrible places in which to keep patients.  The nursing staff in Longford <Col N="1644" /> is second to none.  It has been praised on all sides.  We have been trying to have hospitalisation there improved. We have a site for a new hospital now, but the war stopped building.  As there are many old people inmates in the county home, I ask the Minister to look into the matter. When Deputy Mulcahy was Minister for Local Government, he would not allow an <i>x</i>-ray room to be built in the present building, as he intended that a new hospital should be provided. We have not got it yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stapleton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to explain that in Tipperary we are not in sympathy with the managerial system. At the first meeting of the new county council, held in Clonmel, a resolution was passed agreeing to increase the wages of road workers.  The manager approved, and asked the council to include the amount in the new rate to be struck.  The council unanimously included a sum of £5,000 for that purpose. The wages of road workers were increased by 10/- weekly, but that decision was turned down by the manager. Since then, these men are working for the miserable wage of 35/- a week, out of which they have to support a family.  Some other decisions of the council have not met with the approval of the manager.  When members go to meetings of the mental hospital committee, some of them travelling 60 miles to do so, they find that the business on the agenda is formal, and a week later they learn what was done.  They see an account in the Press of the business carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the exigencies of the Parliamentary time-table, which make it necessary for us to have the Appropriation Bill law before the end of November, and the fact that time must be given for its consideration by the other House have rendered it necessary to curtail the debate.  I have listened with very great attention and I may say, speaking as an old member of the House&mdash;I suppose I can describe myself as that&mdash;I have seldom listened to a debate that has been more useful to the Minister and fairer to the Department which he represents.  There were, of course, a number of matters broached in the debate and statements made which, I think, were based upon a misunderstanding of the duties, responsibility and function of the Minister, who, like other Ministers, is there to administer the law as made by the Oireachtas.  If the Oireachtas imposes a means test, it is the duty of the Minister to enforce the means test. If officers fail in their duty, there is an officer appointed by this House, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who can report that fact to the Committee of Public Accounts, and the Minister's officers may be made personally amenable if, in the opinion of the Committee of Public Accounts and the House, they have been in any way lax or disregardful of the law in the expenditure of public money.  Furthermore, it is one of the primary duties of a Minister to this House to see that his officers are in no way lax in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say that because it disposes at once of all the questions raised during the course of the debate which related to the enforcement of the means test in relation to those Acts which I am responsible for administering. I am not primarily responsible for enforcing it in regard to the Old Age Pensions Act.  The primary responsibility for administering that Act rests upon the Revenue Commissioners, though the Minister for Local Government has certain functions, the function of an appeal tribunal, in <Col N="1646" /> relation to that Act.  He is supposed to stand outside the general administration, outside the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners, and, of course, outside the claim of the applicant, and to act as an arbitrator when a dispute arises between the investigation officer of the Revenue Commissioners, on the one hand, and the old age pension committee on the other, or between the applicant and both parties.</P>
    <P>His functions there are those of an honest arbitrator, that is to say, he has to look at the facts.  He does not, of course, deal with them directly.  I am sure the House appreciates that. He appoints an appeal officer who acts on his behalf and exercises his functions for him.  The Minister himself does not exercise any function in regard to the matter.  His function is discharged through his appeal officer, who has to look at the facts as they are.  If the value of agricultural produce has gone up, or if the rent at which land might be let on conacre has appreciated in the market, the Minister's appeal officer is bound by the law of this House and the conditions of his appointment to take these things into account and interpret the facts as he sees them.</P>
    <P>Accordingly it is not, and cannot be, a question of the Minister administering the law loosely, and the House will have to appreciate that fact.  If a Minister or any person charged with responsibility to the House and to the people once begins to administer the law loosely, at that moment, I think, you have the beginning of a system of corruption which would creep in here and eventually bring everything down. Therefore, if I have to observe the provisions of the law, it is because I have to do my duty to the House.  It is not because one wishes to be harsh, or is disregardful of all these other factors put forward by Deputies who are quite free to take them into account and to press home with all the earnestness and sincerity they can command, but simply because the law is there and it is the Minister's duty to give effect to the law.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks I paid a great deal of attention&mdash;a great deal, indeed&mdash;to the County Management <Col N="1647" /> Act.  I did not intend that that should lead to a discussion of the merits of the Act.  The reason I felt it necessary to refer to it was that I was charged with the responsibility of determining when the County Management Act should come into operation.  I am referring to myself in my constitutional capacity, my corporate capacity, as Minister for Local Government, who is the Minister charged with the responsibility of determining when that Act should come into operation.  When I brought it into operation, I was aware that the fact that it was being brought into operation had aroused a great deal of public criticism as to its provisions and as to the way in which it was being interpreted.  Accordingly, I thought that it came within the ambit of what is broadly described as administration, because the manner in which the Act is being interpreted and given effect to by the two principal parties to it&mdash;the elected bodies on the one hand, and the county managers on the other&mdash;is, in my opinion, an expression of local administration.  It is a feature of local administration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave said he felt that I, as Minister, had immersed myself too much in these questions of administration. I should like to say that I regard it as the principal duty, though not by any means the sole duty, of a Minister for Local Government, to see that the local administration of this country reaches and maintains a high standard of efficiency.  After all, what purpose had the Legislature in mind when it said that certain things could be done only with the sanction of the Minister?  That certainly did impose on the Minister the responsibility of seeing that those things which it was proposed to do were wise, beneficial and in the best interests of the community, and were, of course, things which came within the ambit of the local authority and within the power of the local authority to do.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Local Government, therefore, is asked to give sanction to any project&mdash;whether the construction of a hospital, the undertaking of a housing scheme or any of the other activities which a <Col N="1648" /> local body may lawfully undertake&mdash;he has to look at it from the point of view of the community as a whole.  He cannot approach it with any party or any sectional interest in the foreground. He must take into consideration all the local factors, and one of the factors he has to take into consideration, and which I have on occasions stressed in replying to questions here, is the ability of the local community of those who have to provide, in great part, the funds with which the local authority finances its projects and undertakings, to pay.</P>
    <P>We have recognised in the county manager system the fact that the people who are best fitted to undertake that work are naturally the elected bodies, the representatives of the ratepayers, but, as I said at the beginning, and as I mentioned also in my opening address&mdash;this touches on the matter raised by Deputy Fionán Lynch&mdash;I, as Minister for Local Government, have to remember that not merely have the local authorities the power to decide whether or not they should give a county manager the financial supplies which he thinks essential to enable him to maintain the local services, but that the primary purpose for which the local authorities have been constituted is to maintain and provide these local services, and if by any chance they cut off supplies to the county manager, and the local services have to be shut down or are not properly maintained, it is just the equivalent of a revolution in the State. Deputies know that when the Legislature refuses supplies to the Government, it means that either a general election must be held, or, if the matter cannot be settled in that peaceful and amicable way, some other form of arbitration has to be appealed to which, though summary, is not nearly so satisfactory.</P>
    <P>That is why I have to take a very serious view of the refusal of a local authority to provide its manager with sufficient funds.  The fact that I have to take that view of the situation does not in any way abrogate the power of a local authority to control its own finances, provided, of course, that that control is exercised with reason.  If I am faced with the situation in which <Col N="1649" /> the local authority fails to fulfil the obligations which are imposed upon it by law, then I have no option but to exercise the powers which have been vested in me, and which, by reason of the fact that they arc vested in me, impose responsibility upon me, and to take what steps are left to me under the law to ensure that the local services will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I am saying that really in reply to questions which were put to me by Deputy Fionán Lynch, who referred to the position which exists in County Kerry.  There the newly elected council refused to make what was regarded as adequate provision for the maintenance of the roads, the consequences being twofold: the roads have been allowed to deteriorate during the last six or eight months, and a considerable number of men have been thrown out of employment.  It is quite clear that I cannot allow that situation to prevail.  I had to hold a sworn inquiry into the position in County Kerry, and I had to consider the position there.  I realised, of course, that a new county council came in, that they had inherited what was, perhaps, a bad situation, and, like most of us, when we come first into office and have responsibility cast upon us for the first time in that way, were perhaps inclined to take up an attitude which on mature consideration they themselves might think was perhaps in some respects unwise.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to Kerry is this: The county surveyor has had to retire by reason of ill-health, and the road situation there has become so serious that an outside engineer is to make a report on the condition of the roads.  As soon as I have that report from the manager I shall communicate with the county council.  But I must be quite firm as to one aspect of my Departmental responsibility, that is, that I cannot allow these roads, in which considerable sums of ratepayers' and of taxpayers' money have been sunk, to deteriorate and become quite impassable.  We have got to realise that, as the law stands at the moment, it is one of the duties of the local authorities to maintain the roads in their areas, and it is my responsibility to see that they discharge that duty. <Col N="1650" /> I am saying that, not in any dictatorial or authoritative way.  I am merely explaining what the position is so that it will be fully apprehended by all sections of the House.</P>
    <P>As I am on the roads, I should perhaps answer a question put to me by Deputy Hughes.  Deputy Hughes asked me what was the present position of the Road Fund.  The position there, of course, is that the income of the Road Fund has dwindled considerably.  It has gone down from £1,300,000 odd to about £450,000.  I am giving the figures roughly.  The other question which he asked was whether any sums of money had been diverted from the Road Fund&mdash;I am not using the Deputy's words&mdash;to the Central Fund.  The position is that, under the Finance Act of 1942, as passed by this House, this House in its wisdom decided that the sum of £100,000 would be appropriated by the Central Fund from the Road Fund and that sum is being used for the provision of other roads and the maintenance of other roads throughout the country.  The roads in question are these bog development roads which are being made and also the other roads which will be provided by the Minister for Finance and the Office of Public Works&mdash;these link-roads and by-roads which form a new sub-head in the Vote for the Office of Public Works.  I am only mentioning that I have no responsibility for the Office of Public Works, but, as the question was asked, I am merely letting the House know at this stage that this problem of the link-road and by-road and accommodation roads, to which a couple of Deputies referred, is being dealt with by the Office of Public Works and the Minister for Finance under another Vote.  We, in the Department of Local Government, have no responsibility for the maintenance or the construction of these particular roads.</P>
    <P>To revert again to the position of the county managers.  In his speech on this day week, Deputy Davin said that he understood it was my habit to see the county managers once every two months, to summon them to Dublin and to discuss local problems with <Col N="1651" /> them once every two months.  I would like to say that there is no foundation for that statement. When the Act was coming into operation it was thought advisable that, as the county managers appointed to these new positions were going to take on functions which were new to our previous system of local government, they should be summoned to Dublin, that the general problems of the local administration should be discussed with them and that I should outline to them how I thought the new system of local administration should be given effect to.  That interview took place at the latter end of last year, and I have not seen the county managers since.  I have not seen them since for the very good reason that county managers are not the officers of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. They are the responsible executive officers of the local bodies.  They are the officers and servants of the elected bodies and of the communities on whose behalf they act.</P>
    <P>That leads me naturally to this other aspect of the matter.  I do not regard county managers as being in any way superior to the elected bodies. On the contrary, in my view, the elected bodies are the paramount element in local administration.  I am determined&mdash;I mean in no arbitrary way, but so far as my view can influence the operation of this Act&mdash;to make it quite clear to everybody that those who constitute the elected representatives of the ratepayers are of paramount influence in local affairs, in just the same way as this Assembly here is the paramount influence in the government of the nation.  But this Assembly does not want to concern itself with what is happening to this particular civil servant or that particular State employee.  Deputies can put down questions and, if they are not satisfied with the Minister's explanation, they can express their views and opinions in that regard but they do not butt in on his day-to-day management of his Department.  No Deputy does, and I am sure no Deputy would want to, intrude into the general administration of any Government Department.  They know <Col N="1652" /> they can call the Minister to account. They know they can call any officer of the Minister to account through the Minister.  The position is exactly the same in regard to the local authorities. They should hold their county manager responsible to them for the local services, but they should content themselves with that, just the same way as the Dáil is content to hold the Government collectively, and the members of the Government individually, responsible for the proper administration of their Departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the Minister aware that there are such things as reserved functions in the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The reservation is no wider in the case of a county manager than it is, say, in the case of a Minister. I mean, it mainly relates to the control of the staff.  The Minister has control of his staff.  That control is hedged round by certain precedents and traditions.  The county manager is charged with the control of his staff. The control of the staff, of the local authorities is vested in the county manager and, of course, it is hedged round, too, with certain precedents and certain traditions.</P>
      <P>That is just the position of the county manager.  I think it is on all fours with that of the Minister, except that the county manager is, perhaps, much more rigidly subject to the control of the members of the elected authority than, sometimes, Ministers or Governments are subject to that of the elected representatives of the people, because, if the local authority want to give directions to the county manager they can do so without the danger of creating any serious political crises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that some of the statements that were made in the course of this debate, in relation to the functions of county managers, rather astonished me, because they seemed to indicate that the elected members of local authorities, sometimes, were not given an opportunity of meeting the county manager.  Such statements would indicate that those who made them were not familiar with the Act or with the powers that local authorities have.  For instance, it was <Col N="1653" /> stated here that a certain county manager had refused to attend meetings of his county council on two occasions. Well, if the members of that county council had been familiar with Section 30 of the Act they could have seen there, in black and white, that it is made mandatory on the county manager to attend these meetings, when ordered to do so by the county council.  The only thing that might relieve him of that obligation would be that it would be inconsistent with his duties as manager to do so, or that it was not possible for him to attend. Now, I cannot see how any county manager could hold it to be inconsistent with his duties to attend any meeting of the county council which he was ordered to attend.  Of course, there might be certain obstacles, local difficulties which might have to be got over where the manager is acting as manager for two local authorities. Naturally, in such a case, some provision would have to be made to enable him to attend at the various meetings of the two local authorities, but that is a matter for arrangement between the county manager and the members of the local councils concerned, and I am sure that with a certain amount of give-and-take on both sides, that could be easily arranged.</P>
    <P>In relation to this matter of issuing Orders by the managers, so far as public bodies are concerned, it appears to me that we must give a certain amount of reconsideration to that matter.  For that reason, I hoped that this point would be raised during the course of the debate.  That was one of the points I had in mind when I approached this matter, because it was quite clear that the matter of the issuing of General Orders by the county managers, which has been referred to by Deputy Meighan and other Deputies, is one that requires further consideration. I think that, in relation to that matter, we have found a reasonable compromise in the case of County Roscommon.  A county manager must arrange for certain things to be done by Order; some of these might be concerned with quite trivial matters and, with the present restrictions on paper and printing, I feel that it would be unnecessary to <Col N="1654" /> have all these Orders printed and circulated to all the members of the local authority concerned.  It seems to me that if we were to decide that, notwithstanding the difficulties to which I have referred, the county manager would have to refer all such matters to each member of the county council, the first people to rebel in that connection would be the members of the local authority themselves, because they would be snowed under with a whole avalanche of matters of one sort or another, trivial and otherwise. However, notwithstanding those difficulties, I realise that the members of a county council would like to know what the county manager was doing, and I think that desire has been reasonably met in the case of the Roscommon County Council.  In that case, the representatives of the local papers are called together and told what orders he has made and a synopsis of the orders is then published as news in the papers.  I realise, of course, that that is not quite the official way of going about these things, but in the circumstances prevailing now, I think that that system might be reasonably adopted elsewhere.</P>

I cannot see how it is objectionable that such Orders should receive any wider publication through the medium of the public Press.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, again, let us be quite clear on this point.  The county manager is not my officer; he is the officer of the local authority concerned.  If members of county councils have studied the Act, they should realise that they can enforce the manager's compliance with their requests.  If I were a county manager, I should do everything possible to satisfy every reasonable demand which was made by the elected body that I serve, and I would use all reasonable means to meet their demands.  In saying that, I am leading up to what, I think, is the main difficulty in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say that he, as Minister for Local Government and Public Health, is the person who decides whether or not county managers should circulate these Orders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to detract from the powers that are given to county councils, but, quite obviously, if the circulating of these Orders is going to lead to an unnecessary spate of printing, it would be unreasonable to ask that that should be done, in view of our present difficulties in the matter and the scarcity of paper.  I do think, however, that if I were a county manager, I would certainly go to the limits of my own personal time and that of my staff to ensure that no member of an elected body would have the opportunity of saying that he did not know what the county manager was doing.  That is my personal view of what I would do, if I were a county manager, but I am not saying that this view is mandatory on these managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I hope that the county managers, as well as Deputies of this House, will read this.  I say that it is largely a matter of temperament, and I am convinced, as I have said, that with a certain amount of give-and-take on both sides, this matter can be arranged to the mutual satisfaction of everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not overlook in that regard the fact that we have had to put into <Col N="1656" /> these positions as county managers men who had no previous experience in that position.  Most of them had experience as secretaries of local authorities and boards of assistance, but there has not been built up behind this system the tradition that exists in the Civil Service of knowing where to draw the line in relation to a number of matters.  Of course, in a certain number of instances we have probably square pegs in round holes.  It is very largely a matter of the personality of the manager.</P>
    <P>We have heard in the course of discussion very conflicting views about the operation of the Act.  We have had it condemned root and branch by some Deputies.  Then we have heard other Deputies getting up, such as Deputy Broderick.  I think he made a very good speech and perhaps made his case against the Act all the stronger by the manner in which he dealt with it, but he certainly did express great satisfaction with his own county manager.  He did indicate that, so far as the control of policy and major matters were concerned, the sort of thing which should be the sole pre-occupation of the elected bodies, he had nothing whatever to complain of.  The county manager sat in and discussed all major questions with his county council and, I suppose, as a result, they hammered out a policy in relation to these matters which was satisfactory to everybody concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pursuing a certain train of thought, and I should like if Deputy Corry would allow me to continue it.  I have said that it is largely a question of personality, of getting the right person for this post. I think that by the exercise of certain qualities the county manager should be <Col N="1657" /> able to make the system work.  It has worked in some counties, as we have heard.  We have heard the eulogistic terms in which Deputies Broderick and Corry&mdash;two Deputies who seldom agree in this House except in advancing the interests of Cork, and then an unseemly rivalry to despoil the rest of the community for the sake of Cork and Youghal appears to animate them &mdash;have spoken of the Act.  I have no doubt whatever that it is simply a case of getting the right man to make the Act work, and I say to county managers that, so far as the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is concerned, he will certainly attach a great deal of importance to the fact of whether or not they are able to make the Act work.</P>
      <P>The question of the collection of rates was referred to by one or two Deputies&mdash;I think by Deputy Donnellan and Deputy Meighan and Deputy Beirne of Roscommon.  The position is that the first moiety of the rate falls due on the day on which the rate is struck.  The second moiety falls due, as everybody knows, on the 1st October.  These are the statutory dates, and we have no power to vary them, but I do feel again that rate collectors, like county managers, can be reasonable people, and that they will take the circumstances of every case into consideration.  I am having the matter which Deputy Beirne referred to in this connection investigated, but I cannot at this stage commit myself to any statement about it. Again I say that I am perfectly certain that these temporary difficulties of ratepayers can be adjusted in a spirit of reason by the rate collectors and the county managers; but this point must be borne in mind: the rates must be paid within the 12 months.  If they are not paid within 12 months, if one person gets away with it, a very serious situation might ensue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the position in County Dublin when one person got away with it, a second person got away with it and, ultimately, we had arrears in County Dublin amounting to over £200,000.  Of course the whole finances of the county got into a condition of chaos as a result.  As soon as the county commissioner was put in <Col N="1658" /> charge in the county and a reasonable attempt was made to collect the arrears in a reasonable way, at once the position began to improve to the benefit and advantage of everybody, with the consequence that in certain areas a reduction as high as 7/- in the £ was granted last year as compared with 1941.  We want to be fair but, at the same time, one of the things at which we aim is to keep the finances of local authorities on a satisfactory basis.</P>
    <P>There is a number of factors which make the prompt payment of rates of real advantage.  I do not think, as far as the great majority of agriculturists are concerned, at any rate, that at this particular time they can have much difficulty in meeting the demands of the rate collectors, certainly not as much difficulty as those who have to live in urban districts. In any event, whether there is difficulty or not, if the people want local services upon the scale in which they have been advocated here in this House, the people will have to pay for them.  No one else can pay.  If local authorities and representatives of local communities want hospitals, water supplies, tuberculosis schemes and all these services upon the scale which has been outlined here in the course of this debate, they will have to be paid for and they can only be paid for if the local rates are collected. We may give a man in distressed circumstances a certain amount of time to pay but it can be only a limited time.  Ultimately the rates must be collected or if not the machinery which is in existence, to deal with rate defaulters will have to be put into operation.  I think most people who have had the experience of the ratepayers in County Dublin will say that it is to the benefit and advantage of everyone that people should pay their rates promptly.  It is not the sort of thing which one likes to do.  When you have to pay your rates, just as when you have to pay your income-tax, you do not feel that you are getting very much for them, but everybody must realise that the maintenance of amenities built up around local administration depends on the prompt collection of the <Col N="1659" /> rates.  We shall have to try to inculcate by gentle pressure that principle into the minds of ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister make a recommendation that the time might be extended?  There was never any question of not paying rates, but the time might be extended.  The rate collector takes half a year's rates up to the 29th September and will not take less than a year's rates from the 1st October.</P>

      <P>The position in regard to the roads was referred to and the suggestion was made that we should try to do something to make them more easily negotiable by horse traffic.  That is a problem which has been given a great deal of consideration by the Roads Section of the Department of Local Government and Public Health. I have been pressing it myself when I was in opposition, and I have been pressing it, at the instance of my constituents, when I was in other Departments, and also I have been pressing it since I became Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  The problem is a very difficult one, and one which has not been solved anywhere.  Two suggestions have been made in relation to it. First of all, there is the suggestion that we should leave a margin at the side of the road which would be waterbound.  The trouble is that, if it is waterbound macadam, it does not stand up to the strain of modern traffic, which cannot keep always on the hard centre of the road but will tend to diverge to the side.  Then that portion of the road is cut up and an unevenness, a step, is built up between the hard and softer surfaces, which is dangerous to wheeled traffic of all descriptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> The difficulty in relation to the proposal to sprinkle sand is that, sand being an abrasive, it speedily cuts up the waterbound surface of the road and causes increased wear and tear. Our present position is that we are short, not merely of money but of materials and essential road equipment. We cannot take any liberties with the present roads: we have to try to keep them even as they are, in order that they may not become any worse.  I cannot be very hopeful in relation to this matter, but I can say that we are keeping it under continuous review.  Every suggestion that appears in the technical Press for solving this particular problem is carefully examined in the Department, and in roads projects which we have under consideration we are considering whether it would be possible to provide a separate strip for horse traffic, particularly meant for horse-drawn vehicles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seldom reproved for talking in a mild and gentle way, but I will try to elevate my voice for the convenience of the Deputy.  Among the questions which were raised in the Local Government section of the Estimate was the position of the county councils in relation to the overdrafts which they had secured for the purpose of financing turf production.  The position there is as I explained in my opening statement.  First of all, I want to emphasise that the guarantee does not apply to all turf produced by the county councils but only to that produced for export.  So far as county councils produce turf for their own needs, the overdraft does not apply.  It is their responsibility to see that they produce turf as economically as possible, and it is their responsibility to provide their own supplies of fuel.  So far as they provide turf for export from the turf-producing areas, provided there has not been absolute carelessness in its production and that there has not been absolute waste, the county council is guaranteed against loss on the turf production overdraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other question, as to whether there can be an extension of the turf scheme, I am not in a position to speak.  All I have is a certain limited amount of money to provide turf for necessitous families in non-turf areas and I can only administer that scheme as best I can.  I do not propose, and do not think it necessary for me, to touch upon one or two of the points raised by Deputy Corry in that regard. All I can say is that we have to bear in mind, in relation to this, that the <Col N="1662" /> grant given to enable home assistance authorities to give special allowances in the way of food vouchers and the grant which has been made to certain other authorities to enable them to supply fuel for necessitous families, do not relieve the boards of assistance or the home assistance authorities of the obligation imposed on them by law to relieve distress in their areas.  If the county council or other local authority chooses to make conditions and refuses to accept the grant given to them out of the Exchequer, it does not save them money and will not do so in the long run, because they are bound to give that relief in one form or another.  There is no wisdom in the county council rejecting a grant for turf, as I think was done in one area.</P>

      <P>The point was raised by Deputy O'Sullivan as to when I proposed to re-constitute the Dublin Board of Assistance.  The position there is that I was compelled to dissolve the board of assistance and entrust the management of its affairs to a body of commissioners, for a number of reasons, the first being that the inquiry which I held disclosed a number of irregularities in the administration of the institution and of home assistance generally which, I thought, warranted me in taking the step I took.</P>
      <P>That was why the Dublin Board of Assistance was dissolved.  In dissolving the board of assistance and appointing commissioners, I took advantage of the opportunity to ask the commissioners to carry through reorganisation of the whole system of administering public assistance here, and to investigate and report to me what would be in the future the most suitable system of public assistance administration for the City of Dublin.  In that connection we have to remember that the system in operation here grew up out of a system of parish relief, that it had at least 100 years' accretion of anomalies behind it, and that the circumstances in which public assistance is necessary and can be distributed in a great city such as Dublin are very different now to the circumstances that prevailed when the system was first instituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until the commissioners have completed the reorganisation of the institution, and particularly the reorganisation of the hospital services attached to the institution, and until they have investigated and reported to me as to the improvements and changes which ought to be made in administering public relief in Dublin, I will not be in a position to reconstitute the board of assistance, or any board of assistance. I may say the whole question of the reconstruction of the board of assistance is bound up with the reorganisation of the administration of Dublin City and of the county; they will have <Col N="1664" /> to be dovetailed into each other, and it is, perhaps, advantageous, with the need for that reorganisation existing, that we should have both the city and county administered by commissioners at the present time.  It is not, of course, the intention to keep that system permanently there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

I feel that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputy Broderick and Deputy Corry have been rather unjust to the Minister for Local Government in relation to the construction of the Youghal bridge.  The existing bridge was built under an Act which dates from 1838, an antique Act, which prescribes a very cumbersome machinery, machinery which, with the changes in the constitution of local authorities that have taken place, could not possibly be put into operation now.  In order to short-circuit the Act, and pending the legislation necessary to enable the <Col N="1665" /> planning and construction of the bridge to be proceeded with, I indicated that the Cork County Council and the Waterford County Council should come together in an amicable and reasonable way and arrange for the procuring of the engineering advice which will be necessary to enable the position of the bridge to be determined and plans prepared so that, when the time comes, we will be prepared to amend the law and enable the construction of the bridge to proceed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Corry wants the bridge to be built or not, but we are prepared to short-circuit the whole of this complicated and tedious procedure and enable the authorities concerned to proceed with the work which is an essential preliminary to the construction of the bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to what Deputy Broderick said about the location of the bridge, we have no views one way or the other, but it is only natural&mdash; and any person with a knowledge of engineering problems will realise it&mdash; that changes may have taken place in the bed of the river and in the approaches to the bridge; physical changes may take place in the neighbourhood, and most certainly there have been changes in the traffic which the bridge will have to carry.  One must consider the load a bridge will be asked to bear under present conditions, and one must also consider the changes in the matter of bridge construction. Again, one particular site may be well adapted to one method of bridge construction, and another site may be better adapted to another form of bridge construction.  It is quite obvious to any person that there must be some such changes and, if you are going to build a new bridge of this magnitude&mdash;it will cost a very considerable sum, well over £100,000&mdash;it is only prudent that you should have an engineering survey made and that the site of the bridge should be determined, <Col N="1666" /> not by the personal predilections of this or that inhabitant or the majority of them, but by engineering and economic considerations.</P>
    <P>The bridge will be designed, of course, to meet the requirements very largely of the local people and, therefore, their views will have to be taken into consideration&mdash;and I am perfectly certain they will be.  I do not think any competent engineer is going to place a bridge except where the people who will use it will get the maximum advantages from it, provided it is a practical proposition from an engineering point of view to site the bridge there.  Therefore, I do not think Deputy Broderick was quite reasonable in the attitude he took up.  I do hope he is not speaking for either public body concerned with this matter for, if he is, we will make no progress with the construction of the bridge and I presume, as usual, the Department of Local Government will be made the scapegoat for the inevitable delay.</P>
    <P>Turning to the public health side of the Department, I feel I must express my gratitude for the kind things which have been said.  I would be doing less than my duty if I did not say that a great deal of the zeal and devotion which the Department has manifested in dealing with public health problems, is entirely due to the splendid services rendered by my loyal colleague and friend, Deputy Ward.</P>
    <P>In these public health matters I speak purely as a layman and I am aware that he could deal with them. much more competently than I.  On the subject of tuberculosis, a rather regrettable reference was made by Deputy Liam Cosgrave to the fact that the position of chief medical officer had not been filled.  I am sorry that the Deputy should have stated that the reason that it had not been filled was due to jobbery.  I am sure, on reconsideration, he will see that even the facts he put to the House&mdash;and they were not the full facts&mdash;will at once disprove any suggestion of jobbery. If you are going to make a job, it means that you have a post in which you want to place a man unfit for that post, but you do not keep that post vacant for a year, or two years, or <Col N="1667" /> any very great length of time, once the vacancy occurs.  I can assure the House that the reason the post of chief medical officer is unfilled is because my colleague in the Department, my advisers and I realise that the term &ldquo;public health&rdquo; has a new connotation.  It is concerned not merely with water supplies and sewer age schemes but with a wide field of preventive medicine, and we are anxious to get a man who will be in the first place a medical adviser.  The qualifications which have been agreed between the Civil Service Commissioners and ourselves are such as to ensure that the person we shall get will not be a mere administrator.  That is not the type of person we want.  We want a person who will be competent to advise us in regard to every medical problem with which the Public Health Department has to deal.  He need not be an expert in all of them, but he must be generally equipped to consider competently expert advice when necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, would the Minister give the House some indication of the difficulties with which he was confronted in finding a suitable person for the post?  I should be prepared to accept that explanation.  What was the lack of qualification in the candidates who were examined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not examine them.  The Civil Service Commissioners make these appointments and they reported that they had not secured a candidate who measured up to our standard.  It may be that, having regard to the remuneration we are offering, our standard has been fixed too high.  I feel, however, that it is far better we should have no adviser than that we should have the wrong man in this job.  From the point of view of public health, this is the most important position in the country and I am only sorry that the limitations imposed upon us by the ordinary standards of Civil Service remuneration make it very difficult for us to get a man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no regulation delaying the appointment but we have fixed certain qualifications for the post.  We want a man who has those qualifications because we do not think that any other man is likely to be of service to us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to discuss that matter but, if the Deputy looks at the remuneration we are able to offer, he will appreciate why it is difficult to get a man.  That difficulty may be adjusted in the near future and we may be able once again to look for a man but upon more attractive terms.</P>
      <P>A great deal of this debate was concerned with tuberculosis and its prevention. With a great deal of what was said I have the fullest sympathy. We have been very disappointed that, in the year 1942&mdash;the year under review&mdash;the mortality from that disease increased by no less than 630 and that there were almost 900 more deaths than there were in the year 1939.  That represents the substantial increase of over 30 per cent. and it is a matter of great concern to us in the Department and to the House.  While I appreciate the encouragement the House has given the Minister to go ahead and try to deal with this scourge, I should have wished that it were not given in terms so unmeasured because, after all, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is not a magician.  He has not a magic wand with which to cure all diseases.  We cannot provide institutional treatment without bricks and without money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot, in approaching this problem, take the view that money does not matter.  We have not got the money for everything for which money is asked.  We have to ration the resources of the community over a considerable number of objects.  Education has to be looked after; so have children's allowances, widows' and orphans' pensions, and old age pensions.  We have to defend the country, provide for the enforcing of the law, and for the collection <Col N="1669" /> of taxes.  Each and every one of these activities makes a demand upon the public purse.  I should like to think that we had unlimited funds at our disposal to attack this problem, but I do not see any probability of that.  Even if we had the funds at present, we should, certainly, find ourselves in a very difficult position in regard to building materials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that.  I cannot approach this problem with the dash with which some Deputies think it should be tackled. We have, all the time, to bear in mind that every penny we take into the public purse is taken out of the purse of the private citizen.  The money we spend on combating tuberculosis, hospitalisation, education and every other public purpose is collected from the taxpayers, and not merely from the rich taxpayers, but from the poor taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>You forgot to mention the poor railway shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They have also lost a fair amount.  The Deputy was not here in 1934 when we carried through a forcible reduction of the railway shareholders' capital.  However, that is outside my bailiwick.  Deputy Larkin will have an opportunity of addressing himself to that question on another occasion.  I am merely pointing out that public moneys are derived from taxation, and that taxation is spread over a number of objects.  Very considerable sums are secured from the income-tax, but the greater part of the revenue is derived from indirect taxation, in one form or another, which has to be paid by everybody&mdash;rich and poor alike.  When we are making these demands on the Exchequer, we have to balance two evils&mdash;whether we are going to make food dearer so as to provide sufficient food for those who may be infected by tuberculosis, and whether we are going to make houses dearer to provide hospitals.  If we are to have building materials for hospitals we must, in present circumstances, make up our minds to forgo the building of a certain number of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the dilemma which I have to <Col N="1670" /> face and which the House has to face with me.  Between us, we have to hammer out a reasonable approach to this problem and see how much we can do.  By all means, let us spend as much as we possibly can afford.</P>
    <P>In connection with that, may I repeat what I said in my opening speech &mdash;that the problem is not one which is capable of any facile solution?  We have heard of malnutrition, shortage of essential foods like milk and butter. overcrowding and undue exertion.  It is quite true that lack of proper food or of proper housing will aggravate this disease, as it aggravates every disease, and renders recovery from it less probable.  As a layman, however, I do not believe that the problem of tuberculosis can be explained wholly in terms of lack of certain foods or overcrowding or undue physical exertion.</P>
    <P>As against our history and the record of our own country in 1942, I want to contrast it with the contrary position in Great Britain.  In Great Britain they had a sudden and very marked increase, in mortality from tuberculosis in the years 1939 to 1941, but since then there has been a decline.  No person is going to say that they are not as badly off as the general mass of our people for protective foods like milk and butter, that in certain of their areas the difficulties of life and over-crowding are not much more pronounced than they are here, and that their population as a whole is not working under a much severer physical strain.  Yet, there you have this remarkable fact.  Here, where our conditions appear to be easier, mortality from the disease has been increasing since 1939.  There was a slight decline in the year 1941, and then there was a sudden rise again until, as I have said, in the year 1942 we had 600 more deaths than in 1941, and 900 more deaths than in the year 1939.  In Great Britain, on the other hand, there has been a very marked decline in the mortality from the disease since 1941.  Now there is some factor&mdash;we do not know what it is&mdash;but it is quite clear that, as I have said, there is some factor here that we have not yet been able to ascertain. When you contrast the conditions in <Col N="1671" /> the two countries, they do indicate that this disease is not merely a question of more milk, more butter and better housing&mdash;all these things will help to curb it&mdash;but there is some other factor which will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>I have already kept the House too long, but before concluding I want to deal with one or two assertions made by Deputy Martin O'Sullivan in relation to the procrastination and delay for which, he said, the Department of Local Government was responsible in connection with the building of the new Dublin fever hospital and the building of the new Dublin sanatorium.  I am not going to deal with that at any length now, but I can say this: that if ever the action of the Department in relation to either of these matters is under review in this House it will be seen that we have not been responsible for undue delay in relation to either of these sites.  If there is any person who wishes to get further information on the matter, he should read the speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary to my Department on March last in the Seanad, in which the Parliamentary Secretary set out the history of the negotiations undertaken in relation to the new fever hospital for Dublin.  If any person does that, I think he will agree with me that the Department did try to do its duty to the other people who have claims on the Hospitals Trust Fund, because, after all, the Minister for Local Government is responsible for the proper administration of the Hospitals Trust Fund.  Remember it is a trust fund upon which there are many claimants. The Cork Street Fever Hospital is only one of a considerable number of such, and we had to ensure that in the administration and distribution of those funds that, whenever a proposal comes before us asking for a grant from those funds, it will be a sound proposal, that it will not be unduly ambitious in its scope, and that it will not involve unnecessary expense in design or construction. That is all we did in relation to the Cork Street Fever Hospital.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the increase <Col N="1672" /> of rickets in the City of Dublin and asked what we have been doing in relation to the extraction of wheat for flour.  It was suggested that the disturbance of calcium metabolism from the use of the 100 per cent. extraction of flour has been responsible for the spread of the disease.  I should say in regard to that matter that it is a highly technical one.  It was referred to the Medical Research Council some time ago for examination in all its bearings, and I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the council for the well-balanced and exceedingly valuable report which they have placed at my disposal.</P>
    <P>I may say that the report is at present receiving the active consideration of the Government, and that a decision will be arrived at in due course.  It would appear to be generally agreed that, if the wheat supply position would permit of a reduced extraction without at the same time bringing about a serious shortage of bread, it would, from many points of view, be desirable to make a reduction, but Deputies will, I am sure, appreciate that in the circumstances of the present time that is not a decision which can be lightly taken.</P>
    <P>I should say, however, in relation to this matter that the Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned to me that perhaps the lack of sunshine and the serious shortage of transport experienced during the summers of 1941, 1942 and 1943 may have had a great deal to say to the spread of rickets.  Sunshine, I gather, is the least expensive and a most valuable source of Vitamin D, which has a great deal to do with this question of calcium absorption.  I am speaking on this as a lay-man and want to suggest to Deputy Dillon that it is not merely a case of the 100 per cent. extraction.  There may be these other factors, all of which goes to show how difficult are the problems with which my Department has to deal at the present time.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the nurses, again that is a matter which has been under review for a considerable time in the Department.  It is a very complex one because nurses are not like an organised body of public servants.  A number of them are <Col N="1673" /> employed by public authorities, and, so far as they are concerned, their conditions are capable of reasonable amelioration.  In their cases I do not think the pension problem arises there in an acute form.  The great majority of nurses, however, are not the servants of local authorities.  They are largely employed by private persons.  A considerable number of them are employed in voluntary hospitals, but do not remain in them permanently.  They go out and engage in their profession, very largely at the instance of private employers who may have to retain their services.  That fact makes it very difficult indeed for us to regulate the profession in any way, and particularly difficult to evolve any practicable pension scheme for them.</P>
    <P>I met the nurses recently.  We put the difficulties before them and indicated that we were prepared to give them any help which would be required in collecting information to draft a scheme, and that when the scheme was drafted we would be prepared to consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We lay it down as a general rule that the hours for nurses should not be longer than 96 hours in 14 days.  A number of cases have been mentioned.  Deputy Norton mentioned the case of a nurse who said that she was on duty for 84 hours a week, most of it night duty.  I wonder was that nurse employed in a hospital?</P>

If Deputy Larkin has any information on that matter I should be glad to have it.  I was dealing with a case cited by Deputy Norton, of a nurse who had written to him from the west of Ireland saying that she was working 84 hours a week. I think that is probably applicable to work in fever hospitals.  There, the hours of duty, though long, are very often nominal.</P>

      <P>I have been dealing with that.  I pointed out what the difficulties were.  It is going to be very difficult to regulate conditions there. Regarding Longford County Home I am sure Deputy Carter is aware of the fact that the responsibility for the condition of the Home rests on the Longford local authorities.  Perhaps now that there is a county manager we may get something done in relation to it.  I agree with the Deputy that conditions in the county home and in the hospital are deplorable, but in the present difficult times I do not know if any change can be made.  As to the matters to which Deputy Larkin referred, I will give them my attention. What he said in relation to baby farming will be examined.  As I stated at the outset, the debate has been very helpful to the Parliamentary Secretary and myself.  I have a mass of material relating to it and when we get the full report it will occupy the attention of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look into that. The Deputy has stressed the humanitarian manner in which the committees concerned with these hospitals approach their problems.  We have all a responsibility and must see to it that helpless people do not suffer and that those attending on them are properly qualified.  There is the problem about the conditions governing the appointments of head attendants in these hospitals which is difficult to deal with.  Deputies know how that service has grown up.  Our duty is to <Col N="1675" /> improve the standard and when that standard is raised it is bound to hurt somebody.  That is the trouble.  There will be always hard cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I explained that we cannot proceed with the work, as a local authority, unless there is recommendation from the Department. That is the position as the law stands. The Minister's reply indicated that the Department regarded the present law as obsolete and that the Department was considering new legislation. No matter what the disposition of the county councils may be they cannot proceed while the law remains as it is. The bridge has been destroyed.  Can the councils proceed now?</P>

      <P>On the understanding, therefore, that the Road Fund is not in any way committed, I would be willing to consider proposals for the preparation of plans for the erection of a new bridge.  It would be necessary, however, that definite assurances should be given by the councils concerned that they will be prepared to <Col N="1676" /> pay the costs incidental to the making of preliminary surveys, and the preparation of plans, which will amount probably to over £10,000.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past 12 months, because of the alteration in the basis of ascertaining the actuarial solvency of the fund, additional sums of money were made available, in the <Col N="1679" /> form of additional benefits, and these additional benefits made some contribution towards relieving the plight of afflicted persons who, owing to illness, had occasion to abandon their employment temporarily.  I do not know if anybody can pretend that our present National Health Insurance code is satisfactory or in any way comprehensive. At best it is piece meal while the financial benefits made available to sick persons are very far from satisfactory. The House will be aware of the fact that men in employment who earn £3 10s. 0d. or £4 0s. 0d. a week on being stricken by illness have then to depend on 15/- weekly National Health Insurance benefit.  They receive no additional allowance in respect of wives or families.  If there is one child or six children 15/- is the maximum sum allowed under the Act.  That is all that is allowed whether a man normally earns £1 or £4.  It is generally agreed in cases of illness that the liability of sick persons is increased considerably.  I should like a statement from the Minister as to whether the Department has under consideration any proposals for examining the whole financial and benefit structure of the National Health Insurance Act, with a view to evolving a scheme much more related to the financial needs of workers stricken by illness.  I know that the scheme is one which requires a fairly comprehensive examination, but it is an examination which ought to take place without undue delay, and I should like to hear from the Minister whether his Department has any proposals for proceeding with an examination of that kind.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Norton himself has informed the House, it was only quite recently that the finances of the National Health.  Insurance Society were the subject of an exhaustive review and examination by an actuary, and subsequently by the Department, and the House, in 1941, passed legislation which set free a considerable sum of money for the provision of new benefits.  The committee of management of the society could have applied that money to other <Col N="1680" /> purposes than those to which they chose to apply it.  A number of heads were laid down and they, as acting on behalf of the members of the society, decided to apply it in a certain way. We have agreed that the money shall be applied in that way, and I do not think it is practicable at this stage to have any review of the existing insurance code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>A question, Sir.  Does the Minister realise that a payment of 15/- per week to a person suffering, for instance, from tuberculosis is an inadequate payment?  There is no use in telling a person suffering from tuberculosis that if his eyesight were bad, he would get glasses, or that, if his teeth were bad, they would be extracted.  He has no toothache and has not got bad sight.  He has infection of both lungs, and what he is concerned to know is how much he will get if he is stricken with tuberculosis, and not what he will get if he happens to have toothache.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but it is an involved scheme of national health insurance, because it is neither national nor healthy.  Would the Minister take into consideration the fact that the main problem in the matter is the provision of some substantial weekly allowance for a sick person? That problem has not been dealt with by the society or by the Department.</P>
