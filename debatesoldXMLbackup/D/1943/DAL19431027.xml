      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether steps have been taken to consider the formulation of plans and proposals for economic development and reconstruction after the war; whether any committee or other body has been set up for that purpose, and, if so, whether he will state the names of the persons appointed to such committee or body.</P>

      <P>Under instructions from the Government all Government Departments and certain statutory bodies such as the Electricity Supply Board and the Irish Tourist Board have, for a considerable time past, been giving urgent attention to the preparation of plans for post-war economic development and reconstruction and to the taking of such preliminary measures as are feasible in present circumstances so that approved plans can be carried into effect with the minimum delay when the emergency terminates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Committee of the Cabinet consisting of the Taoiseach and the Ministers <Col N="1130" /> for Finance and Industry and Commerce and Supplies which was set up in November last keeps under observation the progress made by the Departments in formulating proposals for post-war activities and makes suggestions as to steps which might be taken to expedite planning and the carrying out of preparatory work in existing conditions.  Other Ministers are brought into consultation by the Committee as circumstances require.</P>
    <P>In the case of agriculture, a Committee with wide terms of reference under the chairmanship of Professor T.A. Smiddy is engaged in the consideration of post-war policy.  The members of the Committee are:&mdash;Mr. R. C. Barton, Professor C. Boyle, University College, Cork; Professor J. C. Drew, University College, Dublin; Professor J. Johnston, Trinity College, Dublin; Dr. Henry Kennedy, Irish Agricultural Organisation Society Ltd.; Professor E. J. Sheehy, University College, Dublin; Mr. J.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that there are some small breaches in the embankment of the River Finn which have caused flooding of arable land; that these have been inspected, and that farm drainage grants are held up in the area pending a grant to repair the breaches, and whether there is any possibility of something being done immediately in view of the minor character of the work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Applications have been made in recent months for a grant under minor employment schemes for the repair of breaches in the River Finn embankment. On investigation it was found that the type of work involved is outside the scope of minor employment schemes.  There are no other funds available from which a grant might be sanctioned for the work.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that about 100 acres of arable land are affected?  In the event of the 37½ per cent. tillage, prescribed to be done under the Tillage Order, being damaged by floods, will the Parliamentary Secretary say if the State will bear the cost?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I am sure that as one of the representatives of Dublin City, he is aware of the importance of this question to the citizens in general. Would he say if an extra half-hour in the morning or a half-hour in the evening would involve tremendous <Col N="1134" /> commitments so far as the gas company is concerned?  Is there any possibility, having regard to the time restriction, that at least an extension of the kind suggested could be granted without seriously upsetting the present arrangement?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that the shortage of bacon is so acute that the majority of persons in the country have been unable to purchase it for a number of months past; and in view of this fact if he will state why he has refused shipping space for the importation of bacon and hogs' fat from Portugal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  I am not prepared to grant space on Irish ships for the importation of bacon from Portugal while there are more essential goods available for shipment.  Shipping space was refused for hogs' fat as it was clear from information available to the Department of Supplies that supplies of this commodity would not be released for shipment from abroad to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that the Drogheda Corporation Gas Department is in a precarious condition because of its inability to obtain a supply of coal for the undertaking, and whether in order to obviate a suspension of the gas services of Drogheda, he is prepared to make representations to the British Coal Control with a view to obtaining release of the quantity of coal required to enable Drogheda Corporation to carry on its gas services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties being experienced by the Drogheda Corporation Gas Department are not peculiar <Col N="1135" /> to that undertaking.  The quantity of gas coal at present being made available to this country is only a fraction of the normal importation, and the Drogheda Gas Works are receiving their proportionate share of the available supplies.  They are also receiving the same facilities from my Department for the purchase of other classes of coal to supplement their gas coal allocation as other gas undertakings. In the circumstances, I am not prepared to make special representations to the United Kingdom authorities with a view to the provision of exceptional facilities for the Drogheda Corporation Gas Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Have any representations been made on behalf of a certain number of these smaller gas companies? It appears that the company in Dublin gets more benefit from the arrangements made at present than the smaller companies.  We are not asking for anything for Drogheda especially, but for a number of these smaller undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>It has been represented to my Department that consumers are experiencing difficulty in obtaining turf in some parts of the County Wexford. Adequate supplies of turf are, however, available for distribution by the merchants and any difficulty experienced by consumers must be attributed to the failure of licensed fuel merchants to purchase turf to meet their customers' requirements.

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if supplies of drying coal will be made available to corn millers in Cavan whose kilns are not suitable to dry the grain with turf; and, also, if permits to purchase coal will be granted to millers whose kilns are suitable, but who live long distances from bogs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that in so far as the small millers are concerned kiln drying of grain before processing is unnecessary, except in the case of oats intended for conversion into oatmeal for human consumption.  I will be prepared to entertain applications for permits to purchase coal for the latter purpose from corn millers in Cavan as well as in other parts of the scheduled turf area but only if it can be satisfactorily established that the use of turf is impracticable.  In the present difficult situation in respect of coal supplies, permits to purchase coal cannot be granted to millers whose kilns are suitable for the use of turf. Any miller who is unable to secure supplies of turf through his own efforts will be put in touch with a suitable source of supply in his neighbourhood if he reports his difficulty to my Department.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that considerable quantities of grain due to the wet season are rapidly deteriorating in quality because of lack of kiln-drying facilities, and that it is a serious matter from the point of <Col N="1138" /> view of feeding live stock?  Is he also aware that he has made provision for the drying of oats for the purpose of oatmeal manufacture for resale, and has refused to provide coal for the manufacture of oatmeal on commission? Will he say why he differentiates, in the matter of providing coal, between the conversion of oats into oatmeal for the producer and the production of oatmeal for resale?</P>

I know cases in my own constituency last year of millers who got more coal than they required, and who returned their permits without having fully exhausted their allocations, while this year they are not getting half enough.  They tell me and other Deputies in the constituency that it will be impossible for them to attend to the requirements of the farmers for whom they grind on commission.</P>

      <P>The Minister said my statement was not correct.  I have a letter from his Department which proves that it is correct, in which it is stated that coal is provided for the drying of oats for the production of oatmeal for resale and refused for the drying of oats for the production of oatmeal on commission.

Where oats is being processed for oatmeal, drying is necessary and coal is provided, if it is established that no other fuel can be used.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the profits earned by the Dublin United Transport Company and the heavy financial burden in the form of bus fares on working-class families living in municipal housing schemes in the outer Dublin suburbs, he will make representations to the Dublin United Transport Company on the urgent need of providing special cheap fares for work people, and school children, who are under the necessity of travelling to and from such housing schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the increased costs of operation and the drastic reductions in the matter of operation of services, the Dublin United Transport Company have not increased fares during the emergency, and the present fares are very much below the existing statutory maximum.  I understand that the company have under consideration proposals for general reductions in fares to come into operation whenever normal services can be restored.  In these circumstances and having regard to the uncertainty of maintaining the company's services even at their present restricted level, I am not prepared to press the company in the matter of reduced fares at the present time.</P>
      <P>Children under 15 years of age are already entitled to travel at half fares on the services of the D.U.T. Company and I am not disposed to make any recommendation to the company for further reductions in such fares.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, according to the published <Col N="1140" /> reports of this company, its profits increased from £60,000 in 1938 to £271,000 last year, and that, in relation to its housing schemes, one of the vital problems affecting the Dublin Corporation is that, in addition to the rent, the tenants have to pay heavy bus fares, and, as a result, are cutting down on essential foods?  It has been recognised by many authorities over a long period that there should be cheap transport facilities for the people who are compelled to leave condemned houses in the city and to go to live in the outer suburbs, and if it is possible to make practical suggestions which would not increase the number of passengers to be carried but would merely reduce the financial burden on these tenants, would the Minister consider the matter sympathetically in principle ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fares from the new housing areas were reduced in 1939, and have not been increased since.  I do not think the present is a suitable time in which to consider any general recasting of the company's charging system, because it is impossible to be certain, even a month ahead, that existing services can be maintained.  It is contemplated that there will be a general reduction of fares on the company's system in Dublin, and possibly a recasting of its charging methods, when normal services can be restored. I think that, having regard to the fact that the fares have not been increased during the emergency, despite the heavy increase in costs and the considerable reduction in services, the present position cannot be regarded as unsatisfactory.</P>

Does he consider it more important that the transport company should increase its profits by 400 per cent. rather than that the people in Crumlin and the other areas should get sufficient food?

      <P>I am aware that in consequence of Emergency Powers (No. 274) Order, 1943, the insurance companies have made an all-round increase of 12½ per cent. in premium rates for employers' liability insurance business, irrespective of whether the average weekly earnings of an employee exceeded 40/- or not.  Before the Order was made, the question of its effect on premium rates was discussed with representatives of the insurance companies and I was given to understand that in adjusting the premium rate to meet the increased liability under the Order, it was not practicable to exempt certain employees on a basis of wages differentiation.

      <P>It is the standard practice of companies engaged in this business to fix premiums on the basis of a percentage of the total wages bill.

In so far as their compensation when injured, determined as a <Col N="1145" /> percentage of their pre-accident earnings, is within the maximum fixed by law, they are entitled to get the increased compensation to which their increased rate of earnings entitles them.</P>

The Minister, who spoke in February, 1939, intimated that he hoped to introduce the legislation in the autumn of that year and his successor intimated in February, 1940, that he hoped it would be possible to submit the matter in that year.

      <P>As regards headings (a) and (c) of the question the arrangements for determining the price of turf supplied to Fuel Importers Limited provide for the fixing of an interim price pending the ascertainment of the final charge when the total quantity of turf has been disposed of and the total expenditure examined. The cost of production per ton will, of course, depend on the actual tonnage of turf produced as ascertained by sale.  The final charges for the years in question have not been definitely fixed.  As regards heading (b) of the question the quantity of turf cut was estimated at 499,000 cubic yards in 1941, 302,000 cubic yards in 1942 and 184,000 cubic yards in 1943.  The production of turf in the past two years was hampered by unfavourable weather conditions and some disintegration ensued.</P>

    <P>As pointed out to the Deputy in my reply to his other question I am <Col N="1150" /> informed that his allegations as regards turf destroyed are entirely baseless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state (1) if it is proposed to refund to the Clare County Council the interest charges involved in that portion of their overdraft in respect of turf which is not occasioned by the production of turf for the council's own requirements; (2) if he will refund the difference between the price of 25/- per ton at which turf was offered for the year 1941-42 by the Doonbeg Parish Committee to the subsidiary bodies of the Clare County Council and the price of 41/- per ton these bodies have been compelled to accept for turf; and, further, if it is proposed to refund the cost of cutting turf under instructions of his Department in August and September, 1942, and also the cost of collecting and barrowing it into bog-holes in the spring of 1943, when it proved impossible to save it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards heading (1) of the question, interest on overdraft for the financing of turf production is reckonable as part of the cost of production so that the question of a refund of interest charges as such does not arise.  As regards heading (2) the primary object of county councils participating in turf production was the supply of fuel for their own needs, including fuel for institutions under their control.  They could not prudently rely upon having their full needs met by private production of turf fuel.  I am not in a position to make any comments on the offer of the Doonbeg Parish Committee to supply turf as I am not aware of the full facts, but I can definitely say that there will be no subsidising of turf produced by the county council and supplied to subsidiary bodies in the county for their own needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the concluding portion of the question, a relatively small quantity of turf was cut in the month of August, 1942.  The cost of production is reckonable as part of the general cost of the entire 1942 crop. <Col N="1151" /> It is incorrect to say that any turf was cut in the month of September, 1942. Further, I am informed that the allegation that the turf was barrowed into holes is entirely baseless.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy has in mind the total number of houses erected by local authorities under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, up to the 31st March, 1942, the number was 47,470.  The State makes contributions to annual loan charges at varying rates over the loan period fixed&mdash;viz., 35 years.  There are no statistics available in my Department in regard to the other information sought by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The total cost is estimated at £19,357,000.  The houses were provided in the county boroughs, in other urban centres and in rural areas, and since the cost of building varied from district to district and from year to year, no figure representing the average cost of erection could properly be given.  There was no division made of capital cost as between the local authorities and the State at the time the loans were raised.</P>

I have now pointed out to the Deputy what, perhaps, he was not aware of before, that the county councils are now the rural sanitary authorities for their respective areas and that they can exercise the powers conferred by the Public Health Acts for the connection of houses with a public sewerage system. Therefore, I believe that the sanitary authority has power to enforce the provision <Col N="1156" /> of drainage for a house where that house is without sufficient provision for effectual drainage already.</P>

It is desirable that the medical officer should have his residence convenient to the sanatorium, and I understand that the local authority also hold that view, but that in existing conditions it has not been found possible to proceed with their proposal for the building of a new residence for the medical officer at Brownswood.

The nearest place is Wexford now for the county medical officer of health. Is it in the interests of people who may be lying in their last agony not to have a doctor convenient, instead of being 14 miles away?  Surely the ratepayers are the people to decide whether that is in the interest of those people who are lying in this institution <Col N="1157" /> without any medical attendant?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that there is a general demand in South Offaly for suitable hospital accommodation in Birr, and if he proposes to take action to remedy the grievance; and if he will state if any expenses have so far been incurred in connection with the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the negative.  The erection of a new hospital at Birr was under consideration some years ago, and an architect was entrusted by the local authority with the preparation of plans.  The expenditure incurred amounted to £1,474. At the time a new county hospital was proposed to be provided at Tullamore. The latter project was considered to be much more urgent, and a very liberal grant from the Hospitals Trust Fund was allocated for its provision. The commitments of the Fund then, and even at the present time, would not permit of the erection of all the <Col N="1158" /> hospitals which it is proposed ultimately to provide, so that there is no prospect of making any grant for a new hospital at Birr.  The steps necessary to render the existing hospital more suitable for the accommodation of patients rest primarily with the local authority, and I will be prepared to consider any proposals which they may submit for that purpose.  About five years ago a committee of the former Offaly Board of Health which inspected the existing hospital at Birr reported that the hospital could be put into perfect repair with a small outlay, but the board at the time did not act on that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not empowered to compel the board to act, in view of the fact that it is over 50 miles from parts of the Roscrea area, to the county hospital in Tullamore? The poor as well as the rich of the County Offaly are suffering severe hardship as a result of the hospital being in Tullamore.  Birr has as good a claim, in view of its size and in view of the part of the county in which it is situated.  Has the Minister not powers of compulsion?</P>

      <P>I have seen copies of the Orders made in these cases and also a Gárda report and a note which the justice has been good enough to submit for my information.</P>
      <P>The Orders authorise the parents to be present, if they wish.  This is a statutory requirement.  The Orders contain also a direction that the whippings shall be carried out in the presence of an inspector of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  This is not a statutory requirement and I understand that it cannot be enforced except with the agreement of the society, which is not forthcoming.  In these circumstances, I am advised that there are serious doubts as to whether the Orders can be enforced at all, and I have remitted the penalties.</P>
      <P>In view of certain incorrect reports, I may add, in fairness to the justice, that he did not order any of these boys to be whipped twice for the same offence and also that, before imposing the sentences of whipping, he carefully considered the possibility of dealing with these cases by way of probation or by way of committal to an institution.</P>

I am also aware that in a number of cases the disease was so attributable. While every effort is made to render soldiers physically fit before exposing them to the rigours of exercises, it must be recognised that the military training cannot be excluded as a factor in bringing the disease to light in certain susceptible cases.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the incidence of tuberculosis in the Army is only slightly higher than amongst the general population, and that soldiers are mainly in the age group most susceptible to the disease, I do not consider that any special inquiry into the matter is warranted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little)</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice of inserting the English translation on correspondence addressed in Irish is almost entirely confined to addresses in the Dublin postal district, where a substantial number of the sorting staff have not a sufficient knowledge of Irish.  Such being the case, translation is necessary in order to avoid missorting or mis-delivery of items addressed in Irish.</P>
      <P>The position regarding provincial addresses is different inasmuch as, although there still remains a number of older postmen who have not sufficient Irish, the younger men help them to identify any Irish addresses presenting difficulty, but the English address is not, as a rule, written on the cover.</P>
      <P>The position at Dublin is kept under constant review and the necessity for translation will disappear in time when officers qualified in Irish replace the older members of the staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>There are so many ways in which we have helped the &ldquo;furtherance of the Irish language&rdquo; in the past five years&mdash;talks, plays, dramatisations and features of all kinds in Irish, talks in Irish and English by leaders in the movement, relays of concerts from all parts ot the country, broadcasts of songs in Irish and patriotic songs in English, the heavy proportion of Irish in the daily schools programme, that it would be quite impossible to give a satisfactory estimate of what we do weekly for the language&mdash;and, of course, every week would vary.  An important point, also, is that a precise statement of the time allotted to the furtherance of Irish would give no idea at all of what has been done for the language.  It is not alone a question of the amount of time, but of what has heen done in the time.  Most, if not all, of this information can be obtained from the director's annual reports of which copies are being sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Suitable talks in English on the subject have been frequently broadcast by leaders in the movement and time will always be made available on the radio for the purpose.  If the Deputy has any concrete proposals to make for the furtherance of the language, the Director of Broadcasting will be very glad to discuss them with him at any time.</P>
      <P>Many people believe that for those who have any Irish, and particularly for the young people who ought to have Irish, good, interesting broadcasts in Irish are the best propaganda&mdash; plays, dramatisations, radio digest, question time in Irish, reconstruction of the early days of the movement&mdash; and special attention is being given to this type of broadcast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel there is not much I need say by way of explaining this Estimate to the Dáil.  The gross total is £39,062 as against £38,907 for the previous year, an increase of £155. Sub-heads A, B, C, D and E are practically the same as last year.  They are the ordinary sub-heads in all Estimates, and make provision for salaries, wages, travelling expenses and incidentals.  I do not think they call for any comment whatever.  Sub-head E (2) comprises a couple of token items because, as I explained on the main Agricultural Estimate, these <Col N="1180" /> international organisations are not working at the moment and, therefore, there is no expenditure except a token amount.  Coming to the F sub-heads, which relate specifically to Inland Fisheries, we find in sub-head F (1) an increase of £1,475.  This is virtually all payable to local authorities.  I have explained year after year that there is provision in this Estimate every year that, where local authorities lose through the new rating provision brought in in 1925&mdash;if they lose what amounts to more than 1d. in the £ in their total rate&mdash;the difference must be made good out of the Fisheries Estimate of that particular year.  The amount has gone up there owing, I presume, to an increase in the rate in some counties.</P>
      <P>In regard to the group of G sub-heads, which concern the Sea Fisheries Association, it will be noted that there is a reduction of £2,000 in the Estimate under sub-head G (1).  We have had four sub-heads under G up to this, but at the request of the directors of the association we agreed in the Department to combine the former sub-heads G (1) and G (2) into one sub-head to be called sub-head G (1) representing a total grant-in-aid of administration and development; and there is a reduction of £1,000 on what is now sub-head G (2) &mdash;repayable advances for the provision of boats and gear.  That arises from the fact that it is becoming more and more difficult to purchase fishing gear of any kind.  Consequently, the directors have decided not to incur interest charges by borrowing from the Exchequer money which they cannot hope to utilise to advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head G (3)&mdash;(formerly sub-head G (4)&mdash;remains the same as last year, for the reason that here again the directors did not see any good reason for engaging on structural development in the existing conditions of high prices and stringency of supply with regard to materials generally.  In regard to the H sub-heads&mdash;Appropriations-in-aid&mdash;there is an improvement on last year's figure of £2,450, which is accounted for by three items&mdash;namely, £2,000 increase in the anticipated repayment of advances by the Sea Fisheries Association to the Department; <Col N="1181" /> £200 increase in the receipts expected under the Fisheries (Tidal Waters) Acts, 1934 to 1939; and a new item of £400 set down for salmon export licences.  Deputies are aware, I am sure, that last year we had to bring in a provision for licences for the export of salmon, owing to regulations made by the Minister for Food on the other side.</P>
    <P>Deputies from the maritime counties will have been interested in the figures recently published by the Sea Fisheries Association, indicating the maintenance, during 1942, of the good standard of earnings shown by the members during 1941.  One result of this was that, instead of the £10,000 set down last year as the anticipated figure of repayments by the association, the amount actually repaid was £17,186.  Many of the fishing boats then on hire-purchase have since been completely cleared from debt.  We cannot, however, be over optimistic for the coming year.  We feel that if the figure of £12,000 is attained, as set down in the current Estimate, the association will have done very well.</P>
    <P>The £400 set down as the expected income from salmon export licences is referable, as I have already mentioned, to the new arrangement introduced by the British Ministry of Food, by which it is necessary to have licensed exporters here.  That arrangement also provided for the payment by the Ministry of a fixed seasonal price for all salmon delivered in good condition to the Ministry's order, at one or other of the eight or ten points where duly authorised receiving agents were set up.  The Ministry of Food was the sole purchaser and would no undertake to deal individually with all the people who had previously engaged in this trade here, as it would entail too much correspondence, accountancy work and so on, and the Ministry sought to have the number of exporters in this country reduced to about 20, but, after some negotiation, the number was finally agreed at 35.  These 35 licensed exporters have to pay certain fees to my Department, which are represented in that sum of £400.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Fisheries Estimate last year, I told Deputies that, although the previous 12 months had <Col N="1182" /> been a period of prosperity, comparatively speaking, for our fishermen, I did not propose to claim the credit for that result, save to the extent to which my Department and I had helped our fishermen into a position of being able to avail of their opportunity when it came along, by reason of the fact that they had been already supplied, through the Sea Fisheries Association, with most of the requisite boats and gear.  That attitude towards the question I still maintain; but this does not prevent me, in common with the Deputies generally, from expressing gratification thaP our inshore fishermen have in fact risen to the occasion in so marked a fashion.</P>
    <P>Our total landings of sea fish for the year 1942 were 371,000 cwts., valued at £504,000, as compared with the figures of 236,000 cwts., valued at £233,000 for 1939, which may be regarded as the last full pre-war year.  There is this further important point to be borne in mind, namely, that, whereas, during 1939, there were no less than nine steam trawlers in commission that made in all 259 trips, there were, for the greater part of 1942, no steam trawlers at all in commission here, and for a limited period, only three such vessels.  This means that the increase in quantity of fish landed is entirely attributable to the efforts of our inshore fishermen.  A pleasing feature of this expansion of their business is that these inshore men are behaving prudently towards their increased earnings, and are making every endeavour to clear themselves of all debt. In this connection, I may mention that some 45 members of the Sea Fisheries Association have, during the past two or three years, cleared the cost of the boats and gear supplied to them on hire purchase, and are now the complete owners of these outfits.</P>
    <P>This business-like outlook on the part of individual members is reflected in the global dealings between the association and the Exchequer in respect of moneys borrowed.  These borrowings by the association for the provision of boats and gear to members are repayable upon a half-yearly basis. The repayments on that basis were, as <Col N="1183" /> at 31st March, 1941, some £16,000 in arrear; as at 31st March, 1942, these arrears had been reduced to about £6,000; and as at 31st March, 1943, these arrears had been completely wiped out.  This, I suggest, is as creditable to the fishermen-borrowers as it is satisfactory to the taxpayers whose money had been lent.</P>
    <P>Last year I made reference to the increased difficulties in obtaining supplies of fishing gear and also of fittings and replacements for marine motor engines, not to mention increasing stringency with regard to fuel oil.  It is unfortunate, but true, that conditions in these respects are worsening; and the directors of the Sea Fisheries Association have urged in their annual report that every fisherman must, in his own interest, conserve to the utmost every net and rope, as well as treat his motor engine with that extra measure of care and attention which may result in prolonging its effective existence for that extra period which is all important, if the boat owner's earnings are to be maintained.</P>
    <P>Both my Department and the Department of Supplies have been doing everything possible to ease the situation with regard to nets, ropes and other gear of that character, and we are hoping for at least some limited results; but I want to say candidly that the position with regard to machinery is very serious, because virtually every lathe and every operative in British engineering workshops is now fully occupied on war work.  I think it right to add that the directors of the Sea Fisheries Association have continued to pay particular regard to the needs of those small holders in the Gaeltacht to whom the provision of a currach or a trammel net is a matter of much consequence in their domestic economy.  Deputies may be interested in the following few figures which deal with facilities provided by the association for these Gaeltacht residents:&mdash; Boats, engined, £3,400; boats, unengined, £300; motor engines and parts, £2,700; engineering services, £600; fishing gear: nets, ropes, etc., £3,000; and material for preserving nets, £100.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think every Deputy, and especially Deputies from the maritime counties, will have been glad to hear of the success of the inshore fishermen during the past year, because I think we must assume that fishery development in this country will depend to a great extent on the inshore fishermen for many years to come.  The trawliug adventures which we have had so far have been very transitory in their effects and we have to see what we can develop from the inshore fishermen.  It was particularly pleasing to me to hear that the provision made by the Sea Fisheries Association, which was, I suppose, to some extent, my child, has been so successful.</P>
      <P>I should have been glad to hear from the Minister what part of the country, if it would not be invidious to ask, it is in which the arrears have been mounting, and where it is that the best attempts have been made to clear off arrears of debts due to the association. I am not saying that at all because I have any inside knowledge of what is happening in Kerry, a against what is happening in Donegal, Connemara or anywhere else and, as a matter of fact, the Minister's answer might give me a bad punch in the wind, so to speak.  It would, however, be interesting for Deputies to know where we have the best and the most energetic fishermen, who are making the best use of the advantages provided for them by the Dáil, because it is, of course, the taxpayer who eventually provides the money which finances the Sea Fisheries Association, which, in turn, finances the fishermen in the matter of securing boats, gear, and so on.</P>
      <P>I was also glad to hear that the association and the Department are keeping in mind the position with regard to gear, ropes and nets, because it is becoming more and more serious, so far as the fishermen around the coast are concerned.  Nets naturally wear out in a comparatively short time, and, by reason of weather hazards and so on, there are occasions when a man may lose several hundred pounds worth of nets in what, to him, is one night's disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> The position as far as I can gather from various places, not only in regard to the ordinary nets for herring, mackerel and so on, but also for salmon fishing, is rapidly deteriorating. I do not say that that is in any sense the fault of the Department.  I know perfectly well the struggle that has been going on to get the articles released from Britain and Northern Ireland for the benefit of our fishermen. I am glad to learn that the efforts are being continued.  I do not know, but I presume that it has been stressed with the British Ministry of Food, who are the persons largely concerned in England, that in order that we may be able to export fish to Britain we must get supplies of gear in the way of nets, ropes, and so on.</P>
    <P>There is one case in regard to engines that occurs to me.  It is not strictly within the Minister's Department, but the Minister referred to the care that each fisherman will have to take of his engine and engine parts, and so on, as well as of his ordinary gear.  There are some engines that break down no matter what care is taken of them.  The case I refer to is that of a man who was working his boat with a petrol engine for a number of years.  In spite of all the care that he took of it, it eventually became useless.  That man had a chance of getting a kerosene engine to instal in his boat.  When he applied for a supply of kerosene from the Department of Supplies, they refused to give it to him because he had formerly been in receipt of a petrol ration.  They refused to transfer him from petrol to kerosene.  The Minister should talk sense to his colleague.  The Department of Supplies seem to think that the man merely studied his own convenience, ignoring the fact that he had no option in the matter, that he had either to get out of the business or take the kerosene engine that was available.  I think it is absurd on the part of the Department of Supplies to refuse kerosene to that fisherman in such circumstances.  Deputy Healy is familiar with the case to which I refer and I am sure he will support me in suggesting to the Minister that the Department of Supplies ought to <Col N="1186" /> be prevailed on not to take ridiculous decisions of that kind.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister would refer in more detail to inland fisheries. A great many of our inland tourist centres, notably Killarney, are very interested to know what the Minister has in mind in regard to Section 5 of the Fisheries Act, 1939, and when he intends to bring the matter into operation.  The Act provides an appointed day in regard to various parts of it, including the sections which deal with the acquisition by the State of a great many valued fisheries, and, in certain cases, the removal of the nets from fresh waters. The tourist centres are firmly convinced that the curtailment of netting in fresh water certainly would add greatly to the revenue they would derive from the tourist angler.  I think there is much to be said for their point of view.  They also think, and I think, that there is a considerable amount of justification for the view that the acquisition by the State of the tidal fisheries and the several fisheries would eventually improve conditions up the rivers from the angler's point of view.  Apart altogether from the development of angling, very many people in the country are interested to know the Minister's intentions with regard to putting into operation the Fisheries Act.  I know, of course, that there are very serious financial obstacles at the moment, but I do not know that we can hope to be in any better position to face the matter than we are now.  I would like to hear what the Minister Has to say about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to certain facts in connection with supplies for onr fishing fleet.  I suggest that the Minister should take stops to prevent the sale of whatever Manila and sisal rope are in stock to foreign-going ships' owners, captains or mates.  I would also suggest that in making arrangements with Great Britain in connection with flax, there should be a condition that we should get in return a certain measure of rope, twine and netting of all qualities suitable for fishing.  I hope the two officers who came from England <Col N="1187" /> this week have brought some good news for us.  They have been discussing the question of fishing with the authorities there.  Surely it is important that we should get some means to catch the fish to export to Britain.  I do not think it would create a very awkward situation to put it to them plainly that they should assist us to catch the fish they require.  Thcit is purely a matter of business.</P>
      <P>As regards engines, surely it is time we used our national workshop at Inchicore to make our own engines and not be dependent on imported engines. We can make any kind of engines.  We have the brains.  We have the technicians. Surely there are able men in Inchicore and Dundalk who can handle any kind of machinery if they are given the opportunity.  I do not wish to interfere with those who have been actively engaged in this propaganda for years, such as Deputy Fionán Lynch, but I would draw attention to the report of 1919 with a view to seeing if there is not some information contained in that report that might help.  We must all congratulate our inshore fishermen on their courage in working, sometimes with boats not fitted for the task, and who have rendered such valuable service to the community. As the Minister has truly said, they have paid off their debts after long and bitter years of disappointment.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the matter I raised on the Estimate for Agriculture, of the £5,000 returned by the committee who were dealing with the foot-and-mouth disease.  I want to know what amount has been returned to the Minister's Department of the £5,000, and where does it appear in the accounts of the management committee of five.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who is familiar with the fishing trade, I think that the present prosperity in the industry is only temporary.  I remember that after the last war the industry was in a very flourishing condition, and yet in the course of ten years the industry almost died out.  What happened to the industry in those ten years that affected it so much?  After careful consideration I have come to the conclusion that the fishing industry was seriously affected by loss of markets, by over-fishing and by unlimited fishing.  I consider that the loss of the American market for cured mackerel, and of the continental market for cured herring was the greatest blow ever suffered by the fishing industry in the history of this country.  If we are to obtain prosperity for this industry it is absolutely essential that we must regain these markets.  How are we to regain these markets?  I think the only way in which we can ever regain them is by improving our methods of curing mackerel and herrings.  The methods which we adopt at present are old-fashioned; we have the same methods which were used by our grandfathers, <Col N="1189" /> and unless we improve upon those methods I can see no hope whatever of regaining those markets.  Our greatest rival&mdash;Norway&mdash;experimented and improved on her methods and was able to produce mackerel and herrings in a more attractive condition for the public and in that way pushed us completely out of the American market.  Not alone did she push us out of the continental market but she completely pushed the British out of it also.  Therefore, I think the secret of again establishing the fishing industry in a prosperous state is an improvement in our methods of curing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit, of course, that there was less demand for cured mackerel and herring prior to the present war.  It is difficult to say why there was less demand. I think it was due to t,he progress made in refrigerating and, therefore, this method must also be considered by us.  It is obvious that the present prosperity in the fishing industry is due to the fact that there is a great scarcity of fish in England, and in a short time after the war, when the boats will be again released from war work, we will find it very difficult to sell our surplus fish in England during the summer months.  Even during the months of July and August this year we found there was an absolute glut of herrings in England.  The glut was so bad that the English boats and, particularly the Scotch boats, were compelled to stay in the harbours for over a week and, when they resumed fishing, they only brought one-third of their nets with them.  It is obvious, therefore, to anyone in the trade that in a short time after the war we will see that it will be impossible for us to send fish to England during the summer months.  What will we do with our surplus fish during those months? Unless we can adopt some system of preservation by which we can keep the surplus fish for periods of scarcity, I cannot see how there will be any living in the industry for our people.  If we can solve that problem.  I think we shall solve completely the greatest problem in the fishing industry.  We must, therefore, concentrate upon improved methods of curing and refrigeration. I think we should have ice plants set <Col N="1190" /> up in our most important fishing areas, and that the question of cold-atorage must be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>The present Government must be congratulated upon the good work they have done for the fishing industry through the Sea Fisheries Association.  Personally, I have nothing but admiration for the good work which the members of that association have done for the fishermen.  I have discussed the association with a number of fishermen in South Kerry and they tell me it is the most successful board ever set up in this country.  It has done good work for the fishermen of South Kerry by giving them boats and nets.  If the fishermen had not been given these boats and nets some years prior to the war, they would be unable to avail of the present boom in the fishing industry. I think we must admit that the system of giving boats on the hire-purchase system has been very successful when we find that almost all the boats have been paid for.</P>
    <P>There is one piece of advice I should like to give to the Minister and that is not to allow the Sea Fisheries Association to be converted into a huge fish firm.  There is a tendency in that direction at the present time.  I also suggest that all boats supplied by the Government should be sold by public auction.  That is a fair method of sale and, if carried out on proper lines, it would bring about an improvement of the system by allowing the fishermen to enter into contracts to sell their fish to certain merchants. There is another way in which I think the fishing industry could be helped, and that is by the Department setting up classes or schools in fishing areas, especially classes of a technical nature in which subjects such as the rudiments of boat navigation would be taught and other classes which would help the fishermen to carry on their calling.</P>
    <P>There is one side of the fishing industry which I think must be developed and that is the home market.  We do not consume very much fish in this country, and I think it is the duty of the Department to try to encourage people to consume <Col N="1191" /> a larger quantity of the fish landed in this country.  I think that the reason why that has not been done in the past is that people have to pay too much for the fish.  I believe that there is too much of a difference between the price paid to the fishermen and the price paid by the consumer.  If we are to encourage our people to eat more fish, we must at least give it to them at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch referred to the question of oil for fishermen.  The case which he cited is a genuine one, as the man in question has this boat, which he got from the Department, since 1939 and since then has fished continually with the boat.  Through no fault of his own, he was compelled to change his engine.  Yet the Department of Supplies refused this man a ration of oil so that he is unemployed at present and the other members of his crew cannot get berths on other boats.  The Minister should use his influence with the Department of Supplies so that this man may get some oil.  I am also familiar with another case of fishermen who have a grievance. Three or four of them got together and managed to buy a boat and gear.  When they applied for a ration of oil, they were informed by the Department of Supplies that they could not get it because they were not getting oil at a certain date.  This poor man never heard of such a regulation. I discussed the question with the oil merchants of Cahirciveen and they all informed me that they never heard of such a regulation until this man was refused oil.  If the Department have regulations like that, it is very hard to penalise these poor fishermen and this man certainly should get some oil.</P>
    <P>There is also a side of the industry which was very much neglected until it was assisted by the Sea Fisheries Association&mdash;that is, the shell fishing industry.  There is a considerable quantity of mussels being sent to England at the present time and the fact that we are in a position to supply mussels is due to the good work of the Sea Fisheries Association. This mussel tank at Cromane, County <Col N="1192" /> Kerry, is a great success and the fishermen must remember that, even at the present time, the health authorities in such towns as Manchester, Birmingham and Sheffield have not allowed unpurified mussels to be sold. If, at a period of scarcity such as this, that is not allowed, there is no question of unpurified mussels being allowed on sale after the war.  I admit that the fishermen have grievances, but these could be rectified easily at the present time.  There are 60 boats, that is, 120 men, employed, at this tank for six months of the year, and for the three days that they are working each week they receive about £2 5s. a week.</P>
    <P>The railway companies and shipping companies are not doing their utmost for the fishing industry and are not giving it a square deal.  It often happens that the railway company is not in a position to take large quantities of ice from Cork to Valentia Harbour and Dingle.  That is a serious matter for the trade, as, owing to the neglect of the railway company to provide proper facilities, the fish suppliers are compelled to keep fish over to the following day.  I need not add that, in periods of warm weather, that has a serious effect on the trade, and it means also that the fishermen receive a reduced price for their fish.  Recently, the railway company increased the carriage for ice from Cork to Valentia Harbour by over 64 per cent.  I think tiie railway company were entitled, to some increase, but 64 per cent. is absolutely absurd.</P>
    <P>The merchants still have a more serious grievance.  For years past it has been the custom in Valentia Harbour&mdash;which is undoubtedly the most important station on this coast&mdash; to send large quantities of fish by an early train which, at present, gets into Dublin, I think, at 6 or 6.30.  About a year and a half ago, the railway company or the shipping company made an order that, unless the fish arrived at the North Wall before 5.30, it would not be allowed out on the night boat. This appears to be a most absurd rule, in view of the fact that the boat does not leave the North Wall until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning.  As a result, the fish suppliers are compelled to send <Col N="1193" /> it by a late train, which arrives at about 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning.  It must arrive in Dublin and bo loaded that night.  It costs about 5/- to ice 1 cwt. of fish.  Naturally, when the fish buyers must re-ice the fish, the fishermen receive a lower price.  Worse than that, in periods of warm weather, there is a great danger of the fish arriving in England in very poor condition. If it were sent by the morning train from Valentia Harbour on Tuesday morning, it would be sold in England on Thursday; but by sending it by the late train it would not be sold until Friday.  Anyone familiar with the trade knows quite well that the fish would be suitable for sale on Thursday, while it would not be suitable on Friday.</P>
    <P>The merchants at Valentia Harbour have suffered substantial losses over this ridiculous rule.  I have discussed this question with some of the Labour Deputies, particularly with Deputy Larkin, who has assured me that the dockers at Dublin would do everything in their power to help the fishing industry by loading fish which arrives in Dublin by the 6.30 train&mdash;provided, of course, that they are paid overtime. The merchants are so anxious to ship by the morning train that they made an offer to the Department to pay an extra fee for loading the fish at those hours.  This request was refused. As far as I can see, there is no use in trying to get those concessions which are vital to the trade unless our own Minister fights for us.</P>
    <P>There is another question which has often been debated in this House&mdash;that is, the question of preventing foreign trawlers from fishing within our territorial waters.  I consider that it is essential that the three-mile limit be extended, as three miles does not afford sufficient protection from the damage done to inshore fisheries by foreign trawlers.  There are over 28 trawlers fishing out of Dingle, and I need not mention what the earnings of those trawlers mean, nor how many families they support.  It is obvious to anyone knowing anything about the fishing industry that these men fish almost exclusively in Dingle Bay and St. Finian's Bay.  If foreign trawlers <Col N="1194" /> can come in and scrape the coast clear of fish, it is impossible for those men to make a living.  As happened in the 'thirties, they will be unable to continue and we will see the fish lying lotting on the shores, as the men are unable to obtain a living in the industry. The Minister should put up a strong case when international agreements arc being made, to see that the limit is extended.  I understand that Norway objects to any boat coming within eight miles and I think Iceland requires a distance of 20 miles.</P>
    <P>A separate Department of Fisheries should be set up in this country.  It is a ridiculous rule that the most important industry, agriculture, and the second most important, fisheries, should be under the management of one Minister.  Agriculture has very serious problems of its own, and I have no doubt that the Minister in charge of them would have his hands full in trying to rectify them.  The fishing industry also has very serious problems, peculiar to its trade, and if a Minister were appointed to deal with them he would have a hard job, indeed, to try to counteract the great problems which will affect this industry after the war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Healy rather surprised me when he asked what we would do with the surplus fish, particularly during the summer months.  He answered his own question immediately afterwards, when he talked about the development of the home market.  For years, a number of Deputies, apart entirely from the Deputies who are concerned with the maritime counties, have been advocating that the Department should do something to develop the home market.  I would go as far as saying it is not even a question of the surplus alone, as every Deputy from inland areas will admit that you cannot get fish at all.  There are many country towns, large and small, in this State where fish can never be bought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is perfectly obvious that, with the possible demand and possible markets we have available here and with the great number of days of fast and abstinence, there is an exceptionally large market in our own State for the surplus fish which Deputy Healy and his colleagues want to save.  Possibly, the <Col N="1195" /> Minister cannot do anything during the emergency, but when this war is over whatever Minister is in charge should do something to develop the home market and provide for a better distribution of fish to centres like that. If it is possible to distribute the fish, it will be bought and it is not quite a question of price at all.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the question of assessment of fishely rates.  When the owner of land who, say, has a fishery on the River Blackwater, is assessed for the first time for fishery rates, he becomes aware of that only when he is served with the demand note for the payment of the rates.  If he believes that he is not liable for the rates, that the fishery is useless, that it could not be fished or let, he is in the awkward position that when he gets the demand note his period for appealing against the assessment has expired.  The assessment has actually been made in the office the previous March and possibly he does not get the demand note until July or August.  His period for appealing has expired and, whether rightly or wrongly assessed, he has to pay that year's rates and he must wait until the following March to enter an appeal against the assessment.  Where new assessments are being made in cases like that, I suggest the Department should insist on the parties concerned issuing a statement that they intend to make a rate in respect of a particular fishery and the person liable for the rate should get notice as soon as possible, with ample time to permit that person to appeal.  I have had three cases in that connection this year and in each case all that could be done was to pay the rate assessed for this year, no matter whether it was right or wrong, and these people will have to wait until next year to lodge an appeal.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is no doubt aware, in most of the inland rivers the fishery rights were reserved to the old landlords at the time of the Land Purchase Acts.  The position is that most of the old landlords have left the country, or their estates have dwindled and they have no longer an interest in <Col N="1196" /> the fisheries.  At the moment there are numbers of people buying these fihhcrieh from the representatives of the old landlords, thus creating a problem that is not going to be so nice in the near future.  If you take a farmer living on the side of the Blackwater as an example, he has land on the river bank for half a mile.  He does not own the fishing rights; they were retained by the old landlords. The old landlords did not bother about them.  At the present time there are many people in the country who were not interested in fishing before; possibly they are people who have come up in the world recently and made money, and they are buying the fishing rights from the representatives of the old landlords.</P>
    <P>If it were my own case I am satisfied that I would have quite as much objection to these people walking over my land to fish the Blackwater as I would have to the representatives of the old landlords, or even the old landlords themselves.  If the State does not wish to take over these fishing rights, I think the man who owns the land through which the river runs ought to be given them.  It is ridiculous to permit those other people, many of whom have been out of the country for years, to sell the fishing rights to a club or an association.  It means that the farmer who pays the rent and rates is faced with a new set of trespassers and he cannot deal with them.  If the State cannot take them over or let them in a proper manner, I think fishery rights of that sort should 6e given to the people who own the land on each side of the river.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter about which I wish to i remind the Minister. Time and again, as long as I have been a member of this House, this matter has been raised and until something is done about it, it will continue to be raised.  I wish the Minister would make up his mind to do something about a construction that causes very considerable damage to the salmon fishing on the Blackwater, and that is the Lismore weir.  Why something has not been done about it, is beyond me.  It is utterly ridiculous <Col N="1197" /> that a company representing a particular estate can take tonb of salmon out of the river at that weir&mdash;they pull them out of it.  There are people paying £2 for rod licences up the river and they do not get a sporting chance of getting fish.  They should be given some consideration.  I have always had the feeling that as far as the Lismore weir is concerned it would be much better, from the point of view of fishing in general along the Blackwater, if it were done away with.  The position is that one estate is making a lot of money out of the salmon fishing in the Blackwater at the expense of everyone else.  Whatever powers the Minister requires to deal with a matter like that, or to deal with ex-landlords selling their fishing rights to individuals, I think, in order to preserve the rights of the inland fisheries for the people best entitled to them, that the Minister ought to seek such powers, and I am sure the House will be prepared to give them to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasCarter1921" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with the position of the fishermen on the upper stretches of the Shannon, particularly at Lough Ree.  It appears that the Electricity Supply Board has taken over the fishery rights in all cases and has compensated a great many of the people concerned, with the exception of the people in this particular locality.  These are mostly small farmers, who live a very precarious life and try to earn something to keep themselves and their little families going.  They believe they have been victimised.  There was a period when they could fish 1,000 to 1,500 hooks&mdash;they are what are known as long-line fishermen.  They work on a co-operative basis.  At the present time their activities are curtailed by the board and they are not permitted to use more than 300 to 500 hooks.  I should like the Minister to inquire into this matter and do something for these poor people, who are unable to support their families on the amount of fish that they now catch.  They tell me that 500 hooks are a very small number and if they use one hook over the 500 they are liable to be brought to court, where their licence is either suspended or endorsed.  I want the <Col N="1198" /> position in regard to those poor people clarified.  It is a very serious position for them.</P>
      <P>There are 30 or perhaps 40 families between Lough llee and Lough Derg. These people might have three or four acres of land and they would like to know what is, going to happen to them in regard to their fishing activities.  I have seen two licences that were issued for 1943.  The people concerned had to get those licences to enable them to fish for what is referred to as rough fish.  That never happened before and these people are afraid that they are going to lose whatever rights they have.  When the Minister for Industry and Commerce was introducing an amending Bill to the 1935 Act he said, with regard to the position of these people, that it was hard to know what rights they possessed; in other words, who were the owners.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should allow these people much more latitude.  They are kept inside their own waters.  That means that they must fish near their own land.  If they go down the river as they were accustomed to, some 30 or 40 miles, they are prosecuted.  At the moment they must pay a fairly heavy licence fee. They are in the position that they cannot get yarn for the purpose of making or repairing nets.  If the nets shrink they are liable to be brought to court, I am told.  These people are law-abiding citizens, possibly the most law-abiding in the Twenty-Six Counties.  I hope the Minister will give their case sympathetic consideration, allow them to fish more hooks and place them in a position so that they will not have to face the poverty line. That is all I have to say. Probably I have not said enough, but at the same time I have brought those matters to the notice of the Minister, and I have every hope and confidence that he will look into them.</P>

      <P>I want to make an appeal on behalf of the fishermen on the Slaney, that they would be allowed to cast their nets a month earlier than at present.  I know that the Minister made a promise to them some time ago. <Col N="1199" /> I am not asking for petrol or for paraffin, but am himply making this request for the Slaney fishermen, who fish from Ferrycarrig up.  They have also asked me to see that they will get nets, rope and twine and everything else that they require before the season opens.  There are over 300 of them depending on what they get out of the fishing on the Slaney from Ferrycarrig up to this side of Oylegate.  The Minister knows the river as well as I do. If they are granted this concession, it will give them the opportunity of catching some of the fish that are going to the upper reaches of the Slaney, and that are being captured by people who come over here from England to enjoy the fishing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on this Vote I suffer under two disadvantages. The first is that I did not grasp all the Minister said when introducing the Vote.  The second is that I have not been provided with the Book of Estimates which would enable me to follow to some extent what the Minister had to say in regard to some of the subheads of the Vote.  I think it will be universally agreed that when this war is over there will be a considerable development in the tourist industry. Amongst the most acceptable and profitable kind of visitor who has been coming to this country for a long number of years may be classed the sportsman, the man who hunts, fishes or shoots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are just a few comments I have to make on the Vote.  I have had considerable experience of salmon and trout fishing, and my view, in relation to this matter of policing our rivers, streams and lakes, is that the position will be unsatisfactory until such time as the Minister agrees to establish a river police or a better system of bailiffing than we have at present.  We all know that the present system is absurd, that, in fact, it is a perfect scream.  That is quite evident from recent incidents that have occurred all over the country.  Unless you have a uniformed section of the Gárda Síochána, for preference, to look after the rivers and streams, as they should be looked after, then I say you are <Col N="1200" /> going to put an end to the fishing industry as we know it in this country. As one who has fished all over the country, north, south, east and west I can say that the fishing has deteriorated considerably within the last 20 or 30 years.  Visiting sportsmen have gone away with the same impression.</P>
    <P>I had intended referring to the weir at Lismore, but that matter has already been dealt with by another Deputy.  Notwithstanding what has been done with the assistance of tile Minister's Department by way of providing hatcheries, it must be confessed that our rivers are showing a decreasing number of salmon and trout each year.  Quite recently the Minister sent some of his inspectors to a part of East Cork.  I understand that evidence was given there in relation to a portion of a very small river that used to be very prolific in salmon and trout.  I refer to the little river between Campfire bridge and Janeville, near Tallow.  I gathered from the Minister's statement that this year the sum of over £1,700 more was being allocated than last year to the inland fisheries.  In regard to this little river &mdash;I speak subject to correction and the information which the Minister has received from his inspectors&mdash;I am told that there were something like 700 odd salmon taken out of that short stretch of water in a very brief period.  Anybody who knows anything at all about fishing will agree with me that if that is the case the river will very soon become exhausted of all fish.  It is from that part of the river that the salmon go up to spawn.  It is from there that the Blackwater, which everybody knows is famous for large catches of salmon, is fed.  It would be still more famous were it not for the imprisonment of those fish through the agency of the big weir already referred to.  I know that the Minister is serious in endeavouring to protect our fisheries.  I would ask him to have uniformed guards on the rivers for protection purposes.  The bailiffs that we have on the various streams at present might not as well be there at all.</P>
    <P>I have not a great deal of interest in the sea fisheries.  There is, however, <Col N="1201" /> one matter that I want to bring to the notice of the Minister.  I know a young man who resigned a very good post in order to take up sea fishing.  He purchased a yawl and used a sail for a considerable period.  He did very well for a time, and made a bit of money. Then he bought a marine engine.  I do not know whether it was a Diesel engine or not.  He found, however, that when working under sail he was unable to land his catch in time, and consequently, it had to be dumped in the sea.  I got into touch with the Sea Fisheries Association.  I must say that they were very kind and directed this man where he would be likely to get an engine.  Through the good offices of the Sea Fisheries Association, he eventually succeeded in getting an engine, but then he was refused petrol on the grounds that he had not a licence since 1941.  I agree, of course, that there is a war on, and that petrol has to be rationed.  I do submit, however, that something should be done to support the national effort of this young man in trying to win food from the sea.  Every effort should be made to provide him with petrol, so that he may be enabled to land the fish in good condition.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say any more, except to point out that it would be one of the most popular things the Minister could do.  I know that the usual excuses about its involving more expenditure and a higher Budget will be put forward, but, at the same time, the fishing industry, and the inshore fishing industry particularly, is a national asset and, as such, should receive the favourable consideration of the Minister along the lines I have indicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was in the very happy position to-day of being able to paint a very pleasing picture, so far as the position of the fishing industry is concerned.  I hope he will not follow the advice of the Deputy from Kerry who suggested that a separate Department in connection with fisheries should be set up.  I think we have enough Departments at present, and the setting up of a separate Department would involve very increased expenditure, with possibly no good <Col N="1202" /> results.  The present system is good enough and the results of the past year bear out that opinion.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to learn from the Minister's statement that the income derived from this year's landings of fish was in the region of £500,000.  One might think that that was, to a very large extent, due to the increased price paid for fish, but that is not so, because, in addition to the increase in the sum realised, there was also a great increase, as compared with former years, in the quantity of fish landed, so much so that the men engaged in the industry were in a position to meet all their debts.  I remember that in former years the Minister had to bewail the fact that, owing to the poor season through which they had passed, the fishermen were not in a position to repay the loans which they had got from the Sea Fisheries Association.</P>
      <P>The state of affairs at present is very pleasing, and I hope it will continue. If it is to continue, the Department will have to exert itself a little more in the matter of securing tackle, especially for the inshore fishermen. The Minister hinted at the difficult position which has arisen, and which may become more acute in the future, in regard to the provision of nets for the inshore fishermen.  There are large numbers of them engaged along the east coast and I know personally that last year and especially this year, they lost very large quantities of fish, owing to the poor state of their nets, due to the fact that they could not replace them or even get twine to repair them. I think the Minister should use every endeavour of his Department to secure the provision of new nets, or, alternatively, a good supply of material in the form of netting twine which will enable these men to make the nets themselves. Of course they would prefer to get the nets readymade, but there may be some difficulty in that regard, although I do not think that there should be any great difficulty, seeing that we are supplying the British with most of the catches, especially of salmon and there should be a <i>quid pro quo.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not deny for a moment that the Minister is using any and every means to secure these nets.  I still <Col N="1203" /> think that there should be a little extra push, by the Minister and his officials pointing out to the British Government how it may be that the fishermen will find it impossible to carry on next year, unless they get new nets or proper supplies of twine in time to enable them to mend their nets and possibly to make their own nets.  That is one of the difficulties which seem to be causing great annoyance and anxiety to the fishermen engaged in this type of fishing.</P>
    <P>With regard to shell fish, I think the Deputy from Kerry referred to the good work already done by the Department in setting up what is known as a purification tank along the Kerry coast.  Some years ago, Deputies pointed out how essential it was that a tank of a similar kind should be erected on the east coast to cater for those engaged in the mussel industry near Drogheda and Dundalk, and down as far as Greenore and Omeath. This industry has been the means of providing useful work and giving a fairly good income to many families in Dundalk and Drogheda, especially at a time of the year, the winter, when it is most essential that they should have this work.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, an announcement came from the Department on the far side that no more mussels would be accepted from this country unless they had first passed through a purification tank.  I think that some cases of ptomaine poisoning in England were attributed to shell fish exported from this country.  Be that as it may, the export has been stopped, and it would be a great boon if a tank were erected on the east coast to cater for the industry there.  The price prevailing at the moment is very remunerative, and every encouragement should be given to these men to engage wholeheartedly in this industry and I hope the Minister will give that an encouragement.</P>
    <P>I know that there are difficulties created by the emergency in the way of getting materials, but it would be worth while to speed up this part of the work of the Sea Fisheries Association. Above and beyond that, I urge the Minister to lose no time in endeavouring to have something done in <Col N="1204" /> regard to nets, and, at the earliest moment, to issue a statement which will encourage the fishermen and let them know that they will not next year be in the same position as this year&mdash; in fear and trembling, not knowing whether they would br able to carry on their calling or not.  I hope the Minister will be fortunate enough to arrive at an agreement with the British Government to have these very great benefits extended to the fishermen, and particularly the inshore fishermen.</P>

      <P>In conjunction with Deputy Coburn, I would again like to call the Minister's attention to the unfortunate position of the mussel industry in Drogheda and Dundalk.  I am, of course, aware of the causes of that.  It seems a difficult matter to deal with.  A purification tank was set <Col N="1205" /> up in Kerry for the purpose of experiment, I understand, to see if that type of sterilisation was acceptable on the British market.  I understand that the regulations set out that the mussels must not be taken from sewerage rivers.  Unfortunately, the Boyne is a sewerage river and there is a very large amount of mussels on the mouth of the Boyne.  I wonder if it would be possible to transplant or transfer some of these mussels to adjacent rivers that are not sewerage rivers so as to satisfy the sanitary authorities in towns in Great Britain as to the possibility of sterilising these mussels for the British market.  The British market was a very important market from the point of view of these fishermen who collected mussels and sold them on that market.  It was done, as Deputy Coburn pointed out, during the winter months.  That industry has now completely collapsed owing to the fact that the British authorities will not accept the mussels unless they are passed through one of these sterilisation or purification tanks.  I fear the difficulty will be that the Boyne is a sewerage river, but I think it is possible to transfer the mussels.  That might cost something but if they were transferred to Laytown it might get over the difficulty that now arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that in this country, within nine or 10 or 12 miles from the sea, in Clogherhead, once a good fishing centre, fish are not now procurable.  Even in the town of Navan it is extremely difficult to get fish.  The people in the Gaeltacht colony in Rathcarne, most of whom were accustomed to catching fish, tell me they have never seen any fish since they came there.  I remember that, not so many years ago, the country roads were frequented by people selling fish.  That, of course, was a great advantage to the country people.  I understand that fish is an extremely healthy food.  For some reason or other, in recent years, that industry seems to have disappeared. Before the war I did come across an occasional belated fishmonger on the bus coming from Dublin, having speculated in a box of herrings that had originally come from Clogherhead or Donegal.  There seems to be <Col N="1206" /> a system that compels the fish to come from Clogherhead and Donegal and other places to be sold on the Dublin market and then returned to the place from which it came.</P>
    <P>I think we should make some effort to deal with the marketing of fish.  It is a very sad commentary that more fish is not available to the community, especially in the country districts.  I suppose the difficulty is due to the process of distribution.  It may be due to the cornering of markets by groups. It happened in the potato trade and it almost happened in the fruit industry. Some organisation in the City of Dublin corners a particular commodity, gets the profit and distributes it throughout the country at such a price that it is almost impossible to buy it.  I think some effort should be made to examine the position with a view to securing that the fishermen of Clogherhead will get their fish distributed in the country districts, as it was many years ago, with great benefit to the workers and to the people in country towns.  It may be financially impossible or it may be that the vested interests have become so powerful that they cannot be uprooted.  Every effort should be made in this matter because, if we are to maintain the fishing industry, it will not be on the basis of an export market that will be highly competitive after the war, but on the basis of the home market which we develop for the benefit of the people of the country.  I understand from the figures given by the Minister, and from other sources, that there is very decided improvement in the fishing industry but I cannot say that there is any improvement so far as distribution to the rural community is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incumbent upon the Minister, I think we all agree, to protect the livelihood of the men engaged in the fishing industry.  There is just one point I wish to make, that is, to support the view expressed by Deputy Coburn in reference to the supply of nets.  The Minister has rightly stressed the necessity for preserving gear and getting the maximum amount of benefit out of its use.  We know that this gear is becoming very scarce and it has been stated, I think <Col N="1207" /> correctly, particularly in regard to Louth, that many men are leaving the fishing industry owing to the impossibility of obtaining the gear necessary to pursue that industry.  If this flight from the fisheries continues, there will be little necessity for a Department of Fisheries, as there will be no fishermen left.  Now is the time, I think, to take particular notice of the dire need of the fishing industry.  Mr. Larkin has suggested&mdash;and I think his suggestion should be considered by the Minister&mdash; that the export of flax to the British market might be conditioned on a return of some of the cordage and nets necessary for the fishing industry in this country.  It is a reciprocal arrangement, mutually beneficial.  I think the Minister should do all he possibly can to ensure that the raw material for the netting industry is secured for this country.  In addition, he might consider the possibility, if not of establishing, an industry for the manufacture of fishing nets, of giving some aid through his Department, by taking counsel with those who are interested in this matter, giving them advice or assistance in whatever way he can, so that some emergency industry, at least, might be established which would provide the fishermen with the nets and make it possible for them to mend their own nets.</P>
      <P>If that is done, I think we will be able to stop the flight of these fishermen to England, a flight from the industry which will have very bad effects later on.  It may not be a matter of incurring any great expenditure on the part of the Department, and it will be productive of exceedingly good results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one or two observations I should like to make.  The Minister and I represent the same constituency and I am sure he will look with favour upon the suggestion I have to make.  The fishing industry is more important than people realise, unless they look very closely into the matter.  Dealing with it from an historical point of view and looking back over some generations, I think we will find that the fishing industry <Col N="1208" /> is about to disappear in this country.  The only way it can be kept in existence is not only by keeping those who have the skill at work, but by training others to follow them.  The difficulty at the moment is the question of supplies.  My criticism is that the Minister has not taken a sufficiently strong line with the Department of Supplies.  I speak from personal experience, from letters I have received and representations that have been made to me.  I know that the fishermen in County Wexford are not getting sufficient supplies of fuel and other commodities in order to enable them to carry on their work.  I do not suggest that we have an enormous amount of fuel to go around, but I should like to see the Minister taking a stronger line with the other Departments so that the fishermen will get sufficient supplies of various kinds, such as nets and fuel.  So far as I am concerned the principal complaint is with regard to fuel.  It is important from two points of view that these supplies should be maintained.  It is important, first of all, from the point of view of catching fish at the present time.  It is equally important, taking a very long view, that a very essential skilled group of men should continue in their employment and pass on their skill to others who come after them. Our country, surrounded as it is by the sea, should be able to take wealth from the sea and, unless we keep our people in gainful employment on the sea, the skill that existed in the past and which exists to a certain extent at present will disappear completely. Apart altogether from the question of getting increasing supplies of fish at the moment, for the purpose of the industry it is essential that we should provide them with the raw material to carry on their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister will be in sympathy with me in regard to these statements.  I see other Deputies from County Wexford here and I am sure they are also in sympathy with what I have to say in regard to these matters.  We in Wexford are in the extraordinary position that, unlike many other counties, we are bordered on two sides by the sea.  Over 50 per <Col N="1209" /> cent. of our boundary is the sea.  We are only getting a very small amount of the wealth that is lying at our door. I know that when the Minister talks with other Departments concerned he is up against obstacles and difficulties, but J should like him to be a little more insistent so that the Wexford fishermen can get their fair share of the supplies that are going.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to stress the point made by Deputy O'Reilly with regard to the marketing of fish. It is an extraordinary thing that many small seaboard towns in Ireland, even though a good deal of fish is passing through, often find themselves without a supply of fish.  It appears to me that the greater quantity of the fish caught all over Ireland is being sent to Dublin.  Almost everything is centralised in Dublin nowadays.  I ask the Minister to try to secure that some of the fish caught in towns like Wexford, Waterford, and others on the southeast coast is made available for the people living in these towns.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to get fish in these small towns, even though a good deal of fish is landed at the people's doors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to add something to what Deputy Esmonde has said in connection with the matter of supplies. I think there is undue discrimination in some cases.  Some fishermen find it quite easy to get kerosene, others find it very difficult, and some are not in a position to get it at all.  I urge on the Minister the necessity for making representations to the Department of Supplies with a view to seeing that the kerosene is distributed fairly. Last year people who fish for salmon on the river Slaney experienced a great scarcity of material for making nets, such as ropes and things of that kind.  The result was that a great number of people who were in the habit of fishing each year had to remain off the river.  I know that the Department of Supplies made efforts to secure some of these materials, but I do not know what the result was.  If the fishing industry is not to become extinct altogether, it is necessary that the Fisheries Department and the <Col N="1210" /> Department of Supplies should make special efforts to secure materials for the making of nets.  I should like to emphasise again the question of the marketing and handling of fish in Dublin and in the other cities and towns.  In a great many cases you find some of these towns in which fish is landed without fish on days when the people are looking for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHCrowley" hpid="Mr. F.H. Crowley Mr. F.H. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F.H. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>When the 1999 Act was introduced, I took particular interest in it and discussed many sections of it in this House.  I wish to draw attention to one or two points I raised at that particular time, and which I am emphasising now, including the netting of salmon at the mouths of rivers and also in the Lakes of Killarney. The by-law at present gives two clear consecutive d&amp;ys as closed days in the week.  I strongly suggest, as I did in 1939, that three consecutive days be counted as closed days.  I also made the point, which has been put up by the Killarney Anglers' Association, that all netting in fresh water should cease from 1st July to 1st January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone standing in Killorglin and taking particular note of the method of netting would say it is the mystery of mysteries how a salmon gets up to Killarney lakes.  I will show later how you can get no exposure from the bailiffs on these particular points, as the bailiffs are elected by the net holders and the man who possesses a rod licence has no possibility of having a say in the selection of bailiffs.  The nets are so manipulated that the salmon have got to find an opening, and it is a mystery how they can find that particular opening.  I strongly suggest to the Minister that the only way the Department can get a clear conception of what is happening there is to send down an inspector, who will be paid to stay there for the two or three months of the year, just to see how the system works out.  The nets should be lifted for the month of July, as it is in that month that the young salmon&mdash;what we call peal&mdash;are taken and, from the point of view of spawning, they are the most productive and the healthiest, producing the healthiest spawn.  I do not mind what views are <Col N="1211" /> held by the Department here about that.  It is against the laws of nature for the spawn from a fish weighing 24 lbs., which is an old fish, to be as healthy as the spawn from a fish weighing 4 lbs.  What happens in July is that a huge number of young fish weighing 3 to 5 lbs. is taken from the lakes, at a particular time when the price of fish is at its lowest.</P>
    <P>To show that there is over-netting is rather difficult, for the following reasons: The salmon spawns in the river in its natural bed, the young salmon stays in the river for two years, at the end of which he proceeds to the sea and spends from three to five years there and then returns to the river exactly where he was spawned.  You are dealing with a period of two years in the river and three to five in the sea, that is five to seven years.  If you lift the nets altogether this year, you will have to wait six or seven years to prove the effect, because the spawn that is hatched this year would not come back to the river in the form of salmon for six or seven years.  I suggest to the Department that it is worth while to carry out an experiment to show the effect of lifting the nets, even though you might have to wait six or seven years.  The amount of netting going on in Killarney at the present time is anything but healthy.  Under the 1939 Act, when the nets are lifted from the fresh water, compensation has to be paid on the return from the fish captured for the three previous years. The Minister has given the assurance that he is going to deal with the lifting of nets from fresh water when the war ends, and until then the net holders are trying to make hay, so there is wholesale netting going on at present. That will be felt in six or seven years' time.</P>
    <P>In 1939 I raised a point about the method of election of the boards of conservators.  Tim Healy on one occasion was invited to a certain convention and it happened to be so &ldquo;packed&rdquo; that he sent back a post card and said the invitation reminded him very much of the invitation of the spider to the fly.  The rod holder is in the very same position, when he is invited <Col N="1212" /> to a meeting for the selection of a board of conservators.  Under the 1939 Act and previous Acts, the net holder has such a power of manipulating the votes that it is utterly and absolutely impossible for the rod holder to get control of tlio board.  I appeal to the Minister again, in this democratic age, to realise that the least that should be done is to change the method of election.  What happened in Galway is a disgrace, but I can tell the Minister definitely that the same thing is happening in many other parts of the country.  I strongly suggest the repeal of the particular section dealing with the method of election of a board of conservators.</P>
    <P>The Sea Fisheries Association is doing excellent work, beyond yea or nay, and deserves a compliment from the House.  They have certainly been very businesslike in their methods and have done everything possible to provide boats for the sea fishers.  I would ask an extension of the funds, to enable the boatmen in Killarney and other lakes to get some boats built, as some of the boats in Killarney certainly should be replaced.  I know no fund from which they can draw, and I strongly suggest that a certain sum of money be set aside to enable inland fishermen to purchase boats and carry on their business.</P>
    <P>I again stress the over-netting that is taking place and the necessity of lifting the nets in July.  It is no use in putting up the argument to me that we have generally the same return of salmon year after year, neither is it any use saying that the net holders, if they are over-netting, are reducing their income for future years.  They realise they will not be there in two or three years' time, so the netting at present on the Killarney lakes and the mouth of the Laune is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>There is one other point, in which Deputy Linehan will bear me out&mdash;that is, the method of construction of the King's Gap, or Queen's Gap, whichever you call it.  It is altogether wrong from the legal point of view.  Lismore is a brilliant illustration of that.  I do not know how the fish can possibly get up the river.  Some of the most natural beds&mdash;good sandy beds, with a good <Col N="1213" /> flow of water&mdash;are in the reaches of the Blackwatcr, and you can count on fingers and toes the number of fish that go up there.  The reason is that they arc netted to such an extent, and also that the King's Clap and Queen's Gap are falsely constructed from the point of view of the anglers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to one point in connection with the deleterious effect on the River Feale, owing to the complete lack of responsibility shown in not putting a gap at Listowel into repair. There are several interests concerned, and it is a very old story, which has been before the Department time after time.  My information is that the anglers' association there contributed a certain amount, in order to make their quota towards having this necessary work put in hands.  The Limerick Board of Conservators have declined to accept the offer of the anglers' association because, I understand, of the failure of a mill-owner to contribute anything towards that work.  Where you have so many interests of that type concerned, and where they are allowed to fight over the issue, it is a matter in which the Department ought to intervene; they ought to take a hand in the game and see that the fish population in that river is not allowed to deteriorate year after year, simply because someone has failed to do his job.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to investigate the position of the Kiver Feale, owing to the collapse of the pass at Latchford's.  A decent effort has been made by the anglers' association. I cannot speak of the attitude of the conservators; they have refused to give any contribution to supplement what the anglers have contributed, because of the failure of the third party to contribute anything.  I am asking a fourth party to see to it that the salmon in the Feale will get a chance to propagate.  This is a fine old river and it is a serious thing to see anyone standing in the way.  I trust that the Minister will attend to this matter without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the plea that has been made to the <Col N="1214" /> Minister with regard to the erection of a purification tank for mussels on the east coast.  I believe that such a construction is most essential, and I trust the Minister will give the matter serious consideration.  There are large numbers of fishermen along the coast from Dundalk to Drogheda and down into Meath interested in a project of this kind.  They have seen many lean years since, at the hand of the law, an end was put to the industry in that area.  At one time a thriving trade was carried on in mussels, but now the people are not allowed to carry on the industry, and many of them are in a bad way.  I should like the Minister to give this matter his serious consideration.  There are large numbers of people in Drogheda, Baltray and Dundalk anxious to know the Minister's intention in connection with this matter.</P>
      <P>I quite agree with Deputy O'Reilly that there should be a better distribution of fish in the inland counties. It is a very difficult thing just now for any man in a midland town to buy even a herring.  I think the centralisation of this business in Dublin is wrong.  The farmers who live in the vicinity of towns like Trim or Navan or Kells are unable to purchase fish. I think the distribution of fish among the inland towns should receive more consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention that on the upper reaches of the Boyne there are derelict weirs, and they have been. derelict for quite a number of years. In the past the weirs were properly looked after, but that does not now hold and the position is that the fish cannot get up to the spawning beds. Then again, there is a vast amount of flooding in the tributaries of the Boyne.  I ask the Minister to see that these weirs are removed.  If they are, benefits will accrue to the people whose lands are flooded and to the fishing industay, because the fish will be able to reach the spawning beds. It is too soon to criticise the fishing industry generally, because it is being re-organised and some years must elapse before we can observe the results of the re-organisation.  I am very anxious that the Minister should <Col N="1215" /> give serious consideration to the erection of a mussel purification tank on the east coast&mdash;say, in Meath.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Finian Lynch asked for information as to where the payments from fishermen have been very good and in what centres the payments have not Leen so good.  I am not in a position to give very definite information.  I can only say that the centre of Dingle is, perhaps, the best we have in the fishing industry and the fishermen there have been very successful in repaying their loans.  There have been other good centres, too.</P>
      <P>Another point raised had reference to supplies of various kinds from Great Britain.  Naturally, Deputies are anxious that the fishermen should be supplied with what they want in the way of fuel oil for their engines and nets and ropes and other things they require.  We have been doing everything we possibly could do to get those supplies, not only during the recent visit of some of our officials to London, but even before that.  We have been getting a certain supply of materials for nets and a small supply of other articles, such as ropes.  As Deputies know, we are getting a small, an insufficient, supply of fuel oil of various kinds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a case cited by Deputy Lynch which gives me an opportunity of explaining the position.  The Minister for Supplies has a limited quantity of kerosene to distribute and, in spite of what Deputy Esmonde said&mdash; he felt that I was not making a sufficient impression on the Minister for Supplies&mdash;I think all the kerosene the Minister has is going, somehow or other to the rural areas.  The three big users of kerosene are, agriculturists for their power machinery, fishermen for their boats, and rural householders for their lighting.  If I am to make a greater impression, as Deputy Esmonde would like, on the Minister for Supplies, I can only do so by asking him to give less to agriculture and more to fisheries, or to give less for lighting in rural houses and give more to fisheries.  It is not so <Col N="1216" /> easy to hold the balance fairly between all classes.</P>
    <P>I think that, on the whole, the Minister for Supplies has done as well as any man could do under all the circumstances. There is no kerosene to come from any other source, so far as I know.  It is being used in the way I have indicated, and we cannot do any better.  The Minister for Supplies, it, is true, on various occasions refused to give kerosene to a man with a new boat, and the argument he used was that the existing fishermen are not getting enough, and, therefore, he does riot see that there would be any justice in bringing new persons into the business.  I think that is right, where he is dealing with a new person.  You have the cases of men&mdash;I know of them myself&mdash;who were out of the fishing business for four or five years, and they are now coming back when they think there is something to be got out of it. I think it is much better to support the men who have continued in the business rather than allow new men to come in and in that way cut down the supplies to the existing fishermen.</P>
    <P>I think the case referred to by Deputy Lynch, and also by Deputy Healy, is quite a different one.  That is the case where a fisherman had petrol and where his engine, as a petrol engine, is no longer in use and he happened to get a paraffin engine and was refused supplies.  I think an individual case like that might be pushed forward with the Department of Supplies to see if it could not be reconsidered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister help?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, certainly.  Deputy Lynch asked when we intended to put the Act into operation.  When putting the Act through in 1939 we had in mind that we might, within two or three years, commence making the necessary Orders to acquire the fisheries throughout the country.  The emergency, of course, has made a difference, and although we have had to postpone this matter I should say, perhaps, indefinitely, I think it is a thing that we should not put off too long. We will go into it again and see if we <Col N="1217" /> should not take some action.  That refers to acquisition, to the removal of nets from fresh waters, and such other matters as were referred to by Deputies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin talked about our flax going to England, and asked what we were getting in return.  There is one thing we get in return and that is binder twine.  We got 1,000 tons of binder twine and 1,000 tons of sisal with which to make binder twine.  We also got material with which to make ropes and cord, and part of that will be used for the benefit of fishermen.  I do not know if it would be possible to get marine engines made at Inchicore. I cannot say if the possibility of that was explored, but I do know that in my Department the possibility of getting existing engines repaired was explored very fully and it was found impossible to get certain repairs done to some of our engines in any workshop in this country.  There does appear to be some insurmountable difficulty, so far as Inchicore works are concerned, in regard to marine engines.  I agree with Deputy Healy that, when the war is over, we shall have to make bigger and better efforts in regard to the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often stated in this House that the problem appears to be divided into three parts.  The first part concerns the protection of our fisheries so as not to allow anybody but our own fishermen to get the fish. That we had brought under fairly successful control before the war.  Since the war, there has been no such thing as poaching.  The second part concerns the provision of equipment to catch the fish for our own fishermen.  That has been very well done, as has been acknowledged from all parts of the House, by the Sea Fisheries Association. It will be better done when the war is over and when they are in a better position to get engines and other supplies.  The third part concerns the better marketing of fish, including refrigeration, as mentioned by Deputy Healy.  The point was made by some Deputies that it is a pity that all our fish goes to Dublin.  Deputy O'Reilly spoke of fish being taken from the Louth coast up to Dublin and coming <Col N="1218" /> back to midland towns within 30 or 40 miles of where they were caught.  This does appear a difficult question but it is, apparently, necessary to have a big. reservoir or pool of fish if we are to keep things going at all.  In Great Britain, where they have about 40,000,000 of a population, and fish being landed at different places, they have foul big markets from which practically all the fish arc distributed. Under that system, fish may be brought past certain towns, up to one of those receiving centres, and then be brought back to a town which they had passed on the way.  It does appear to be essential to have some sort of pool or reservoir to make fish-marketing successful. I was glad that there was no criticism of the Sea Fisheries Association. We are inclined to forget an organisation of this kind in which men work without being paid, but they deserve our thanks for making this undertaking a success.  I am sure that they would be only too glad to consider any suggestions made here with regard to the marketing of fish in inland towns.  It must, however, be remembered that the Sea Fisheries Association lost some thousands of pounds in connection with these inland markets and the opening up of new markets.</P>
    <P>It is not an easy problem by any means.  The fact that we have fast days seems to be against us rather than in our favour.  On days of abstinence practically everybody wants fish, and practically nobody wants fish on any other day.  Fishermen are very discouraged if they get a big catch on Friday or Saturday and find that they cannot sell it easily.  It is rather hard to expect them to continue in the business and fish for a particular day's. market.  These are difficulties with which we shall have to deal.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the question of education.  Classes were established in a few centres and we shall see if there is any hope of getting more done in that way and of getting better support for the classes.  The question of freight on the railways is not one for me.  When anything like that is sent to my Department, we endeavour, so far as possible, to get the matter righted through the Department of <Col N="1219" /> Industry and Commerce.  That is all we can do in this case.  Deputy Linehan referred to the question of fishery rates.  I have taken a note of his point and I shall see if something can be done to have people notified in time to make an appeal whenever a fishery rate is raised.  The question of fisheries retained by landlords is one which comes under the Land Acts. Under certain of the Land Acts, the landlords were left their fishery rights without any conditions being attached. They were quite free to sell those rights.  As the law stands, we cannot interfere.  I have, however, sympathy with the Deputy's view, and I think that we should, perhaps, do something about it.  It is a matter which can be considered when we are bringing in further legislation in that connection.</P>
    <P>If the question of Lismore weir were settled, the debate on this Estimate would be considerably shortened.  The question of Lismore weir always leads to a long discussion.  It cannot be correct to say, as Deputy Linehan and Deputy F. Crowley contended, that there are no salmon going up.  If that were so, the proprietors could not continue to take tons and tons of salmon. They must be going up to propagate.</P>

      <P>It is clear that, although the weir is there, the number of salmon is not appreciably decreasing because, if it were, the proprietors could not be getting tons and tons of salmon.  I am not defending private ownership of weirs.  As Deputies know, we brought in a Bill in 1939, which became an Act, to deal with these matters.  We must be allowed a little time before we proceed to implement that Act.  Deputy Carter and Deputy Dockrell referred to the interference of the Electricity Supply Board with fisheries.  A Bill is being prepared at present in the Department of Industry and Commerce dealing with the further development of rivers for the Generation of electric <Col N="1220" /> power.  The Department of Industry and Commerce will consult with my Department regarding the safeguards which we think would be right and fair in all the circumstances.  We shall have an opportunity then of trying to persuade the Minister for Industry and Commerce to insert whatever safeguards we think are necessary.</P>
      <P>The question of the River Slaney was raised.  That comes up in every debate practically.  The suggestion was to allow the net men to extend their period of netting.  Under the law, I have no power to do a thing like that. The only power I have is to order a public inquiry, and at it a <i>prima facie</i> case must be made that, in the interests of the fisheries&mdash;remember now I am talking about the present law&mdash;and not in the interests of the net men, it would be right and wise to extend the period. From time to time we do hold these public inquiries to see if the circumstances have changed.  At the last public inquiry that was held, no evidence was produced to make the <i>prima facie</i> case that I have referred to.  That does not prove at all that conditions may not be changing, but in cases where they may be changing we hold these public inquiries from time to time to see if it is possible to make a change.</P>
      <P>I have already dealt with the question of nets and ropes.  I want to tell Deputy O'Leary that we are doing the best we can in getting these things, and that their distribution is as equitable as we can get it done.  Somebody said that we should get new nets, and, if not new nets, twine to make new nets, and that if we are not able to do that, we should get twine to mend the old nets.  I am afraid we are reduced in most cases to the third alternative, that is, we have to depend on twine for mending the old nets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Anthony spoke of the protection of the rivers.  When I brought in the 1939 Bill, which dealt, more or less, with the ownership of the estuarine fisheries and weirs, I said that I expected to have before the Dáil within a few years a consolidation of all the laws dealing with the inland fisheries, and that then I expected to be able to deal with such questions as <Col N="1221" /> the composition and method of election of boards of conservators and the protection of the rivers.  That is still the position.  Some progress is being made, not very much, I am afraid, but still some progress is being made towards a consolidation of the existing laws. When that is completed, I hope to be able to bring that Bill before the Dáil.  Having placed before the Dáil what the position is which that consolidation will show, we can then discuss whatever changes may be considered necessary for the future government of the inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>I do not think that what Deputy Anthony claimed is true, that there is a persistent decrease in the number of fish in our rivers.  The number for 1942 was well above the average.  It showed that there was quite a good supply of fish, and indicated that matters are not getting worse.  Deputy Kennedy advocated that we should relax our restrictions with regard to giving permission to people to fish, because we should look on the matter now not so much as one of sport, but rather as a question of procuring food. It would be a very dangerous thing to withdraw all restrictions.  I am afraid that we will have to carry on as we are, even though fish is a very important food.</P>
    <P>With regard to the mussels in the Boyne, which was raised by certain Deputies, I explained here before, when we iwere building the purification tank at Cromane in the County Kerry, that we looked upon it largely as an experiment.  I think everybody will agree that the experiment has been very successful, and that we would probably be justified in going ahead with the building of more purification tanks.  There is another aspect of it.  As well as being an experiment, we built it for the purpose of getting experience.  I think it would be well to get three or four years' experience of the working of that tank so that we may learn from our experts what are the advantages and what are the defects of the particular system that we have there.  We may, by waiting for three or four years, be able to make considerable improvement in other tanks that we may build in the <Col N="1222" /> future.  We are always impatient, I know, in regard to matters of this kind, but these tanks are going to be there for centuries to come. Therefore, I think it would be a pity not to wait for a few years in order to have the best possible results before us when we do come to put them together.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connolly spoke of the flight from the fisheries.  We have the flight from the land.  I would like to make the same point on this Estimate that I made on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, and that is that we are actually catching more fish now than we did six or seven years ago.  If there are less men fishing, it means that the men who are fishing are getting a very much better livelihood, and from that point of view it is all to the good.  I admit that it would, of course, be better still if we could have more men engaged in the fishing industry, all earning at least as much as those who have remained are earning, say, this year.  I have already pointed out the difficulty of providing extra equipment or extra fuel oil and I am afraid there is no hope of encouraging others to come into the fishing industry at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crowley raised the point of extending the week-end period so as to allow more salmon up.  There may be something to be said for that.  He then raised a highly controversial subject, namely, what particular type of salmon is best for spawning.  I do not want to go into that.  I think it could be better debated at, say, the Biological Society of University College, Dublin, or some such place, but I do not think, you will get two biologists or two rodsmen who will ever agree on that particular subject.  He said that if we tried this experiment it would take six or seven years to find out the result.  We do not mind that in the Fisheries Department.  When I went to the Forestry Department I was told that they were doing some experiments.  When I asked about the results they told me they would tell me the result in 150 years' time, and could not tell me sooner.  Deputy Crowley complained of a lack of <Col N="1223" /> democracy in our methods of electing boards of conservators.  I think his grievance was that the netsmen were getting more representation than they were entitled to as compared with the rodsmen.  Most people would take the view that we are following the dictates of democracy by giving the netsmen fair representation, but, strictly speaking, of course Deputy Crowley is probably right, that if we are giving them more than fair representation the thing is no longer democratic.  As I have said, the mode of election of boards of conservators and this whole question will have to be considered when the new Bill comes up.</P>

      <P>I heard what happened in Galway.  The position is that the law is a very old law.  It has been slightly amended on two occasions during the last 20 years, but, fundamentally, it is the same, and the position is that the owners of the fisheries have big representation, the netsmen have representation, and so have the rodsmen.  I must say that at first sight it looks a fair system, that those people should meet together and discuss how best the fisheries should be carried on with regard to protection and so on.  In a particular case, however, the general rule may have its defects and we may get very absurd results as the Galway people have claimed.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,836,654 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1944, for the Army and the Army Reserve (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts; and for certain administrative expenses in connection therewith; for the expenses of the office of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures; for Expenses in connection with the trial and detention of certain persons (No. 28 of 1939, No. 1 of 1940 and No. 16 of 1940, etc.); for certain Expenses under the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-Raid Precautions Act, 1939 (No. 21 of 1939); for Reserve Medical Supplies for Civilian Hospitals; for certain Expenses of the Local Defence Force (including Grants-in-Aid) (No. 28 of 1939); for certain Expenses in connection with the special Commemoration of the 1916 Rising; for certain Expenses in connection with the National Blood Transfusion Council; and for a grant to the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate for the Army Vote for the financial year 1943-44 shows a reduction on the previous year's Estimate of £434,418, despite the fact that, owing to the leap year, the increase in the rate of pay for private soldiers, and to new services, there should have <Col N="1225" /> been an automatic increase over last year's figure.  The reduction has been effected by a judicious pruning of every branch of Army expenditure, but it must be clearly understood that the present Estimate of £8,507,654 reflects not the Army's needs in men or its requirements in stores, but only the deliveries expected and the strength anticipated during the current year based on experience of the recent past.</P>
    <P>The record of the Army's activities during the past financial year contains many credit items and also a few debit factors.  On the credit side must be considered the progressive improvement in the conditions of service of soldiers during the year.  Outstanding here is the increase in the rate of pay. From 29th September, 1942, the pay of every private soldier in the Army has been increased by sixpence a day and, in addition to this actual increase of sixpence a day, every non-commissioned officer and private soldier will be credited with another sixpence a day, called deferred pay, because its payment is deferred until after the end of the emergency.</P>
    <P>Another improvement in the conditions of service is the extension of marriage allowance to all soldiers with two years' service.  That extension has practically absorbed all personnel already married but not hitherto entitled to the allowance, and, according as men of 23 years of age complete their two years' service, they will become automatically entitled to the allowance, if they marry.  During the previous financial year, the rates of marriage allowance were substantially increased and that increase coupled with the present extension has involved an increased cost of about £170,000 in the Estimate for 1943-44. Indeed, the total cost of the allowance for wives and children during the year is estimated at £618,418.  Finally, quite recently, we have, at considerable administrative expense, made marriage allowance payable weekly instead of fortnightly, as heretofore.</P>
    <P>The free annual leave voucher, previously introduced, continues to operate and involves an additional estimated expenditure of about <Col N="1226" /> £17,780.  There has also been introduced a free issue of dentures and spectacles to those in need of them, and, although the financial effect of these issues is not yet certain, it is expected that the cost will be at least £4,500.</P>
    <P>The improvements outlined deal with the material interests of the soldiers, but their spiritual needs have not been lost sight of.  During the year, there have been appointed additional fulltime chaplains so that practically every large unit in the Army has now its own chaplain to look after the spiritual interests of the men.  During last year's large-scale military exercises, the chaplains accompanied their units in the field and their example in the cheerful endurance of the stress, strain and fatigue of the exercises must have had no small effect on the morale of the units engaged.</P>
    <P>The physical fitness of the Army has considerably improved due to the constant training in the field of the various units.  The standard of health has remained at a high level and the Army has been free from any serious form of epidemic.  Discipline, too, has been well maintained and, during the past year, there have been very few cases of serious crime.</P>
    <P>By far the most important feature of the Army's activities during the year under review has been the large-scale exercises held during the autumn of 1942.</P>
    <P>The object of these exercises was to provide an opportunity for higher commanders to command their troops in the field and to give them practice in co-ordinating the team work of the different components of their commands. They were also designed to be a practical test of the tactical and technical training carried out during the previous two years, of the physical fitness and morale of all troops engaged and of the administrative capabilities of all units under severe conditions.</P>
    <P>They were the first exercises in which complete divisions have been exercised and maintained in the field. They were, moreover, the most prolonged exercises yet attempted, involving <Col N="1227" /> as they did long marches, continuous operations over a number of days and over varied terrain without regard to weather conditions.  In this way, since they were held under conditions outside the control of the formations concerned, they provided a real test of organisation and of the ability of these formations to take the field, to operate and maintain themselves under conditions of uncertainty.</P>
    <P>The result of the exercises from a military point of view is a matter for the General Staff of the Army, but, as far as the public is concerned, it may be said that the exercises showed clearly that the Army, in addition to its protective garrison and administrative duties, can now put into the field an effective striking force.</P>
    <P>Throughout the exercises, all ranks displayed a high standard of stamina and physical fitness, together with a cheerful disregard of every form of discomfort.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the much improved conditions of pay and allowances introduced at considerable cost during the year which has elapsed, we have failed to attract a satisfactory number of recruits. This failure seems to be mainly attributable to complacency on the part of the civil population generally, and, particularly, to a lack of responsibility and a false sense of security on the part of the youth of the country. There seems no doubt that if this country were faced with the dire threat of immediate war, its youth would respond, as always in the past, to the call to arms, and the failure of many to do so during the present emergency must, therefore, be attributed to their lack of appreciation of what is involved in the training of a modern army.  They do not yet realise that one trained soldier is of more value than any number of untrained recruits, and that, therefore, if they put off their joining the Army until there is a threat of immediate war, they may be too late to render any effective service in the defence of their country.  I, therefore, avail of this opportunity of once more impressing on the civil population generally and on the youth of the nation in particular, the urgent need <Col N="1228" /> of the Army for recruits and of their responsibility to see that the gaps in our ranks are filled without delay.</P>
    <P>The other chief item on the debit side of the account is one over which the Department has little or no control, the non-delivery of stores against the orders placed, especially for equipment of a warlike nature.  From this it must not be inferred that the delivery of such stores has ceased, but it does mean that we have not received all the stores which we have ordered. I am glad to say, however, that, over the period under review, we have received what may well be described as substantial deliveries of every form of military equipment.</P>
    <P>So much for the Army itself.  I will now deal with the L.D.F. Here, during the year, there has been a wastage, but that, I am glad to say, has been more than counter-balanced by a steady inflow of new recruits, so that now the strength of the force is not less than that of previous years.  The wastage has been due to a variety of causes such as waning enthusiasm and economic factors, but no small part of it has been due to the elimination of what may be termed dead-weight material; that is, men nominally on the registers but making no real or apparent effort to attend parades and exercises.  It is not suggested that all the dead-weight has been completely eliminated, but it can be said with some confidence that the great majority of the force is now fully effective.</P>
    <P>During the past year, special attention has been devoted to the fighting and personal equipment of the force, and all of the effectives have now been provided with uniforms, greatcoats, leggings and boots.  Its training, too, has been progressively maintained, and a modified form of battle drill with special attention to practical problems, mainly designed to train leaders in field duties, has been introduced. During the summer months special courses were held at the Curragh for district leaders and district training officers.</P>
    <P>The record of the other voluntary service, the A.R.P. service, has been one of steady progress during the year.  In the county boroughs and <Col N="1229" /> the scheduled urban areas there have been virtually completed the control and message centres, the air raid warning system, the wardens service, the rescue service, the casualty service, the distribution of respirators to the civilian population, and arrangements for the establishment of food and rest centres are well under way.</P>
    <P>The provision of public shelters in case of air raids has been actively pushed forward and there has already been provided adequate accommodation for about 70,000 persons.  In addition to the public shelters, 93 private firms have submitted plans for the construction of shelters for their employees and 33 firms have already completed shelters with capacity for about 10,170 persons.</P>
    <P>Progress has also been made in developing the Auxiliary Fire Service, and, in addition to providing about 113 static water tanks remote from existing water static supplies such as canals, rivers and ponds, existing static water sources have been adapted so as to make them available for fire fighting.</P>
    <P>In order to organise householders and business firms in elementary fire fighting arrangements and thus to locate and extinguish incendiary bombs as soon as they fall so as to prevent major conflagrations, an organiser for local fire prevention has been appointed in Dublin.  He has been dividing the central city area into suitable blocks and has been assisting in organising those particular city blocks which have been devising schemes of their own in advance of legislation on the subject.  In this connection I should mention that the Government have recently directed that an Order be made making it compulsory on occupiers of business premises to prepare schemes for the protection of their premises against fire, and in the case of local authorities to prepare fire-fighting schemes, not only for their own premises, but also for residential areas.</P>
    <P>In order to provide food and hot drinks for personnel of the Air Raid Precautions Service when working for long periods, four mobile canteens have been provided by the Dublin Corporation, and the Irish Red Cross <Col N="1230" /> Society has agreed to provide the necessary staff.</P>
    <P>Another subject which has been under active consideration is that of essential undertakings, i.e., undertakings whether public or private, such, as railways, the Electricity Supply Board, gas companies, waterworks and other concerns, the continuance of whose operations is deemed to be essential and who are required by the Act mainly to provide instruction in air raid precautions for their staffs, to supply shelter and equipment for them, to make arrangements for fire-fighting, to give special protection for key men and for vital points of their works, and to accumulate reserve stocks of spare parts and other essentials. Essential undertakings to the number of 149 have been requested to submit schemes in accordance with the Act. The schemes approved to date provide for shelter accommodation for about 3,000 employees, the training of 2,000 together with the supply of fire-fighting equipment and the provision of reserve stocks.</P>
    <P>The remarks made concerning the delivery of stores for the Army apply equally to stores needed for Air Raid Precautions Service.  Everything that could be done has been done to get all the stores and equipment necessary, but deliveries against orders have not been all that we desire.  We have, nevertheless, during the year received field boilers, fire engines, trailer pumps, respirators and a large assortment of tools.  During the year all stores delivered to local authorities have been inspected by the Department's officials and the results were on the whole satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Finally there has been evolved a scheme to operate in case of urgent necessity for the evacuation of certain categories of the civilian population of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire, and arrangements are being made for their reception, lodging, boarding and general welfare in specially selected reception areas.</P>
    <P>From this account of the progress of the Air Raid Precautions Service it must not be inferred that everything connected with the service is in a satisfactory condition or that the Government is viewing the present <Col N="1231" /> position with complacency.  There are still many gaps to be filled up in all the services but, especially, in the rescue, decontamination, and fire fighting services.  Some difficulties have occurred here and there throughout the year in connection with the serving personnel of the services. Many of these difficulties have already been ironed out, and it is to be hoped that the fine example shown by the serving members of the service in sacrificing their time and leisure in the interests of the civil population will have the effect of inducing others to fill up the gaps in their ranks and of making still further progress in developing the service during the period which lies ahead.</P>
    <P>The Estimate includes provision for the Office of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures and the Censorship Staff, the cost of which has increased by about £700.  This is accounted for in the main by normal incremental advances and the increase in the cost-of-living bonus under the Civil Service (Emergency Bonus) Regulations.</P>
    <P>During the year, recruiting for the Construction Corps was continued and, notwithstanding discharges totalling nearly 800 due to termination of service and on medical and other grounds, there were approximately 200 more boys in the corps at the end of last year than there were 12 months previously. This is not an unsatisfactory position, but I am aware, of course, that there is a very large number of unemployed boys who are eligible to join the corps and who have not done so.  By inculcation of discipline and a graduated introduction to manual work, good results are being obtained in improving physique and endurance and in fitting these boys of the corps for employment which would otherwise be beyond their physical capacity.  The corps training also includes instruction in the elementary educational subjects for all members and, where the limited opportunities allow, training is given to selected personnel in such subjects as mechanics, victualling, cooking, shoemaking, hairdressing, and so on, for which outlets exist, in the routine of the corps.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> During the past year, various types of work, such as road construction, fence construction, repairs to rifle ranges, drainage, trenching, and cable-laying, were undertaken by the corps for the Army.  Furthermore, personnel of the corps cut considerable quantities of turf and timber for Airny use.  Apart from these activities, the following civil work was in hands during the year:&mdash; (1) Road construction and quarrying at Glencree, County Wicklow, for the Special Employment Schemes Office; (2) timber felling at Glencree for the Department of Lands; (3) construction of a light railway at Clonsast for the Turf Development Board; (4) drainage and levelling work in connection with the development scheme at Tramore for the Irish Tourist Board.</P>
    <P>The reclamation work in Cluais, County Galway, which was suspended during last year, was again put in hands during the current year.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, in considering this Vote for £8,507,654, covering an establishment for all services of not more than 250,000 men, the Dáil may rest assured that the details of the Estimate making up that amount have been very carefully computed, that the most rigid control is being exercised over its expenditure, and that in due course all such expenditure will be duly accounted for, not only under the two legal heads of the published Estimate but also under the normal sub-heads of the Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to discuss this particular Vote, I want to express my protest against the continuation of carrying, within the Ministry of Defence, another Ministry.  That practice was reasonable enough in 1939, when the office of the Ministry for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures was established, the object of which was to include it within that of the Department of Defence, but, after all, nearly five years have passed since then, and I think that every Government Department and every individual Ministry should be answerable through the people to Dáil Eireann.  I believe that every Minister should be answerable to the Dáil for his Ministry and for the administration of his Department. <Col N="1233" /> This casual way of referring by a Minister to one of the Ministries under his Department seems to me to be something like a sweepstake, and that it is not treating the Dáil fairly.  I think that there would have been a good lot to be said, and a good deal of opposition to be expressed, as to the setting up of the Ministry for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, when it was introduced here, except for the fact that there was a state of emergency here, and I think that that is one reason why this Vote is introduced here, as a part of the Vote for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, with regard to the Department of Defence, I must say that I should like to commend everybody concerned to the attention of the Department&mdash; whether they be officers or men, or even the Minister himself&mdash;because of the progressive efficiency that is clear to all of us with regard to our Defence Forces&mdash;an efficiency that is clear even to the man in the street.  These men show, by their behaviour, their deportment, and the business-like way in which they go about their jobs, that they know what they are doing, and they are giving that impression to the ordinary man in the street.  From that point of view, everybody, including the Minister, is to be congratulated, but in facing up to this Vote, for the year 1943-44, when we are asked for the huge sum of £8,500,000, every Deputy must satisfy himself conscientiously: firstly, that the money is required, and, secondly, that the money is not required more urgently elsewhere.  I believe that in war times, and particularly in global-war times, the energies and resources of every country must be bent towards meeting whatever danger is most real and imminent at the moment. In the summer of 1940, following the collapse of France, and under the momentum of gigantic armies, which carried these armies to the west coast of Europe, of course, any country in Europe at that time had a right to be panicky or nervous as a result of the war situation, but I do not want to talk, nor do I presume to think that anybody here would want to talk, with any more knowledge of the situation that then existed than that which presented itself to the ordinary man in the <Col N="1234" /> street.  However, it was obvious to everybody that our position here was particularly vulnerable, and that it was particularly attractive to some of the belligerent nations.  Approaching the matter from the ordinary impartial view of the man in the street, looking at the map of the world, one can readily assume that one or other of the belligerents would say: &ldquo;There is a little island which we could use for our advantage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was, undoubtedly, an attraction, not alone to one side of the belligerents, but to all sides&mdash;to come in and take advantage of our position in that particular year.  Any sum that would have been asked for by the Government in that period would not have been considered excessive if it were to be devoted to the saving of our country from any attack by any of the belligerents.  If, in that situation, it meant that a half, or even a quarter of our population would have to starve, in order to meet the emergency, it would not have been considered unnecessary.  That was the position in 1939, 1940, and possibly in 1941.  We had no L.D.F. then, and we were asked for a sum of about half what we are asked for now; yet, we are told that that was the sum required for the defence of this country.  As a result of that effort, we not only gave the Army tens of thousands of volunteer soldiers&mdash;and that is nearly four years ago&mdash;but many thousands of men who joined the regular forces.  Now, I do not want to encourage the belief that there is no danger now, but I am sure that nobody is going to say that the danger is as real or imminent now as it was in 1940 and 1941.  Our strength is immeasurably greater than it was then.  From the point of view of the war in Europe, it looks as if the soldiers on one side or the other are, so to speak, neutralising one another, and that, as a result of extensive and expensive ventures overseas, the time has gone by in which to embark on new adventures, and that as far as the importance of this island as a steppingstone for the supply of great armies in Europe from the western continent is concerned, alternative arrangements of a vast kind have been made so that <Col N="1235" /> this little island fortunately has been by-passed.</P>
    <P>Even assuming that we must to the very end be prepared to meet any danger that might come our way, it is the function of the Minister for Defence not only as the head of the Ministry of Defence but as a member of the Government to see that in war time the resources and the wealth of a little country such as this are directed towards meeting the danger that is most imminent.  I think the danger that is most imminent at the moment is one of supplies, and not only of getting supplies.  There is no good in getting supplies if the supplies cannot be bought.  Whatever supplies may be there at the moment, whether from overseas or home-produced, circumstances are necessitating a bounding increase in prices from month to month, and our main trouble for the remainder of this war is to see that the people of this country are properly fed. Food cannot be produced&mdash;and it would be unreasonable to expect it to be produced&mdash;except there is a reasonable margin of profit left to the producer. With increasing prices of every implement, every instrument, every article used, the price of the finished article must go up.</P>
    <P>At the present moment that price is completely outside the reach of the poor families of this country.  We have reached a point in this war emergency when we must face up to this: that if we are to continue to get food produced it must be paid for and that the price giving a profit to the producer is entirely out of reach of the poorer families.  If we could devote £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 to subsidising food and the necessaries of life so that the producer would get a reasonable price and the consumer would get an article reasonably cheap, I believe we would be taking a sounder step in the defence of the country than by spending it on arms and armaments.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Department of Defence, without demobilising a single soldier, lean a bit more towards the hundreds of thousands of young volunteers, who have come forward to give their time and their services in an unpaid capacity, to act alongside a <Col N="1236" /> central, highly trained, skilled and expert little army, to let those who want to get out of the Army, having done three or four years' training, into the L.D.F., where their experience and their training will make that splendid force a still better force.  I do not believe in, or do not advocate, the demobilisation of a single soldier but there are very many men who came forward at the time of an apparently real crisis, leaving their trade, their business, their farms, to spring into the gap of danger, to offer their services against a danger which they believed was just around the corner.  That danger passed but the world war is not yet over and those men are still retained in the Army, their trade neglected, their business shrinking.  These men are trained men now.  Most of the soldiers fighting throughout the world at the present moment have not got a fraction of the training that even our L.D.F. has got.  The number of professional soldiers on all sides now would not represent 5 per cent. of the armies.  The balance, 95 per cent., is made up of civilian soldiers, not as trained as our L.D.F., not as trained as men who have given two or three years' service to the country within the army.  If men who want to get out within a limit fixed by the Minister, were allowed to get out, to resume a trade or business, some definite approach to this problem could be envisaged.  We are not a vast continent; we are a tiny little island.  These men are patriotic young men.  They sprang to the colours immediately the call went out.  If danger swerved again in our direction, a wireless message would get 99 per cent. of them.  In the meantime they would be helping on the farms, maintaining their families and serving the nation, outside as well as inside.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to realise that we are reaching a very serious situation in this country with regard to food.  It is only two days ago since the Minister for Supplies brought in an Order fixing the price of eggs at 4/- a dozen&mdash;4d. an egg.  That is not going to worry the wealthy household. Eggs will still go into the middle-class <Col N="1237" /> household but is there a single wife of a labouring man or an unemployed man in the City of Dublin who can afford to buy eggs at 4d. each?  The infant child, the most helpless member of the human race, the tiniest infant, requires two pints of milk a day and the price of milk is going up every three months.  Would the Minister reckon the daily cost of a bottle fed infant?  What is happening as prices go up?  In the better class household there is a bit of grumbling&mdash;nothing more.  The money is there, the article can still be purchased, there is, no less food going into the house.</P>
    <P>But what happens in the humble home?  What happens even in the home of the steady workman who has never been out of work, when butter bounces to-day, milk leaps up tomorrow, meat doubles its price in the course of the year and eggs go up to 4d. each?  It is not a case of grumbling there and buying the article.  A point is reached when the wages cannot keep up the gallop as the price of the egg, the pint of milk, the pound of meat and the pound of butter increases. What happens there?  Only one thing.  There is less bought.  There is less food and the Ministry of Defence should particularly be concerned about the health of the oncoming generation.  You see by the reports in your daily papers, by the reports from health visitors, by the reports of those living amongst the youth of the country, that health is deteriorating, and the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Local Government will tell you that is so.  There is no money available to assist them, there is no money available to subsidise food, there is no money available to wade in in a big way, as they had to do in Great Britain, so as to see that, where the price the producer was guaranteed, a cheap price to the consumer was also guaranteed by filling the gap by subsidies. That is the choice that I, for one, feel I have to face up to as an individual Deputy when I am asked for £8,500,000 here and where I am told on another occasion that a matter of £50,000 cannot be found because all our money is wanted for defence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> This Vote for defence is going up and up and up.  Although the voluntary unpaid defence force, the L.D.F., has gone up from nothing to well over 100,000 men, yet this Army Vote keeps going up and up.  One would imagine that a sum of £1,000,000 or £1,500,000 counted for nothing.  A sum of £1,500,000 per annum in this country means the difference between a, half-fed, a half-starved child population in the majority of the homes and a fairly comfortable child population fairly and reasonably fed in the majority of the homes.  That is the choice we have to make.  But, when we had no L.D.F., when the necessity for food subsidisation was not half as great, the maximum sum asked for by the Army was £1,500,000 less than to-day.  If we had the money to spare, I would say that the mistake the Minister was making was asking for £8,000,000 instead of £80,000,000, because, to tell you the truth, my belief is that if we have to face invasion, it is a joke to be talking in terms of £8,000,000.  We might be able to throw up something worth while if we could talk in terms of £80,000,000.  But, seeing that our poverty is such and that our resources are so limited, we have to take the hard choice as to how best to spend what we have to spend.  I would take a risk with regard to the security of the whole country before I would deliberately see a half-starved generation growing up.  There is no case of risk there&mdash;that is a certainty, that is a fact.  The other risk is just the possibility. We can all have our opinions as to how great the risk is, whether it is receding or coming nearer.  One person's opinion is as good as another's. My view is that that particular danger is receding.  But the other danger, the danger of starvation, the certainty of partial starvation in many homes, is not a matter of opinion.  It is not a matter of speculation.  It is a matter of dead, certain fact, and it is a matter of fact that is within the knowledge of the Government.</P>
    <P>I should like that the Minister for Defence, as a Deputy for Dublin City, would sit down to the details of that particular Estimate asking for £8,500,000 per year and see whether <Col N="1239" /> his defence machine, splendid as it is, with the splendid force of unpaid men that rallied to it, could not be fed for, say, £1,500,000 less.  It would be within his own knowledge how that £1,500,000 could be spent certainly in the interests of the nation and not spent in a direction where there is any doubt as to the danger.  In expressing those views I am expressing my own views, and I am expressing views based only on my deductions from what appears in the daily papers.</P>
    <P>On some detailed questions with regard to the Army, I should like Army headquarters and the Minister in particular, to inject a little bit more of ordinary family humanity into the machine.  I should like the Minister and G.H.Q., while acting fully in the military sense, to face up more to their responsibility as head of a great family.  There is no doubt about it that, without interfering with the efficiency of the Army as a whole, without in any way creating any disorganisation, there could be a lot more humanity inside the machine.  As I said earlier, tens of thousands of men, who joined for the duration of the emergency, who joined in the big rush in 1940 and 1941, were of opinion that there was fighting coming and were determined that they were not going to be found leaning back, that they were going to be as trained as they could be and that they were going to play their part.  None of them visualised three years or four years or five years in the Army.  Many of them left wives and children at home.  Many of them left widowed mothers at home. Many of the mothers have become widowed since.  Would it create any great disorganisation in the Army, seeing that it is a kind of emergency Army, that has to be held for the full duration of the emergency and that we have no say or voice in deciding how long or how short that emergency will be, to see that where possible, or as far as possible, every married soldier or every soldier with a widowed mother was posted as near as possible to his home?  Every one of us here has handled dozens of applications where a married soldier is posted, say, <Col N="1240" /> down in Youghal while his wife is in Athlone.  There are a few hundred men in Athlone and a few hundred men in Youghal.  Surely an internal system of transfers could be carried out, at all events with regard to the young married men, so that they could on their evenings off lend a hand to till a plot, to drag a cart-load of turf, to chop up wood, or to ensure that the children at least know their daddy. I find that applications of that kind do not go through very easily.  If we are to have a good emergency Army&mdash;not engaged in fighting but just beating time against the day when danger might come&mdash;the mental comfort of every individual soldier should be looked after as carefully as his bodily comfort.  I do not care how well you house or clothe or feed a man, if his heart is gnawed out of him with anxiety for those at home, he is irritated by the thought that he could be there as easily as any one of another 100 soldiers if the machine allowed him.  Little things like that count, and I would like to see those little things looked into.  The amount of temporary disorganisation caused by the carrying out of the reshuffle would not be very great.  One of the big problems in a big army in time of peace is to keep everybody healthily occupied, and, if nothing else, there is a certain amount of staff occupation in carrying that out.</P>
    <P>The question of marriage allowances is a running sore and it is increasing. The marriage allowance is a regulation common to all armies in normal times. As far as I know, in an emergency, or in war, the restrictive conditions disappear in most, if not all, armies, and every married man, by right of being married, gets his allowance.  We met that situation in this country to the extent that in the past it was necessary for a man to be 25 or 26 years of age and to have five years' service before he could get married.  Now it is 23 years of age and two years' service. I think the age restriction is quite defensible, but I would question the two years' service qualification.  You are not dealing with a normal Army.  It is not a professional standing Army.  It is an emergency Army, rushed together <Col N="1241" /> to meet an emergency, and those conditions of two years' service before a man can get a marriage allowance are the normal peace-time regulations of a small standing Army.  They are not reasonable regulations to impose on an emergency Army, a war Army.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister say in 1940 that the emergency was going to last for two years?  Every man officially married takes the age limit as being reasonable, but every man that is regularly married should get the marriage allowance. If we are going to deal with millions of pounds, surely it is not right that the wife and the children of any soldier of the State should be branded as destitute and should come on the home help list?  From the taxpayers' point of view, it is Tweedledum and Tweedledee whether it comes out of one pocket or the other pocket.  The families have to be maintained, whether out of the Army Vote or public funds, but it is degrading that the families of soldiers of Ireland's little Army should be compelled to brand themselves as destitute.</P>
    <P>Is not that a grand headline to set to employers?  The example to an employer should be the State, and that certainly is an example which we would not like to see followed by any employer in the State.  I put it to the Minister that he is dealing with huge sums of money, and, perhaps, this emergency will not last as long as we think, and that in the time he has that Army, the fellows who came forward as volunteers should be treated properly.  Treat them in a way that will get the respect of people outside. It may be a big bill.  The bill has got to be reckoned in terms of two years, but, certainly, the bill as far as the taxpayer is concerned has got to be paid.  He is paying it for home help when it is met out of public funds.  He will pay in the same way on this Vote, but to inject the normal regulations of peace time into a wartime emergency Army is entirely unreasonable.  That is the one point I want to make in regard to allowances.</P>
    <P>Another point is this: we all handle applications from trained soldiers, men of two or three years' service, for indefinite <Col N="1242" /> leave.  To a very great extent that is granted where it is required for agricultural purposes, but not in every case, and not very speedily.  It is granted to students who want to get on with a course of studies.  But, in every case that I have come across outside those two classes, it is not granted.  Now, an apprenticeship to a a carpenter or to a cobbler or to any other tradesman is just as important to that boy and his parents as the career of a student of any particular profession, and if the Army can allow one class of youths out to resume professional studies then the same should apply to everybody sufficiently trained to go on indefinite leave, where he has an occupation to go to.  I do not think, in fact, that if a real emergency came upon us, and if some considerable numbers of your present trained soldiers were at home between this and then, you would lose as much as half a dozen men when the call would go out, and they would be no less efficient as soldiers.</P>
    <P>On this question of the treatment of individual soldiers, men are being turned out of the army medically unfit. A good number of them are found to be tubercular and a note is sent to some practitioner in the county that Private so and so is about to be discharged suffering from tuberculosis, and that arrangements should be made with regard to his disposal. For the information of the Department of Defence, I want to say this, and I am saying it with knowledge and a certain amount of experience, to quote the old phrase about the camel going through the eye of a needle, that animal would go through that particular passage with much greater ease than one of us can get a bed in an Irish sanatorium.  The Minister for Defence is head of a great State Department, and if he wants x or 2x or 4x beds for patients who are soldiers of the Army, he can get them like that, while others cannot. What is happening is that those men are going home and spreading the disease in their homes, and it is months before the best efforts of anybody down the country can get them into a sanatorium.  That is a thing that can be done by the Minister and <Col N="1243" /> it is not a case of arguing about one half-penny.</P>
    <P>We are arguing and talking of human lives, not only the lives of the particular soldiers who are diseased and given a chance of recovery, but the lives of those they are sent home to infect.  There is any amount of premises&mdash;every good looking building from here to Donegal and from here to Skibbereen is in the hands of the Department of Defence at the present moment.  You could, within the property that is controlled by the Department of Defence, turn this country into a tuberculosis patients' Utopia. You have an unlimited number of the best sanatoria that could be found and they are standing there empty and idle against the time when something may happen, but as against that, something is happening every hour every day.  You have tubercular soldiers going out and causing new cases again as a result of that.  Is it beyond their capacity and powers, or is it asking too much from the Department of Defence that they would utilise, equip and staff some of those beautiful buildings that are now standing empty in the most beautiful places of Ireland, and turn them into sanatoria or convalescent homes for the young lads who came forward when we all asked them to come, and who lost their health and strength in the service of this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there is a medium provided for the purpose of discussing the broader questions of Defence in this country, I do not desire to press the wider issues which might normally arise on this Vote.  With Deputy O'Higgins, I think it is regrettable that we must spend such a large sum of money on defence purposes, a great deal of which may be of a very negative character, but unlike Deputy O'Higgins I do not think it is easy for us to shed liability and responsibility in that regard.  After all our expenditure on defence purposes is not incurred by our own volition.  The movements of armies elsewhere, the threat of invasion from one side or <Col N="1244" /> another, and the intensity of the European military conflict may compel us to resort to methods of defence which are forced upon us because of extern circumstances, and I think that, whether we like it or not, it has been the experience of neutrals that did not believe in a military expansionist policy, that for the duration of this war, expenditure on defence is an insurance for the nation against the possibility of attack and invasion, so far as you can get any insurance in financial expenditure during a war of gigantic magnitude such as we are experiencing to-day.</P>
      <P>One hopes that eventually this expenditure will be adequate insurance for the whole nation, and that for the rest of the world conflict we may be spared the horrors, the privations, the appalling devastation and the terrific slaughter of human life which unfortunately is the lot of the greater part of the world to-day, whether it is in respect of armies on the battlefield or the civilian population at home.  It is generally recognised, however, that expenditure of a military character, necessary though it may be, does not of itself produce any great improvement in the economic or social conditions of a nation, but in our circumstances and the world circumstances as we see them to-day, it is perhaps too Olympian to hope that so long as the world is in arms, we can escape expenditure of the magnitude presented in this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to discuss broad questions of defence policy here publicly, but I wish to raise matters of administration&mdash;matters which I think with a leavening of humanitarianism might do a great deal to improve the lot of the tens of thousands of regular soldiers, of duration soldiers and of men who have joined the Defence Forces as auxiliaries to the normal defence machine.  With every other Party in the House I want to pay a tribute to the magnificent service the nation has received from the thousands of men and women when the nation looked to be in the throes of a crisis. They have served faithfully during the past four years.  They have given of their best to equip themselves for the <Col N="1245" /> nation's defence.  They have borne the rigours and privations inseparable from military life, and a grateful nation should make sure, so far as it can, by the exercise of pressure on the Department and the Government, that those who have given up their freedom in civilian life, and who have undertaken the hardships of military life should be treated as well as it is possible for the nation to treat them.  It is to that aspect of this Estimate that I want to draw attention.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the granting of agricultural leave.  I think it is true that the Department grants it liberally, and in that respect I have no complaint, but I have a complaint against the conditions.  A person with five or ten acres of land may join the Army.  He may have been employed on the roads, in the bogs or on other local activities of one kind or another.  He knows that the land is the best source of insurance against privations for his wife and family.  He knows there is a national demand for the production of more food, and he applies for leave in the spring to go back to plough, harrow, and sow his land so that when the harvest comes there may be food for the household to maintain the family.</P>
    <P>I think it is praiseworthy activity on behalf of the soldier.  He might very well say that the land had to lie there until he came out, but for the purpose of providing for his family, he wants to utilise the land.  He makes application for agricultural leave and it is granted.  He goes to work on his land but, bear this in mind&mdash;during the 28 days of agricultural leave, he gets no pay from the Army, his wife gets no marriage allowance and the children get no allowance, so that as far as the ordinary soldier is concerned, he leaves the Army and his wife and children get no allowance.  Everybody who has any knowledge at all of agriculture knows perfectly well that ploughing and sowing land is not at all times a remunerative proposition. It is a time of expenditure, and if a small man with five or ten acres of land has no income, and is faced with a position of having to get land ploughed, perhaps to get assistance and to seed it, that man's financial <Col N="1246" /> plight can very easily be imagined. Nobody could pretend to believe that we pay our soldiers well and, recognising that, and the fact that a number have left the land for the purpose of national defence, the Army authorities might recognise the claims of these soldiers to be paid some allowance during leave.  They are doing valuable work, and are doing it not merely in the interests of their family, but in the interests of the whole nation.</P>
    <P>They are keeping land from going to waste; they are keeping land from deteriorating and I think it is rather unfair and, if I may say so without being desirous of being captiously critical, rather mean of the Army authorities to give a man a month's leave without any pay, knowing the circumstances under which that man joined the Army for the emergency and knowing, too, that at the time he gets the month's leave he is ill-equipped financially to undertake the task of ploughing and sowing his small area of land.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring that matter to the notice of the Minister.  I know, from contact with him, that he has a sympathetic interest in those in the Army.  I know, of course, that the matter is not wholly one for the Minister to decide, but I think the Minister should take his stand on this principle, that he is the Minister responsible for the organisation of an Army which is a credit to the whole nation, and is entitled to go to the Cabinet as often as he likes, fortified all the time with the authority and the pride of the nation, and ask the Cabinet to provide better conditions for those soldiers in circumstances such as those to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer is the allocation of soldiers to various units.  With other Deputies, I have raised with the Department of Defence a large number of cases where soldiers are away from their wives and families.  In many cases those soldiers are anxious to get back for the purpose of looking after a piece of turbary, a piece of land, the cutting of turf or timber and, generally, assisting in the management of households. But although many cases of <Col N="1247" /> that kind have been represented to the Department of Defence, my experience &mdash;and I think from discussions I have had with them it is the experience of most other Deputies&mdash;is that it is extremely difficult, in a large number of cases, to induce the Army authorities to transfer a man either to his own home town or a place near his home town.</P>
    <P>We are not dealing with an army of millions.  This is not the Eastern front. We have not a 2,000-mile terrain to look after.  We are dealing with, probably, one of the smallest armies in Europe, numerically not a very large army, and it ought not to be impossible in these circumstances for the Army authorities to make some arrangement of a human kind whereby soldiers who are serving away from their home towns will be transferred to units which are stationed in these towns or close to them.  There is no use in pretending it is impossible to do that.  The Minister may reply that a person who joins the Army must put up with all that kind of inconvenience. If the Minister makes that reply I will say that it is just a brass-hat outlook on this whole question.  The Minister is not a professional brass hat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This war will be over a very long time before you make much progress at the present rate. The Minister is simply a Minister for Defence and I can quite understand that folk in the Army may say to him: &ldquo;Mr. Minister, you cannot do it.  This has always been the practice and you must not pet and humour these soldiers too much.&rdquo;  I want to stiffen his back, and I say to him that he must recognise he is a civilian Minister for Defence and the kind of steelish notion that impregnates military folk must have no place in the make-up of a civilian Minister for Defence.  His job is to protect the rights of the civilian soldiers, because in the main that is what the Army is composed of.  I hope that the Minister, now that he has indicated <Col N="1248" /> that a scheme of this kind is under way&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that we are doing it as far as it is humanly possible to do it.  It is in the interest of the Army to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will look over his replies to Parliamentary questions from time to time, I am sure he will be surprised&mdash;although they are all written in his name.  It may not be possible in all cases to do as I suggest.  You may not be able to transfer an artilleryman stationed at Cork to an area where only an infantry battalion is stationed.  One can understand that.  And you cannot transfer one of the infantry into an area where only artillerymen are stationed.  But at the same time every effort ought to be made to transfer soldiers as near to their home towns as possible.  Generally speaking, the type of impatience which military folk are inclined to display when they get applications of this kind should not have any place in the civil administration of the Department of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Married allowances to serving soldiers have been referred to here and elsewhere on many occasions.  I think we are not treating the dependents of the married soldier fairly.  The allowances which we pay to them are small, smaller probably than is paid in any army in the world which Irishmen join, even in exile.  We are privileged, perhaps, in that we have not the same financial commitments that other armies, other countries engaged in war have, but I think we have a heavy moral responsibility to the dependents of married men who join the Army and the dependents of men who marry after they join.  I am sure the Minister will not pretend to believe that the scale of Army allowances is such as to provide a decent standard of living. The scale is altogether too low. It cannot be justified by reference to the standard of living or to any decent concepts of life.  I think a further effort should be made to increase the scale of allowances which are so inadequate.  I know from personal experience that the dependents of married soldiers have had to put up <Col N="1249" /> with an intolerably low standard of living.  It seems, to me to be very unfair that a soldier's wife and children should be compelled to tolerate that low standard of living when his service in the Army is for the purpose of protecting the coinnninity, many members of which enjoy a very much higher standard of living than that which is the lot of the soldier's family.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this Army allowance question.  I refer to the position of the young man who joins the Army leaving, perhaps, an aged father and mother at home, perhaps leaving a father at home who is working when the son joins the Army. Many such boys joined the Army four years ago.  Economic circumstances in the towns or the rural areas have probably forced the father out of employment, or perhaps ill-health or advancing years have helped to do it.  The son is still in the Army.  When the father was working, things at home were not so bad, but when the father is out of work and the family income is either nil or has dwindled rapidly, it seems unfair in such circumstances, with the son the main contributor to the family wage pool, that no allowance should be paid.  I think the Minister could urge on the Government that where a young man of that type is in the Army, leaving at home people virtually wholly dependent upon him, there should be a scale of allowances just as there is in the case of the married soldier who has a family to provide for.</P>
    <P>It may not be easy to draw the line in a case of that kind, but in other spheres of legislation we have been able to define total and partial dependency. If it is not possible to make an allowance in an automatic way, it ought to be possible to devise a scale by which, where the son joins the Army, and leaves the family to which he normally contributed or in existing circumstances would contribute in a substantial way, an allowance would be paid.  These are administrative matters outside the realm of our broad defensive policy, but they are matters which affect the daily lives of the soldiers and the families of those <Col N="1250" /> soldiers.  If we are going to surmount what in every country has been found to be a natural disinclination on the part of people to join the Army, we can probably do that best by making the Army attractive.  The Army can be made attractive only when we give the soldiers decent conditions of service, pay them reasonably well and make full provision for their families. These are administrative matters, and I hope that the Minister, when replying, will be able to tell us that, whatever about the position in the past, he realises that the Army has given good service to the nation and that, as Minister for Defence, he will spare no effort to secure, by approach to the Government, that the conditions of the soldiers will be further improved on the lines I have broadly indicated in the course of my few remarks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins has covered virtually all the points upon which I desire to touch.  I, with other members of the House, pay tribute to the magnificent qualities of our Army, but I make an appeal to the Minister on behalf of the men and their wives and children.  Several times I have raised the question of the inadequacy of their allowances.  An hour ago, passing down one of our principal streets in a working-class quarter in the city, a woman called after me.  She had a newly-born baby in her arms and she said: &ldquo;They are giving me 3d. a day for it, and a bottle of milk costs 4½d.&rdquo;  That occurred in a street within five minutes' walking distance from here.  She does not get even the price of a bottle of milk for the baby.  With the rapid increase in the cost of living, are we not justified in asking the Minister to give the dependents of these men, at least, the same increase that these soldiers would have got if they had continued to follow their ordinary avocations and had made application to the Wages Tribunal? Their wages would, in that way, have been increased by 7/- or 8/- a week. Surely they are, at least, entitled to the increase they would have got if they had continued working at the docks or at some factory.  I have been asked dozens of times to mention this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> Last week, I raised the question of the boy and girl marriage&mdash;the young soldier of 20 years of age, the girl of 18 and the baby.  I read a letter in this House in which a young woman told me that her mother and herself had gone to the pawn office and pledged their bed-clothes to get ready for the young woman to go into the Rotunda Hospital.  She was a soldier's wife.  The next thing that happened was that an application was received by the Dublin Board of Assistance, better known as the Poor Law Board, for a grant to enable that woman to keep herself and her baby while her young husband was serving in the Army on a single man's pay.  I believe that there are at least 300 or 400 of that type of boy and girl marriages in the City of Dublin and the parties are living on a starvation allowance.  The girl goes to her mother to live and brings the baby with her.  I do not think that an Irish Government should stand for that much longer.  We should impress on the Minister and the brass hats referred to by one of the speakers that they cannot stop these boy and girl marriages by some regulation in the Army.  Under this regulation, soldiers are not to get married until they are 23 years of age and have had two or three years' service. If a soldier who is 23 but who is not qualified by service gets married he gets only a single soldier's pay.  I think it was Deputy Cosgrave, junior, who referred to the cases of young men with full service but under age who could not get the marriage allowance. I know that every member of the House has letters similar to those sent me about the hardships being suffered by the wives and children of our Army men.</P>
    <P>The marriage allowance, where granted, is not sufficient.  I have seen soldiers' children every day during the past week barefooted simply because the mother could not afford, out of the small pay her husband receives, to buy seven or eight pairs of boots at the price which they are to-day.  They are practically unpurchaseable.  Therefore, I say that the Minister should instantly see that something is done to secure that the men in the Army <Col N="1252" /> will get the same treatment that they would have got if they had continued working in the jobs which they left when the emergency occurred.  Some of them thought that the emergency would last only for a year or two. Having declared their allegiance to the country and their preparedness to defend it, they thought that they would be allowed to return to their work.  Now, they see their workmates getting increases&mdash;and rightly so&mdash; which they are not getting.  I appeal to the Minister and to every member of the House to consider those points.</P>
    <P>Another case came under my notice which may be justified according to military law but which I think is a shame.  It is the case of a woman with a large family.  When her husband, who is a soldier, is at home and she receives his ration allowance, her position is not too bad.  But this case resembles the unfortunate case mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins.  It is a case in which the man was suffering from T.B. and went to hospital.  He was in a hurry to leave hospital.  Why was that?  Because he wanted his wife to have the ration allowance when he was at home.  When he went into hospital&mdash;a military hospital at that&mdash; the Government stopped his ration allowance owing to the hospital regulations or some Army regulation.  I do not think that that is a proper thing to do.  It may be said that, when the man is not at home, his wife has not to provide rations for him and that, therefore, she loses nothing by his going into hospital.  Every one of us knows that where food is bought for a family and is being cooked on the same fire, the ration allowance is of benefit to the family. I think the Minister ought to consider that point and see that the ration allowance is not stopped when a man goes sick.  That is the time to give the allowance to his wife and family.  It should not be taken from them and given to a State hospital.  We know that when an old age pensioner goes into the Dublin poor law institution, 8/- a week is stopped from the pension, and that the balance is left to the pensioner. I do not think that is proper.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins covered most of the points that I wished to refer to. <Col N="1253" /> I make a final appeal to the Minister that where allowances are being paid they be increased, and, further, that in the case of the boy and girl marriages the Minister will see that the soldier's wife and child in Dublin will not have to depend upon poor law assistance.</P>

      <P>For some time there has been a growing feeling in the country that the expenditure on the Army is altogether in excess of the needs of the present situation.  Deputies in all parts of the House, as well as the people outside, have felt that the question of the strength of the Army and the amount of money which should be devoted to national defence were matters primarily for the Defence Conference.  I would like to ask what has become of this alleged Defence Conference?  Has it been dissolved or disbanded?  To-day we heard Deputy O'Higgins who, I understood, was a member of it, advocating a very drastic reduction in the strength of the Army, as well as a very drastic cut in defence expenditure.  If these, questions have not been dealt with by the Defence Conference, I do not see what particular use that body serves at the present time.</P>

      <P>If the Minister does not <Col N="1254" /> want to disclose the information, I am not prepared to press him.  It seems rather strange to me that we should have this question of the strength of the Army, and the amount devoted to defence, brought up by a member of that conference.  I am entirely in agreement with Deputy O'Higgins.  I think that the situation has changed very materially since 1940, and that there is a very strong case for reducing the strength of our Defence Forces and the amount of expenditure on defence. Money is more urgently needed to-day to provide for a more important line of defence, namely, the provision of the essential food and fuel requirements of the nation.  Deputy O'Higgins pointed out that this money could be employed in a more desirable way, that is in closing the gap between the cost of production and the price which the consumer has to pay.  That is a policy which the members on these benches have been persistently advocating, and it seems to be one which is long overdue.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, a reasonable case for reducing the strength of the Army can be supported by the need which arises for staggering the volume of demobilisations from the Army.  As everybody realises, it would be a most undesirable situation for the country to have to face if the major portion of the Army were to be demobilised in a short space of time.  If it were possible, as I believe it is owing to the change in the international situation, to transfer men gradually from the Army to civilian occupations over a period of months or even over a period of years, if would make for greater stability. It would enable those men to get established in their civilian occupations with the minimum amount of disorganisation, difficulty and confusion. In addition, some of the money which would be spared in reducing the strength of the Army could be devoted to the purpose of establishing those ex-members of the Defences Forces in civilian occupations, and in supplementing their earnings in fuel or food production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy O'Higgins has made a very strong case for a reduction in the amount of this Estimate.  I think it will be the duty of the Minister, <Col N="1255" /> when replying, to defend the Estimate and to convince the House as to the need for this huge volume of expenditure, unreduced to any great extent or only to a small extent, having regard to the amount involved as compared with last year and the preceding year. I think that the Minister roust be prepared, cow that the Defence Conference has, apparently ceased to function, to come forward and tell the House exactly what danger he really fears, and to what extent the international situation is the same as it was when it was decided to expand defence expenditure in 1940.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has often occurred to me, when listening to debates of this character and hearing the eulogies poured out on the soldiers who give service to their country&mdash; when we hear people telling us of the pride that they take in the Army&mdash;to wonder how much pride the ordinary private soldier takes in the people and nation whose safety he has enrolled himself to safeguard, secure and protect. I say that, especially, when we realise that in so many ways and forms we treat the average private soldier as some form of helot, some type of sub-human being that in some way is not allowed to associate with the ordinary citizen or to enjoy the ordinary rights and privileges conferred by the State on every citizen above a certain age.  It is a peculiar feature that in this country we did not attempt to break away from a certain mental attitude adopted by another country towards its ordinary private soldiers.  We seem to have carried over to our military life all the bad and evil conceptions of the British Army whereby the ordinary private British soldier is treated as a sort of outcast among the great mass of the people.  Whether that is due to the peculiar lines along which our defence policy is built up, or whether it is that we have just inculcated into our small Army all those vicious principles, I do not know.  But it is a peculiar thing that in this country, where the name of soldier, in our struggle, carried a very high tradition, we are on a level with those countries that, have always <Col N="1256" /> treated their soldiers as merely a form of cannon fodder: that we have kept them on the lowest conditions possible, and have never attempted from the early days to follow a better headline, to treat our men who go into the Army, not as people cast into the outer darkness whom we hliould shun and ask to live at the lowest possible level of existence, but as citizens who have taken upon themselves an added responsibility and an added duty, and are therefore entitled to additional protection.  So far as I am aware, there are only two Governments in the world which have done that.  One is the Labour Government in Australia, where the ordinary private soldier enjoys a rate of pay commensurate with that paid to skilled workers outside and all the privileges and rights of a citizen.  We, unhappily, have followed the other course.</P>
      <P>It is somewhat difficult to discuss the actual details of a Vote of this kind, and I think it would be as well for Deputies who feel, if you like, that the amount is too great and who would like to see it reduced to realise, when dealing with the types of individuals whom we refer to under the title of &ldquo;brasshats&rdquo;, that once you give them something, it is very hard to get it back.  You will not get it back merely by appealing to their better instincts or by pointing to the needs of ordinary women and children.  The debate on such a matter has to be a major debate and it is necessary to bring in all the principles of the entire strategic policy of the country and that is something which is not possible at the moment. There is, however, another way in which it could be approached, and that is not merely to suggest that the Vote should be reduced, but to endeavour to formulate ways and means of obtaining this money, so that this huge sum of £8,500,000 might not be taken away from what are, to my mind, the even more vital needs of the welfare not only of our women but of our future generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think many of us must have been struck from time to time by the thought that it is an illogical procedure to equip and train an Army, to ask <Col N="1257" /> our men to bear arms and risk their lives in the defence of their country, when we expose the children of these men to premature death, disease and all the ravages which follow a low diet, a low standard of living.  If there is anything valuable in this country, surely it is not merely the property, the sticks and stones, that we have, and surely it is not even the general vague principles of nationality and freedom about which we talk so much. Surely it is the people of the country and not those of us who have already completed the greater part of our span of life, but the little children who are to come after us and carry on the race and tradition.  Yet, in building our Army and in providing a sum of £8,500,000 for it, we do not ask that we should run any sacrifice, that we should do without anything, but we ask that the cost of that Army should be borne by the most defenceless section of our people.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is that we are illogical, or whether we just do not give a thought to it, or whether we have that particular attitude of mind which feels that human life is of less value than property; but, in the ordinary civic affairs of our city, if a property owner wants particular protection for his property, and if he asks for additional police protection, he pays for it.  Is there any reason in the world why this sum which we have spent on our Army year after year during this war period should not have been regarded as an emergency expenditure? Why should we not realise not merely that our Budget is one which has to be balanced year by year, but that there are times such as the present when we have to meet exceptional expenditure, and that such expenditure should be spread over a longer period?  Why should we not ask those who stand to gain most by the protection our Army affords to make the biggest contribution, because they are in the best position to do so?  Surely it is not too much to expect that those who have property and investments in this country would have provided the Government with a long-term loan to enable it to meet this expenditure, and not, as Deputies have pointed out, to take out of the mouths, not of the <Col N="1258" /> children generally of the nation, but even more particularly of the children of these very soldiers, the food they require?</P>
    <P>I do not think it is of great value to pursue that particular line at the moment, nor is it of any great value to try to deal with the Vote as a whole; but while it might appear to be repetition to follow the line of other speakers in regard to the allowances paid to the dependents of soldiers, it would be a shame for any Deputy who has the opportunity of voicing a protest to remain silent and refrain from adding his voice to the protest made already from different benches.  When we consider that, in the City of Dublin, the Department of Defence and the Minister responsible require the wife and nine children of a sergeant in our national Army to exist on a sum of £2 3s. Od. per week, and that, when we work that out in terms of so much per meal per day, they are asked to provide a meal for these ten people for the sum of 2½d., we see the state we have reached.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that among the most poverty-stricken, the most ill-nourished and badly clothed children in the City of Dublin are the children of our serving soldiers.  If he does not believe that, he should go to one place alone in the city&mdash;Keogh Square, Inchicore&mdash;where he will have personal experience which possibly may even now change his mind.  It is from that angle, it seems to me, we should make this appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the average citizen realises the position in which we place these men.  We take them, in many cases, from good jobs; we call them up from the Reserve and put them into the Army; and because they have laid themselves open to that call from their country, we condemn them to see their families taken from relative comfort and security and placed below the poverty line.  If these men are worthy of service in the Army, if their service is valuable to the country, surely the first consideration is that their women and children should be given at least that minimum protection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> Deputy Byrne has spoken about giving them the same increase as has been given to workers in outside industries.  I do not think that even that sum would be sufficient to fill the gap which we have left between the needs of those dependents of our serving soldiers and the amount provided for them, out it would at least be a measure; and, from my experience of dealing with the type of individual who would be arguing the case against us, we would be very lucky if we succeeded in getting portion, not to speak of the whole, of it.  It would, however, be an encouragement to us to go ahead and to continue protesting, so that finally our soldiers would be treated not as helots or individuals who, for one reason or another, have &ldquo;taken the shilling,&rdquo; as was the phrase in the old days, and who have gone away to hide themselves in shame, but as citizens serving in a more valuable, a more dangerous and a more worthy way than the great bulk of the citizens.</P>
    <P>Then we come to deal with the other problem that has been raised by Deputy Byrne, the problem of the young soldier marrying outside the regulations.  It is another amazing fact that we give the right to any male citizen of this country to get married at 18 years of age but we say a soldier in the Army, apparently, is neither fit nor competent to get married until he is 23 years of age.  At the same time, the very individuals who lay down these regulations require an increased birth rate to supply their Army with recruits.  And they talk to us about national suicide! I would suggest that if it is fit and proper and if they do believe in a larger Irish nation and a greater population, apart altogether from whether or not it is possible to stop these marriages, it is important from the point of view of the country and from the point of view of the men that those who joined the Army or were called up, should not lose the ordinary rights they enjoyed as citizens outside the Army.</P>
    <P>I want to quote one case to the Minister, which seems to me somewhat symptomatic of the attitude towards <Col N="1260" /> these men in the Army.  It is a case of a soldier with 16 years' service and a good record, who was living in married quarters.  He has a young family of five children.  He has a boy already in the Army, who is now in St. Bricin's Hospital.  One of his boys got into the ordinary trouble that any boy would get into.  He was brought up in court and put on probation.  Then the Army, not satisfied with the decision of the, magistrate, ruled that the father should pay monetary compensation for the damage done by the boy and, in addition, that he should vacate his married quarters and, until such time as he did so, his marriage allowance would be stopped.  I am fully familiar with the difficulties that arise in having children in married quarters.  I happened to live for some time outside the wall of a barracks and I had many unpleasant experiences but to penalise a whole family because of a misdemeanour of a boy of 12, to reduce this family to the stage that they have to have recourse to charitable aid from the St. Vincent de Paul Society, seems to me to be going beyond the limit altogether.</P>
    <P>When that man goes out on the barrack square in formation, and collapses from weakness, through hunger, we cannot even then get any remedy but are told that the regulations must be enforced.  When he leaves the married quarters and takes up residence outside the barracks, then, and only then, will his marriage allowance be restored.  This man has seven children for whom he must find accommodation in the City of Dublin.  Any one who knows the city knows that it is almost a physical impossibility to get any accommodation for a family of that size unless the applicant is in a position to pay rent of £1 to 30/- a week.  This man has to find such accommodation and to pay that rent out of the ordinary pay of a private soldier.  I suggest that that attitude to a serving soldier requires to be changed.  It seems to me symptomatic of our attitude towards these men. That is something that we cannot take pride in and I certainly do not think it, induces pride in these men.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the difficulties <Col N="1261" /> confronting the Army in the trek across the Border.  Men do not leave the Army because they take pride in that Army and are satisfied with their conditions.  If we cannot give to these men all that we think they are entitled to, at least we should give their women and children the loud, clothing and shelter they are entitled to through the services of their men and as women and children of our nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one very small point which I would be glad that the Minister would look into.  I do not expect an answer from him to-day because it is obviously a matter he will have to look up.  It has been reported to me that in some districts there has been difficulty in cashing the drafts paid for allowances.  I understand that these allowances are paid by a cross-draft and that they bear on them some remark to the effect that a bank cashes them at its own risk.  I presume that such safeguards as can be taken have been taken to ensure that the person who presents the draft for payment is the rightful person, but at the same time I understand that in one particular case there was some trouble over the cashing of one of these drafts; the bank was unable to recover the money from the Department and, in consequence, all the banks in that particular area have declined to cash these drafts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information may not be correct but, if it is, I think it is a matter which should be looked into.  The Minister should see if some system different from the existing one cannot be adopted&mdash;payment through the Post Office, or something of that nature&mdash;so that there may be no difficulty about the cashing of these drafts.  It is obvious, of course, that most of the persons in receipt of these allowances will not be persons who have banking accounts.  That, of course, presents a difficulty in their having them cashed through a bank.  If a shopkeeper cashes them, he does it at his risk, because there is this clause that the Department may not make it good.  It is probably a difficult matter, but I hope the Minister will take note of it <Col N="1262" /> with a view to seeing if anything can be done to improve the system so that there may be no difficulty about the cashing of these drafts in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>The various Deputies who have spoken have all complimented the soldier on his discipline and good behaviour.  When one listens to men congratulating the soldiers for behaving properly one would imagine that to join the Army you must be some low type of human being.  After all, the great majority of the Army come from the working class, many of them from the unemployed ranks. They happen to be the best citizens of this country.  They happen to be the backbone of this nation.  It is only to be expected that they would behave in the Army just as they would behave in civilian life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to voice my protest, not against the amount of this Estimate, but against the way in which it is distributed. I cannot see why the soldier does not receive better pay.  I cannot see why the soldier, if he is so important and if he is at any moment prepared, and has taken an oath, to lay down his life for the defence of this country, should not receive a wage equivalent to that which he was earning, if he was in employment, before he joined the Army.  That is a point in which I am very much interested: why cannot the soldier receive a wage equivalent to the wage he had before he joined the Army?  Of course, the Minister may reply that there are Deputies who say that the expenditure is already too great, and that what I suggest would increase it.  Would it not be possible to lower the salaries of the higher ranks&mdash;the brass hat people &mdash;the men from the N.C.O. up? Would it not be possible to give them a little cut and to give a little rise to the lower grade, the ordinary private, who has his wife and family to look after, the man who is barely existing I One would think a little humanity might come into our hearts, and the Minister's heart and the Government's heart.  One would expect a little Christianity.  After all, these men are <Col N="1263" /> very patriotic.  I happened to be out of this country, as a worker earning my living, when the war broke out, and I was quite surprised to read of the numbers of young men who rushed to the Colours in this country.  I was surprised that there was any patriotism whatsoever left in the youth of this country.  I was surprised that they were prepared to lay down their lives to serve under the rotten and diabolical system that exists here to-day and that has existed for the past two or three years since we got our native Government.</P>
    <P>That is the only point on which I can pay tribute to the soldier of to-day, that he has within him any patriotism, or any respect for this country, seeing the way he has been treated since we took over the reins of office, and since we claimed to do what John Bull failed to do in the past years&mdash;to give our workers and people a decent wage, to give them economic and social security, healthy environment, everything that the worker and the ordinary man requires and has a perfect right to demand with no apologies whatsoever.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that when you meet the ordinary soldier in the street he has certain faults to find with the administration of the Army and with the way he is treated.  If you go into a pnblichouse&mdash;not that I drink much; I may go in to pass a half an hour&mdash; do you think you would see the &ldquo;big shot&rdquo; offer the private soldier a drink?  He would not touch him.  Do yon think you would ever see a soldier in the saloon bar or the cocktail bar?  Not on your life.  Do you think these upper classes would ever invite them to their home on Sunday afternoon for a nice tea or make life more sociable for them?  Not on your life.  They are just contemptible rats, something of the lower type of humanity, who have joined the Army to take up a gun and lay down their lives to protect this country.  Against what?  Against an invasion, we are led to believe.  To protect the private owning class, the property class and the exploiters&mdash;that is what the Army <Col N="1264" /> is for.  If Hitler came in here, I have only my clothes and pyjamas.  They would not be much use to him.</P>

      <P>It is six of one and half dozen of the other as far as I am concerned.  I think the Minister would be very well employed, and he would be fulfilling his obligation in the letter and the spirit, if he tried to do something more for the private soldier.  If he cannot find the money let him come to the House and get the money.  If he will remove, perhaps, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures and the staff he has in that Department, perhaps he would be able to find an, extra few thousand pounds which would give tike ordinary soldier extra comfort and easier access to the social comforts which he needs and which he has every right to have.</P>
      <P>Then we would be getting somewhere, and there would be no need for the Taoiseach to have to beg for recruits for the Defence Forces.  We would be in a different position then, because we would have somthing to defend.  If the ordinary citizens of this country had been properly treated prior to this war, and if any reasonable guarantee had been given to them that their dependents would be looked after properly, I believe that there would be no need to beg for people in this country to come to its defence.  For instance, take the ease of a married man, with a young family, what guarantee had he that his wife and family would be taken care of?  In the case of a man with a wife and child, if, let us say, a lunatic should come into the house to attack that child, that man would put up the best defence he could to protect his child.  I know that I would do so, and I am sure that any man would be prepared to do the same thing.  Accordingly, if the people of this country were given the social security to which they have a right, there would be no need for any broadcasts over the radio or through the newspapers to get them to join the Defence Forces, but the fact is that that social security does not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> It must be admitted that in Ireland at the present moment we have nothing to offer our citizens which would induce them to go out and fight in its defence. The present Government has given no inducement to anyone to go out and defend their country.  It is all very well to speak of the payments or allowances made to soldiers or their dependents, but I should like to know&mdash;I have not the exact figures with me&mdash; the amount of money that goes to the higher officials connected with the Department of Defence.  I should like to know what exactly are the salaries of the high officials or officers of the Army, from the Commander-in-Chief down to the lowest grade officer.  When I read the figures here, I was shocked. I could not believe that, under a Fianna Fáil Government, the higher officials should be getting so much, while the ordinary private or volunteer in the Army could not get enough to enable him to buy cigarettes.  I am prepared to back what Deputy Larkin, Deputy O'Higgins and other Deputies said with regard to the present emergency, and that the dependents of these soldiers should get assistance immediately in order to help them to exist.  Of course, I know that we are told that certain things should not be referred to during the present emergency, but I think that that is a matter which calls for immediate attention.</P>

      <P>In his opening statement, the Minister indicated that it was due to judicious pruning that this decrease had been effected, but having regard to statements made by various Deputies I wonder whether the use of the word &ldquo;pruning&rdquo; was judicious. I am sure that the best thing that can be done is to keep our Army at the highest peak of efficiency, and I feel quite sure that the Minister will not give a deaf ear to any suggestion in that regard.  Accordingly, we have to examine the Minister's statement carefully in view of the various statements that have been made here to-night. The Minister has indicated that there has been a, slackening-off in recruits for the Army as compared with the original influx of recruits at the start of the emergency.  Is the Minister satisfied that the treatment of the wives <Col N="1266" /> and families of soldiers is not a contributory cause to the falling-off in recruiting?  It may be, perhaps, nauseating to repeat this, but I have to say that the wives and families of these soldiers are acting as anti-recruiting agents, if you like, because of the way they are being treated. Other speakers have referred to the inadequate marriage allowances of soldiers, but there is one point that I particularly wish to refer to, and that is the different treatment which is given to the higher officials or officers, which must reflect itself upon the feelings of the unfortunate dependents of the ordinary serving soldier.  I am sure that any Deputies who have had any contact with those soldiers will be aware of the irritating effect of many of the regulations, with regard to marriage and so on.  If we are looking for anything that would help to make the lot of these soldiers and their dependents better, surely we could remove some of these irksome regulations which are militating against a satisfactory condition in the Army.</P>
      <P>I am sure, as Deputy Larkin has pointed out, that the Minister must be conscious of all these things that are militating against recruiting for the Army&mdash;these regulations with regard to marriage, and so on.  Perhaps, these are matters that should be more properly discussed by the Defence Conference. Deputy Cogan referred to that, and I am sure that these matters have already been adverted to in the Defence Conference, but I do not agree that such matters should not be discussed here during the duration of the present emergency, even if they have already been discussed at the Defence Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel rather timorous in discussing this question of the Army but, as I said in my opening remarks, I think it is the business of every Deputy to see that the Army is maintained at the highest pitch of efficiency although a few months ago the Government Party seemed to feel that they themselves were the sole custodians of the right to have an Army.  In my constituency, they made a remarkable outburst in a printed circular which they distributed broadcast irrespective of the damage <Col N="1267" /> it might have done.  In that document they accused members of the Labour Party of trying to disband the Army, and stated that if the Labour Party got into power, their first intention was to disband the Army, to enable members of the forces to go to England, where they could earn higher wages.  So much for the responsibility of the headquarters of an organisation which allowed a circular of that character to be disseminated through the length and breadth of my constituency.</P>

It was repudiated here before, but I want to take advantage of this Estimate to say that they should show a greater responsibility for the Army which they control.  It is the Army of the nation, not their Army.  Any criticisms made from these benches are not made with the object of scoring personal points against the Minister or his staff, but really to try to improve the standard of the Army and to see that the grievances which are rankling in the minds of members of the Army should be removed at the earliest possible moment.  I think they should be removed, not alone in the interests of justice and humanity, but also in the interests of the efficiency of our Defence Forces.  I am merely takmg advantage of this Estimate to raise these matters.</P>

      <P>I was not in the House when Deputies were dealing, at an earlier stage, with the Army Vote, but there are only one or two matters to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  Some time ago I wrote a letter to the Minister&mdash;there was also a letter from a certain member <Col N="1268" /> of the Defence Forces&mdash;in which I enclosed a copy of a communication sent from the B.A.F. recruiting station in Belfast, which indicated that members of the Army in this country are able to secure these documents and leave the Army&mdash;to desert in other words.  They are able to go to Belfast and join the R.A.F. I have before me one of these documents which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is now possible to arrange for your immediate enlistment in the. R.A.F. subject to passing the medical board and trade test in Belfast. In agreement with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, it is necessary for you to travel and to catch the 9 a.m. train from Dublin to Belfast. No other train will do and this letter acts as a travel permit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This letter acts as a travel permit to allow members of our own Army to join the R.A.F.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an official document, a travel permit in other words to go straight up to Belfast and join the R.A.F.  How can we keep an Army in this country when the British Government is sending down travel permits to members of our forces to go down there and join their army? The Minister should have replied to me on that matter, at least I was expecting he would reply.  I was down in the Library when I was told that this Vote was under discussion and I rushed up to ask the Minister is he aware that this business is going on? I have the travel permit in my possession which I got from a soldier.  There is another point to which I should like to call the Minister's attention.  Is he aware that there are high-commissioned officers in the Army who have sons serving in a foreign army?  We know that a father's heart lies where his son is.</P>

      <P>At the same time it is not good enough.  We cannot expect a good return from these men when we leave the whole question of our defence in their hands while their sons are serving a foreign country.  I do not think there is any sincerity or heart about it.  There is no other point I wish to raise but these are two matters to which I should like the Minister to pay some attention.  A major, question is that concerned with the issuing of travel permits to Belfast for members of our Forces because we cannot keep an Army while we have the British Government sending down these communications to men in our Forces.  There are some of our men going because there is easy money to be earned in England and in Belfast.  I think the practice should be stopped. The Minister would be well advised to look into the matter.  If necessary, I shall send this travel permit to his office in the morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to bring a few points before the Minister which I have not heard raised up to the present.  The first concerns men taken into the Army who are classed as A.1 and who are later discharged from the Army without any pay, their only recourse being to sign on for the dole.  The Minister referred to the fact that these men receive 6d. a day extra and that there was 6d. per day retained which they would get when the emergency was over.  Some of these men <Col N="1270" /> will have gone to the long home by that time and will never get the money. I suggest that men discharged from the Army as unfit or for any other cause should get the 6d. per day which baa been deducted from them during their service.  Some of them have served tor over two or three years.</P>
      <P>I should also like to mention that I know cases of soldiers' wives in my own town, such as Deputy Byrne mentioned recently.  There is a case of a wife and eight children who receive £2 3s. 9d., and a wife and seven children receiving £2 2s.  In that town they are paying 4/- rent, and 1/- for electric light.  These people are not able to afford boots to send their children to school, and if they do not go to school the Guards are on to than. We see children going to school in their bare feet, because their parents are not able to buy boots from this meagre allowance.  I should like to see the Army Estimate increased by £2,000,000 more so that the rank and file might get increased allowances.  I would ask, the Minister to consider the cases of men who have been discharged, with a view to having the 6d. per day deducted from their pay during their service immediately paid to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join in the appeal which has been made to the Minister from all sides of the House to grant an early increase in the marriage and children's allowances. I am not going to elaborate on the matter, as other Deputies have spoken about it, and we have had it mentioned here on many occasions.  The allowances certainly are not adequate, and they should be increased this side of Christmas.  In passing, I think that we can congratulate ourselves on having had this debate, because it is the first time we had a really thorough debate on this important question.  On other occasions on which we tried to raise it, it was generally stifled&mdash;fairly successfully.  I think tills debate will do a lot of good, and I hope that as a result the marriage allowance will be increased by at least 50 per cent. before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise that I think the debate has done good, and I am glad that the matter has been debated in the way it has been.  With regard to the regulation preventing marriage under certain conditions, I have on more than one occasion asked the Minister to give a reason for that regulation.  He has not as yet given any reason other than that it has always been the practice in most armies.  That is not a reason.  I want to know if there is a really good reason why that regulation should be there at all.  I think there is every reason why it should be abolished.  The truth of the matter, I think, is that it is there for economy reasons.  I think it is entirely wrong and unchristian that any State should economise by such a barbarous regulation.  It has been suggested quite often to me that, apart from the marriage and children's allowances, there should be a separation allowance for other dependents.  We often come across a man in the Army whose aged mother is living at home on a miserable old age pension, most of which goes in rent.  We ought seriously consider that allowances should be made to dependents of serving soldiers, apart from their wives and children. A few men in the Army have also complained to me that when they felt they had a grievance with regard to the rate of pay or something else and wrote to their local Deputy, if that were discovered they were punished for it.  I think that also is very wrong. I think that no man should be punished who, when he thinks he has a genuine grievance, tries to get it remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer very briefly to the two policy matters for which the Minister is answerable to the House and to nobody else except the members of the House.  Nearly every Deputy knows that the numerical strength of the Army has not changed for the past year or 18 <Col N="1272" /> months.  Notwithstanding the fact that the numerical strength of the Army has not been altered to any great extent, it is surprising to me to read every few weeks a list published in the daily papers of new commissions being granted or promotions being made by the Minister and his advisers.</P>
      <P>If the strength of the ordinary rank and file of the Army is standing at the same figure for the last 18 months, I cannot understand why it should be necessary up to quite recently to increase the numerical strength of the officer ranks and to promote officers whose duties and responsibilities have not been altered to any great extent, or to any extent at all so far as I know.  I notice, for instance, in one particular case&mdash;I do not want to give the position of the officer concerned&mdash; that an officer who orrginally entered the Army as a lieutenant was subsequently promoted to the rank of captain without having his duties and responsibilities altered in any way. The officer concerned has nobody under his control.  He is in a position in which he is on his own and, if there was no alteration in the duties and responsibilities of the officer as compared with the time when he was appointed to this particular position as a lieutenant, the only conclusion I can come to is that this is a sort of backdoor method of giving an increase of salary to an Army officer.  That cannot be done in the case of the rank and file.  I should like the Minister to explain why, at this stage, it is necessary to grant so many new commissions, because this is only creating a problem which the Minister or his successor will have to deal with at a later date or at the end of the emergency period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter that may not be regarded as very serious, but it is a matter of policy for which I presume the Minister is responsible.  I understand that three serving officers who were in the Army up to a short time before the last general election applied for permission to contest seats at the election.  This is not a Party matter, because I understand the three officers involved have been associated <Col N="1273" /> with the Fianna Fáil, the Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  The three officers concerned were defeated at the election, but I am informed that the Minister and his advisers refused to reinstate them in their former positions. Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to explain why ho has refused to reinstate them and whether he is relying upon some Army regulation to support the action that he has taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters to which I should like to refer. The position of the Army in a neutral country like this should be as important as in any country engaged in war. There is a matter connected with the Army which is creating great discontent. I regret to have to deal with it publicly, but it has got to be raised somewhere at some time, if anything is to be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the very low rate of marriage allowance, married men in the Army, very frequently men with excellent records, have found themselves in certain difficulties which have led to disciplinary action.  In some cases they have been tempted to part with Army blankets or some Army stores to some people who bought them.  I agree that they must be dealt with, but I do not agree that the punishment should be passed on to the wives and innocent children of these soldiers.  In Great Britain the same regulation applied, but in that country now everything must be sacrificed to victory and they removed that regulation.  If our object is to keep out of the war, we must rely mainly on our armed forces to preserve oar neutrality and I think it is time that the Government and the Minister should review that position and see that no longer shall the wives and innocent children of serving members of the Defence Forces have to share in the punishment of such men, if they have to undergo any punishment for any offence during their service. Nobody will argue that it is in the interest of the Army in any way that innocent people should have to share in the punishment meted out by the Army authorities.  The moment a soldier commits himself in any way, no <Col N="1274" /> matter how slight, steps are taken to ensure that his wife and dependents no longer receive allowances until the matter is dealt with.  Then, if he is sentenced to any term of detention, they do not receive any money during that time and the local rates liave to support them.  I am sure the Minister will agree it would be well if something could be done about it.  In the Army there are many special classes in the private ranks, such as cooks, and so far as I know most of those men are married men who are left in one post for years.  I suggest it would be much to the advantage of their dependents if they could be located as near as possible to where their families reside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to what has been said as to the inadequacy of the marriage allowance paid to a soldier's dependents.  I think it will be admitted by everybody that it is too low.  The Minister will probably tell us, as he did before, that within the last two years the allowance has been raised twice.  Notwithstanding that, the allowances at present are not such as to permit a man's wife and family being treated in the proper manner.  The Minister will recite the allowances given to a soldier, the amount it takes to keep him in barracks and in clothes, and so on.  Of course, that is very little use to the man's wife and family.  One would like to know the actual cost of keeping a single soldier in a barrack at present.</P>
      <P>Like some of the other Deputies, I submit that the man who joins the Army to serve his country, and who stakes an oath to lay down his life for his country if needs be, should have at least a wage equivalent to the wage he would receive in civil life.  I do not think there is anything unreasonable in that suggestion, and the Minister would be well advised to adopt something of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to marriage allowances, under the present regulation, a man must be 23 years of age, and must have two years' service.  I think it was 25. What right has the Minister of the Government to determine when a man should get married?  The Church has always advocated early marriages, and <Col N="1275" /> it is a very dangerous thing for the Government to take up this attitude. It is not preventing marriages; soldiers are being married day after day against this regulation.  As a result, no marriage allowance is paid to the man's wife, and after a time there is a child, and no allowance is paid on behalf of that child.  The result is that they have to go to the home assistance authorities in order to receive a few miserable shillings, week after week.  It is humiliating, to say the least of it, and certainly disgraceful, when a man is in the service of his country and prepared to lay down his life for his country, that his wife should have to seek home assistance, because of a regulation which is very hard to understand.</P>
    <P>Some speakers to-day mentioned the question of husbands being separated from their wives and families.  I know that the Minister has been helpful in this matter and I remember writing to his Department on three or four occasions, when he always did what I asked in that connection.  However, matters of this kind should be adjusted before it becomes necessary for a Deputy to write to the Minister to ask that a husband be sent back to his home town, or as near to it as possible. These men offer their services to the Army in an abnormal time: probably they would not have done so if the times were normal; and, therefore, they should not be bound by rules that would or should be in operation, perhaps, in peace-time when a man offers himself as a professional soldier.</P>
    <P>On many occasions, a soldier gets home on leave for a week and at the end of it he may be ill and not able to go away.  I have known occasions where that man's wife called to the military barrack in the town in which he spent his leave and presented a doctor's certificate to the officer-in-charge. That certificate was sent on in the usual way and, the man went back a day or two afterwards.  The next time a separation allowance was due, none was sent to the wife and family.  I would ask the Minister to try to remedy that.  I am not pleading <Col N="1276" /> the case of a man who deliberately refrains from going back on duty&mdash;as there are many&mdash;since that is the man's own fault.  Where, however, a man is ill and takes all the necessary steps to acquaint his commanding officer by sending a medical certificate, the allowance should not be held up for two or three weeks, as I have known to occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin raised a very important point in connection with the promotion of officers.  It had been my intention to refer to that and to suggest to the Minister that it is definitely a back door method of increasing the already very high salaries of some of the officers.  We have a discrimination between the family of the officer and the family of the private.  We have heard here to-night an appeal from all sides of the House to give to the private what is his due to him by his country.  You have privates' children expected to be maintained on 3d. per day.  What is the allowance for the children of officers?  Why should one person be promoted from a clerk to a second lieutenant and from commandant to A.D.C.?  Was that done on account of his politics, because certain people in this House were relatives of his? Why was his Party singled out?  Is that not one of the reasons why the Taoiseach said there would have to be conscription, because he realised that the soldier was not satisfied when his children were getting only 3d. a day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>He is reported in the Press as making it, and it was not contradicted.  I say that our Army should be made attractive, and then there would be no necessity for such a threat.  I do not agree with other Deputies here in the suggestion that, if there is an emergency, a soldier will not render loyal service because he has a relative in the army of a foreign country.  If an emergency were to arise there are, perhaps, some who might not render loyal service, simply because they may have relatives <Col N="1277" /> in the army of a foreign country. At the same time I may say this, that we are all very proud of our Army and some of our soldiers have rendered distinguished service in other walks of life.  I am satisfied that if we call upon them in an emergency we can rely upon them.</P>
      <P>I must criticise the Minister for his back-handed method of giving increased allowances and salaries to officers and not to the sergeants and the privates.  It may be pointed out, without divulging any secrets in relation to the Army, that there have been certain promotions to high positions and I suggest that there was no necessity for those promotions.  Why were those promotions made?  I am aware of certain persons who were in the Army and they got out of it because they had neighbours who were in the English Army whose wives were receiving up to £4 and £5 a week.  I am not suggesting that we are in the position to pay our men at that standard.</P>
      <P>I am not agreeing with other Deputies when they say that £8,500,000 is too much for our Army.  I say that whatever Government is in power is the best judge of that.  It is on that Government the responsibility rests for organising an Army in case we may require it.  If we are going to retain the Army, and if we wish to possess the confidence of the Army and make Army life attractive, we must do better than we are doing, especially in allowances for children.  We will not make it attractive by offering a private 3d. a day and giving officers 5/- a day.  Surely the child of a private in a house in the country requires as much nourishment and food as the child of an officer.  Why discriminate to the extent of 5/- in one case and 3d. in another?  Is that the way you are going to make the Army attractive?  If that is the policy, the Minister will have a very difficult job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recognise his difficulty.  He should approach the Government, as has been suggested from all sections of the House, and demand on behalf of the Army better treatment than has been given our soldiers in the past.  If he does that there will be no necessity for the Taoiseach to threaten us with <Col N="1278" /> conscription.  The Minister has not done so; he has congratulated the Army and he has spoken of the fine services our soldiers have rendered.  I would much prefer to see him doing something practical for the Army.  I would prefer to see him introducing a Bill here asking for authority to improve Army conditions and I am sure the House would give him every assistance in order to make conditions easier for the private or the sergeant, so that their dependents will be no worse off than the dependents of officers.</P>
    <P>It is humiliating for men on public boards, as Deputy Corish pointed out, to have to consider applications for home assistance from the dependents of soldiers.  Why should a soldier's wife have to look for home assistance? Why does the Army not maintain those people?  Under certain circumstances a soldier may be forced to marry.  Why should his unfortunate wife and child be penalised and why should they be forced into the position that they have to rely on the local authority?  We know that in some instances the Church intervenes and, to the credit of the soldier, he acts as a man and marries the girl.  That poor girl and her child are victimised; in their case there is a taint of pauperism.  That matter is made the subject of propaganda in the county and people will say: &ldquo;Here is a soldier's wife and child depending on home assistance each week, although her husband is in the Army.&rdquo;  Probably that is one of the reasons why there are so many desertions, but we need not go into that aspect to-night.</P>
    <P>I say deliberately that in many cases certain things are worked through politics in order to satisfy certain people.  I will state that certain officers have been promoted, and they were not worthy of that promotion, but the promotion was granted simply to give them a higher status and salary.  Deputy Cafferky pointed out that many of the officers spent portion of their money trying to help unfortunate soldiers.  We do not want them to do that.  We want the soldier to be treated in such a way that he will not be depending on officers or other people.</P>

That man was working as a clerk a couple of years ago.  My suggestion is that yon should stop promotions of that sort, stop such increases in salary, and give to the men who are really serving the country, and who can be depended on whenever they are required, sufficient to keep themselves and their dependents in reasonable comfort.</P>

      <P>I, too, have had experience of young soldiers who got married, and found themselves not entitled under the regulations to a marriage allowance.  They had not complied with the regulations, which indicate that they should have two years' service, and be 23 years of age.  I agree with the views expressed by Deputies.  It does seem a rather humiliating thing to have a soldier's wife seeking charity from the local authority.  I think the Minister should reconsider that matter.  It is grossly unfair, and it is a reflection on the Army, on the conditions under which men are asked to serve.  I am aware of one case where a soldier's wife died, and he was not in a position to bury her.  Some small provision was made from some fund in the Army.  I am aware that the undertaker is still out of pocket.  If the Minister wishes it, I shall give him particulars of that case later.  The amount provided from the Army fund was insufficient to cover the burial expenses.  It is possible that the undertaker was looking for too much.  I think a more substantial contribution should have come from the Army fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister. It has reference to agricultural leave, indefinite leave.  The intention of the <Col N="1280" /> Minister and the Army authorities is to facilitate soldiers who seek agricultural leave at certain periods of the year.  They get a month's leave to do agricultural work if they are small farmers or cottiers who have crops on their plots.  They are supposed to get an opportunity to save their crops.  I have experienced a great deal of difficulty in the making of representations regarding such soldiers.  The procedure seems to be very involved.  The Adjutant-General has to be consulted and there is a great deal of letter-writing and examination into the circumstances of the applicant.  The result is that the soldier may obtain his leave only when it is four or five weeks late.  If the Minister is to continue the grant of agricultural leave, the method of dealing with these applications should be expedited.  Such leave is of little use when granted too late for the purpose for which it is intended.</P>
    <P>In some cases there appears to be no difficulty in getting indefinite leave, but incases in which there would seem to be a good claim for such leave, taking into consideration economic circumstances and other factors, applications are flatly turned down.  I do not know whether there is any hard or fast rule governing this matter, but it would seem that there is not.  It struck me that if an applicant is not a good soldier, the Army is glad to get rid of him on indefinite leave.  But if he is a good soldier, no matter how strong his claim, he will not get indefinite leave.  I think that the time has arrived, seeing that we have now indications of what the result of the war will be, when we should decide that those who are anxious to get out of the Army should be discharged.  In the post-war period, the demobilisation of the Army will present a big problem.  If the Government is satisfied that the danger to the country has disappeared, we are scarcely justified in spending the huge sums of money which the House is asked to vote for defence.  Where a man is anxious to get out of the Army, he should be facilitated.  A large number of men appear to be anxious to get out of the Army.  Whether that is an <Col N="1281" /> indication of discontent or not, I do not know.  Whether Army life is monotonous or not, it struck me as amazing that so large a number of men should be anxious to get out of the Army.  I am sure the Minister is in a position to give some information to the House as to the reason for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to the difficulty experienced by soldiers' wives in securing proper housing accommodation in my constituency. I may give the Minister one example.  A soldier made application to the Kildare Board of Health for a cottage in the parish in which he had worked as a civilian before he joined the Army.  His wife and family were living in an insanitary house.  His application was refused by the board of health on the ground that he was not an agricultural worker.  That is only one example of many cases of which I am aware.  If the board of health, or the housing authority in a particular case, are debarred from granting houses to soldiers' wives and families, so that they are compelled to live under insanitary conditions, the Minister for Defence should do something about it.  I can understand the difficulty in providing married quarters for all those in the Army who would be eligible for them, but it is very wrong and most unreasonable that a soldier should not be treated as an agricultural worker for the purpose of the Labourers Acts, as insurance agents are.  The term &ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo; receives a very wide interpretation in the allocation of board of health houses and I do not see why a soldier who is serving his country should be debarred from receiving a house. There are several cases in Kildare in which soldiers cannot get houses in their own districts because they are <Col N="1282" /> not agricultural workers, although they will, probably, be going back to genuine agricultural work when the emergency ends.  In any event, their wives and families should be permitted to live under proper conditions in their own districts.  I ask the Minister to see that something is done in connection with this matter.</P>

      <P>With a couple of exceptions, the trend of the debate has been in one direction.  The exceptions, I am sorry to say, have been such as to cause me, and I am sure others in the House, a certain amount of concern.  Deputy O'Higgins seems, for some reason or another, to think that the danger situation has more or less passed.  I cannot agree with that.</P>
      <P>I feel that the situation which brought about the expansion of the Army is just as grave to-day as it was when it was found necessary to create that expansion.  The world conflict has not in any sense decreased.  In fact, if anything it has, in my opinion, extended, and has become very much more vicious than it was when the necessity for the expansion arose.  I would be just as anxious as the Deputies who have spoken in these terms to see the Estimate for the Department of Defence decreased.  In fact, I think it will be something that will be looked forward to by the House with pleasure when the day does arrive when the amount of the Estimate which is being sought this year and has been sought for a number of years will no longer be required, hut, unfortunately, in my opinion anyhow, that day has not yet arrived. The situation, as I have said, is as dangerous to-day for this country as it was in the year 1940.  It can be argued by those people who like to argue that way that the war is moving away from these shores, but neither this Government nor any other Government could merely consider that aspect of the question.  The aspect of it which we have to consider very seriously is the protection of the rights of this nation and of its people, and that can only be done by the means which we introduced in 1940.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> It was stated, I think by Deputy O'Higgins, that at the very best our Army is such that it could be of very little use in stemming an invasion.  I am not sure that these were the words he used, but I think that is what he meant to convey.  However opinions may differ on that question, the fact, nevertheless, remains that the Army which was increased in those years has been made more efficient as each year has passed until to-day, as Deputy O'Higgins himself has said, the Army of the nation is probably the most efficient army in the world.  That has been brought about by the continuous, untiring efforts and devotion to duty of the Army staffs, and by the magnificent discipline of the men.  That, in my opinion, is the thing that has ensured this nation against any attack being made upon it.  Therefore, I feel that when Deputies suggest that this Estimate could be decreased by millions of pounds for the reasons which they gave, they are neither doing themselves a service nor,doing the nation a service. I only hope that whatever effect may be created by their words that, at least, it will not make the people feel that all danger to this nation has passed.  It has not, and I am sure that the majority of Deputies do not share those feelings.</P>
    <P>I was naturally very pleased to have heard the praise which was lavished by numerous Deputies on the Army and on its efficiency.  It was a long-delayed tribute, but I may say a well-deserved one.</P>

      <P>The Army officers, to my own personal knowledge, have never spared themselves in their efforts to make this Army an Army such as Deputy O'Higgins described it here this evening, and whatever efficiency exists in the Army to-day is due solely to the higher authorities in the Army <Col N="1284" /> who have given almost unceasing attention to every aspect and every phase of Army requirements.  As I mentioned in the course of my opening statement, the manoeuvres which were carried out last year could not have been carried out in any circumstances were it not for the preliminary training that took place in the preceding years.  These manoeuvres were carried out on the most extensive scale that Army manoeuvres have ever been carried out in this country.  They were carried out under conditions equivalent to the most difficult active service conditions. I am very proud to say, sad I am sure the House will be very proud to know, that every unit in the Army stood up to these conditions and carried out their duties throughout these manoeuvres with credit to themselves and credit to the nation.</P>

      <P>They endured very long forced marches.  They marched through the long hours of the night and over mountains in order to carry out the plans which were being operated.  They crossed rivers and brought their equipment across riven and, on the whole, they did everything that it would be necessary for them to do if this nation was faced with an attack upon it.  They supplied themselves with food throughout the entire period of these manoeuvres.  They supplied themselves with ammunition, and they carried out every particular phase that it would have been necessary for them to have carried out if an actual attack was being made.  As I said before, they carried that out with utmost credit to themselves.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether there is any uniform scale of salaries for nurses in hospitals controlled by local authorities in Éire; and, if not, whether he will state the scale paid by each local authority in the country to nurses employed in hospitals under their control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no uniform scale of salary for nurses in hospitals controlled by local authorities, nor is there a uniform scale of salary in the case of each local authority.  The preparation of a detailed statement of salaries would take a considerable time and the expenditure involved in its compilation would not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is scarcely any county in which a uniform salary scale is applicable to all nurses in all the hospitals therein. The salaries generally vary as between the county hospital, district hospitals and fever hospitals in a county and in <Col N="1177" /> many instances there are variations between salaries paid to different nurses in the same institution where, for instance, extra rates are paid for qualifications in midwifery or where the emoluments differ or where nursing sisters are employed as well as lay nurses.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances there is no convenient form in which the information requested by the Deputy could be presented, and even if there were the compilation of an exhaustive statement is not practicable.</P>
