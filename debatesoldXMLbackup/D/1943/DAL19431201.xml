      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that the recent Order controlling the price of eggs is giving dissatisfaction throughout the country, and if he has received representations from the Cork <Col N="380" /> Chamber of Commerce and other bodies pointing out the effect of fixing a much higher price for eggs in Dublin than in the rest of the country; and whether he is now prepared to amend the Order.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he has seen representations from the Cork Workers' Council that a serious egg shortages had occurred in Cork City consequent upon the retail price of eggs being controlled at 3d. per dozen more in Dublin than in Cork, the differentiation in price being responsible for the diversion to Dublin, where buyers stand to make a profit of 7/6 per case more than they would get in Cork, the rail charges being only 1/6 per case of 36 dozen; if he is aware that by reason of the controlled price workers, invalids, hospitals and institutions are so deprived of this necessary food; and, if so, if he will state what action he is taking in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take questions 7 and 8 together. I am not aware that the recent Order controlling the price of eggs is giving dissatisfaction throughout the country. Eggs are always scarce at this time of the year, and the Order was made so as to prevent an abnormal increase in the price to the consumer. In making the Order I made provision for the usual difference in price which I was advised always operated as between Dublin and other places.  I received certain representations suggesting that eggs were being diverted to Dublin from other districts, and that the maximum price in Cork should be increased.  I have no evidence that such diversion has occurred, and I am not prepared to accept the suggestion that the price in Cork should be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he received a letter from wholesalers informing him that diversion of eggs had taken place by reason of the difference in price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that, so far as the inquiries which I made have revealed the position, there has been no such diversion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="381" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Cork Workers' Council stated that there was such diversion, and that the wholesalers supplemented that statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it impossible to understand why, if there has been diversion to Dublin, it should be from Cork alone, and that no such reports have been received from any other part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the cost of transit from Cork to Dublin is less than the difference in the price of eggs and, consequently, it pays to transfer them to Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference which has been provided for in the Order has always prevailed between Cork and Dublin.  So I am advised by persons who are engaged in this trade and by officials of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that within the week following the imposition of control, there was an abnormal shortage of eggs, and that within the past week 1,000 eggs were dumped in one Dublin street because they were held up too long?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware, but when Deputies refer to a shortage of eggs they must take into account that if the price had not been controlled, prices would probably have risen and there would not be the same demand. Presumably, the fixed price has created a greater demand, but if higher prices had operated there would be a limited demand, which would have possibly obviated complaints of shortage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that the recent increases by the Electricity Supply Board are causing considerable hardship amongst many of the poorer dwellers in towns and cities, and if he will consider the advisability of seeing whether these charges could now be revised; and, also, if he can state, in <Col N="382" /> detail, the reasons for these increased charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The increases in charges by the Electricity Supply Board have been allowed only after an examination of the financial position of the board.  The increased charges are justified by increased costs of the Electricity Supply Board arising out of the circumstances of the emergency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have now received the letter referred to from the Tullamore Urban District Council.  The charge in this case has not been investigated in particular, but all accounts and costs of the Electricity Supply Board have been investigated, and I am satisfied that the level of charges in general is reasonable and that excessive charges have not been made.  I do not propose to investigate the multitude of individual charges made by this undertaking and representations in respect of such matters should be addressed to the board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A communication from the Blackwater Branch of the Irish Labour Party was received on November 26th.  Prior to that date, however, the necessary steps had been taken in the Blackwater area, in common with other areas in County Wexford, to deal with certain difficulties which had arisen in connection with the distribution of turf.  It is expected that the <Col N="383" /> arrangements made in the matter will provide a solution of the difficulties, in so far as turf is concerned.  As the Deputy is aware, no control is exercised over timber fuel; and it is not proposed to take any special steps in regard to the provision of firewood in the BIackwater area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether his attention has been drawn to the grave difficulties experienced by large numbers of persons in Dublin in obtaining supplies of turf from small shops and bellmen; and whether be proposes to take measures to ensure that adequate supplies are made available through these channels of distribution in the various districts of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that for a short period prior to the opening of the dumps on the 19th November, 1943, difficulties were experienced by a number of the bellmen and small shops in obtaining supplies of turf adequate to meet the increased demand for fuel due to changing weather conditions.  The necessary steps have been taken to deal with the matter, and it is not expected that there will be any recurrence of these difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware that these difficulties still exist and that although further steps are being taken by Fuel Importers Limited to supply the bell trade, these have improved the situation to a limited extent only?  I suggest that the best solution would be to open dumps in outlying districts where people could obtain supplies themselves as it is impossible for the bellmen to carry the quantity of turf required to these outlying areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>All the dumps are now operating but I take it that the Deputy's suggestion is that we should have dumps in outlying areas.  That matter was fully considered in the light of the experience last year, but it was found difficult to find localities where turf would be dumped and protected while in the dumps.  Some additional dumps have been opened in <Col N="384" /> outlying areas but not to the extent some Deputies represented to be necessary, following on last year's experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that bellmen who were formerly supplied by the merchants are now being supplied from the Phoenix Park. That means that the south side and part of the north side of the city are being catered for by these bellmen but the bellmen are still unable to supply areas in Crumlin and North Cabra as they are unable to carry the volume of fuel required.  In view of these circumstances, would the Minister consider opening up the timber dumps to serve these areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be unwise to dispose of the reserves of timber fuel at the moment.  So long as we can ensure that public needs can be met out of the turf supplies, we shall concinue to supply turf.  The timber fuel is being held as an iron ration to meet a situation, which may arise before the war is over.  The position with regard to turf is that supplies must be brought in during the summer and stacked in dumps. There is no alternative to that arrangement. Normally no difficulty arises because requirements are met from supplies as they come in but as increased demands arise daring the winter period it is necessary to go to the dumps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Senior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the corporation had arranged to open up a number of dumps for the distribution of fuel?  We had 11 depots opened up.  Why should the corporation not be allowed to supply the people from these depots?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.  I take it the Deputy is referring to the cheap fuel scheme. None of the dumps available to meet the fuel ration is under the control of the corporation.  They are under the control of Fuel Importers, Limited.</P>

I have received no representations from any organisation desiring to purchase for free distribution a portion of the supplies which will be available, but if such representations are made, arrangements will be made to bring the parties into touch with the wholesale importers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The function of the Minister for Supplies in this matter is to bring in all the supplies he can and make them available at a price that does not yield an unreasonable profit to traders.  If there is amongst charitable organisations or on the part of the Dublin Corporation a desire to procure some of the supplies for free distribution to children in hospitals or elsewhere, they can be facilitated but any specific arrangement that might be made for Dublin would be a matter for some organisation in Dublin.</P>

They can mill wholemeal flour.  In so far as some of them may have attempted to produce a white flour, that has been done by the use of sieves.

      <P>The Deputy's suggestion that covered waggons should be supplied for the transport of stone if open waggons are not available would not be practicable.

Moreover, as pointed out in the reply given on 24th June, 1941, to a question by the Deputy, the board, as a matter of normal policy makes a supply of electricity available wherever it is possible to do so on a reasonably economic basis.  It will be understood, however, that at present owing to shortage of coal and other supplies extensions must of necessity be severely restricted.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state why the Haulbowline Steel Mills have practically closed down after collecting large quantities of scrap iron; what amount of Government money has been granted or loaned to this company, and when it is anticipated that the mill will be in a position to produce horseshoe iron.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Operations in the Haulbowline Steel Rolling Mills have been limited up to the present to the rolling of iron and steel bars, etc., from billets.  The quantity of billets available for processing during the present year was very limited, and when the supply of billets was exhausted rolling operations ceased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> Before wrought iron and steel scrap can be converted into rolled iron and steel goods it is necessary, as a preliminary step, to melt the scrap metal in furnaces.  The existing plant and equipment at Haulbowline do not include furnaces, but efforts are being made to procure, the necessary materials for the construction of furnaces. It is not possible to say, at this stage, when the furnaces will be completed or whether the necessary materials will, in fact, be available under present conditions.</P>
    <P>Certain limited quantities of billets may be available from time to time, and when arrangements are being made for the rolling of bars, etc., from such billets consideration will be given to the possibility of making quantities of shoeing iron available to farriers.</P>
    <P>The Government has not granted or loaned any moneys to the company.  I have, however, given a guarantee as to principal and interest under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1939, in respect of a sum of £200,000.</P>

      <P>The post of medical officer of the Ballinrobe No. 2 (Cappaghduff) Dispensary District, which includes the Tourmakeady area, has been filled by a temporary medical officer since the 1st January, 1942.  The delay in making a permanent appointment was occasioned, firstly, by the former Mayo Board of Health and Public Assistance adjourning consideration of the filling of the vacancy from January to August, 1942; secondly, by the coming into operation in August, 1942, of the Local Government Act, 1941.  Under that Act the statutory procedure for determining the qualifications for the post of dispensary medical officer was changed.  These qualifications, including the number of years' experience required of candidates, had to be determined in conjunction with the Local Appointments Commissioners.  In the meantime, a number of similar posts in the Gaeltacht became vacant, and it was decided by the Local Appointments Commissioners to set up an interview board to interview the candidates for all the vacant posts in Gaeltacht districts.  Owing to the fact that some of those invited to act on the interview board were unable to act, the date originally proposed for the meeting of the board had to be deferred.  The interview board is at present in session.  The recommendations for the filling of the permanent post should be made early next month.</P>

      <P>The possibility of operating a scheme of the kind suggested in the question has been under examination, but investigations have not been concluded.  The examination so far has shown that the difficulties to be overcome in framing such a scheme&mdash;including problems relating to supply, the prevention of abuses, and methods of distribution, etc.&mdash;are so great that a scheme on a reasonable basis may not be practicable, and will in any event require a great deal of prior organisation.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a film such as the Deputy describes is being made.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, &ldquo;March of Time&rdquo; is an American company which has produced documentary films dealing with life and events in many countries, including our own.  On this occasion permission was asked through our Legation in Washington for the making of a documentary film on present-day Ireland, our Minister there being assured by &ldquo;March of Time&rdquo; that both the photography and commentary would be entirely objective. Permission was, accordingly, given, and two representatives are now in this country.  Although I have no official knowledge of the subjects filmed, I understand that &ldquo;shots&rdquo;<Col N="403" /> have been taken such as Army, Marine Service, A.R.P., and fire fighting exercises, Maynooth College, the G.A.A. finals, the Oireachtas reception, the export of live stock, the shipping of bloodstock to Spain and Portugal, social functions, fairs, etc.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last part of the question, the Deputy presumably refers to the resentment created by the manner in which the taking of certain &ldquo;shots&rdquo; was arranged by the &ldquo;March of Time&rdquo; representatives at a social function in Dublin.  This matter was taken up with them, and I understand that as well as repeating the assurance that the film shown will be entirely objective, an undertaking has been given that the &ldquo;shots&rdquo; objected to will not be used.  I should add that the film is not in any sense official, and that outside of security considerations there is no control of, or interference with, the &ldquo;March of Time&rdquo; representative here.</P>

    <Title>Vocational Education (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1943&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;&mdash; (Minister for Education).</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the House a fairly lengthy exposition of our views on this Bill, and I wish now to summarise some of the main points. All Parties in the House are agreed, I think, as to the importance of vocational education.  It is a new service in the State and has been well received by the citizens.  It may not have attained a uniform level of excellence all over the country.  There may be the usual ups and downs in the standards. It may be better in the cities than in the rural parts, but, viewing it as a whole, it is a very important service that has proved its worth.  We know that the commercial prosperity and the power of other nations have been assisted by a proper recognition of, and support for, technological education.  We know that in the postwar years, too, this branch of education will be of extreme importance.  We cannot have a developing industry and a flourishing commerce without the men to man them, and unless we have a proper perspective of vocational education we are going to be faced with grave difficulties in the development of this part of the life blood of our nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for these reasons that we have supported, in general, the financial provisions for the expansion of vocational education, and, because we desire to advance this branch of education, we have shown great concern in regard to the sections of the Bill affecting officers serving under vocational education committees. These points, which I have dealt with very fully, are summarised <Col N="412" /> under the headings of retiral age, suspension and dismissal, and the application of these measures to the officers who at present hold office under the different committees.  I need not emphasise that we believe in efficiency. We believe in high standards.  We want to elevate the level of the profession in order to have proper harmony and a proper spirit of cooperation. We want to safeguard the conditions of employment of these officers who are engaged in giving us their valuable services.  I have given reasons why we do not object to the fixing of a retiral age, provided, however, that the principle already adopted, though somewhat in abeyance at present in the Department, of adding years of service for pension purposes is admitted.  I stress that point. I think that if we recall that the older officers in the service, whose number is diminishing year by year, were pioneers in the service, were called upon to man it as a new extension of our educational system, we must realise that they deserve special consideration in this respect.</P>
    <P>Forty years of teaching is enough for any man, but there are some of these men who still feel that they are capable of giving many years of excellent service to the State and think that there is discrimination against them.  They find, for instance, that professors in the universities may go on until they have reached the age of 70 years.  The main test that they wish to put is the fitness of the officer for educational purposes.  If a man is fit they think that he should be continued in the service year by year, at least, over perhaps the actual statutory limit which may be fixed at 65 years in order that he will have some recompense for the lifetime of work that he has put into the service.</P>
    <P>There is the question of pensions which is of extreme importance to these men because, in this service, there is no provision made for them or for their dependents when, for instance, officers die.  This omission, of course, is a very grave one and hits the officers in a very serious manner.  It requires them to make provision for their dependents, and for that reason, <Col N="413" /> among others, they wish to have the maximum pension and the conditions under which they get it safeguarded. We have pointed out that there is no time limit in the Bill in reference to the question of the suspension of officers.  We think it would be more just and more correct if there were some time limit in the case of suspension, so that there would be some determination of the case.  Furthermore, we have stressed the fact that there should be payment of the remuneration of an officer who has been exculpated as a result of an inquiry, of an officer who has been declared not guilty.  There should also be provision for defraying the expenses of an officer in such a case as that.</P>
    <P>The withholding of his remuneration, while he is suspended, inflicts a grave hardship on an officer.  It may prevent him, in fact, from obtaining the legal aid which it would be necessary for him to have in order to state his case, and, therefore, we think it should not be left in the hands of the Minister to decide whether or not, or to what extent, this remuneration will be returned to the officer when the period of suspension is over.  If such provision is not inserted it would appear that suspension is automatically followed by dismissal, and in that case there is no sense whatever in an inquiry.  We are not informed as to the type of inquiry, but we assume, unless the Minister makes a statement to the contrary, that &ldquo;inquiry&rdquo;&mdash;a sworn inquiry&mdash;will have the same meaning in this amending Bill as &ldquo;inquiry&rdquo; has in the Act of 1930 under Sections 105, 106 and 107 which I have quoted.  We are not objecting to the power of suspension, but we think that, in fairness to the officers and in fairness to the rights of the committee, it should be a committee, with the approval of the Minister, following some definite procedure, which should have this right of suspension.  In every case we hold that there should be a proper inquiry following suspension.</P>
    <P>We have objected to Sections 7 and 8 particularly.  I went into detail on these, and showed how they violate Section 99 of the Principal Act which <Col N="414" /> preserved the rights, conditions and remuneration of the officers transferred to the vocational education committees.  I want to stress now that I think that in a Legislature such as this no Bill should amend a Principal Act by implication, and that if there is to be the repeal of any provision in a Principal Act, it should be done specifically.  In particular, I think that Sections 7 and 8 should not have any application to existing officers.</P>
    <P>Section 8 gives the statutory grounds for removal.  I asked for some more precise definition of unfitness, and suggested that the unfitness to be taken into consideration in respect of the dismissal of an officer should be educational unfitness.  There may be different types of unfitness.  A man may be unfit from the point of view of being a politician, but may be eminently suitable from the point of view of being an educationist.  We have at present no idea of what may occur in the political life of this country. We have had in the past very embittered times, when there was a great deal of political rancour and bias which was injected in many cases into spheres into which it should not have been injected.  There is no evidence of that at present, but we cannot say what the situation will be in the future and we look to the future in order to safeguard these men and to see that they are not victimised on account of some political, philosophical or sociological beliefs which they may hold and which may not coincide with those held by some future Minister.</P>
    <P>It is quite likely&mdash;it has occurred in other Departments in the past &mdash;that officers with, say, advanced Labour, Clann na Talmhan, or other opinions, may find themselves politically opposed to the Minister and may find their positions, in so far as these opinions are taken into consideration, very seriously affected.  We have not had any such trouble under the present Ministry, and, unless we have a statement to the contrary, which naturally we do not expect, we take it that the views of officers on these matters will not be <Col N="415" /> taken into consideration when judging the question of fitness or unfitness.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to object very strongly to that part of Section 3 which deals with the sending of a notice and the Minister informed me, to my surprise, that the Dáil had incorporated such a provision in a previous Act.  I have since taken steps to look up the debates on the Local Government Act, 1941, and find, to my stupefaction, that the Minister is absolutely correct.  Section 25 of that Act evidently slipped through the House without anybody whatever objecting to it.  There seems to have been no reference whatever to it.  The House evidently was not sufficiently aware of, or sufficiently interested in it, to check up on its serious implications. As a democratic Assembly, the House should have been very loath to pass such a section.  In the Seanad, however, there was a reference to it by Senator O'Donovan, but he merely objected to the time limit of seven days which he held to be too short and which he asked should be increased to 14 days.  It did not strike him, however, that the sending of a notice was the operative part of the section which would inflict the greatest hardship if the section were embodied in the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the finish.  That was the chief point which I particularly wanted to check up on, as, at that time, I was, as I said, in ignorance of the fact that the House had passed this section in another Bill. It gives us, however, an opportunity of rejecting this principle, which is a very serious one in that it takes away the rights of the citizen, even though that citizen be an officer functioning under these vocational education committees. We want harmonious relations in the vocational education service, and we do not want the officers to be under suspicion.  We expect a liberal interpretation by the present Minister of the different sections of the Bill, <Col N="416" /> more particularly where they apply to existing officers, but we cannot examine the Bill, and the Bill should not be examined, from that point of view, because we have no guarantee as to the mentality or outlook on vocational education of any succeeding Ministers.</P>
      <P>They may be members of other Parties, when the Minister has taken up another position, and their views on vocational education may not be the same as his, and they may not be as liberal in respect of these officers. If we have a Clann na Talmhan Government we may have a Minister for Education picked from some of the people with the mentality of the members of the Roscommon Vocational Education Committee, which alone amongst all the committees in Ireland refused to pay the bonus sanctioned by the Minister, although the Minister has taken no steps to enforce its payment. We have no guarantee as to what will occur in the future, and it was for that reason that we decided to take a very narrow view of the Bill, until we had got definite assurances upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, this Bill is supposed to bring us into line with other local officers through the country.  The Minister for Agriculture has argued the same point with regard to his amending Bill, but the amazing thing is that the Minister for Agriculture does not require Section 8 which is embodied in this Bill.  That Local Government Act, which is the basis of this amending measure, was passed mainly to suit the County Management Act.  That was not a democratic measure, in our view, and, up to this, the vocational education committees and these agricultural committees are the only local bodies of a democratic character which are left.  We propose under this Bill to rob them of any shred of power they have.  That is not a very good purpose for any legislative assembly, and I think the House should resist the spreading of that power in relation to these committees.  The Constitution provides certain safeguards for the citizen.  It may not be the proper place to raise the matter, but I doubt whether these sections are not in conflict with, or even <i>ultra vires</i>, <Col N="417" /> that Constitution.  They are, if they are interpreted, as I interpret them, as a deprivation of the elementary rights of the citizen and, as such, should be resisted by the House.</P>

      <P>I propose to address myself to an aspect of this question other than that which Deputy Connolly has touched on, although I may perhaps be permitted to make some reference to the points he has mentioned. I want to raise with the Minister the question of whether this Bill should be enacted without a general inquiry into the present position regarding vocational education.  In addressing myself to that question, I am limited to the extent that I propose to refer only to the rural areas.  It is quite possible that the position in the urban areas is different from the position in rural areas, but I believe that there is great dissatisfaction with this whole system in the rural areas.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that this is an amending Bill of very limited scope indeed, dealing with two matters.

The other is&mdash;the qualifications for membership of committees, and three items dealing with the age limit, suspension and removal of officers, and nothing else.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I would respectfully point out that this Bill proposes to increase the rate both in rural and urban areas for vocational education.  I propose to address myself to showing that that should not be done until an inquiry into the whole matter is held and the result discussed.  I want to say that I view with very considerable misgiving the question of increasing the rate in rural areas for vocational education purposes without having some more justification for the proposal than appears up to the present, or than appears from the results of 13 years' experience of vocational education.  It is 13 years since the Act was passed and, during that time, there ought to have been some detailed report as to progress.  We have had no general <Col N="418" /> report presented as to what actually has been the result.  I am quite satisfied that in many cases throughout the country the attendance at vocational schools is only kept up by a great effort, and I have very considerable misgiving as to whether the system is justifying itself.  I submit then that, in addressing ourselves to the question of providing increased revenue for that purpose, it is legitimate to discuss how far even the money that has been already expended for that purpose has been justified by the results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of what I intended to say has already been covered by Deputy Connolly and some other speakers.  There are two sections in this Bill which, in common with a number of other Deputies, I consider are of a rather penal character.  I refer to Sections 6 and 9 of the Bill.  It is proposed in Section 6, which deals with the question of age, to retire a number of persons who have reached the age of 65 years.  I do not want to put down an amendment if that can be avoided and, therefore, I want to submit a case to the Minister which I feel certain will get his sympathetic consideration. He was a member of that profession and he ought to know some of the difficulties that have arisen in connection with the teaching profession in all <Col N="420" /> branches in this country.  I have something like 30 years' experience of the working of the old Technical Education Act, and of this Act as a member of the Cork Borough Committee, of which I am still a member.  Therefore I speak with some knowledge of the working of both technical instruction and vocational education in this country.  Under Section 6 of this Bill a very large number of teachers would not qualify for full pension because they would not have 40 years' service by the time this Bill becomes an Act and, therefore, would be retired on modified pensions after 30 to 35 years' service.  If the Minister will consider the matter in all its aspects, I am certain he will have a good deal of sympathy with the case I am about to make.  I know many cases where officers entered the service at the age of 30 years, having already served an apprenticeship to some craft or trade and gone through a technological teachers' course.  A young man appointed at 30 years of age would not have 40 years' service which would entitle him to full pension, until he was 70 years of age.  If he were retired at 65, he would be five years short of that service.  I suggest that he has certain rights preserved for him under the 1930 Act.  I suggest to the Minister that he should look up that Act and see in what way the rights of such an officer will be protected.  The guarantee given to him under that Act has the same force as Article 10 of the Treaty has in reference to transferred officers from the British service.  It guaranteed to these teachers that at the end of a certain period they would have certain pension rights.  I feel that these men and women in the service will have a big grievance if they are compulsorily retired now.  I suggest to the Minister that he should insert a sub-section in this Bill which would enable these persons I refer to to draw a full pension by giving them added years of service.  There was a very old custom extending back over 30 years under which public officials who retired before they had the full 40 years' service were given added years of service to entitle them to full pensions. I think the solution in these cases is to add four or five years where <Col N="421" /> they are four or five years short of the 40 years' service.</P>
      <P>In regard to Section 9 of the Bill, I think here again the Minister should take into consideration all the facts in regard to the position of these teachers.  Under this section the Minister takes complete powers of dismissal for certain reasons not specifically set out in the Bill.  It may be that we have a very excellent Minister for Education now, but we do not know who the next Minister for Education may be or who subsequent Ministers for Education may be and it is to my mind a retrograde act to remove all power from the local committees. Having been connected with the old Technical Instruction Committee and with its successor, the Vocational Education Committee, for an unbroken period of roughly 30 years, I may say I have never yet met even one case of serious remissness on the part of any teacher.  The arrangements worked very smoothly and I do not think this alteration would at all serve the purpose, which the Minister may have in mind, of creating more stability amongst vocational teachers or any other purpose.  In fact, I hold the view that it would have a very disturbing influence on the whole position.  I have said it is a retrograde step and I believe it is, if the section, as drafted in the Bill before the House, becomes operative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, which I think will be borne out by the very large majority of those engaged in vocational education, whether as members of a vocational committee or as teachers, the arrangements at present being carried out are perfectly satisfactory.  There may have been in certain parts of the country some abuses.  I do not know. I am speaking for the Cork Vocational Committee and the old Technical Instruction Committee, where there have been no abuses.  We never had to invoke the aid of the Minister at any time to correct any abuses, because they did not exist.  I would ask the Minister to consider the points I have raised in regard to Sections 6 and 9 of the Bill and to consider the grave injustice and hardships that would be inflicted by these sections as at present drafted on a number of most deserving <Col N="422" /> teachers and, by the way, very successful teachers.  Some consideration should be given to the fact that, in some of the trades classes for instance, these teachers have had to spend long years in training in order to satisfy the Department as to their qualifications to teach any given subject.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of this Bill is a very penal section, in my view, which gives the Minister full authority.  Nobody wants to take any authority from the Minister if the local vocational committees recommend that he should take very stern measures in regard to any given teacher, but Deputy Connolly made the point a moment ago that there may be outside influence brought to bear on the Minister.  We are all human, and the Minister is only human.  It might be quite possible that, assuming the Farmers' Party were in power in this country&mdash;which God forbid, because I know what would happen then&mdash;and assuming that they objected to certain members of the various staffs, there might be a Minister in power who, being only human, might react to demands or requests by any Party in this House.  I do feel that the Minister is making trouble for himself and that we would be well advised to reconsider Sections 6 and 9 of the Bill, with a view to meeting the demands of a number of seriously minded educationists in this country.  When I say educationists I am talking not only of those engaged in the profession of teaching, but those who are associated with them day after day and week after week on the various vocational committees in this country.  I make this strong appeal to the Minister with regard to those two sections. I believe something must be done in regard to those two sections to arrange matters so that no injustice or grave hardship will be inflicted on those people.</P>
    <P>Leave is given frequently to teachers to absent themselves from school even for months at a time for the purpose of attending Irish colleges and perfecting themselves, as far as possible, in the Irish language and the teaching of the Irish language.  That leave of absence has always been given &mdash;and very properly so&mdash;during my time. <Col N="423" /> It is never refused.  In this connection I want to say something that may be more acceptable to the Minister.  We have always granted that leave to a teacher who applies for it.  The teacher attends the Irish course or some other post-graduate course which will enable him to become a better teacher.  But I know&mdash;and I think the Minister may have this fact in mind&mdash; that there have been abuses.  I agree that there must be finality somewhere and that leave of absence does not mean absence for one or two or three years.  I know cases where that has occurred.  It did not occur in connection with the Cork Borough Committee, but I know that it occurred in the country.  There was no finality and teachers applied for one year's absence and the absence might run into two years.  I see there is a danger there, and I think something should be done to limit the time of absence and that the Minister should have power to put a limit to the time that teachers will be absent from schools.</P>
    <P>As one who has always taken a very deep and abiding interest in the technical and vocational branch of our educational system, I would suggest to the Minister that he should carefully consider Sections 6 and 9.  I am not so concerned about the rest of the Bill. I have received a great deal of literature in regard to this matter but I am not talking by the book.  I am speaking from experience and I know I am voicing the opinion, not only of the teachers, but also of those who are interested in education.  I hope the Minister will look into these sections with a view to making the Bill more acceptable to all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephMeighan" hpid="Mr. Meighan Mr. Meighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested, I think, that the Roscommon Vocational Committee has been unfair. Were it not for this suggestion, I think I would not have intervened in this debate.  I am not a member of the Roscommon Vocational Committee but I am chairman of the county council, the parent body that nominated the present vocational committee. The chairman of that committee, until a few months ago, was Dean <Col N="424" /> Cummins, Dean of Elphin, who was accepted by all, by the Government Party and by the former Government, as an authority on vocational education. His successor, up to a couple of weeks ago, was the administrator of Ballaghadereen who is now the parish priest of Ballymote.  There is a number of other clergymen on the committee which is representative of the whole county.  I feel I would not be doing my duty if I did not give the views of Roscommon, and when I speak on this Bill I am speaking on behalf of County Roscommon alone.  For the reasons I have already stated, any steps that have been taken by our committee have been taken after a very full consideration of the facts. They put forward their views and, as I have said, they took steps accordingly, after full consideration, and I should like to point out that, in any decisions they have come to, they had full regard to the financial ability of the taxpayers of Roscommon, so far as their paying capacity is concerned, to provide the necessary amount for vocational education.  Therefore, I think it is unfair to single out County Roscommon in this regard.  As I have pointed out, they have given their views very frankly and fairly, and I, as one of the representatives, mean to stand by them.  As a representative of Roscommon, I feel bound to say here that I stand by the views that were expressed by the Roscommon Vocational Committee, and I should like to be assured by the Minister, through you, Sir, that it will not be made compulsory or mandatory on Roscommon County Council to provide an extra rate for this purpose, because I think that the present feeling in Roscommon is that there is not enough money being provided for vocational education in that county, from the Central Fund, and therefore they resent the imposition of an additional rate.  I think I can say that that is the general view, so far as Roscommon is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer, and this has reference to a proposed action which, in my opinion, would also be resented: and that is, the matter of taking <Col N="425" /> authority away entirely from the hands of the local county committees, and appointing officers to the various bodies concerned.  I have a particular case in mind in regard to that matter. Last July, in connection with the shortage of thread and woollen worsted for the making of socks, the county committee in Roscommon, where there was an abundance of wool, appointed two lady instructresses to go around through the county and give lessons in the home-spinning of wool; yet, notwithstanding the fact that these instructresses were appointed last July, and that we are now practically approaching Christmas, the object of appointing them has not been realised.</P>

      <P>I have a fairly close association with the affairs of the City of Dublin since the commencement of the Act with which we are now dealing, and I feel bound to say that the system is working reasonably well so far as the City of Dublin is concerned.  I should also like to say that, so far as our relations with the City of Dublin Vocational Committee are concerned, that department, in recent years, certainly, has been very helpful in any matters that we have had to undertake, and particularly in connection with building operations. Recently, for instance, we have had the active help of some of the principal officers of that institution, and I am surprised that the Minister found it necessary to introduce this amending Bill, on the two bases that he has put forward, having regard to the general application and working of the Act, as originally introduced.  One of these two bases was in regard to the question of increased financial aid, and the <Col N="426" /> second was concerned with the question of principal officers.</P>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I must say that I think the time was opportune for the working of the main Act, and that it would have been very helpful to the Minister, and to all concerned, in that respect, whether in the City of Dublin or in the country districts, if, of our own volition, we had undertaken a review of what has been done by the various headmasters in these vocational institutions throughout the country&mdash;a review of the 1939 Act, on which the board is engaged, and the report of which we are anxiously awaiting.  I believe that if some approach were to be made along these lines down through the country, it would have a very good effect, because it seems to me that the feeling, generally, is, that the Act has not been implemented in the way which was intended. Even amongst my own colleagues I find a divergence of views as to the general utility of the Act so far as urban and rural areas are concerned.</P>
      <P>There is a feeling amongst the public, generally, that a big portion of the work of these technical schools is taken up by commercial courses.  I find that out of 54,000 persons attending such schools in Dublin, all but about 4,000 are studying commercial courses. Whether that is lopsided or not I cannot say, but I can definitely say that all facilities, on the technological side, are available in the City of Dublin, and there is no grievance there; but I do suggest that since the Minister is bringing in this question of an extra rating for vocational education, we might be allowed to have the benefit of the experience of the people who have been engaged in this work for many years&mdash;particularly in view of the fact, as I understand it to be, that in the City of Cork, if the Minister wishes to take powers for the maintenance of such continuation classes, that pre-supposes that there should be provision for children between the ages of 14 and 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the City of Dublin is concerned, I understand that we have not room for even an additional half a dozen pupils in our schools.  I wonder <Col N="427" /> whether the Minister has envisaged the possibility that under the maximum rate in operation, which it is now proposed to alter, some committees may, if this twopenny rate is put on them, switch back to the powers which local authorities have, of devoting the money thus raised to other purposes, and in that way nullifying the effect of this.  In so far as the rating is concerned, I want to point out to the Minister that, so far as the City of Dublin is concerned, in comparison with other vocational education areas, there is that rather disquieting fact, and I should like to know why we should be discriminated against as against other areas in the country. For instance, in Cork it would amount to 4d. and even in Dun Laoghaire, which is quite near to us the contribution is 2d.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the main Act, and I am pointing out that, in the amendment of the main Act by this Bill, Dublin is being put on the same basis as the other areas to which I have referred.  Now, on the question of the officers concerned, a good deal has been said with regard to individuals who were associated with other committees.  In that connection, may I say that in my ten or 12 years association with a vocational education committee here in the City of Dublin we have never had a single instance&mdash;not one&mdash;where it was necessary to report a member of the staff to the Minister, on any question of discipline or otherwise?  From my own personal experience and close knowledge of these teachers, I can say that we have as high a standard of teaching in our schools&mdash;I am speaking for Dublin&mdash;as can be found in any other county, and that they are doing their work magnificently.  For that reason, I can only express amazement, again, that, so far as concerns a system which has been working so smoothly, and where the teachers concerned have been doing their best, the <Col N="428" /> Minister should find it necessary to requite the services of these teachers in this particular way.  The only reason that I can think of, to induce the Minister to take this particular action, is to bring the present system into line with the Local Government and Public Health Act, and if there is one thing that I take personal pride in, it is that, as a result of our activities in former days, we brought about the measure of autonomy which every local authority requires.  Now, however, it would appear that the Minister proposes to undermine the authority of the local county committees.</P>
      <P>We have an excellent staff of upwards of 500 teachers and for a number of years, there has not been the slightest complaint either on the part of the committee or the teachers as far as their work is concerned.  I repeat, therefore, that this amendment dealing with officers would seem to be exceedingly vexatious.  I appeal to the Minister to remove that section, whereby he proposes to deal with individual officers without any reference to the committees.  Local inquiry will be made, without the slightest reference to the vocational committees. But I suggest that that would be the first breach in administration as far as these committees are concerned.  I regret that exceedingly because of the experience I have had in Dublin.  From what I heard during the last few weeks vocational teachers are seriously disturbed at the action the Minister proposes to take, and at this stage I appeal to him to take steps later to ensure that that disquietude will be removed.</P>

      <P>The debate on this Bill has gone on for a considerable length and most points of importance have been dealt with.  I wish to address myself to one particular section of the Bill, under which the Minister takes power to lay down the retiral age for officers.  Taking that as a principle, the Minister or whoever is responsible for that section would have the right to decide the age at which teachers retire. That is beyond dispute.  But in deciding the age for retirement full consideration <Col N="429" /> should be given to the fact that teachers should not be forced to retire under circumstances that would mean something near to destitution.  It may be fair enough to say that these officers are being brought into line with other local officials.  The pension scheme for local officers is 1/60th of their pay for each year's service.  That is designed for a service which people enter when young, where, given normal good health, they have a reasonable prospect of forty years' service, which would mean two-thirds by way of pensions. To link under a common standard those who enter when young and those who enter late in life is, to say the least of it, evidence of failure inside the Department to recognise the changed conditions in different branches of the same service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us throw our minds back to the way in which staffs for vocational schools were built up.  As we had no cadet school, we took people from other walks of life, school teachers and others, and they were appointed vocational teachers.  Obviously, at the date of appointment they were in the late twenties or thirties, and Dáil Eireann is now asked to approve of a scheme under which they will be compulsorily retired at an age that would make it impossible for them to have reached any reasonable pensionable standard. On the face of it that is a breach of contract.  The conditions under which these men are serving are that they shall relinquish office or be compulsorily retired when unfit for further service, due to mental or physical incapacity. We are altering that position and saying that no matter how fit they are to continue to perform their duties, at a certain age to be decided by the Bill, they must go.  It is a common saying that a man is as old as his arteries.  Many people are too old for effective work at 65, but, on the other hand, other people are as fit as, or fitter, at 65, than they were at 45.  I do not think it would be the opinion of Dáil Eireann that the Taoiseach would be unfit, an antique, in two years' time, yet we are laying it down that at 65 everybody in the service of the vocational committees is unfit to work.  Gladstone was Prime <Col N="430" /> Minister of Great Britain when he had passed 80 years, Marshal Hindenburg led armies when he was well past 70 years; Mr. Churchill is 69 to-day, and I expect there is greater responsibility and a greater demand on his mental and physical energies than on the most enthusiastic vocational teacher.  He is able to carry the burden.  I hope the Lord will spare him long to carry the burden, and to keep his mental and physical vigour.</P>
    <P>By Act of Parliament we are going to lay it down now that every man is too old for every form of public service at 65.  If that is the view of the Minister there is no doubt that he will carry it in the Dáil, but if he is going to standardise it, that every Irishman is too old for any useful work at 65, then be generous.  We have to remember that people who are not vocational teachers, and who may have to perform very hard and exacting physical work, are not regarded as old enough to be pensionable until they are 70.  That is the standard laid down by this State for the ordinary man and woman, that they are fit for hard physical labour until they reach 70 years, but a vocational teacher must be thrown on the scrap-heap at 65.</P>
    <P>If we are going to do that, and to decide that, irrespective of the physical condition of a person, surely we should in a pension scheme recognise the fact of compulsory retirement at a certain age.  When the local government pension scheme was drafted and approved of, the condition determining cessation of service was physical or mental unfitness.  That might arise on one side of 60 or might not arise until the far side of 60 was reached, but, at least, everybody enjoying normal health was given a reasonable prospect of securing two-thirds of their pay by way of pension.  I venture to say that the average vocational instructor took up duty in the late twenties.  Such teachers must leave, we shall say, in the early sixties.  There is no mathematical chance of any one of those getting a reasonable pension.</P>
    <P>Again we have in this particular Act, in a rather slavish parrot-like manner, carried along phrases that are merely of importance because of their <Col N="431" /> antiquity and that are particularly inappropriate when they are carried into Pensions Acts in a new State.  We have the old phraseology of the British Acts that were reasonable enough where there was a long history of government and continuous, uninterrupted service.  Now this State as a self-governing entity, is only 21 years old.  We established a number of new services in this State and the only place where we could find staffs was from the pre-existing services within the State.  If any officer was to equip himself for any of the new services he had to leave his old service, to do a course and to secure a diploma of some kind or another.  If he were ambitious or anxious to serve in a fuller capacity in the new State he had to interrupt his service.  Would it be unreasonable, therefore, to suggest that in all these Acts, governing pensions in this State, we should provide for cumulative service?  The fact that it was interrupted for a week, a month or a year should not invalidate all the previous years of service. Surely that is a fair principle and surely it is a most important principle where you are dealing with officers, the bulk of whom had to resign from some position in this State which they previously held and where there was an interval, smaller or greater in different cases, of interrupted service.  Surely recognition of cumulative service is a fair demand in such cases.</P>
    <P>Remember somebody is getting away with the fact that they are not being pensioned for their whole service.  The State, public funds, either central or local, are being saved the cost.  Say a man was seven years in one State service, remained a year out and then came into the vocational service. Somebody is getting the benefit of his forfeiture of pension for the other seven years' service.  If the Minister is going to insist on an age limit for all officers irrespective of health, vigour or capacity to do their work efficiently, then it is only fair to urge that special pension terms be granted so as to compensate for loss of office.  I am aware of at least one case, assuming the age limit is fixed by the Minister at 65 years, of a highly efficient teacher who <Col N="432" /> has given complete satisfaction to the Department, to the local committee, and to the students who have passed through his classes, who will be compulsorily forced out after 20 years' service with no pension whatsoever.  At the present time that man is earning a pension.  He is in good health, in splendid physical condition and has plenty of vigour at this moment to look forward to ten or 15 years more efficient service and pension based on 35 years' service at the end of it.  He will be 65 within a few months.  If 65 is the limit fixed in this Bill, he goes out and he will not have the 21 years' service which is necessary to qualify for a pension.  He goes out, therefore, without any pension.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister, if he wants to exercise his own rights in laying down age limits, to do it on general lines.  It is a very serious thing for any employer to break a contract made with his employees.  The State should be the example to be followed by all other employers.  If a big firm like Guinness' Brewery to-morrow broke through contracts made with their workers, this Assembly here would be a kind of hullabaloo.  Government Deputies and Government Ministers would intervene to ensure that contracts made between big employers and numerous employees should be honoured.  Here in this country it seems to be the particular and peculiar privilege of the State to be the one great employer that is permitted to tear up a contract between itself and an employee at any time, as being of far less value than a scrap of paper.  We have had it done to officers in the professional services of the Army.  We have machinery to do it in the Agriculture (Amendment) Bill.  We have machinery to tear up contracts in this Bill.  I would urge on the Minister the inadvisability of such a course.  The number of vocational teachers is few.  In making special provision to give more generous pension terms you are only making it for one generation.  Successive generations of vocational teachers will come into this service at a younger age than those already serving and the reason that they came in at a comparatively advanced age was because they were <Col N="433" /> called in and asked to help to build up an infant service of an infant State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other Deputies, I take a rather serious view of the powers embodied in Section 4 of this Bill, which provides for an increased rate in rural areas of 1d in the £.  As I understand the Principal Act, it is mandatory on the county council to increase the rate by 1d. in the £ if a demand is made by the vocational committee.  For that reason, I feel that those who are interested in protecting the rights of the ratepayers must be concerned with this power to increase the rate and must naturally inquire from the Minister what justification there is at the present time for an increase in the rate for education. We can all recognise the fact that there has been an increase in the various costs&mdash;the cost of living, the cost of materials and other things, which might account for this demand. But, having regard to the lack of success which has attended vocational education, particularly in the rural areas, I fear that it is not justifiable to ask at present for this power to increase the rate.  As I understand, the Minister has power under Section 5 of the Bill to compel a county council to increase the rate by 1d. or 2d. in the £ for a particular year.  That is a very far-reaching power and it appears to be exercisable even if the rating authority are striking the maximum rate provided by this Bill.  It is just one other method by which the Minister and the officials of his Department can dictate to a vocational education committee and a rating authority to a far-reaching extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel very strongly that this demand for an increase in rates is not justifiable and that it will be the duty of the Minister, when replying, to give the House very definite reasons why this power is being demanded.  All over the rural areas we have provided new vocational schools.  I assume that, in providing these establishments, the local authorities were guided by the comparative success which had attended technical education in urban areas.  However, I suggest that there <Col N="434" /> was no comparison.  The efforts to provide technical education in these day schools in rural areas have been a complete failure.</P>
    <P>These schools do not provide, and cannot provide, the type of technical education which people who have to work on the land require.  The rural schools are open to objection on many other grounds.  They are open to the objection that, as they are day schools and are not residential, they are unable to obtain in their areas the number of pupils necessary to enable the classes to be conducted efficiently and economically.  They are also open to the objection that they are mixed schools.  There is very grave objection to that in rural areas by many people who have seriously considered this question of education.  For these reasons, I suggest that the powers sought in this amending Bill have not been justified by the Minister's opening statement, and we are entitled to demand that, in his concluding statement, he will put before the House strong and convincing reasons why this extra claim should be made upon the ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked whether I was satisfied that we were receiving the necessary co-operation from the vocational education committees throughout the country in operating the schemes. I am glad to say that the vocational education committees, in general, are co-operating very heartily, and I thank them for their co-operation.  As the Deputy pointed out, in referring to the financial clauses of this measure, we may with safety leave it to the committees to decide whether or not, in fact, they will get value for the expenditure proposed.  There are two sections in the Bill dealing with the rating powers.  Section 4 deals with the ordinary schemes, and it is proposed to permit the committees to increase the maximum rate for the ordinary working of the schemes by 1d. both in town and country.  Section 5 deals with the implementation of Part V of the Principal Act.  Part V of the Principal Act refers to compulsory continuation courses of 180 hours a week for young people from 14 to 16 <Col N="435" /> years of age&mdash;such courses as we have at the present time in the boroughs of Cork and Limerick.  Having ordered that provision to be given effect to, the Minister may, if he is satisfied that the committees are not in a position to finance its operation from their funds, demand from the rating authority that a rate be struck to meet the cost of the obligatory clauses.  He may serve notice on the rating authority for the vocational education area, requiring that authority to pay, in addition to the local contribution for the next year, a specified sum which shall not be more than 2d. in the £ in the rateable valuation in the four county boroughs and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, and not more than 1d. in the £ elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I explained in my opening statement the reasons why committees were finding it difficult to carry on.  I explained that 15 committees had reached their maximum income although their expenditure was still increasing.  That was because certain additional costs had been thrown upon them owing to the emergency&mdash;the additional cost of materials, of the upkeep of schools and bonus for teachers and employees.  In all the circumstances, the additional permissive rate of 1d. in the £ sought for the working of the schemes must, I think, be considered fair by any person who has a reasonable view about vocational education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I used to hear Deputy Cogan speak in this House of the necessity for scientific training for agriculture. I do not quite understand from his remarks whether it is just that he has a prejudice against schools, part of the upkeep of which must be paid for by the ratepayers, or whether his antipathy is to efforts to extend education generally in rural areas.  According to the Deputy, the schools in the rural areas are not a success, they are failures; they are giving a type of education that is not suitable; and the Deputy proceeds to lecture the House on aspects of the matter which I think we may safely leave in the hands of the competent authorities concerned. As the Ceann Comhairle has ruled the <Col N="436" /> matter out of order, I do not wish to proceed into a general survey of vocational education, but I really think that a Deputy who has the responsibility which Deputy Cogan claims in this House should, at least, give some reasons or some evidence to substantiate his charges that the system has failed in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy visited the school at Hacketstown in his own constituency&mdash; he may have heard of it&mdash;and as a reasonable person, considered the work that has been done there since the inception of the school, I feel he would come to the conclusion that, if it does not attain to the high standard the Deputy would like&mdash;a standard which he has failed to explain to us in the House&mdash;at any rate, the type of education that is given there is, as is the opinion of competent observers, very suitable to rural areas and to those who are preparing for life on the land.  If there has been any failure or any lack of attendance it is, in the first place, due to the fact that, failing compulsory powers, it is impossible very often to make people in rural areas realise the value of the courses for their children, as they are made to realise in the case of primary education, because the law compels them.  There is that difficulty, and there is also the fact that children in rural areas find it difficult to travel to the schools during the present emergency.  I am glad to say that in the vast majority of the schools&mdash;I think I might say all the schools outside the larger urban areas &mdash;the bulk of the pupils come from rural districts.  They and their parents must not have quite the same opinion of the value of the instruction given as that which Deputy Cogan holds but, perhaps, they have not the same knowledge or lack of knowledge as the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I have visited some of these schools and have seen children cycling long distances to attend courses.  Those children at the present time are very often kept at home because they are needed in connection with the spring work, the work on the bog and the harvest work, and that has affected the attendance.  Again, it is almost impossible <Col N="437" /> for them to get tyres for their bicycles, which also has affected the attendance.  Quite recently, I visited an important vocational school and found there were large numbers of children cycling long distances and making every effort to come.  Yet the Deputy says that the type of education given is not suitable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, whom I am glad to hear on this matter and whose enthusiastic co-operation and support of vocational education made it a matter of pride to me that he should be selected as the chief citizen of Dublin, has referred to the fact that a certain proportion&mdash;a minority&mdash;of the students in the vocational schools here in Dublin are doing commercial courses. I do not know what figures the Deputy had, but according to some figures that I have it does not appear, even in the City of Dublin, if we take the subjects of shorthand and typewriting, that the number of such pupils is substantial. The total enrolment at day and evening classes in Dublin was 54,905, while the numbers taking shorthand and typewriting were, in the day classes, 1,433 and in the evening classes, 1,929.  As far as these two subjects are concerned, at any rate, that would mean that the percentage of the total enrolments in day and evening classes who are taking these subjects was only 6.1.  In other areas, the figures are similar, sometimes running up to 10 or 11 per cent. In the rural areas, there is a large number of schools where no instruction in shorthand or typewriting is given.</P>
    <P>As regards vocational schools in rural areas generally, where the instruction in those subjects is being given, it is very carefully co-related to the instruction in the practical subjects which bear particularly on the life of the neighbourhood&mdash;rural science and manual or metal work in the case of boys, and domestic economy subjects in the case of the girls.  If Deputies would visit some of those rural schools and employ their time in getting some accurate and practical information as to the type of instruction which is being given, they would not come into the Dáil to make the absurd statements <Col N="438" /> they did make, that the type of educa tion that is being given is not suitable.</P>
    <P>A visitor to one of our vocational schools, broadcasting from Radio Eireann early in November, on her visit to a school, made the following remarks, which will give Deputies an idea of the kind of work that goes on in a rural vocational school:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Already one lot of boys and girls have finished a two-year course in rural science there and at night time over 100 men and women travel from as much as six to seven miles away to attend classes&mdash;and, of course, the social activities arranged there.</P>
    <P>In the hall, under an unobtrusive crucifix, hangs a large scale map of the district and a typed time-table on which you read of woodwork (which includes carpentry and construction in different materials), and cookery, Irish classes, and various subjects coming under the rural science course...  When I got there, they had been studying the structure and characteristics of certain kinds of bulbs.  There was a diagram or two on the board and I was relieved to see that it wasn't also covered with all the long-winded names we had to cram into our heads at school, without really knowing the simple outline of the thing first.</P>
    <P>The boys and girls there were just clearing off the desks the shallot samples they'd been using and going out into the garden to plant some.  They gave the impression of being responsible human beings doing something because they liked it.  There was none of that &lsquo;caged in&rsquo; feeling, that the children are dying to get away and carry on their own lives.  The boys made for the shed where rakes and spades are kept and were soon digging and preparing the ground while others planted. The girls, on the other hand, got busy taking hedge cuttings and planting out.  But before I tell you about the garden itself, first let us be clear what this rural science course consists of.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further down the statement goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" />&ldquo;The girls, of course, do cooking and needlework as well, the boys woodwork, which covers various other subjects, too.  During the first year they all get a general introduction to the life of plants and flowers and insects, backed up by the use of the microscope and observation. When the weather keeps them indoors more, they cover the geology of the neighbourhood, learn to keep a rain gauge, record weather changes and so on, which leads to a certain amount of physics and chemistry in relation to temperature, water, atmosphere, and later go on to studying the question of combustion, different forms of heat, etc.</P>
    <P>When March comes and they have learnt something about cells and sap and food generally, they do more practical work out of doors, and notice, not only soil conditions and what is happening in the plant world, but bring in news of how things are doing at home, for conditions vary very much in such a neighbourhood.  There are all sorts of problems for the teacher to solve; he's often asked about pests or plant diseases, and the seed testing which they do in the school is also a link with the work going on.  Another interesting side is learning how to make surveys of fields round about, and these maps, when drawn out with the greatest care, as I saw myself, are often pinned up with great pride in the pupils' houses.</P>
    <P>For the second winter of the course, more detailed classification and comparison can be done.  For instance, grasses are studied, this of course covers the main crops, wheat, oats, etc.  Talks on pests of various kinds and plant diseases introduce the study of bacteria and the subject of milk is gone into carefully. Wherever possible, near at hand, practical illustrations are given for any particular lesson.  For instance, the heating system of the school, ice on the roads or a rapid thaw, a bad season for apples, will all serve to bind together theory and reality. There you'll see, on a window ledge of a lecture room, a special breeding <Col N="440" /> cage where moths and caterpillars pass through the various stages of their growth, and I believe there is quite a bit of rivalry as to who shall look after them.  There are the tin plates where seeds are germinating in a warm place near the stove, and cases where all sorts of insects from the cabbage moth&mdash;is it an insect by this time?  I never know&mdash;to the turnip fly, can be seen pinned out with an obituary notice describing their life and habits.  Another interesting collection is made up of examples of the work of plant diseases, all safely bottled, which also come in useful for the talks on the general principles underlying farming which are given in the evenings for grown-ups.</P>
    <P>In the garden, as a result of the keenness of teacher and pupils, you'll see samples of all the different kinds of grasses growing in those parts, and others, too.  These are of interest to the parents and other farmers who visit the school.  Some of them have been using various seed mixtures for years and may not know what the actual grasses look like.</P>
    <P>I also saw some trees grown from seed, which later some of the children will take away to plant out at home; they might also be taking hedge clippings, flowers and so on but, of course, the garden is really to provide specimens and to enable practical work to be done.  There are also trees, vegetables and various kinds of herbs there.</P>
    <P>Well, there was still another section to be seen indoors.  We found ourselves in the room where boys were copying a diagram on the board which showed the construction of a silo, a simple one on a hill site that any of them might use at home.  As the instructor told me, &lsquo;There's nothing like being able to read a map or a drawing, it's a kind of international language, you know.&rsquo; Here we start the boys off by learning all about the planning and construction of a house, the general points, roofs and gutters, and drainage and so on.  This takes us on to <Col N="441" /> thinking about farms and how they can best be laid out, what improvements can be made to outhouses and that kind of thing.  Often the boys take the ideas home and discuss them with their parents when they're thinking of making alterations.  All sorts of questions are put forward.</P>
    <P>We study water supply, sewage, ventilation, electricity supply, the use of concrete.  For instance, not long ago one lad asked me what they could do about getting rid of rats, and we went into the question of making &lsquo;baffles&rsquo;, as they are called, pillars to prevent them climbing up into the hay or corn stacks.  Of course, they do a good deal of practical carpentry besides this theory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think I need go any further. That is from a talk by an independent observer on what was being done in a rural school in one of the best agricultural areas in this State.  In collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, we intend to emphasise still more strongly the value and importance of the type of instruction, particularly in rural science, that is being given in the vocational schools, and their importance to the farming community.  I have not the slightest doubt that, in spite of the difficulties, the children from farmers' houses will respond and, as in the past, will make up the bulk of the attendance.</P>
    <P>I have stated in my opening remarks that the provisions in this measure are regards the officers are precisely the same, almost word for word, as in the Local Government Act, 1941.  Before the 1930 Act became law, the position was that officers of vocational, or, as they were then called, technical education committees, had really no status or rights independently.  Whatever rights they had were as officers of local authorities.  I cannot see the force, therefore, of the criticism that the contract of service is being altered.  If we have regard to the history of these committees, we must know that the officers concerned were all officers of local authorities and that the law generally, as regards the conditions of service, applicable to officers of local authorities, applied to them.</P>
    <P>The position under Section 44 (1) of <Col N="442" /> the 1925 Act was that an officer, in order to secure superannuation, had to have 25 years' service and to have reached the age of at least 65 years. The position now under the Bill is that at the age of retiral, whatever that may be, an officer will not necessarily have to have 25 years' service; he may have 15 years' service and he will still be entitled to a pension.  The superannuation scheme for officers of local authorities applies to officers of vocational education committees.  I think the superannuation scales are very reasonable.  As has been said, they are on the basis of the payment of a pension at the rate of one-sixtieth per year of service.  In the Civil Service, payment is at the rate of one-eightieth per year of service, a civil servant being entitled to a maximum pension of half his remuneration.  He is also entitled to a lump sum when he retires from the service, which is not the case with an officer of a vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>We cannot have one code of conditions of service, or of superannuation, for officers of vocational education committees, and another for officers of local authorities generally.  Is it the contention of those who say that the contract of service has been altered to the disadvantage of officers of vocational education committees that, if such officers had remained under the Minister for Local Government, their position would have been better than it now is?  If the 1941 Act, as was the original intention, had applied both to the officers of vocational education committees and to the officers of agricultural committees, this discussion would not have arisen at all, I presume, because what Deputies are objecting to is the law already in regard to the officers of local authorities throughout the country. Some portions of the Bill, such as this matter of the conditions of service of officers, might appropriately have been brought into the 1941 Act.  Other parts of it, unfortunately, did not fit in.  Therefore, it was necessary for the Minister for Agriculture and myself to introduce separate Bills dealing with the conditions of <Col N="443" /> service of officers under our respective jurisdictions.  In my case, at any rate, I have followed the 1941 Act.  As I have said, the position actually is that there is an improvement in the pension conditions in that respect: that whereas formerly officers had to have at least 25 years' service that is not now necessary.  It is suggested that we are in some way departing from some legal contract embodied in the Vocational Education Act of 1930.  Section 99 of that Act, sub-section (3) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every officer transferred by this section shall not, in the service of the vocational education committee to which he is so transferred, receive less remuneration or, subject to the provisions of this section, be subject to less beneficial conditions of service than the remuneration to which he was entitled and the conditions of service to which he was subject in the service from which he is so transferred.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My reading of that sub-section is that the most vocational education officers can claim is that the conditions of service they enjoy now should at least be as good as were those in the service from which they were transferred. I have explained to the House that the provisions regarding the conditions of service in this measure are exactly the same as those in the Local Government Act of 1941, which apply to local authorities' officers generally. Therefore, I fail to see how it can be suggested that the conditions of service have been worsened.  The conditions of service are to be the same as those for officers of local authorities generally, and the sub-section which I have read makes it perfectly clear, I think, that no more than the conditions of service and rates of remuneration which applied in the service in which they formerly served can be claimed by existing officers of local authorities. Section 9 of the Bill, which makes the measure applicable to existing officers, is precisely the same as Section 16 in the 1941 Act.</P>
    <P>I think that the argument against fixing a compulsory age for retiral has been rather abandoned when we have the admission that there <Col N="444" /> is no objection in principle to the fixing of such an age.  I need hardly say that, in fixing an age for retiral, the Minister will take into consideration all relevant circumstances, and will, I think, behave in a reasonable manner.  One would imagine from some of the speeches made that the Minister was in a position, even if he wished to do so, to act in an entirely arbitrary fashion in this matter.  We know that the Minister has to be guided by precedents and by circumstances, and that he has to answer for his actions to this House. We know also that, if he is a reasonable being, he will have regard to the operation of the vocational education schemes generally throughout the country, and will not try to enforce conditions that would militate against the success of those schemes, or that would be to the disadvantage of officers.  Certainly, he will not arbitrarily make regulations that would offend the officers, that would make them feel they were being penalised in some way, and were being treated differently from others.</P>
    <P>In the case of teachers generally, I think it is well recognised that when the age of 65 is reached one may not expect the same efficiency&mdash;I think that goes without saying&mdash;as in the case of younger teachers in the prime of life, full of enthusiasm, vigour and earnestness.  The only question that remains to be decided and one to which, of course, I shall give close consideration, is what the age of retiral should be.  Generally speaking, it has been the age of 65 in the case of other classes of teachers. Large numbers of highly qualified young men now coming out of the universities are seeking entrance into this service&mdash;and the fact that promotion is now possible in the local services generally and in the vocational education service, ought to lead Deputies to take more interest in the younger men who are striving for advancement and who have, I think I may say, higher qualifications than those who originally entered the service, rather than in the cases of isolated officers.  If it is suggested that it is a hardship upon officers, under the conditions <Col N="445" /> of superannuation that obtain at present, to go out on pension at the rate of one-sixtieth of salary per year of service after 37 or 38 years' service, I do not think that is unreasonable or that it imposes any serious disability on an officer.</P>
    <P>Those who remember the early days of technical education will know that, in the beginning, there were really no rates and no scales of pay.  Scales of pay have now been fixed, and executive officers and teachers are receiving reasonable remuneration.  In fact, I believe that the pension which an officer, such as I have referred to, will get will compare very favourably with the salary that he was drawing in the early days.  If the argument is going to be that he was drawing a salary not as good even as his pension is now, we cannot have it both ways, I am afraid. If we have improved his conditions and introduced new scales of salary, I do not think that we can step up superannuation which, I would like to say again, is favourable.  I do not think that we are entitled to do the second thing&mdash;step up the superannuation and amend the code specially in order to deal with these isolated cases. In any case, we cannot amend the superannuation code under this measure.  We can only amend that code, so far as years of service are concerned, by amending the main superannuation Acts.</P>
    <P>I think it is in the interest of the service and of education that an age for retiral should be fixed, and that committees should not be left in the present position, in which men who have advanced well beyond the age of 65 have the heavy responsibility placed upon their shoulders of undertaking the direction, control and urging forward of vocational education schemes in their areas.  In my opinion, these schemes require the assistance of men at a more active period of their lives, men who would be able to give the fullest possible energy to the work, and I think the success or failure of vocational education will, in the long run, depend to a great extent on the type of personnel operating it.  Teachers have difficult and arduous work, and I do not think <Col N="446" /> any reasonable person who is acquainted with their work will agree that it should be necessary for them to continue to work after the age of 65.  If the age of 65 is fixed&mdash;I do not suggest that it will be fixed for all classes of teachers; there may be some types of teacher in respect of whom it will be necessary to fix perhaps a lower age&mdash;all the circumstances will have to be taken into consideration, but nobody, on examining the question carefully, will believe that the age should be higher than 65.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked me whether it would not be possible to arrange, if a line had to be drawn, that the end of a session should be taken as the delimiting point.  I quite agree that it may be to the advantage of the service that teachers should not retire in the middle of a school term or school session, and perhaps it may be possible to arrange that retiral will take place not later than, say, 31st July, or whatever the date of the end of the school session may be.  I do not think it is true that leave of absence is not allowed for.  In the case of teachers who take up educational courses to improve their qualifications, I think it is allowed for, but if Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Anthony or any other Deputy has a particular case in mind, I should be glad if the particulars were communicated to me.  I think it possible that, in respect of these cases, at any rate, the Deputy has been misinformed, and that the position in fact is not that the teacher absented himself for the purpose of acquiring a higher qualification, that is to say, got leave of absence.  If a teacher leaves his employment, resigns his post and takes up a post somewhere else for a period in order to improve his qualifications, that is quite a different matter, but if he gets leave of absence from his committee, it certainly can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of added years, I have pointed to the fact that the superannuation and present scales of pay seem to be reasonable.  The Minister for Local Government, whom I follow in regard to these matters generally, has, as was pointed out during the debate, issued a circular in which he states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" />&ldquo;For positions requiring highly technical qualifications, it is realised that it may not be possible to secure the services of suitably experienced officers at ages sufficiently youthful to enable them to qualify eventually for the full two-thirds superannuation. In such cases, where the services have been satisfactorily carried out, reasonable additional years might be added to the actual number served for the purpose of calculating pensions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that what the Minister for Local Government had in mind was the type of case in which an officer entered the service at a mature age and had higher technical qualifications than those laid down in the conditions of appointment.  If an officer leaves an important engineering post outside and enters the service of a local authority or vocational education committee, it being clear that he had a much higher qualification than would have been necessary to satisfy the Minister for Local Government or me, and if his period of service was much shorter as a result, the Minister for Local Government has power to consider adding certain years to his service, but, as regards teachers in general, it cannot be claimed that that is the case.</P>
    <P>When a committee appoints a manual instructor, for example, he has to be qualified to suit the Department's conditions, and the Department will look for a certain amount of practical experience.  The same would be true of teachers of other practical subjects, but that does not mean, with regard to an ordinary tradesman or crafts teacher, that we will give added years because he has the qualification we consider necessary.  If he has a very high technical qualification and has spent portion of his life doing a specialised kind of work, altogether beyond what would be required ordinarily to become a teacher, when his superannuation case comes up, it can be examined, but this could not apply to teachers generally.</P>
    <P>As regards suspension, the provisions here are similar to those in the 1941 Act and are taken practically <Col N="448" /> entirely from the 1926 Act.  In fact, this particular section, Section 7, is practically a re-enactment of Section 11 of the 1926 Act.  It is being reenacted here because it is considered by my legal advisers to be a more appropriate place.  If an officer is suspended and is restored to duty, I do not think there can be any doubt that he will receive his remuneration, if the circumstances make it clear that the suspension was not warranted, but, of course, as Deputies will realise, the question of whether he will be paid for his period of suspension will depend on circumstances.  I do not think it would be possible to fix a time limit, because it may happen that the case of an officer who has been suspended may have to go before the courts.  Action by the Department or by a committee will probably not be taken until the court case has been finished, and it would be impossible, I think, to fix some period in the Bill. We could not be certain that the court case, if there were repeated adjournments, would be over well within, say, a few months.</P>
    <P>With regard to removal from office, a point made was that a local inquiry should be held.  A local inquiry still will be held and I think I can say that that would be the normal procedure where there was any doubt as to the circumstances of the case.  If the circumstances justify the holding of an inquiry and, if it is not clear to the Minister that the case is so bad that nothing less than removal from office will meet the situation, then the inquiry will be held.  But there may be circumstances where an inquiry is not really necessary.  If, as would be the case, we have to set up a public sworn inquiry, as was set out in the original Act, such inquiry might not even be to the advantage of the person involved. Deputy Cosgrave mentioned that it should be held in the case of suspension, but it might not be always to the advantage of the person involved.</P>
    <P>I want to say that the vast bulk of the officers employed by vocational education committees are, of course, teachers.  There may be, say, 1,000 teachers employed, and it is inevitable <Col N="449" /> that you will have odd cases of teachers who are not efficient.  In the case of a teacher who is not considered efficient by the inspector, or to be doing his work satisfactorily, the procedure will be that the inspector will warn him, will probably advise him as to improving his methods and, if he finds that the teacher is still not doing satisfactory work, he may report the teacher to the committee.  But the House can take it that there will be no action taken, such as suspension or dismissal of the teacher, merely because an individual inspector reports that he is dissatisfied with his work.  In all branches of education a senior inspector is called in and has to report independently on the case. That is what would happen.  Suppose the senior inspector is still dissatisfied with the work and feels that the teacher is so bad that he ought not to be retained and the committee fail to remove him, what is to be done then? Is the position that the House will demand that I should set up a sworn inquiry in order to deal with that case?</P>
    <P>We have also the case of chief executive officers.  There is only a limited number of them.  In their case also it might happen that circumstances, such as a report by the audit officer, will make it clear that action will have to be taken either by way of suspension or dismissal.  I think the House may take it that in cases of suspension or removal from office, vocational education committees will not be disposed always to take action themselves; they will prefer that the Minister should take it.</P>
    <P>As regards the County Roscommon Vocational Education Committee, I have only to say that the scales of salary recommended by my Department are permissive.  All the committees in the country have accepted these scales of salary, therefore there was no necessity to impose them on the committees.  The emergency bonus to be granted to officers is also permissive and, if the Roscommon committee have taken a different attitude from other committees, I am sure they feel they have a reason for their attitude.  In any case, I do not think that I should be asked in connection <Col N="450" /> with this measure to impose something upon the Roscommon committee with regard to the bonus that is not imposed by law on other committees or local authorities.  I think that most of the points raised were really Committee points that might be gone into more fully on the next stage.  I have tried to cover the main points that were raised.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 15, after the word &ldquo;locomotion&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and subsistence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My reasons for this amendment were given by me on the Second Stage and I have not much to add to what I said then.  Under the sub-section as it stands, no subsistence allowance could be granted to a member of a committee. Cork is a very big county and, in order to attend a meeting of the committee, some members have to leave their homes the day before.  In addition to that, I am anxious, and I am sure the Minister is also anxious, that the members of a committee of agriculture should be experienced agriculturists, and we do not want to have men travelling 40 miles to a meeting and 40 miles home after attending a meeting all day without even getting a meal.  Therefore I think it is reasonable that they should be allowed subsistence allowance and that is why I move the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the case made by Deputy Corry arises out of the emergency, because I take it that, in normal times and with normal travelling facilities, a member of any committee would be able to get to the county town and back on the same day, and there would <Col N="451" /> not, therefore, be the same point in looking for subsistence allowance. In regard to this point and other points raised in connection with this Bill, I am not prepared to put into the Bill anything that would be substantially different from the Local Government Act or the Vocational Education Bill.  In other words, the members of a county committee of agriculture will have to get the same treatment that county councillors and members of vocational education committees are getting.  I think that Deputy Corry's point would be met better if he were to put it to the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister for Local Government might consider the making of a regulation of some sort to cover the case of people who have to stay out at night owing to inadequate travelling facilities at the moment; but I would not consent to put it into a Bill and make it a permanent provision.</P>

      <P>The position is that when the Local Government Bill was introduced here we were not fully aware of the provisions of the Bill, and I admit that we did not make the provision that should be made.  If we have to wait for new legislation to be brought in, or something of that kind, we may have to wait for years.  We are going to have a committee of agriculture which some of our most valued members will not attend.  After all, there is very little use in having a committee of agriculture if it is not a good committee.  I think the Minister will also admit that.  I do not think I am looking for anything unreasonable.  I wonder could the Minister see his way to meet the amendment in regard to that point.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 15, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;incurred&rdquo; to the end of the sub-section and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) by each of its members in travelling to and from meetings of such committee held after the 30th day of June, 1943, and</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 5 go together. Amendment No. 2 was to cover an omission in the original Bill, that is, to provide for travelling expenses on the same scales for attendance at subcommittees of the committee of agriculture. There are such sub-committees at times and, unless this amendment were inserted, no travelling expenses could be allowed.  It is on the same lines, of course, as the expenses paid to members attending the full committee, the only difference <Col N="453" /> being that the sub-committee must be appointed by the committee of agriculture and be approved by the Minister for this particular purpose, in regard to expenses.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>I see no reason whatever for this sub-section. I have examined it carefully since the Second Reading and I find that civil servants are getting locomotion expenses.  I see no reason to expect anybody to travel five miles to a meeting or five miles back, entirely at his own expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I already mentioned, there are many provisions in this Bill that are already in the Local Government Act and that Act, of course, contains something like 40 to 50 sections which were very fully discussed in the Dáil.  The Minister for Education and I are introducing Bills to bring our legislation into line with Local Government legislation on this matter of expenses, retiring ages, and so on, of officials and members of county committees of agriculture.  This is another thing that I think it unwise to change or to make different from the provisions in the Local Government Act. If we were to delete this sub-section, the position would be that a man who is a member of the county council and also a member of the county committee of agriculture, who lives, say, four miles from the town, would be paid his expenses in attending the committee of agriculture, but would have to attend the county council without getting any expenses.  It is very hard to justify that.  My experience of the country is that persons living within six or seven miles of a town visit that town very frequently; they go to fairs and markets and have some means of locomotion that they are accustomed to using, either their own pony and trap or a bus passing the door, or a bicycle.  Whatever it may be, they get there very frequently, and without very much expense.  Even if they travel by bus, the amount is very small, probably <Col N="454" /> about 1/- there and back, if the distance is four miles.  I think it is unreasonable to move to have this sub-section deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in referring to the Local Government Act in this connection.  Two wrongs never made a right.  The fact that the House at that time, when they were fighting larger issues, did not realise the importance of these things, is no reason why we should allow them to remain for ever.  If they travel by bus, they have to pay for the bus; if they travel by bicycle, they wear tyres that they cannot replace; if they travel by pony and trap, they wear shoes that are very dear at present.  No matter what locomotion they use, it is at their own expense, and I think that is wrong on the face of it.  As I stated already, the officials are paid for distances under five miles.  I see no reason why the same thing should not apply to the members.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When this issue was raised Deputy Hughes referred to it.  I am going in one direction and he is going in an opposite direction.  I am making it clear that an exception can be made for an individual.  Deputy Hughes wants to copper-fasten the section so that exception can only be made where it is of general application.  In my opening statement on Second Reading I went into this matter in some detail, and also at the conclusion I explained that we have two types of cases in mind.  Number one case is of general application, where there is no competition whatever between one applicant and another.  I could give no better example than the lime scheme, under which every farmer is supplied under ordinary conditions. There were places where lime was scarce, but generally speaking, every farmer got the quantity that he applied for.  Therefore, no favour was shown to any particular person.  If a member of a county committee applied for lime he did not deprive anybody else of it.  In a case like that, there is no point at all in depriving a member of a county committee of the benefit of the scheme.  An order would, therefore, be made granting exemption in the lime scheme.  On the other hand, where-ever there is competition amongst farmers, it is not my intention&mdash;and I am <Col N="459" /> sure it is not the intention of any other Minister&mdash;to make members eligible for benefit, as in the premium bull scheme, where very often there are four or five applicants in an area, only one of whom can get the bull.  In that case it would be unfair to the area if a member of the county committee should get it.  Even though he might be considered by the Department, by the committee and by the county council to be the best applicant, yet his opponents would believe that he had an unfair advantage on the committee. We have also had cases in the Department from time to time, where a member had a premium bull for a year, and expected to get three more premiums. That man paid a fair price for the animal.  He borrowed the money from the Department, expecting to be able to pay back the loan by getting further premiums.  He was considered to be a very desirable person to be a member of the county committee of agriculture and was asked by the county council to go on that committee.  He is prepared to do so but cannot afford to lose the premiums.  That is a case where exception might be granted.  That would not be the general intention but would concern a particular exemption.</P>
    <P>Take a case where a wife or daughter had a poultry station, and where the husband or father is asked to go on the county committee of agriculture. It may be in the middle of the hatching season or in the production season for eggs, and the person concerned may not be willing to lose any benefit that might accrue to the station for that particular year.  If the amendment were to be accepted, it would be a question whether, in a case like that, we should say: &ldquo;Well, the Minister is prepared to grant exemptions for this year, or for this year and next year.&rdquo; I do not think any Minister would say that exemption would apply for all time, and neither would he say that when the term came to an end that particular member should get another bull.  It would only apply to the animal that he already had, or, in the case of a poultry station, to the season. These are the cases I have in mind. <Col N="460" /> That is the idea behind these amendments.</P>
    <P>The first part of the amendment, to delete the words &ldquo;to the public&rdquo;, is put in because it is not altogether correct to say that every scheme applies to the public.  There are certain schemes administered by county committees of agriculture in which they confine benefit to people making their living by agriculture.  For instance, demonstration plots is one case in which committees make it a condition that they will be given only to agricultural labourers or to farmers who make a living by agriculture.  That is not the public.  That is a class.  If you like, this is a drafting amendment. The second part (b) moving to delete the words &ldquo;members of committees of agriculture&rdquo; and to substitute the word &ldquo;his&rdquo; might be held to mean, as the section stands, that if I were to make exemption, a man elected to the county committee of agriculture would continue to get a premium for a bull.  I am not sure, but it might be held in the courts that every holder of a premium was entitled to be a member of a county committee of agriculture, or that every member of such a committee was entitled to have a premium bull.  The wording is to make sure that if an exception is made it will have a restricted application.</P>

      <P>I think that even under the present law they could qualify for scholarships, and if this amendment were passed it would be perfectly clear that they could.  There is just one point that I should like to mention. Deputies will notice a reference in the section to a member &ldquo;or his partner&rdquo;. &ldquo;Partner&rdquo; includes his wife or dependent relative.  If his daughter had a poultry station, in that case she would come under the definition of &ldquo;partner&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be of advantage to the House if they were taken together.  My amendment reads:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3) (a), line 28, before the word &ldquo;if&rdquo; to insert the following words: &ldquo;the application of which is of general benefit and not particular to individuals&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister up to a point, as I stated on the Second Reading. There may be hardships involved for members of a committee in regard to schemes which are of general benefit or of general application.  We would, I think, be quite safe in granting a member the right to benefit by schemes whose application is general and where no question of favouritism is involved but we should guard against any danger that a suspicion of corruption might arise in the public mind.  I think that, even at the risk of keeping a good member from coming on the committee, we should guard against any suspicion of that kind.  If we are concerned about clean administration in the country, I think we should maintain the present safeguards even if it means keeping a man who has a premium for a bull off the committee. There is always the danger of the public being suspicious about exemptions of this sort.  I do not think the Minister has made a case for the amendment because there is no question of real hardship involved.  It is quite a different matter where you have a committee in existence and where a member is allowed to participate in schemes such as the lime scheme, which is of universal application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where, however, there is a scheme <Col N="462" /> which has a particular application, even where a member is coming on the committee for the time being and may be debarred because he happens to hold a premium for a bull, we should remember that in all probability he will be an applicant for the renewal of that premium for the purchase of a new animal.  I do not see that any great purpose will be served by exempting him for a year or so.  The same remarks would apply in the case of a person who has a poultry station. Where there is a poultry station in existence, it is likely to be continued in existence for a much longer period than a year or two, which is the period the Minister mentioned.  That is not a type of exemption that is going to serve any useful purpose in the long run.  There is always the risk that the public will become suspicious about such schemes and in our legislation we ought to place all public schemes above suspicion of any kind. There may, as I say, be certain hardships involved but I think we shall have to endure these in order to ensure clean local administration.  You will get plenty of men who are prepared to forgo any benefits in order to serve on county committees.  In order to preserve clean administration, in my opinion we should not make any exceptions and I am opposed to the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>The one thing that we should try to preserve is the confidence of the public in local administration. I think that we would place an extraordinarily high value on the services of any individual if, in order to secure preferential treatment for him, we were to jeopardise public confidence in local administration.  I think there is only one scheme in which members of these committees should be allowed to participate, and that is the lime scheme, as there is plenty of that commodity for everybody.  In regard to all other schemes, I would not agree to any exception being made in the existing procedure.  No matter how right things may be, they must always appear to be right in the public mind, and I would suggest, in order to safeguard against any misunderstanding as to the integrity of these committees in the administration of <Col N="463" /> public affairs, that no exemptions of the kind suggested should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are undoubtedly exceptional cases where the provisions suggested by the Minister should be allowed to operate.  For instance, a county council may find itself in the position that a member of the county committee of agriculture may resign or die and it may find great difficulty in getting any of the remaining members of the council to accept nomination for the committee. I have known an instance in recent years where the county council experienced a great difficulty of that kind.  There might be one man on the county council who happened to hold a premium for a bull at that particular moment and he would perhaps be the only member available or prepared to accept nomination on the committee of agriculture.  The amendment suggested by the Minister would get over that. That difficulty could arise and has arisen in the past.</P>

      <P>I must agree with Deputy Hughes in this matter.  I have been for a great many years a member of a county committee of agriculture. I have earned prizes under various schemes but I was never eligible for any one of these prizes and I was very glad <Col N="464" /> of that because, as Deputy Broderick said, if I were given one of these prizes it would definitely reduce public confidence in the administration of these schemes.</P>

      <P>I think the aspect of the problem which I have mentioned is too valuable to overlook, merely to facilitate a few exceptional cases.

We have heard enough about corruption without opening the door for any further criticism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment of Deputy Hughes.  I think the Minister would do well to consider even putting in a provision to the effect that a member could resign from a county committee of agriculture and be reappointed in the following year if he ceased to hold a premium for a bull.  That is a particular example.  If a person had a premium for a bull year after year and if there were a number of applicants, if it is known that he got it while he was a member of the county committee for agriculture, no matter how you may excuse it, the general public opinion will be that that particular person, because he was a member of the committee, was able to influence either the Department or the inspector in securing the premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I infer from Deputy Cosgrave's speech that he believes we had the intention to give the benefit of premiums in respect of bulls to members of the committees.  There was no such intention.  There was the intention to allow a person who joined a committee and who might be in receipt of such a benefit to continue to receive that benefit until its expiration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were two or three years to run, we would allow him to finish out the premium, but we would not allow him to get another bull.  A person may pay £100 or £120 for a bull.  He may borrow three-fourths of that and depend on his premium to pay back the loan.  He cannot afford, perhaps, to be left out of his money.  Therefore, we have to let him finish up his premium.  The alternative is not to allow him to join the committee. I do not want to press this amendment too hard if members are afraid that it would shake public confidence. I do not think that it is so serious as all that, but I do not want to have the appearance of forcing the amendment if the Dáil does not want it.  I make an exception in regard to paragraph (a), which relates to a different point.  Some schemes of county committees are not open to the public; they are only open to certain persons.  If you leave out the words &ldquo;to the public&rdquo;, it will not alter the section so far as this point about benefits is concerned.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, with the section as it is, there is no necessity for Deputy Hughes' amendment because Deputies will find that towards the end of sub-section (3) (a) there are the words&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...if the consent of the Minister to members of committees of agriculture receiving such benefits or advantages has been given.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That means, according to the legal advice I have received, that it is of general application because it must be applied to members of committees of agriculture and cannot be made to apply to an individual.  Therefore, the position would be, if both amendments were left out, with the exception of that referring to the words &ldquo;to the public,&rdquo; that the Minister could exempt certain schemes of general application but could do nothing more.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are opposed to the whole section. I have merely put down those amendments to reduce the objectionable and arbitrary powers which the Minister seeks.  It may be that, in a different set of circumstances some years ago, subversive organisations opposed to majority government influenced certain local authorities to oppose the Central Government.  For that reason, drastic legislation was necessary in that period.  The time has arrived when all our people recognise majority government and when the Constitution is generally recognised.  Therefore, we feel that drastic legislation of this sort is undesirable, and that we should completely change our outlook in that respect.  On the whole, committees have performed their duties efficiently and properly.  There is no example of <Col N="468" /> impropriety in discharge of its duties by a committee.  Therefore, I propose to substitute &ldquo;statutory order or statutory regulation&rdquo; for the words in the Bill, &ldquo;lawful order, direction or regulation of the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>You may find a situation where the Minister may give a direction on a matter that is at issue between himself and a local authority on the question of, say, good farming methods.  He may hold one view and the committee may hold quite a different one.  In that case, if it is not a statutory duty of the committee, I feel that the Minister should not be empowered to compel a committee against their proper judgment to obey a direction given to them&mdash;that is, if it is not a statutory duty as far as the committee is concerned. That is the reason I have asked in this amendment to delete that power.  The amendment is put down to reduce the objectionable powers which the Minister is seeking. We object to the section as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a lot of difference, as far as I can find out, between the words in the Bill and the words proposed by Deputy Hughes&mdash;&ldquo;lawful order, direction, or regulation of the Minister&rdquo; and &ldquo;statutory order or statutory regulation&rdquo;.  If a Minister had some dispute with the committee about the best form of agriculture&mdash;which hardly could arise &mdash;and the Minister were foolish or mad enough to dissolve the committee on that account, he would be standing on very poor ground.  As regards the difference between lawful and statutory, in some of the laws passed it is laid down that a committee must do so and so, but it is not laid down what is to happen if they do not do so.  In such a particular case, if it were a serious matter, the Minister could make a lawful order but not a statutory order, as there is no statutory way open to him.  For instance, under Section 33 of the Act of 1931, the county committees are asked to draw up a scheme for the year, which is a statutory duty, and submit it to the Minister; but the clause does not say what will happen if they do not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the Dáil, when <Col N="469" /> passing that Bill, intended that the Minister should enforce it, but they did not tell him how.  If the Minister told such a committee that, if they did not draw up the scheme he would put someone in their place, that would be a lawful order, but not a statutory order.  As far as covering the case Deputy Hughes has in mind, of a Minister dissolving the committee for some disagreement on policy, I think the one word is as good as the other.  The Minister would be on very shaky ground in dissolving a committee for a matter of that kind, but he would at least be on the same shaky ground if the amendment were adopted.</P>

The law has laid down what should be done in a certain case, but has omitted for some reason to state what will be done if it is not carried out: in pursuing that, the Minister may say that the committee has not carried out the statute and that he will get rid of them and appoint someone else.  That would be a lawful order, but not a statutory one.</P>

    <P>The Minister has not made a case for <Col N="471" /> this at all.

As regards this particular section, the position was contemplated that there might be prolonged, expensive proceedings, possibly involving a mandamus, if a committee failed to obey the order of the court.

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 4, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;committee&rdquo; in line 4 to the end of the sub-section and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;and order a new appointment to be made by the council of such county of members of such committees&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under Section 5 the Minister, after dissolving a committee, may order a new appointment to be made, by the council, of members of such committee or transfer the property and the several powers and duties of such committee to any body or person or persons. I want the Minister to ask the county council to give him a new committee if the old committee is dissolved. I am opposed to giving the Minister any power to appoint a man on a salary basis to carry out the work of a county committee for a period of two years.  If a committee has not performed its duties, it must go, but in this case also the Minister has not given us any example where the duties of a committee have been carried out in such an improper manner as to render it desirable to get rid of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only answer the Minister can make is that he has to get certain powers to enable him, in the event of a committee behaving in an unruly <Col N="474" /> manner, to dissolve that committee.  If a new committee is necessary, there is no reason why he should not ask the county council to appoint one.  If there are not sufficient members on a county council to constitute a new committee, the Minister should empower the local authority to appoint persons outside its own members.  The Minister should not appoint an individual on a salary basis.  Surely in any county there is enough material among the farming community to appoint 16 members on a county committee.</P>
    <P>I am very definitely opposed to the application of a principle which really means further bureaucratic administration. That is really what the Minister is asking the House to agree to. He wants us to give him power to appoint a man for two years on a salary basis to perform the functions of a county committee.  There is, I suggest, ample material in any county from which to select a new committee. The section is undesirable from every point of view.  It is in order to reduce to a minimum the arbitrary powers sought by the Minister that I suggest, where a committee is dissolved, the Minister should ask the parent body to give him a new committee.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this amendment, which I consider very reasonable.  As Deputy Hughes said, this is carrying the policy of dissolution a bit too far.  The Minister is seeking power to dissolve county committees.  Let us take it that the parent body is functioning to the satisfaction of everyone.  It might be that the county council, that appoints the members of the committee of agriculture, might happen to appoint, once in the blue moon, some person or persons who might not act properly.  The Minister, under this section, gives himself power to dissolve that committee over the heads of the county council.  I suggest that power ought not to be given to the Minister.  If the Minister is not satisfied with the committee appointed by the county council, then the reasonable course would be to refer the appointment back to the county council <Col N="475" /> and point out that the committee was not functioning properly and the county council should be asked to appoint a new committee.  I daresay the county council would do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan says that the members of his Party will vote against the section.  That can be tested when the time comes.  Surely there is a good case for the Minister having some discretion in relation to the affairs of the council or the committee.</P>
      <P>If the position arises, a position which has not, as Deputy Hughes has pointed out, arisen so far, in which the members of a county committee are not satisfactory, we all know that about half the members of the county committee are members of the county council.  If any trouble were to arise which would induce the Minister to get rid of them, they are likely to have the county council on their side, and the county council would not be likely to appoint a more accommodating committee in their place.  Therefore, if the necessity ever arises under this section to get rid of a committee, I think that it is unlikely&mdash;it is possible all right&mdash;that any Minister would ask a county council to appoint another committee.  The power we are taking here is to appoint another person or persons to run the affairs of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this section, when the Minister for Local Government was bringing in the 1941 Act, it was agreed between the three Departments concerned&mdash;the Department of Local Government, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Education&mdash;that each of the three Ministers would bring legislation up to date in regard to the particular local authorities that he had to deal with.  This <Col N="476" /> section is somewhat similar to what is in the Local Government Act of 1941. There is a similar section in the Vocational Education Act.  I suggest to Deputy Hughes that if the section stands, it is not going to be of very much use if his amendment is carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy was following what I have been saying.  The Minister, say, has trouble with a county committee of agriculture. If the trouble is so serious as, in his opinion, to warrant the dissolution of the committee, the fact that half the members of the county committee are members of the county council will mean that the county council is likely to be on the side of the county committee.  It may not in all cases, but in the case that I take the Minister is not going to be very much better off by getting the county council to appoint another county committee.  Therefore, he may require to appoint another person or persons to run the affairs of the committee. I can understand Deputies being against the section in the interests of democracy, although on that very general question of democracy I would like to say that probably what has finished democracy in some countries is the giving of too much powers to them.  There is no way of preventing them running riot altogether. I do not know whether the Minister can stop them or not.  He may be able to stop them from doing wrong things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is an effort to take the sting out of the section.  Someone wrote a letter to the newspapers recently stating that there was criticism of this power <Col N="477" /> from this Party although we were responsible, it was said, for these abolition proposals and for the wiping out of county councils.  I think that on an earlier stage of the Bill I made it clear, even to persons of very weak intellect, and the persons with a very poor memory as well as persons not anxious to hear the truth, that the reason for the proposals, introduced in 1926 was that we were just after a rebellion. We had not perhaps finished with it.  We had 40 seats empty in this Dáil at that time.  The county councils at that time afforded an opportunity for political propaganda and political interference of one sort or another. Now, 20 years after the setting up of this State, and 15 years after the filling of every seat in this Dáil, with not a single person remaining outside, we are being asked to give this power. The giving of it is a very small thing. I would prefer to hear the Minister say that he did not think it likely, or possible, that he would have to exercise it.  Assuming that he has to ask for co-operation, is it likely that there will be co-operation, in a county if he has two or three civil servants carrying out the business of the county committee of agriculture there?  I have my doubts.  It may be that during the last ten or 12 years county committees of agriculture have annoyed the Government when the Government were engaged in the maddest escapade that any political Party ever engaged in&mdash; the economic war.  I dismiss that particular subject in a single sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it going to be held that, while that nonsense was going on, a member of a county committee of agriculture had not the right to voice his opinions? If so, the usual interpretation of what democracy means to most men's minds must have disappeared altogether&mdash; that is, if the real meaning of it is that members of local authorities throughout the country are not entitled to criticise Government.  I do not mind criticism of a Government. I never minded it myself when I was in office.  They were mostly duds who criticised the Government at that time, and many of them have since seen the error of their ways.  In this section we are being asked, in regard to the most important industry in the <Col N="478" /> country, to resurrect a power that has been falling into disuse, and that at a time when the policy ought to be to secure all the co-operation possible.</P>
    <P>In this case, assuming there is criticism, why should not the Minister for Agriculture go down and meet the county committee for agriculture and thrash out with them whatever matter is in dispute?  If necessary, let him bring down some agriculturists who agree with his policy.  Let them deal with it, and leave out the politicians altogether.  In that way perhaps a working arrangement might be arrived at with the county committee. If these county committees are to be of service to the State and to the counties in which they are operating, they must derive their usefulness from the fact that they are composed of men who are the very bone and sinew of the county, of men who are in touch with all the agricultural problems that affect its welfare.  They will be men who will be familiar with the circumstances prevailing in the county, and will be the best qualified to pronounce upon the agricultural policy that will be pursued there.  What are civil servants going to do if appointed to administer the affairs of the county committees?  Their position will be an anomalous one.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this matter, the House is in the weak position that it does not know whether this is the Minister's policy, or whether it is Government policy or whether the section is simply being put in in order that it may be on parallel lines with what is in the Local Government code.  During our term of office there was never any period in which we abolished a local authority when we were not fully aware of the drawbacks there were in that policy.  The policy was put into operation to meet a situation that existed at a certain time.  Have we such a situation now or anything approaching the dire opposition to Government policy that there was at that time?  Will not the Minister himself admit that there is no comparison whatever between the position to-day and what it was in 1932 as regards Government policy towards agriculture? If people on these committees down the country want to let off <Col N="479" /> steam, why should they not be allowed to do so?  Why should that be regarded as a reason for their abolition?</P>
    <P>Going through the section and examining all the provisions which lead to abolition of one of these committees, one is amazed to find how Draconian they are.  &ldquo;If a committee wilfully neglects to comply with any lawful order, direction or regulation of the Minister...&rdquo;&mdash;I can quite appreciate the Minister's difficulty in explaining to the House that he had had such cases.</P>

I think Deputy Hughes has to some extent agreed with these peculiar statutory rules and regulations&mdash;I am not sure what term to apply to them&mdash;which give the Minister power to do certain things, to dismiss a committee which, in his opinion, is not carrying out these lawful orders. The proposition made from the Opposition Benches is that the county council should appoint the new committee.  Is that not correct?</P>

      <P>There are roughly 16 members on a committee of agriculture, and in some of the counties, there are only 27 members on the county council, and, therefore, if the whole <Col N="480" /> committee of agriculture were to be composed of members of the county council&mdash;and it seldom is&mdash;there would not be many members to select from. I do not see how, at this or any other stage, you could do anything but allow the Minister to appoint the committee. The Minister for Agriculture controls the committee once it is set up; the Minister for Education, the vocational committee; and the Minister for Local Government, the county council.  I take it that the Minister for Local Government has the same control over the county council as that which the Minister is asking for here, and I take it that the Vocational Education Act has something the same enshrined in it.  It is just a question of what is the best form of control.  No matter how good a committee which is in existence is, it is necessary to have some form of control over it.  I wonder what form of control exactly would Deputy Hughes propose to have.  Is it proposed to take control completely out of the Minister's hands or to have a control which he cannot properly exercise!</P>

      <P>How short Deputy O'Reilly's memory is.  Does he remember his own salad days, when he was in here thundering about the iniquity of control, analogous to that proposed, in the case of the Minister for Local Government, in respect of county councils, when he and his colleagues were persuading county councils to stop functioning altogether?  In face of that threat, and only in face of that threat, did the Cumann na nGaedheal Government consider itself justified in asking Dáil Eireann to give it the right to suspend popularly-elected local government.  This House must ask itself this question: Is it in itself desirable that the Executive shall have the right to wipe out locally-elected committees or not?  I venture to say that every Deputy will agree with me that, in itself, that is not a desirable thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, however, the Minister comes in here and says: &ldquo;The maintenance of all precautions for public health, the protection of the destitute poor, the carrying on of the county hospitals and the maintenance of the department <Col N="481" /> of the medical officer of health depend on the local authority functioning and certain local authorities have announced that they will not function because they do not like the Government. In those circumstances, and in those circumstances only, we claim that, for the protection of the essential and vital interests of the people, the Executive has the right to ask Dáil Eireann to give it the power to suspend the defaulting local authority and carry on its essential services through a commissioner or person who will take the place of a local authority&rdquo;, the matter can be examined; but it was only after the most protracted reflection that the Executive, 15 years ago, dared to come to Dáil Eireann and ask for such powers, when Fianna Fáil, as a deliberate policy, was trying to smash local administration in order to make it impossible for Deputy Cosgrave to carry on the Government.</P>
    <P>When, in that situation, Deputy Cosgrave came to the House seeking these essential powers, he was met by a tornado of abuse from the Fianna Fáil Party, on the ground that he was anti-democratic, and wanted to establish a dictatorship in this country.  He faced that tornado of abuse and explained his difficulty&mdash;that the only alternative which lay before him was to get these powers or to allow the social services in rural Ireland to break down, to allow the hospitals to be closed, outdoor relief to be suspended and all the other services founded on the county councils and boards of health to be disbanded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a very short memory if he does not remember when that happened&mdash;when it first became necessary to introduce a system of installing commissioners in the place of county councils and boards of health which would not do their work. The reason the Cumann na nGaedheal Government did so was that Fianna Fáil wanted to make it impossible for Deputy Cosgrave to function as head <Col N="482" /> of the legitimate Government.  He foiled that object, but he foiled it by desperate measures.  It was an extreme step and he knew it was an extreme step.  I have no doubt that he came to the House, looking for these Draconian powers, after considerable heart searchings.  They had to be used and they were successfully used, and local government was carried on in spite of Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil came in, and their first announcement was that they were going to abolish this whole system as a detestable intrusion on the rights of the people. They were not very long in office when they proceeded to use these powers, right, left and centre, and now they are asking for similar powers in respect of county committees of agriculture.</P>
      <P>What danger does the Minister allege?  Has the Minister any single case in respect of which he can come to the House and say that essential services broke down because a county committee of agriculture would not do its work?  Has he a single case in mind in which that was threatened?  Has he a single justifying argument for the introduction of this proposal into the House except that Deputy Cosgrave sought similar powers in respect of county councils and boards of health during his administration, and that his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, enjoy such powers in regard to local authorities at present?  Surely the House must see the distinction between bodies which carry on essential functions, the suspension of which for one week might create chaos in their administrative areas, and a county committee of agriculture?  Surely Deputies must see that the only justification for seeking these powers in regard to local authorities was the appalling gravity of the possible consequences of local authorities not doing their work?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may say that, but I propose to fight every stage of this proposal, to seek to minimise it and to defeat it, if I can; but surely the Minister ought to intervene and make a case, ought to say that, if there is a clash, a head-on collision and a deadlock extending over a week, a fortnight, or three weeks between himself and a county committee of agriculture, he foresees that irreparable damage might be done and, therefore, he requires to be forearmed with powers of this character.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not any possible contingency that can arise now or hereafter which could create a situation in which it would be necessary for the Minister to act within 24 hours.  A situation could arise in regard to a county council or a board of health which would make it essential to put somebody in to carry on the essential services at 24 hours' notice, if the local authority refused to function. Supposing a county committee of agriculture refused to discharge its functions, has not the Minister ample time to come to the House and say: &ldquo;Here is a case where I must have power to deal with a specific evil&rdquo;?  But no such case can be made and no such contingency can arise.  The only justification the Minister's supporter, Deputy O'Reilly, makes for this is that analogous powers are contained in the Local Government Act and in the Vocational Education Act.  Deputy O'Reilly does not attempt to suggest that there is any urgency about possible difficulties which might arise between a county committee of agriculture and the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to direct the attention of the House to is, that this is all part of a general scheme gradually to centralise all authority in Merrion Street, to deprive the local elected representatives of the people of any authority. Mind you, I was in favour of the County Management Act.  But some <Col N="484" /> Deputies forecast that if we assented to the principle in that measure it would be the first step on the slippery slope.  I am still in favour of that Act and this ought not to be a slippery slope.  There is no analogy between the principle underlying the County Management Act or the emergency legislation brought in by Deputy Cosgrave, when Prime Minister, and this proposal.  In both these cases an entirely different set of circumstances obtained and, in my judgment, the circumstances there obtaining justified the measures introduced then.  But here is quite a different story.  Here, the precedents there created, with special circumstances surrounding them, are used as a justification for analogous powers where no such circumstances obtain.</P>
    <P>The Minister replies that it is highly unlikely that these powers will be ever used.  I want to warn Deputies that I heard that pledge repeated in this House 40 times in the last ten years. There never was a proposal brought into this House designed to take away from the elected representatives of the people part of their powers that some Minister did not get up and say: &ldquo;Come, now.  What is all this fuss about?  It is highly unlikely that this will ever be used.&rdquo;  But, as certain as these powers were given to the Minister, and as Dáil Eireann was lulled into a sense of false security by that undertaking, within 12 months these powers were used, and when you point out that the Minister gave a solemn pledge that these powers would be rarely if ever used, you are met with hilarious laughter from the Fianna Fáil Benches.  It is quite conceivable that the powers given will not be used in the early future, but I want to warn Deputies that powers of this character &mdash;given here under an undertaking such as the Minister is giving to us at present&mdash;are rarely used until the feeling of apprehension engendered by the debate in this House has time to subside, and everybody is lulled into a sense of security because the powers are not used.  Then, by the time they are used, people have forgotten the source of the particular powers.  They have forgotten the undertakings given when they were passed, and, when <Col N="485" /> representations are made about the honouring of the Minister's undertaking not to use the powers except in the most extraordinary and exceptional circumstances, they are laughed at.</P>
    <P>I urge Deputies to view this proposal with the utmost possible suspicion, and to withhold these powers on the section. But, knowing the power of the Fianna Fáil majority, I ask them to vote for the amendment, because, if we carry the amendment, it will in some measure mitigate the evil of the Minister's proposal.  The proposal, even as amended by the amendment, is very bad, but it is not as bad as the original proposal.  We should carry the amendment as the first step in the campaign to delete the power, and then we should do our level best, when the section comes before the House, to delete the section from the Bill.  I venture to swear that, if we take that section out of the Bill, at no stage of the present Minister's period of administration will he ever experience the slightest real inconvenience as a result of his having to forgo the power.  I am certain that the Minister himself never put that section in the Bill.  I am perfectly certain that that section was put in in the Draftsman's office on the grounds that there is a similar power in the Local Government Act and in the Vocational Education Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has found himself suddenly confronted in the House with a strong volume of feeling with regard to a section that he himself does not give two tuppeny damns about.  He does not feel that he wants it.  He has no experience which suggests that he will ever have to use it.  In that position, I commend to him the attitude of the present Minister for Finance.  That Minister is not afraid, if he finds something in a Bill which people strongly react against and to which he does not attach very much importance, to meet the House halfway. These powers are utterly unnecessary. If, on some future occasion, the the Minister can satisfy the House that, for some ulterior motive, a county committee of agriculture is trying to thwart the Minister, trying to use its position to prevent him from doing that which he has a legitimate right to do, I will vote for giving him <i>ad hoc</i><Col N="486" /> powers to suspend the committee. That is different from giving general powers to suspend any committee which happens to have a collision with him.  I have no desire to enable any body in this country to prevent the legitimate Government ruling the country in accordance with the law.  I may not agree with the laws they make but, being the Government of the people, they have the right to rule. If any other body seeks to thwart them, albeit I agree with the policy of the other body, I will support the elected Government in carrying out the mandate the people's majority gave them.  It is not in any desire to set up the local body as a rival authority to the Minister that I am against this section.  It is in order to prevent the bureaucracy denying to elected representatives their legitimate rights. I am for these legitimate rights and I am against the bureaucracy's attempt to destroy them.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, in his own interest and in the interest of decent democratic principles in this country, to get up at this stage and say: &ldquo;I do not think this section is really necessary. I have never known of an occasion on which I would have to use it. If everybody feels so strongly about it, let it go.  &ldquo;If a situation arises when these powers become necessary.  I will come back and tell the House the situation in which I find myself embarrassed.&rdquo; If he does that, I can assure the Minister that he will find on all sides of the House, even amongst his own implacable opponents, a willingness to give the powers necessary to carry out whatever he is legitimately entitled to do as a member of the elected Government of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, in my opinion, is very drastic and, in so far as its application removes the control of the elected representatives of the people over the very important business they are appointed to transact, and which they know most about, I think it is too drastic.  I was very glad to hear the criticism so strongly offered from the Opposition Benches to the proposal.  However, in the course <Col N="487" /> of the discussion, a viewpoint occurred to me to which I feel I am in duty bound to give expression.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Hughes has quite a lot of reason behind it.  It is a reasoned proposal, in so far as it admits of the possibility which the Minister has in view, in the powers which he seeks to deal with such committees. Deputy Hughes' contention is that if the committee appointed fails to discharge its duty, then, the parent body that created it should have the right to have the matter referred back to them with a view to remedying the weakness of their committee.  That is true.  I think that should the council, the parent body, fail to discharge its duty or, having discharged its duty to the best of their ability, find that their new committee is not carrying out the regulations of the Department and the regulations under which they serve, it might be possible for the Minister then to adopt the powers which he now seeks.</P>
      <P>It has been asked in the course of the debate here, why does this necessity now arise; has any occasion occurred in recent times that would justify the Minister in seeking additional powers of this sort?  I do not know whether there has or has not but I do see reasons why the Minister should seek to entrench himself and the Department more strongly as regards committees of agriculture than they have hitherto, for this reason, that the powers of committees of agriculture have gradually grown over the years and they have now reached a stage where they perform a very important function in the life of the agricultural community.  To the extent that their responsibilities have grown, the interests that they serve must be correspondingly protected.  Therefore, I can see a justification there for the Minister seeking to ensure that these interests are more efficiently served now, having regard to the increased responsibility of these committees, than was necessary hitherto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Deputy Dillon's point that as soon as the necessity arises for the abolition of a committee and the <Col N="488" /> substitution of civil servants or some other official, this House should be prepared to give that power, I wish to say that the moment you admit that that contingency might arise, the necessity for the provision which the Minister is now seeking is admitted. What is the difference between making provision in advance for a contingency that might arise in the future, as it has arisen in the past under local government administration, and waiting until the contingency has arisen?</P>
    <P>I consider the proposal good in so far as it provides for a contingency which we know has occurred in the past in similar bodies but I do submit to the Minister that he should meet the case somewhere in between. The amendment proposed by Deputy Hughes to refer the matter back to the parent body, the county council, for rectification, before he applies the drastic measure which he seeks is, in my opinion, the solution and, to that extent, I favour the amendment, if the amendment could be amended now to meet the position that Deputy Hughes will admit.  I agree that the powers sought may be necessary but should only be put into effect if, having referred the matter back to the county council, they in turn fail to supply a committee to discharge the duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular sub-section gives power to the Minister, where a committee is dissolved, either to ask the county council to appoint a new committee or to pass over the county council and nominate a person or persons to carry on the work of the committee.  The next sub-section then gives power to fix the remuneration of such person or persons.  Deputy Hughes' amendment seeks to limit the Minister, that is, that where a committee is abolished, the Minister shall ask the county council to nominate another committee.  The main opposition, I would say, to this particular sub-section is the suggestion at the end of the sub-section that it will be utilised in order to nominate paid officials to do the work that at the moment is being done by the agricultural committee.  The Minister, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, may say: <Col N="489" />&ldquo;Oh, a Minister is not likely to do that.&rdquo;  In this House, the Minister is the individual who is in charge of a Bill.  Once the Bill becomes an Act &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; is 200 civil servants working in a Department.  We all know that there are many things done every week in the name of a Minister and that the Minister himself is not aware of 1 per cent. of the things done in his name.  There is a very marked tendency, in recent years, for Departmental officials to get more and more powers through legislation of this House on the plea that it is unlikely that those powers will ever be used and, the month after those powers are given in the name of the Minister, legislation is examined by hundreds of individuals.  To find out what?  To find out to the <i>n</i>th degree what powers there are in Departments in Dublin to interfere with local officials and local bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I am slow to make that statement, but I make it with conviction. As I say, the offensive portion of this sub-section is where it is left to the discretion of the Minister, or, in other words, to the discretion of his Department, to require a county council to appoint a new committee of agriculture, or to nominate a person or persons to carry on that work.  I would suggest that the Minister might consider the advisability of altering the sub-section to this extent: that where such a committee is abolished, the Minister should call on the county council to appoint a new committee, and that, if the county council refuses to do so, then he would exercise the powers that are claimed here, but that at least the county council should be consulted beforehand.  If the Minister's arguments, to the effect that portion of the powers of these county committees are closely associated with the powers of the county council, are sincerely advanced, then I think that he cannot expect to have co-operation from the county councils unless he is prepared to consult them before taking action in this matter.  I suggest that the Minister might see the advantage of consulting the county councils beforehand on this matter and that, by doing so, he would be able to meet the reasonable fears of the House in <Col N="490" /> regard to this particular sub-section. Now, in regard to the appointment of people who are paid to do work, as against those who have been doing the work voluntarily, I can quite see, in the case of more Departments than one, that if any legal opportunity is given to wipe out any voluntary committee or body connected with a county council, and to appoint fulltime paid officials to do the work, it will not take very much provocation to have a great number of agricultural committees abolished under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much afraid that we have spent too much time in discussing the proposed amendment to this section instead of discussing the section itself.  One reason why we are opposing the Minister in connection with the giving of these powers is that these county committees of agriculture, generally, are made up of farmers who voluntarily elect to serve on them.  They are not people who are elected by the ordinary voting system: as a matter of fact, the county council, generally, co-opts members of these committees.  In my opinion, the average county committee of agriculture is the one type of committee in this country that is not made up of political wrigglers.  Therefore, I think that it is the one type of committee about which the Minister need not worry.  I do not think that the Minister, during his period of office, ever had to dissolve a county committee of agriculture.  Neither do I think that Deputy Cosgrave, during his period of office&mdash;and we have been told how he had to go through so much fire in this country in the matter of the abolition of local bodies&mdash;had to abolish any of these county committees of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the real reason for that is that these committees of agriculture are not made up of people who are elected because of their political opinions: that they are taken on by the county council as being really representative of the agricultural community. They are co-opted by the county councils because of their out standing ability in their profession. <Col N="491" /> That is the chief reason why we oppose this section because we do not believe that there is any reason for the Minister being given this power.</P>
    <P>In listening to this debate, I must say that we were brought back to a period of 20 or 23 years ago, when, as we have been told, law and order were smashed as a result of the activities of various people in this country, and, as a result, certain county councils had to be abolished.  I do not think, however, that there is any advantage in discussing these matters now, and I do not believe that it is in the best interests of our country to discuss them now.  If certain county councils had to be abolished, whether under Fine Gael or the Fianna Fáil régimes, worse things were also done, and I do not think it is of any benefit for us to go back and discuss these things now.  However, I would ask the Minister to withdraw this section, because the people concerned here are not selected for any political purpose; they are brought in to serve on these committees merely on account of their professional abilities. I think the Minister himself is aware of that, and that is the only reason that we are opposing his section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting the amendment, but in doing so I submit that my reason for supporting the amendment is that this section is not diplomatic so far as the Minister is concerned.  For the past three or four years, every member of the Government, at some stage or another, has been received by various committees of agriculture, down through the country, in connection with the matter of production of food for the community as a whole, and I have yet to learn of a single case of a county committee of agriculture being found at fault or not willing to do its duty in that regard. On the contrary, as far as I am aware, every county committee of agriculture set out to do its best to meet the demands made by various Ministers in the interests of the country as a whole. Accordingly, I think that at a time like this, when agriculturists have been doing their best to meet the requirements <Col N="492" /> of the country, it is a very poor return for the efforts of these people for the Government of the day to include a sub-section such as this in the Bill, whilst expecting these people, at the same time, to continue doing their best.  I think that the inclusion of this sub-section is a reflection on the county committees of agriculture.  For these reasons, and for what one might call diplomatic reasons, such as getting the best that one can out of the work of these committees, I think the Minister should withdraw this sub-section or, if not, that he should accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>I have attended a great many meetings of these committees of agriculture, at which the Minister or higher civil servants of his Department were present, and I can say that at every meeting at which I was present the highest tributes were paid to the members of these committees.  Now, the Minister comes in here and says that, although these committees have been doing very well, he thinks he should be put in the position to exercise powers of abolition in regard to them.  I think that that is bad business, if only from the diplomatic point of view, and if for no other reason, I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have already tried to explain my attitude with regard to this amendment, but, perhaps, for the benefit of Deputies who have arrived in the House since I spoke last, it might be well to point out again that if this amendment were to be passed it would take away any good that may be in the section.  Now, I do not know why it should be assumed that civil servants, inevitably, will be appointed in these cases.  They may or may not be appointed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but if this section goes through, the Minister will have <Col N="493" /> to have discretion to appoint a new committee, which would probably consist of local farmers or, if that is not possible, to appoint an official, on a salaried basis, to undertake the work. There is no use in any Deputy getting up here and saying that any of these committees will be abolished because they do not agree with the views of the present Government.  That has never been done by this Government; it was not done by the previous Government, and I do not think it is likely to be done by any future Government. I was asked why this power was necessary, if no fault was to be found with the administration of these committees. I do not know if there is any local government authority with which there is any fault to be found, but it is a fact that when the Local Government Act of 1941 was being drawn up, it was agreed between the three Ministers concerned&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the Minister for Education&mdash;that we should in future stick to our own particular code of legislation instead of having the whole matter under the Local Government code of administration, as had been the practice up to that time.  Therefore, we started off by re-enacting the code, with a view to having the Minister for Education dealing with the matter of vocational education, and the other Ministers dealing with their particular branches.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the dissolution of local bodies, where they were found to be unsatisfactory, it was felt that this would be a quicker method of dissolving them than had been the case originally&mdash;at least, so far as the county committees of agriculture were concerned&mdash;because in order to dissolve the county committees of agriculture, as things stand at the moment, you would first have to dissolve the county council.  These powers may never be used.</P>

      <P>Let the Deputy read his own speech and the speeches made in this House against it.  I agree with Deputies when they say that naturally a Minister cannot attend to everything that goes on in his Department.  He cannot personally see what every civil servant is doing, because there may be 600 or 700 civil servants in a Department. Many letters go out in the name of the Minister which he does not see, but, at least, in a well-run Department these letters are in line with the policy laid down by the Minister. There may be civil servants who want to take powers from local authorities. I do not know of any.  Every Deputy knows that in a big matter, like that of a county committee of agriculture being abolished, the Minister would have a say, and would also have a say as to who was going to take the place of that county committee of agriculture; whether the appointment should be made by the county council, whether <Col N="496" /> local people should be called in or whether people should be sent from headquarters.  That would be a matter of importance.  I do not think Deputy MacEoin meant to create any friction between county committees and the Department of Agriculture.  It would be a great pity if this particular section were to create any friction of that sort, or drag this question of the abolition of county committees of agriculture across the food campaign we are carrying on.  I suppose we will have to discuss the section afterwards but, as long as the section remains, that particular sub-section will have to remain.  If the necessity arises for a Minister to abolish a county committee of agriculture the circumstances will be such that he will need to have a great deal of discretion in the appointment of a committee to take the place of the one abolished.</P>

    <P>Amendment accordingly lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (3) and substitute therefor the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) Where travelling expenses are incurred by persons appointed under the foregoing sub-section, Section 2 of this Act shall apply.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear again that we intend to oppose this section and to oppose anything that tends to extend bureaucratic control in this country. This amendment is designed to reduce the objectionable and arbitrary powers for which the Minister is asking.  In the event of the House agreeing to give the Minister power to dissolve a body, I want the House to ensure that the Minister is not in a position to appoint a civil servant to carry out the duties of a county committee for a period of two years.  For that reason I have put down this amendment.  In sub-section (3) of this section, the Minister makes provision for the payment of remuneration.  This amendment, if the Minister agrees to it, would make provision only for the payment of travelling expenses that may be incurred by a voluntary committee.  I think it is a reasonable amendment and that the Minister should be prepared to meet us on it.  If a committee has to be dissolved and a new committee set up, surely there should be sufficient material among the farming community in that county to get a committee of 16 farmers who would be prepared to carry on on a voluntary basis.  If they do that they are entitled to get the travelling allowances provided for in Section 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unlikely that he will accept that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not that effect, in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting the amendment on the assumption that it has that effect and, as far as I can see, it would have that effect.  It is not likely that any official would be prepared to perform the work of a county committee of agriculture without remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he might be prepared to consider the appointment of farmers to carry out this work but that, on the other hand, he might be prepared to appoint an official to do the work.  I think that the Minister should not be provided with that alternative.  The work of a committee of agriculture is mainly that of people with a practical knowledge of agriculture who, by reason of that knowledge, can give to the permanent officials of the Department an <Col N="499" /> insight into work on the land: It would be absolutely absurd to appoint an official to carry out the work of a committee of agriculture.  Whatever chance an official might have of carrying out the work of a county council or a board of health, he would not be competent to carry out the work of a committee of agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes' amendment does not carry out the idea he has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is merely a gesture. I do not see the point of rubbing the Minister's nose in this business.  Whatever satisfaction we may get out of that operation, we are not likely to get much reform.  I am as certain as that I am standing in this House that the Minister does not believe in this section.  If he would make any concession designed to distinguish what he, as Minister for Agriculture, thinks is the appropriate means of dealing with a recalcitrant county committee of agriculture from what his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, or his colleague, the Minister for Education, conceive to be the appropriate means of dealing with recalcitrant bodies in their respective spheres, I am perfectly sure the House would give it a hearty welcome.  Surely the Minister, in making the case for himself on the last amendment, suggested he was simply following in the footsteps of two other Ministers in pursuance of an undertaking given when the Local Government Act was introduced. That seemed to me to be the lamest of excuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention this matter on the amendment, because if the Minister would indicate his readiness to go any distance to meet the House on this section, the House would not be unreasonable. It is for that reason that I deprecate this amendment by Deputy Hughes.  It seems to me to be rather a nose-rubbing amendment, not designed to achieve anything but rather to put the Minister on the defensive. I want to get the substance of Deputy Hughes' other amendments <Col N="500" /> accepted and a real concession given. If necessary a distinction should be made between county committees of agriculture and the other bodies to which the Minister has referred. Instead of standing pat and meeting one amendment after another with a <i>non possumus</i>, I suggest that the Minister should come forward with some <i>via media</i> by which the House could reach agreement.  It is manifest from the last division that the House is very uneasy in its mind on this matter and what is the use of stirring up a storm when it is quite possible to reach reasonable agreement?</P>

      <P>You will have to pay them yourself.  The particular sub-section which Deputy Hughes seeks to delete is one which provides that payment be raised from the agricultural rate of the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so but it does not serve the purpose Deputy Hughes had in mind, which was to prevent them from being paid at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies are against the section, that is all right.  But if the section is to stand, it is obvious that it must have all the provisions contained in it because, if a Minister has to dissolve a committee, it will create a serious position.  There will be a good deal of opposition from members of the committee and, as half the members are members of the <Col N="501" /> county council, it is more than likely that there will be opposition by the county council.  If the Minister has to operate this section, he cannot depend on the county council to appoint another committee.  If the occasion arose, I should be inclined to look for local farmers to man the committee. There may be circumstances where that would not be advisable and where it would be necessary to put in some one person as a sort of commissioner. If such a necessity arose, that person would have to be remunerated.  It follows that he should be remunerated out of funds available to the county committee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it down because I am opposed to the appointment of any civil servant to a position of that sort.  I overlooked the provision contained in sub-section (2).  As has been pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition, even as my amendment stands, the person appointed could not be paid out of local funds.  The Minister would have to make provision for payment out of his own Vote.  We are trying to meet the Minister but he, evidently, is not prepared to meet us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider a compromise which would not be at all satisfactory to me but which would be better than the situation with which we are confronted?  Would he undertake, in the event of dissolving a county committee of agriculture, to nominate another committee from the members of the county council? Surely we do not envisage a situation in which a county council will refuse to carry out its function and be immune from action by the Minister for Local Government?  We must assume that, if a whole county council goes &ldquo;loco&rdquo; and refuses to carry out its duties, the Minister for Local Government will abolish it&mdash;and more <Col N="502" /> power to his elbow if he does.</P>
      <P>Supposing a county council is functioning reasonably and regularly and a county committee comes into a head-on collision, with the Minister, as a result of which he says that he will abolish the committee, will he undertake that out of that portion of the county council not on the committee he will choose another committee or give the county council an opportunity to do so before appointing a commissioner?  That is a <i>via media</i> which he might consider.  He could make that concession with perfect safety and it would be an indication of his desire to arrive at accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is difficulty in appointing a voluntary committee, the schemes may fall through and the benefit of 50 per cent. which the county gets may be lost.  The Minister, therefore, has the whip-hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Even here, so far as getting a voluntary committee is concerned, the Minister anticipates that he will not get sufficient people in a particular county to function without remuneration where the committee is dissolved.  I suggest that the result to the county council would be obvious, and that it is up to the farming community as a whole in any particular county where that situation may arise, to see that a committee is provided. Otherwise, they will incur a substantial loss, as the Minister will withhold the grants and they will not endure the loss of the grants for any considerable time.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Dillon's point, most county councils are composed of 21 members and the county council can put 16 of those members on the first committee of agriculture, under the law as it stands, and that would leave only five to form a new committee, under this scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister makes an announcement that he would be prepared to do anything, that would smooth the path.  We have now reached the stage when the Fianna Fáil Party are beginning to envisage a situation where the county council, the subsidiary bodies of the county council, and everybody else, enter into a dark conspiracy to obstruct the Minister.  If that situation should arise, the local body will be abolished <i>in toto.</i>  It is true in theory that a county council can put the whole 16 on the county committee, but in practice the invariable rule has been that they nominate half and bring in half from outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will probably find that eight are appointed, which leaves 13 other members of the council from which to select a fresh committee.  If, however, the Minister finds that this effort to get a second committee from the elected representatives of the people is abortive too, then let him fall back on this power.  I would sooner not give him this power at all, but I am suggesting to him to make some gesture of compromise, instead of sticking his heels in the ground and saying there will be no compromise.  Would it not be reasonable to say that, if he has to abolish an existing committee, he will constitute another from the county council, <Col N="504" /> and only in the case of the council or the new committee refusing to function will he fall back on the power to appoint a commissioner or administrator? That would be giving an indication to meet Deputy Hughes in some degree, rather than sitting back and saying he will not do anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I repeated several times that, if it were my case, I would try to get the county council to form a new committee.  I want to explain the difficulties.  The case the Deputy has just outlined may arise, where the whole county council is giving trouble, or where there is no county council there to do it.  That trouble may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Dillon that the appointing of an official is the only alternative to appointment by the county council. There would still be the alternative of appointing practical farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>But he said if it was impossible to select a committee from the county council&mdash;he suggested selecting it from the county council&mdash; the alternative was to appoint a paid official to carry on the work.  He definitely suggested that.  I say that there is still the alternative of appointing farmers, as Deputy Hughes has pointed out.</P>

      <Col N="505" /> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4), page 4&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to delete lines 19, 20 and 21 and to substitute the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Where the Minister has, under sub-section (1) of this section, dissolved a committee of agriculture for a county and transferred the property, powers and duties of such committee to any body, person or persons, the Minister shall, in the first or second election year after such dissolution, by Order cause a new appointment to&rdquo;;</P>
      <P>(b) to delete lines 25, 26 and 27 and substitute the words &ldquo;in the committee so appointed, notwithstanding such transfer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is not as formidable as it looks. As the section was being drafted, the draftsman, when he had passed on from sub-section (1), which gives the Minister an option of asking the county council to do one thing or the other, came down to sub-section (4), and that sub-section was drafted entirely on the assumption that other than the county council nominees would be acting.  To bring sub-section (4), therefore, in line with sub-section (1), and in case the county council had been asked to nominate the committee, this amendment is necessary.  That is all that is involved in it.  I do not wish to deceive Deputies opposite or let them think that we are going any further in this amendment.  If sub-section (4) is read, Deputies will see that it is inconsistent with having asked a county council to appoint another committee.  This brings it into proper relation.</P>

      <P>May I make a suggestion to the Minister?  This is an example of some of those publications which are giving rise to a good deal of criticism outside.  Why did the Minister not withdraw that sub-section (4) altogether and bring in a new sub-section on the amendments sheet? This is largely like legislation by reference. It takes time to write it out, it takes time to examine it after it is <Col N="506" /> written, and I am quite sure the draftsmen could have drafted it the other way.</P>

I readily admit that the Minister's accommodating attitude right through would almost disarm many of the objections to the Bill. Deputy O'Reilly, in his speech on the Second Reading, said that he was against centralising power and giving too much power to the Minister, unless it was absolutely necessary.  Deputy Allen, too, to-day said it was only a bad mind which would read suspicion into the actions under the Bill.  The three sub-sections involved are (1), (2) and (3), which read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  If and whenever&mdash;</P>
      <P>the Minister may by Order dissolve such committee and, as he may think fit, either order a new appointment to be made, by the council of such county, of members of such committee or transfer the property and the several powers and duties of such committee to any body or person or persons.</P>
      <P>(2)  Whenever the Minister makes an Order under this section dissolving a committee of agriculture, he may appoint such and so many persons as he shall think fit to perform the duties of such committee, and may from time to time remove all or any such persons and appoint others in their place, and may fix the tenure of office, duties and remuneration (if any) of all such persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The remuneration of all persons appointed under the foregoing sub-section to perform the duties of <Col N="507" /> a committee of agriculture for a county shall be paid out of the moneys raised by means of the agricultural rate by the council of that county.</P>
    <P>In other words, the county must find the money to pay the newly-appointed commissioner, or whatever title will be applied to him, who is to carry out the committee's functions.  There are some Deputies who may not regard those as dictatorial powers, and who may think they are necessary, but, if they take up that attitude, they will have to give a much better reason that has been advanced here.</P>
    <P>I do not like to use strong language, but I must say that the three points set out by the Minister are to me simply nonsensical.  His first point was that something similar is incorporated in the Local Government Act.  I think I should apologise for using the term &ldquo;local government,&rdquo; because in this connection it is a travesty of language &mdash;but that is by the way.  There is no analogy between the functions under the Local Government Act and the functions of a committee of agriculture. You must remember that the Minister for Local Government is responsible for the welfare of the afflicted, the upkeep of mental hospitals, for boards of assistance, and for hospital treatment. No sane man will deny the Minister for Local Government the power necessary to deal with local authorities that do not provide adequately for the services for which they are primarily responsible.  I agree that the Minister for Local Government should have that power.</P>
    <P>The second point mentioned by the Minister was that a committee of agriculture might refuse to obey a mandamus order or any court order.  Is there any substance in that?  Anything the Minister said in that respect was not very convincing.  I do not know how an order of the court would be necessary, or in what way the committee could transgress so as to invite court action.  Even if it were possible that the court might intervene, the committee could be held up for contempt of court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> The third reason advanced by the Minister was that the committee might not submit accounts for audits.  Has the Minister forgotten that the secretaries of county committees are in responsible positions, and what official will jeopardise his position by refusing to carry out an order?  There is no substance in the Minister's arguments.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he had come to an arrangement with other Ministers so that they might co-ordinate services and have the administration running smoothly.  What analogy is there?  Has the Minister ascertained what a committee of agriculture is? Listening to the debate, I frequently wondered if Deputies realised that these committees are created by local authorities and are financed to the extent of 50 per cent. from local and 50 per cent. from national funds.  Their one object is to increase productivity, and they never bother their heads about political conflicts.  Their main anxiety is to put our premier industry, agriculture, on the map; to do the best they can for it, and to see that there is immediate benefit in their own localities. What man would be prepared to face the odium and contempt of his fellows in his own area by trying to deprive them of the expenditure of £50,000 or £70,000?</P>
    <P>This whole debate is unreal, and there is absolutely no justification for arbitrary powers to deal with committees of agriculture.  All the arguments put forward here by the Minister and his supporters are hypothetical. Those things may never arise.  He said to-day:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I know of no committee that is not deserving of commendation; every one of them is functioning perfectly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In such circumstances, what is the meaning of this proposal?  There is no body of men in Ireland to-day, whether we take the Government, the county councils, or professional men, to whom the welfare of the country means more than the committees of agriculture. They are the backbone, the spearhead, of the national food drive.  They are the men who see that the Government's schemes are carried out.  The Government <Col N="509" /> create the schemes, and high technical officials may lay down the plans, but the men who put them into operation, who breathe life into them, are the members of the committees.</P>
    <P>In the crisis through which we are passing it is not so difficult to conceive a scheme calculated to benefit the community.  The really difficult part is putting that scheme into operation. In this critical period of our country's history, instead of casting reflections, indirect though they may be, on those committees, they should be entitled to our greatest consideration and latitude. You are suggesting in this section that they will take up a certain attitude.  I have an intimate association with members of these committees and I have asked myself time and again in what way can they offend.  The Minister cannot give any indication.  These committees are created by the county councils, they are composed of people representing all sections, and they include the best brains of each county.  The outstanding citizens are co-opted on them. Various schemes are given to them to administer and these schemes are financed by the Government and the county councils.  In what way can they offend?  If they are not carrying out schemes in accordance with the wishes of those who promote them, an inspector can make investigations; the Government's 50 per cent. contribution is always conditional on the scheme being fully availed of, and the Minister has power to withdraw the grant.  The same applies to the county council.  Our experience is that we are never able to give those committees sufficient money to operate schemes to the extent that might be desired.</P>
    <P>I have studied this matter closely, and I cannot see any justification for this measure.  I suggest it is an unwarranted and provocative attack on a most important body of men.  These men are not taking advantages of their position to carry on political activities. They are mainly interested in their own areas, in horse schemes, bull schemes, pig schemes, wheat and rye schemes.  There is no digression into <Col N="510" /> anything of a nature that could be considered political.  The Minister has been challenged to indicate in what direction could the committees offend. I ask him to point to any committee that has done anything other than devote its attention to furthering schemes for the benefit of the people. They are looking after the best interests of their areas.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, when there was an effort to force some schemes on the country, the local committees, with a perfect knowledge of their own interests, and exercising a better judgment than the technical experts, ventured to give their opinions and to criticise Ministerial action.  Their attitude in relation to certain schemes has since been justified.  Some of the schemes that they criticised have failed.  In criticising those schemes they were, I suggest, merely exercising their functions.  The Minister has his technical experts on whom he can rely for advice, but I suggest that he is very fortunate in having on those committees intelligent men who have a perfect knowledge of their areas and who know what they are talking about. They have to operate the schemes and it is a good thing for the Minister to have those men in a position to criticise and offer helpful suggestions.  I know that, possibly, something was said that might not have been said, but I am not dealing with that.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a very weak reason for the inclusion of this power when he said that he was relying on the fact that a similar power was taken in the Local Government Act.  There is no analogy at all between the Local Government Act and these committees. Every sensible man is prepared to support the Minister in seeing that necessary public services are properly looked after.  Here we have an entirely different position.  The county committee of agriculture is a voluntary body created by the local authority and financed by the National Government and out of the rates.  Its only function is to help to improve agricultural productivity, to encourage and develop schemes that possibly have been conceived by the experts in the Minister's <Col N="511" /> Department.  The Minister, in his speeches on the previous occasion as well as to night, said nothing that could justify the inclusion of these mandatory sections in the Bill.  It is all very well for him to say that he will not use this power and to give an assurance to that effect, but as a general principle I am not in favour of giving power to a Government that it is not absolutely necessary for it to have.  To give a Government unnecessary powers is bad for the Government and worse for the people because in extreme cases it may be used.  If you ever use it you will regret it more than any of the committees that you suppress. You have given no reason whatever for the inclusion of these mandatory sections.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  I oppose this section for three reasons, and when the time comes I intend to challenge a division on it.  In the first place, the reasons given by the Minister are entirely unconvincing.  They have absolutely no substance in them.  He says that in doing this he is simply bringing the Bill into conformity with an undertaking given to other Departments.  I submit that the powers given to other Departments were given in entirely different circumstances, and should never be applied to a body such as a committee of agriculture.  In the second place, the powers that are being sought here are to be applied to a body of men who, in my opinion, are rendering far more valuable service to the country in the present crisis, in administering the schemes entrusted to them, than either the Government or the county councils.  That is a very big claim to make for them, but I am making it because their function is to give effect to schemes which help to increase agricultural productivity.  So far as I can help it, I am not going to allow any reflecttion to be cast upon them.  In the third place, the Minister already has ample power to deal with these bodies if they are not functioning as successfully as <Col N="512" /> he would like, or if they show any inclination to go too far.  He always has the grip over them that he need not supply them with finance.  The controlling power that he has in that way should be sufficient.  Why should any suspicion be thrown on those bodies? The Taoiseach has thought them good enough to meet them.  He has an appointment with the Cork County Committee of Agriculture in the courthouse there, on Tuesday next.  Would it not be an extraordinary thing if, when he meets the members of that committee, he were to hold up this Bill to them and say: &ldquo;My Minister can suppress you any time he likes&rdquo;?  I think that what is being proposed here is very unfair, and that these mandatory sections ought to be withdrawn altogether.  The Minister spoke of democracy, but I am not going to touch on that.  I think that the proposal in the Bill is entirely undemocratic, and for the reasons I have given I intend to oppose the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I opposed this section on the Second Reading of the Bill on the grounds that these local committees of agriculture represent one of the last independent bodies that we have in the country.  They are in close touch with agriculture and in a position to direct agricultural policy locally.  I was astonished that the Minister, when replying to the Second Reading debate, did not take the opposition that was voiced to this particular section very seriously.  He asked, in effect, if he looked like a person who would suppress those county committees of agriculture lightly.  I know quite well that the Minister would not be unjust or unfair to any committee of agriculture, but I wonder why he is seeking power to wipe out those bodies which, over a long period of our history, have given very useful service.  They are all locally elected or locally selected, and I think it can be said that there is no local body which is held in higher esteem by the general community than the committees of agriculture.  Very little, if any, criticism could ever have been directed against them for the way in which they have carried out their functions.  They have always <Col N="513" /> sought to advance the interests of agriculture, even at times when the Minister for Agriculture was proceeding in an opposite direction.  They have sought to ensure that every possible advantage that could be given to the farming community, either by way of the promotion of schemes for the improvement of the industry or of increased technical knowledge for farmers, should accrue to the agricultural community through the machinery at their disposal.  I hope that the Minister in his own charming way will accept the opposition that has been expressed to this section as being genuine and well-founded, and that since there is really no strong reason why it should be included in the Bill he will simply say to the House: &ldquo;I am withdrawing it&rdquo; and leave it at that.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I cannot agree with my colleague, Deputy Broderick, or with his statements about what happened at the Cork County Committee of Agriculture.  The <Col N="514" /> Deputy, unfortunately, is not a member of that body, but over the last four or five years a member of that committee has adopted a practice of putting down a motion at every meeting, the object of which was to endeavour to prevent the farmers of Cork County from doing their tillage quota.  That particular county committee of agriculture was used as a platform to propagate the policy not to grow wheat in the County Cork. On account of the harm that the committee was doing I appealed to the Minister on several occasions to dissolve it.  I make no bones about that, because undoubtedly that committee was doing harm to the country at a period when the country could not afford to have harm done to it.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a similar question on the 15th July, 1942 (Official Report, Vol. 88, No. 2, Cols. 629-30), the classification of taxes into direct and indirect is largely a matter of opinion.  Particulars of the revenue derived from each tax in the years in question are given in the published Finance Accounts for those years.</P>
