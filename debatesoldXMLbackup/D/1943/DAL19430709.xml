      <P>It is proposed to take business as on the Order Paper: Items <Col N="536" /> Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive.  I wonder if an understanding could be arrived at by the House as to the hour of the adjournment to-day.  It may be desired to have a long discussion on the Emergency Powers Bill and, consequently, it may be necessary to move a motion that the House sit late.  I would like to know if the House could give us any indication as to what hour it would wish to continue to sit till.  It has been intimated to me that a number of Deputies from the country would like to catch their trains in the afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to continue for another year, up to 2nd September, 1944, the operation of the Emergency Powers Acts.  The Principal Act was passed on 3rd September, 1939, following the outbreak of the war, and was limited to one year.  In view of the continuance of the emergency and the conditions resulting therefrom, it has been found necessary to keep the original Act, and the amending Acts which have since been passed, in force from year to year.  The last renewal was made in the Emergency Powers (Continuance and Amendment) Act, 1943, which provided for continuing the emergency legislation in operation up to 2nd September next.  There can be no doubt that the special powers conferred by the Acts will be required after that date, and it is, therefore, proposed by the Bill now before the House to extend, the legislation up to 2nd September, 1944.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to move on the Committee Stage of this measure that it remain in force only until 1st April next.  The date set down here is 2nd September, and I have only to say that in so far as the general principle of taking powers such as are contained in these Acts and the amending Acts is concerned, we are in agreement. Whatever Government is in power, no matter of what complexion, in this or in any country during a time of crisis such as the present must be armed with these powers.  It does not follow that there is agreement or even acceptance of the manner in which they have been used.  In our view, these powers have been abused&mdash;in certain cases, shamelessly abused.  Not only that, but they have been abused with a marked absence of anything in the nature of common sense or wisdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no earthly reason why more than half the emergency decrees put into operation by the Government since they got these powers should not have been introduced here as legislation. I may mention only one, that is, the standstill Order in connection with wages of which we had, I think, six <Col N="540" /> amendments and subsequently a measure codifying them.  If there is a case to be made for legislation such as that&mdash;and it was keenly resented in many quarters&mdash;it ought to be made here in the House.  The Government has no cause for complaint as to the manner in which they have been treated since the crisis occurred.  In practically every case in which they asked for special consideration and co-operation, it was forthcoming.  At a moment's notice, that particular Order was brought in.  Had it been introduced as legislation, proposals would have been made for the adoption of the same style of treatment in respect of it-as was in operation in both Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Instead of that, we have had this trouble of certain people in the State who, suffering greater tribulations and making greater sacrifices than other sections of the community, believed that they were being harshly treated.  Goodness knows, there ought not to be that indifference to the tribulations of those people at this time.</P>
    <P>In a time of crisis, you require the co-operation of all sections and you must be prepared to take into account the difficulties of the different sections at such a time.  While a <i>prima facie</i> case may be made for stabilising wages in certain cases, the House is entitled to insist upon a stabilisation of prices concurrently with that proposal.  It is positively unjust to think that with the rising scale of prices, rising cost of living and so on here, we say to the people that we cannot afford this vicious spiral, as if they cared twopence about spirals, references to inflation or things of the kind when their own sufferings are so pronounced as they have been during that period.</P>
    <P>The Government, as I say, have had no cause to complain of the manner in which they have been treated since this emergency arose, but we are entitled to expect some attention to be paid to the rise in the cost of living. We cannot understand why it is that in a country like Great Britain serious and successful attempts have been made to keep down the cost of living. It has risen there by something like 20 per cent., while here it has gone up by about 50 or 60 per cent.  That is a <Col N="541" /> matter which affects very large sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The second point I have to refer to is the question of penalties arising out of breaches of the law.  Last year, this measure was drastically amended and power was given to the Minister to specify much more severe penalties. At short notice, penalties which were not already embodied in any of the decrees or laws of the State were prescribed. I have only this to say in regard to penalties&mdash;that in many cases the heavier the penalty, the less respect and consideration there is for the legislation If you pass laws which, impose penalties out of all reason and the cases go before the courts, the courts will seek some way of getting out of them, because they will not administer penalties which are out of all proportion to whatever is the crime alleged against a person.</P>
    <P>There is no other institution in this State capable of measuring justice than the courts, and consequently we object emphatically to a Minister of State having any power to inflict a penalty after the court has affixed its penalty. In other words, if a person is charged, no matter how bad the crime, with a breach of the regulations or of the law in connection with black marketing or anything else, leave the penalty to the court to fix.  When it is fixed let no Minister of State and no civil servant review that case and add to the penalty.  If you desire to put that man out of business, to withdraw a licence he may have from the State, put that into the decree and let the court decide whether or not it is to be withdrawn.  It is not unreasonable to ask that.  I understand, that the Minister, after some six or eight or 10 months' badgering about this question, has restored those licences.  I am quite sure he has done that after some representations have been made to him from his own Party as to the inequity or injustice of the imposition of these further penalties after the court has decided a case.  There is more than that in it.  I understand, the Minister has had no option but to restore the licence in certain cases.  It was found that the people could not get their goods except through the persons who had had the licence.  There was no act <Col N="542" /> of grace in that.  It has occurred in at least one case, and I have heard of it in another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Nowhere.  The licence was never withdrawn until arrangements for the transfer of the customers had been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.  That is more of it.  A man sitting in an office thinks he knows everything about what is going on all over the country! Surely we ought to get away from that sort of nonsense.  Assuming that it is so, I still object to any jurisdiction by a Minister of State after the courts have dealt with the case.  Put it into the law and let the justice consider whether or not alternative methods of accommodation can be found for these people, and all the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>The Government knows well that we are going to support the principle of having a measure of this sort.  The Government has been told that we object to its abuse.  Piles and piles of these decrees come out regularly and, so far as the printed documents are concerned, at very irregular dates.  I think I read some of them within the last week that were signed in April last.  How in all conscience can you expect the courts to keep pace with the mass production output of legislation on that basis?  As I said before, those things ought to come before the House. You must measure the people's acceptance of the law and respect for the law by the manner in which the Legislature itself attends to the making of the law.  If it is put out in that form you cannot have respect for it, and once it, happens that disrespect for the law creeps in it is a much more vicious spiral than the spiral of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all I have to say on it.  We accept the principle of this Act.  We will give it to them no matter how they abuse it.  We say to them: &ldquo;In all justice to the people and in the interests of the good name of the State <Col N="543" /> and the co-operation that ought to be sought from all sections of the community, exercise it with discretion.&rdquo; Remember, if they are in authority, the exercise of it oupht to he in the interests of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make reference to the question of the internees, but before doing so, there are three matters to which I would like to advert.  One of these is the question of a candidate in the election who was interned&mdash;Seán MacCumhaill.  Another point I wish to make is in reference to the Minister's suggestions about the murder of a detective officer and, thirdly, in regard to his references to the Labour Party not opposing in the previous Dáil the question of these internees without charge or trial.</P>
      <P>In reference to the question of Seán MacCumhaill, the Government, we know, have extremely wide powers which enable them to deprive a citizen of his liberty for an unlimited time without charge or trial.  It surely becomes an abuse of these powers when they exercise them for the purpose of depriving a Parliamentary candidate of his liberty.  It may, of course, be said that the candidate was given the option of conducting his campaign on parole but, with the powers the Government had, it surely would have been a proper gesture on their part to give this candidate unconditional release to conduct his campaign and to inform the electorate in his constituency as to his programme and his policy.  They did not do so and I think&mdash;I am sure most people with democratic leanings agree &mdash;that the Government were guilty in this case of an abuse of their powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The candidate in question also suffered another very serious disadvantage in the conduct of his campaign. He had advertisements asking for support which he desired to publish in the Press.  The Government exercised its powers of censorship to delete the words that he was &ldquo;interned without trial and was now 32 days on hunger strike.&rdquo;  That action of the Government in reference to this candidate was surely unnecessary and was an infringement on the rights of any <Col N="544" /> political candidate.  I am sure the House will agree that the only justification for censorship would be that the advertisements contained something which would endanger neutrality or which was patently illegal, but I think the words I have quoted, and which were deleted, cannot be placed in either of these categories.</P>
    <P>Strange as it may seem, the Government Information Bureau, on the 18th June, I think, gave the public the information that Seán MacCumhaill was on hunger strike, but he was not permitted to refer to the matter nor were these advertisements permitted to appear.  Therefore, we had a case of this candidate being precluded from addressing his constituents through being detained as a prisoner after his nomination.  Secondly, he was prevented, through the operation of the censorship, from informing his constituents as to why he was unable to address them.  Thirdly, he was prevented, by the censorship, from making it clear that he was not charged or convicted of any offence.</P>
    <P>That would be a very important point in an appeal to the public and it would militate against the chances of success of any candidate were he to lie under such a charge.  He was the only candidate in this election who was not permitted to appear before his constituents and whose election advertisements were so censored.  Although it must not be taken that we desire the application of the censorship to the utterances of other candidates, I am sure the Irish public will contrast that with the treatment meted out to, say, candidates like Mr. O'Dwyer, of Cork, and Deputy Dillon.  In fact, some of their statements might be considered by certain parties to bear very distinctly upon this issue of neutrality, and yet there was no attempt on the part of the Government to censor any of their utterances. In our opinion, the matter amounts to a constitutional abuse and an infringement upon the elementary democratic rights of citizens.  That is the point we wish to make in respect to that and we trust that it shall not be made a precedent in future.</P>
    <P>In reference to my second point, the <Col N="545" /> Minister for Justice on Wednesday, in referring to his action in regard to three internees, said that, though he had been advised by the police to release these men as he understood from their representations that the men had amended their ways, he, the Minister for Justice, laboured under a suspicion in regard to these men. Despite that, however, he released these men with calamitous results, resulting in a detective officer with a national record being done to death. The significant part of this statement is that the Minister should come into the Dáil to make his suspicions public. This is, in our opinion, a very serious matter.  The men who were released on the representations of the police have not been apprehended, they have not been put on trial.  Yet the Minister comes before the House prejudging their case.  If these men are ever arrested and put on trial, the suspicions of the Minister will be remembered to their detriment and we cannot hope that these men will obtain a fair trial.  The Minister is entitled to his suspicions, but I do not think he is entitled to bring them before a democratic assembly to prejudge an issue of this kind.  Many members of this House might quite rightly say, had they the information, that the Minister's suspicions in regard to these three men are absolutely unfounded, or that they had suspicions in reference to other parties.  But, as the matter may eventually come before a court, it is, I think, regrettable that the Minister should have given utterance to this suspicion.  The Minister cannot afford himself the luxury of suspicion.  In a double sense, the Minister, like Caesar's wife, should be above suspicion.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the fact that the Labour Party had a different attitude on this matter from that which is evidently being pursued in this Dáil.  I must, of course, leave to the members of the previous Dáil the rebuttal of that.  But, it should be obvious to the Minister that the 80,000 extra votes which the Labour Party obtained at the election were, perhaps, due very largely to the fact that quite a number of Republicans, those with Republican traditions, had come over <Col N="546" /> towards the Labour Party, and that their activities had resulted in that accretion of strength.  Naturally, if that is so, the Labour Party must become responsive to this new impact on its political make-up.  Apart from the question of natural justice, apart from the question of the natural attitude of the Labour Party in regard to this infringement of democratic rights, that probably accounts for the fact that we should pursue a line in this Dáil which would command support among a very large mass of our people.</P>
    <P>Apart from these three matters, I am asking that the Taoiseach and the Government should give us a revaluation of the whole position in regard to these untried and uncharged internees. The Labour Party is not satisfied with the basis on which these men are held, many of them for long periods, some of them for more than three years. The situation is changed both in respect to the powers and to the forces of the Government.  The forces which the Government now command are much stronger than they were at the period when these men were first interned. There has been a very large development of the armed forces of the State and of their auxiliary forces, which forces naturally are at the disposal of the Government to resist any attack upon the powers of the State. These increased forces enable the Government to discharge the duty of making the community more supreme and invulnerable than when these men were first interned.</P>
    <P>There is also another change that perhaps the Government have not apprehended, and that is in respect to the outlook of many of these men on the political situation in the country. Their ideas may have changed.  The ideas of most men change over a period of years.  Men in internment camps particularly have opportunities of discussing questions in perhaps a different atmosphere from that to which they have been accustomed outside, and there may be, therefore, a revaluation in their own minds of many of these political questions.  I know it is stated that many of these men are difficult to handle both inside and outside.  But I think that there are <Col N="547" /> too many of us in this House with prison experience and experience in internment camps to stress this as any great objection to the line which I advocate, the line of a revaluation of the whole position.  These internees as we all know use their situation, and they buck against all sorts of regulations and conditions.  They make themselves difficult in order to maintain their self-respect, in order to maintain their independence of mind, and, in many cases owing to the irksome nature of their imprisonment, in order to maintain their sanity.  This then should not be taken as an argument that these men are too difficult to handle, and that their cases are not worthy of re-examination on the lines I wish to advocate.</P>
    <P>We have discussed the question of the men who have been on hunger strike since the 24th May, and I do not wish to traverse the humanitarian plea that nas been made by Deputy Norton.  But we must emphasise that the Labour Party, as a democratic Party, believes in democracy and that it vigorously opposes totalitarianism in any shape or form.  It is prepared to admit that a democratic State, especially in a time of national danger or international war, should exercise the fullest powers to safeguard the community and, especially, the workers and toilers.  Equally it ranges itself against any abuse of these powers by the State machinery, and it considers it the function of such an Assembly as this, while democracy continues, to prevent these abuses of the power given to it by the State machinery.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believe in orderly progress as the best guarantee of the elementary rights of the workers, the best guarantee of the expansion of democracy, the best guarantee of the evolution of nationality itself.  But, while we are a democratic Party, we have our own philosophy on this question of the appeal to arms, a philosophy that is not, perhaps, very well understood even by those internees, and I wish to make it plain.  The appeal to arms, in our opinion, is a continuation of a political line, perhaps in a restricted set of circumstances, due to frustration and the prevention <Col N="548" /> of development along normal political lines.  But yet it is nothing extraordinary, it is nothing out of the skies; it is just a continuation of politics in another form.</P>
    <P>There are times when the nation will endorse such an appeal.  There are times, Indeed, as it has been in the past, when the nation will cry out for such an appeal to remedy an injustice which no other manner of action might effect.  There are times when an attack upon essential liberties may be met only by such an appeal.  The Labour Party does not forego such an eternal right of the people as an appeal to arms.  Men on the Government Benches and on the Opposition Benches have themselves upheld such a right when necessity arose, and I am as proud to have been associated, perhaps in a very small way, with the present Minister for Defence in the Civil War in Findlaters, or to recall the happy times when the Taoiseach acted as O.C.  Operations on Séamus Robinson's staff as when I did very little indeed as a youth in the G.P.O. in 1916.</P>
    <P>But other times and other men demand recourse to other forms of activity, and this is the important point that we wish to stress in regard to this matter which is at the root of the internment policy of the Government, this question of the appeal to arms.  The Government do not seem to appreciate that members of the physical force party now interned may also begin to see things in a different light.  In the past the physical force party in this country aligned itself with, or at least did not oppose, the Parliamentary agitation of Parnell or Davitt.  In the present, members of the physical force party, to my own knowledge, are drawing near to the normal lines of legal political action which characterise the Labour Party and other legal political Parties in this country.  Such men, in our opinion, who have begun to think along these lines, should be permitted to resume their places in the normal democratic life.  There should be a revaluation of their intentions after prolonged internment. I want to say again that they may to-day think differently from what <Col N="549" /> they thought three years ago on political matters.</P>
    <P>To digress for a moment, when the Minister for Justice made a statement, which he repeated in the Dáil, that these men had the keys of their cells in their pockets, he was aware, I am sure, that representations had been made on their behalf to exercise rights which, he said, resided with them in order to obtain their release.  Unfortunately, the Minister did not qualify that statement, and he caused a lot of dismay among many of the relatives of these men, who exercised their influence to try to get them out, and found that, despite the fact that they were willing to comply with the forms, they were still refused their liberty.  We know, of course, that in the present circumstances a general gaol delivery is too much to expect, and we are just arguing here upon the minimum rather than upon the maximum lines; but we can at least demand of the Government a general re-examination of all the cases of untried prisoners by some impartial body.  That, I think, is a reasonable approach to the matter which the Minister could not resist.</P>
    <P>We make no plea to let loose any elements who may be indoctrinated with the ideology of totalitarianism. The Labour Party would naturally be the last to plead on behalf of discredited Fascist elements or to ask for their release.  Such elements exist, of course, in every democratic country, but the Labour Party record shows that in the past it supported Fianna Fáil when there were attempts made in this country to assail the democratic State.  Labour assisted Fianna Fáil in smashing the Blue Shirt attempt to seize power, because they realised, as they do to-day, that had such an attempt succeeded, Labour would be the first and the worst to suffer.</P>
    <P>But the Minister must make his case beyond yea or nay that such elements compose the major or any goodly part of his internees.  The Minister referred to Seán Mac Cumhall and his activities, and suggested that such elements among the internees had endeavoured to embroil this country in a war.  That there may be certain elements with that intention, we do not doubt, but <Col N="550" /> we would like the case to be made more definite even than the Minister made it, because we are in possession of a telegram received yesterday from Seán Mac Cumhail in which he denies the allegation of the Minister that he attempted in any way to infringe the neutrality of the country or embroil it in war.</P>
    <P>The Minister must make his case absolutely watertight in regard to this question of the elements who compose the internees.  They may not be a homogeneous group; I do not suggest that they are.  But the Labour Party wishes to emphasise its point that any of the elements amongst the internees who now wish to participate in the normal political life of the country should be given the opportunity of doing so.  Labour will not stand for any attack on the democratic institutions of the State, no matter how much we are opposed to the economic policy of whatever Party may be in power at the moment.  There is no contradiction here, though some may think so. All the Parties in the State have come together on the question of neutrality, though they widely differ on questions of their political line no less than on questions of their economic line.  Similarly, though the Labour Party has its own social outlook and philosophy, though it is diametrically opposed to Fianna Fáil policy in certain matters, that would not prevent it rallying all the forces of Labour and all the forces that Labour commands to resist an attack upon the democratic institutions of the State.  So long as the Government Party remains a democratic Party, it can be assured of such support from Labour against any attempt to undermine the constitutional basis of Government by extra-legal, Fascist means.</P>
    <P>I myself have always held to this principle of trying to unite the Labour and Republican elements in this country against the reactionary political and economic groupings which oppose progress on the part of the Irish nation.  I believe that, otherwise, there is no possibility of progress in the political field, any more than in the social or economic field, especially <Col N="551" /> in a country with our traditions and with the economic basis on which we rest, the number of small producers and small property owners and the peculiar ideology they have.</P>
    <P>It has always been the aim of many of us to weld together these progressive forces, to try, for instance, in the present situation, to get the utmost co-operation between the Republican elements which may be in Fianna Fáil, in Clann na Talmhan and in Labour itself to enable us to take a progressive line in regard to many things, such as the partition of our country, and in regard to the general question of Irish nationality.  But the continued detention of those whose only aim is republicanism rises as one of the big political obstacles and barriers to any such unity of purpose between the Republican and Labour forces in this House or outside.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I, for my part&mdash;apart from the general line of the Party&mdash;seek a revaluation of this whole internee position.  That would enable us to give greater attention in this House and outside to economic matters which press so heavily on the people and free us from the canker of civil discord.  The test that should be made in regard to these internees should not be the merely negative one of subscribing to forms or renouncing some mode of activity in which they indulged in the past.  That is a very hard thing to get men to do, as most members on the Government Bench know from their own experience.  It is very hard to get men to subscribe to these forms.  I ask the Taoiseach and those responsible for the internment of those men to apply another test&mdash;a positive test, not a test to renounce what they did in the past, and to give guarantees for the future which have no great validity and which may not be carried out.  I suggest that the test we put to them should be the positive test of taking their place in the political life of this country and conducting their agitation upon normal political lines to achieve as many of their ideals as they can.  If they are prepared to do so, I think we should draw a veil over their past activities and <Col N="552" /> have a new start.  If these men are prepared to undertake normal political activity&mdash;and I am sure the Fianna Fáil Party would be prepared to allow them to do so&mdash;they should be permitted to conduct whatever agitation they think necessary, provided it is permitted by law, even to the extent of forming political parties of their own or joining the Labour Party or ranging themselves with any Party which they conceive might possibly end the regime of Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>As we know, many of these internees are quite young and quite inexperienced. Their political concepts, when first interned, were, probably, quite immature.  There is a great responsibility on Fianna Fáil and on the Labour Party, particularly, for not having provided a youth movement for these ardent, young spirits.  We did not provide them with any youth movement into which they could have flung their zeal and enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not suggest that we should have youth movements such as have been used in other countries, and were intended to be used in this country, as stepping stones to totalitarianism. There are other youth movements, and in democratic countries these movements have played very important parts in these countries where the light of democracy has not yet been brutally extinguished. For some reason or other, the progressive forces in this country, the Fianna Fáil and Labour Parties, have not turned the attention they should have turned to the creation of these youth movements.  It might be a lesson for Clann na Talmhan to learn from the failure of these other two Parties, that there is necessity for political youth movements along legal lines to give an opportunity to the youth of this country to throw their enthusiasm and energy into the normal political life of the country.  Once these men are given the opportunity for which we ask they may, who knows, contribute a good deal to the creative efforts of the nation.</P>
    <P>To sum up, we are asking for two things&mdash;to ease the situation and <Col N="553" /> make it possible to have a revaluation that would be productive, we ask the Government, again, to consider the advisability of releasing these men who are on hunger strike, without charge or trial and allow them to have a new start.  This is a new Dáil, and there should be a new spirit.  The arguments for their continued detention may be very sound from the point of view of Fianna Fáil, but if we are to get a new lease of political life, if we are to draw these men into normal political activity, we must first solve this question of the hunger strikers.  The only way it can be solved is by their release.  The alternative of letting them die is an alternative which we could hardly contemplate as doing any credit to the Government or to the country.</P>
    <P>If this is done, or whether it is done or not&mdash;it is out of our hands&mdash;on the very minimum basis of dealing with this problem, the Government should take the risk, if there is any risk, of making the test by releasing any internee on his sincere expression of desire, henceforth, to engage in the normal political activities of the country, and to work for the attainment of his political ideas through normal legal channels.  If my words can go beyond these walls, to those people in the internment camps, and they take this message to heart, that many of their aims may be accomplished through legal effort without necessarily sacrificing their ideals, without, indeed, surrendering their philosophy, or their aims if at times injustice demanded it, then I think there may be quite a change for the better in the political situation of this country, and if the Government accedes to this request, we may open up a new era of political development.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken started off by referring to the way in which a candidate at the election was treated&mdash;this man, Seán Mac Cumhaill. It was said the Government has interfered with his election address.  I made enquiries since the last day and find that no such thing was done.  He was given every facility to communicate with his constituency by writing.  He <Col N="554" /> was offered his liberty only on one condition, that he would abstain from illegal activities while out, and that was necessary, because the same man had been unconditionally released on a previous occasion&mdash;I am not quite sure how long before, but certainly a few months after he had been arrested. The position was that he was sentenced to five years in the Six Counties.  He came home and the Guards arrested him, believing that he was going to continue these activities.</P>
      <P>Representations were made to me that the man was not getting a fair chance, and that he should get an opportunity to live an ordinary life. I thought that that was only fair and insisted on his release, although the police objected to it.  Very shortly afterwards, we found that he was in charge of the I.R.A., and I certainly was not going to stand for letting a man out unconditionally in view of that.</P>

The Deputy also said that in my reply the other day I referred to the case of the three men in such a way as to prejudge them. I have done no such thing.  The fact is that the police published the photographs of the three men wanted for the murder of Detective-Sergeant O'Brien.  I said they were suspected &mdash;and so they are&mdash;still suspected.

      <P>I quite understood what the Deputy said.  I did, for the first time, object to the police recommendation that they be released.  I have objected and refused to intern men on police recommendations, but I have never demurred from releasing any man from internment, except on this occasion, because I have some idea of the previous history of these men. <Col N="556" /> But the police were satisfied they had changed their ways, because they had persuaded them that they had done so, and would sign any undertaking they were asked to sign.</P>
      <P>We suspected that these three men were responsible for the murder of Detective-Sergeant O'Brien, and one of them for two other Guards since. Not alone were their names published, but their photographs were published, and the police are still looking for them.  So much for prejudicing the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has been raised about their changed outlook.  I am constantly looking for that.  They have had every opportunity of changing their outlook.  They have been appealed to, time and again, to take their places as ordinary citizens.  We do not care what Party they belong to &mdash;that is a matter for themselves&mdash;but they should not persist in trying to involve this country in war.  I am quite positive about that.  They actually had the cheek, an unknown body of people&mdash;we do not know who they are&mdash;to make a declaration of war on the British Government.  Is that denied?  And, in the name of the Irish people, too.  Seven ex-T.D.s who were elected for the last time about 20 years ago, met in Dublin, or somewhere, and handed over their alleged powers to the I.R.A. somewhere about December, 1938.  And in January the next year, 1939, this body in the name of the Irish people, declared war on Britain, and what sort of war was it? It was not like the stand-up fight of the old days, but the dropping of hand-bags, or attache cases, full of explosives, in crowded thoroughfares and railway stations&mdash;something that brought shame to the cheeks of Irishmen. That is the sort of thing we have to deal with, the blowing up of cinemas, putting bombs in customs huts and running away, and when men and women came along later they are blown up.  That is what they call &ldquo;war&rdquo;.  They persist in their right to do that.  I say that they want to involve this country in war.  They have been carrying on this campaign since 1929.  When the police tried to stop them they killed a number of them and <Col N="557" /> wounded others.  Are we to allow that to go on?  Why did we decide on mass internment?  The Labour Party was a party to that, because they were convinced that there was a reason for it.</P>
    <P>Deputies who are new to this House may not be familiar with the situation as it was at that time.  In 1940 when things looked very bad it became known that a parachutist had descended in this country.  He was not captured, but his paraphernalia was found in a house in Terenure in which we found plans, as far as we could see, for an invasion of this country.  It took 18 months to capture the parachutist as he was harboured by the I.R.A.  We knew that 24 hours after a parachutist got into a house in Glendalough he was taken away by these people.  It took the police 18 months to capture him.  While he was in this country and at large we did not know what to expect.  Nobody knew what to expect.  The Labour Party representatives sat at the Defence Conference and never objected to internment.  The question was never debated in this House as all Parties agreed about it.  Not a single Deputy objected.  Another parachutist who came down here was luckily caught by the police.  He escaped from Mountjoy later and it took three months to catch him.  He was in touch with some group of persons outside.  Is it not a fair indication that these people tried to involve this country in war when they harboured these men?  If we allow their attempts &ldquo;to make war&rdquo; as they call it on the British, allow the blowing up of huts, the murder and the wounding of policemen, as well as the fact that they harboured people who came here with plans for invasion, as far as we could see, was not that a direct attempt to involve this country in war?  One man was the Chief of Staff, as far as the police could discover, and we are now asked to assume that, if released, he would behave as an ordinary citizen.  He was released unconditionally.</P>

      <P>I withdraw it.  I find it hard to withdraw it in this particular case, but I do so as requested.  The Government is looking into this question constantly, and every man's case comes under review.  If a man wishes to make representations he will be listened to.  Chances are taken.  I could not say how many people have been released against the wishes of the Guards.  When I did not listen to the advice of the Guards, I found that they were right.  I have been found wrong in almost every case where many men were released.  Where the Guards opposed release, men had to be arrested again because they would persist in the attempt, definitely to involve this country in war.  That is what they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connolly may not be aware that that attempt has been made. These people are free to go into the <Col N="559" /> political arena and to put their case before the people.  They can do what the Labour Party and Clann na Talmhan has done&mdash;get a party into the Dáil and put down a motion.  These men could have gone up for election if they were prepared to do what other people did.  One man was not prepared to do that.  He said he was entitled to be a member of the I.R.A., with the right that they claim to make war, and with the right of government without coming into the Dáil. They say that this House has not got that right, that they, unknown people, have that right.  When they went up for election they could not pay the deposit, yet they claim to speak on behalf of the Irish people, with authority that they got from seven or eight people who were elected 20 years ago, but were not elected since.  What sort of a party is that?  This is the Assembly to decide whether this country is or is not to remain at peace.</P>
    <P>As far as these internees are concerned, if they behave as ordinary citizens, a number of them can be released. Some of them cannot be released while this war lasts.  I am sure that if the ordinary courts functioned they would be found guilty but, on account of the terror that these people can inspire, we cannot try them.  Only two months ago a man was shot in this city for giving evidence in one case, and another man who was wounded hovered between life and death.  How could you expect these men to be tried? It is impossible.  The only witnesses we can get are police witnesses. Occasionally somebody with exceptional courage is not afraid to give evidence.  Anybody who does takes his life in his hands.  We had two cases in Kerry where people were shot at, one being wounded and the other luckily escaping.  However, he was boycotted, his land was spiked, and he could not get his corn threshed or his turf saved. simply because he gave evidence that gelignite had been taken.  That is a state of affairs you have throughout the country.  If the Labour Party happened to be the Government in office they would not chance leaving these people at large.  The only thing to <Col N="560" /> do would be to look into their applications and to get their records from the police.  There is no other way of dealing with them.  Any Government would have to insist, while the emergency lasts, that the internment of a very large number of these people is absolutely necessary.  I daresay there is a case for releasing some of them. That will be done if I am satisfied that it should be done.  As far as the hunger strikers are concerned I want to say that I think it is a shame that the Labour Party has taken up their cases for this reason, that they must know that we cannot release them.  The only effect of taking up the cases of these unfortunate men is to create the hope that the Government will be forced to release them That is the only effect there will be, and it may be disastrous for the men concerned, because we cannot release them on a threat of hunger-strike.  They can be released, through the ordinary, process I have outlined, if they change their attitude, but not by a threat of hunger-strike.  I think it is really too bad that these men should be kept on hunger-strike an extra week because of the attitude of certain members of this House in trying to force the Government's hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, first of all, to refer to an Order made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and of Supplies relating to the transport of goods and commodities, including turf, in an area known as the North Mayo area.  I mention it, primarily, because the Order affects the constituency that I represent in one very important respect.  The Order has given a monopoly of transport of goods and commodities, including turf, to the Great Southern Railways Company. The private lorry owners were driven off the road, and I do not know how the scheme is operating in the Mayo portion of the area, but I have been given to understand that there is a very large measure of dissatisfaction at the way in which the Great Southern Railways Company is carrying out its duties.  There is a small portion of the county already included in the scheme: the area known as the Dromore West area, and it is from that area that 75 per cent. of the turf is <Col N="561" /> supplied to the people in the town of Sligo.  Now, the fuel merchants, when they were transporting the turf themselves, laid in sufficient supplies of turf to last during the whole of the winter and a good portion of the following spring.  Last winter they stocked a sufficient amount of turf to supply the people in the town of Sligo and the adjoining areas during the whole of the winter and some of the spring as well, but now, since this has been handed over to the railway company, they are only able to get a stock sufficient to last for from seven to ten days.  That is the largest supply, I am told, that the fuel merchants in the town of Sligo can get from the railway company.</P>
      <P>The population of Sligo town is about 14,000&mdash;not quite 14,000&mdash;and the area adjoining the town of Sligo also depends on the fuel merchants in the town to supply them with turf; so that, altogether, from 16,000 to 20,000 people depend on the fuel merchants there for their supplies of turf.  For that reason, it is essential, unless things are allowed to become chaotic, that the Minister should take some steps either to make the railway company increase considerably the number of lorries they have on the road transporting turf, or else give to the fuel merchants themselves the right to transport turf from Dromore West to the town of Sligo.  If he does not do that, I fear that there is danger of a fuel famine in the town of Sligo in the coming winter.  The poor, who buy the turf from day to day, would be the hardest hit by that situation.  Unless the Minister takes immediate steps to relieve the position, it may give rise to considerable hardship, especially among the poorer sections of the community, during the coming winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the local lorries that were hauling the turf until the Minister made this Order were fitted with a certain type of crate to suit the requirements of the Turf Development Board.  The railway company lorries, on the other hand, are using an old type of crate, and the result is that when they haul turf&mdash;I am not now speaking of the fuel merchants, but of the railway company&mdash;the turf, generally, has to <Col N="562" /> be unloaded outside the premises to which it is being brought, because the crate is too large to go through the gates, and the inevitable result is that the cost of the turf is increased appreciably. Then, again, with regard to the costs of transport, the fuel merchants themselves were able to transport the turf at an average cost of 12/6 a ton, whereas in the case of the railway company the cost of transport is 17/6 a ton, and they transport a smaller quantity.  The result is that turf is being sold at £3 5s. a ton whereas, if the fuel merchants were allowed to haul in the turf themselves. the price to the consumer would be reduced very substantially.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the fuel merchants themselves that there actually has been no saving of petrol or tyres.  In fact, they maintain that if they had the hauling of the turf themselves they could actually economise in the consumption of petrol and in the use of tyres as well.  As an actual fact, two of the fuel merchants have equipped their lorries with producer gas plants, and the other fuel merchants there are prepared to do likewise, if the Minister will agree to exclude the Sligo area from the scheme, at least for the purpose of transporting turf to the town of Sligo.</P>
    <P>To give an example of the difference in the cost of transport by the railway company and the cost of transport by a private lorry owner, there is one member of the Lorry Owners' Association in Sligo, I understand, who was asked recently by an official of the Department to quote a price for the transport of furniture in his lorry or van from the town of Sligo to Enniscrone, which is in the scheduled area. He said that he was prepared to do so provided that the official concerned secured permission from the Department of Industry and Commerce for him to use his van in bringing the furniture to Enniscrone.  The price quoted by this private individual was £7 10s., whereas the price quoted by the railway company was £16.  The furniture had to be transported by the railway company because the individual concerned could not get the necessary permit from the Department of Supplies <Col N="563" /> or the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;I do not know which particular Department was concerned &mdash;to take the furniture from Sligo to Enniscrone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Taoiseach that I am not going to hold up the business of the House very long. I want to point out to the Minister that his Order has caused quite a lot of unemployment.  It has hit the private lorry business, and in addition it has created unemployment in local garages in Sligo.  There is a danger that, if the Minister insists on the Order remaining in force, some of the fuel merchants in Sligo will also be driven out of business, with consequent addition to unemployment in the town.  I do appeal to the Minister to exclude the very small portion of Sligo covered by the scheme.  If the Minister cannot see his way to do that, he should at least agree to allow private lorries in Sligo&mdash;lorries which draw for fuel merchants, and other private lorries if necessary&mdash;to transfer turf from Dromore West to Sligo town, so as to prevent the possibility of a fuel famine in the coming winter and spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a few other matters that I wanted to raise, but, in view of the Taoiseach's statement, I will not hold <Col N="565" /> up the business of the House.  With regard to the regulations made by the Minister under the Emergency Powers Act, I would appeal to him to impress on his officials the importance of administering those regulations a little more sympathetically than they have been doing it up to the present.  I know of cases where shopkeepers and traders have been hauled before the courts on the trivial charge of failing to fill in the correct form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise that that is not a trivial charge.  It is the natural cover-up for black market activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have known intimately for a number of years one particular merchant who was hauled before the courts for failure to fill up the correct form, and I know that that merchant did and was doing his utmost to carry out, in the letter and in the spirit, the regulations made by the Minister.  I know that he had no intention whatsoever of causing any trouble to one of the Minister's officials.  Nevertheless, because he failed to fill in the correct form, he was brought before the courts.  Fortunately, the district justice took a charitable view of the case, and let him off, I think, under the First Offenders Act; I forget at the moment what the actual sentence was.  There have been a few cases of that type.  I know one case where an inspector visited a shop in a certain area in my constituency seven times in one day.  I realise perfectly well that, during the war, it is essential that an Emergency Powers Act of this description should be enforced.  I realise also that it is essential that the Government and the Minister should have extraordinary powers.  I realise too that it is the duty of citizens to co-operate to the best of their ability with the Government and the Minister in carrying out the provisions of the Act.  But I would appeal to the Minister to impress on his officials the importance of administering those regulations as sympathetically as possible.  From my knowledge of traders and merchants, I believe that they are anxious to co-operate to the best of their ability with <Col N="566" /> the Minister and his officials.  It must be remembered, however, that the difficulties which traders and merchants have to face at the present time are very great.  Their problems are not by any means easy ones, but I do think that at least 95 or perhaps 99 per cent. of the merchants and traders in this country are quite honest in the manner in which they are carrying on their business, and I do not think it is necessary for officials rigidly to apply the system of inspection which they are carrying out in so many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking for myself, and not for this Party, I feel that there is no member of this House who can seriously object to the Government seeking the powers which are embodied in this Emergency Powers Act.  We all have had very vivid experience of the manner in which those powers have been abused in various ways during the past couple of years. Nevertheless, the preservation of the democratic institutions of this country, the preservation of the very existence of the nation, depends upon whatever Government is in office being vested with powers sufficient to enable them to deal with any attempt that may be made upon the authority of the State. The very fact that the present Government is in a minority position in this House places a heavier responsibility upon every individual Deputy here than would, perhaps, otherwise be the case.  If the Government had a clear majority over all Parties, it might be possible for minority Parties here, or for individual Deputies, as a gesture of protest against some of the things that have been done under the Emergency Powers Act, to vote against the continuation of that Act, but, in the present circumstances, I think no Deputy in this House who seriously realises his responsibility to the nation would take the risk of depriving the Government of the powers which are so necessary for the preservation of the authority of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fairly reasoned case was put up by Deputy Connolly in regard to certain matters under this Emergency Powers Act, but I do not think that he did really attempt to establish a case <Col N="567" /> against the continuation of the Act. He certainly indicated that many of the powers which are embodied in the Act, particularly in regard to the internment of persons suspected of endeavouring to upset the authority of the State, would be utilised by him if he were exercising governmental authority.  At any rate, he made it clear that there are certain types of suspects, particularly suspects with Fascist leanings, against whom he would be prepared rigidly to enforce the law, because he would not allow them to upset the authority of democratic institutions in this country. Therefore, we may take it that the general principle of internment is accepted by him, and it is only a question of considering whether the number of persons interned by the State could be reduced by a revaluation or a reinvestigation of the circumstances of each individual internee.  I think that is a fairly reasonable request, and I think it is one which the Government would be prepared to meet.  It is really only a matter of finding out the most desirable method of investigating the future intentions of those who have had to be interned.  On general principles, therefore, I think the necessity for internment of certain citizens of this State for the protection of governmental authority is accepted.</P>
    <P>In other matters, very strong protests have been made by citizens of this country against the manner in which some of the Orders under the Emergency Powers Act have been enforced, and particularly the Order which enforces the cancellation of the licences of traders.</P>
    <P>Here we have the position in which people who have been tried by a court and sentenced to the most severe penalty which the court considers necessary to meet the case are, in addition, subjected to a much more severe penalty, imposed not by any tribunal, but by an official of the Department of Supplies.  I think there should be some assurance from the Government that in future some adequate protection will be afforded to citizens who are brought before the <Col N="568" /> courts for offences against the various emergency regulations.  At any rate, no citizen of this State should be deprived completely of his means of livelihood&mdash;for that is what is implied in the cancellation of his licence.  Not only is the trader deprived of his means of livelihood, but he is also deprived of means of collecting debts which are due to him by his customers.  We all know what a delicate and difficult thing it is for a trader to build up a connection with his customers and secure a definite patronage. If he loses that support for even a matter of a few months he may lose his trade permanently.  I think that that aspect of the matter should command the earnest attention of the Government, and that in future some provision should be made for some form of tribunal to which a person can appeal if it is proposed to cancel his licence to carry on business.</P>
    <P>Another matter which intimately concerns my constituency, and I suppose every other constituency, is the power of the State to take over turbary rights from citizens in this country.  We have very serious complaints from many counties as to the basis on which compensation has been awarded to bog owners.  We have also serious complaints as to the manner in which these turbary rights have been distributed amongst prospective turf cutters.  This is a very serious matter as our turf supply is one of the most important considerations at the moment and it is absolutely necessary that the turbary rights of private citizens should be respected.  Turbary owners are, and have always been, the poorer sections of the community.  If, in this time of emergency, it is proposed to take over their property in the national interest and thereby deprive them of property which might be very valuable to them and their children in after years, it is absolutely essential that full and adequate compensation should be paid and that all consequential loss or damage inflicted on those small property owners should be taken into consideration.  I think the House would be prepared, while protesting against some of the extreme and unwise measures taken <Col N="569" /> under this Emergency Powers Act, to support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to co-operate with the Government or with any Party that I believed was going to introduce legislation in the best interests of the Irish nation.  I should like very much to be in a position to support any measure brought forward in this House with that object, but I am very sorry that I cannot associate myself with this Bill or with anything relating to the public safety measures introduced by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government or by the present Fianna Fáil Government because I have seen that most of these Emergency Acts were always directed against Republicanism.  How is it that we do not see any of these Acts directed against the Jews, who crucified Our Saviour nineteen hundred years ago, and who are crucifying us every day in the week?  How is it that we do not see them directed against the Masonic Order?  How is it that the I.R.A. is considered an illegal organisation while the Masonic Order is not considered an illegal organisation?  You do not hear one word in these Acts against the banks who are robbing the people, right, left and centre.  I told the electors in Leix-Offaly that the banks were robbers.  The police were listening to me.  Does the Minister for Justice think that, if the banks were not robbers, the police would have allowed me to make that statement in public without attempting to make me prove it?  This Government is introducing an Emergency Powers Bill now to prevent the suffering masses of the Irish people from ridding themselves or the poverty, emigration, debt, seizures and a thousand and one other national ills which I could continue to enumerate in this House until this day-week, but I do not propose to waste your precious time doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that I have to say is that my heart goes out to the men who are on hunger strike to-day.  I made a request to the Minister the other night to release these prisoners.  I am sorry I made such a request.  I had a right to demand it on behalf of the people who sent me here as a republican.  I <Col N="570" /> am demanding it now.  Seán Mac Cumhaill sent me a telegram last night asking me to deny a certain statement made by the Minister.  Perhaps you, Sir, would tell me if it would be in order to read this telegram to the Minister since he did not think it worth while&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Thank you very much.  I should like to say that I cannot support any of these Bills because Our Holy Father the Pope stated that all nations, strong and weak, had a right to life and independence, and if I am a Christian, I must obey the teachings of the Church.  Is the Minister a Christian?  He says he is, but nothing Christian has come from Fianna Fáil or from Fine Gael.  That old Christian saying: &ldquo;Do unto men as you would like men to do unto you&rdquo;, is forgotten and their policy is: &ldquo;Do a man before he does you.&rdquo;  That is the position as I see it.  I want to make my position clear.  I am associated with no Party in this House.  I am expressing the views of the republican organisation and the people of Leix-Offaly who sent me here because I got no support from Fianna Fáil, from Fine Gael, Labour or Farmers.  I got support only from the republicans of Leix-Offaly who sent me here, and it is on behalf of these people that I am demanding the release of Seán Mac Cumhaill and these other men in the interests of Christianity and in accordance with the teachings of the Pope that all nations strong and weak have the right to life and independence.  Does the Minister remember the words of the late Dr. O'Dwyer, that great Bishop of Limerick, who said in 1916 that &ldquo;While grass grows and water flows there will be men found in Ireland to dare and die for it&rdquo;?  You will not be here in years to come, not one of us will be here in years to come, but I hope a better lot than we are will replace us.  When you are gone out of this House there will be men daring and dying for Ireland.  They will <Col N="571" /> have to wait for the republic and perhaps die for the republic if they are waiting for us to get it.  I cannot see anything in these Acts about the republic.  It is completely forgotten.</P>

      <P>I cannot for the life of me see why those men should be interned because of their views.  Their views are the views of Wolfe Tone, or Pearse and of Connolly.  Deputy <Col N="572" /> Dillon, a member of this House, says that this nation should be at war with England&mdash;that it should join in with her.  Senator MacDermot, a member of the Oireachtas, in a broadcast from the United States some time ago said: &ldquo;Shame on Ireland because she is not in the war with England, her best friend and ally.&rdquo;  That man was one of the Taoiseach's nominees in the Seanad.  I wonder will he appear on his list for the Seanad this time? There was no Act to intern Deputy Dillon, and no order to arrest Senator MacDermot the moment he arrived here.  I am surprised to see Deputy Dillon free, because if I said the things that he has said I would have been in jail long ago.  The Guards in Mountrath tried to put me in jail.  They had no case against me or I would be there.</P>
      <P>I want to ask that the Emergency Powers Order which prevents the division of land from taking place, be immediately lifted.  The Minister for Lands wrote me some time ago to say that there was not sufficient staff in the Land Commission to deal with the division of land.  How is it that there are thousands of well educated young men being forced to take the emigrant ship, not from Galway Bay or Cobh this time to take them to the greater Ireland beyond the Atlantic, but to take them from Dun Laoghaire and Rosslare to the land beyond the Irish Sea, the land of our traditional enemy, to help England in her war effort against Germany?  There is one thing that Germany did, and that was to rout the Jews out of their country. Until we rout the Jews out of this country it does not matter a hair's breadth what orders you make.  Where the bees are there is the honey, and where the Jews are there is the money. I do not propose to detain the House further.  I propose to vote against such Orders and actions, and I am doing so on Christian principles.  The Minister for Justice could not give me a straight answer a few moments ago. I am sorry that I interrupted him in the heat of the discussion.  Of course, one needs great patience to listen to what is going on.  I know very well that even the clergy in the Minister's constituency are up against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> Father Keane, the parish priest of Athleague, is up against him, and when the clergy are up against him surely it will be hard for any of us to support him.  I thank the Chair for allowing me to make my statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words concerning the revocation of traders' licences to which reference was made by Deputy Cosgrave and by Deputy Cogan.  There appears to be in the mind of Deputy Cosgrave, and also in the mind of Deputy Cogan, a misunderstanding in connection therewith. Apparently, they have the impression that the revocation of traders' <Col N="574" /> licences is intended to be an additional penalty imposed administratively over and above that inflicted by the justices by whom a trader has been convicted for some offence under a rationing or price control Order.  It is nothing of the kind.  The requirement that a trader should have a licence before dealing in particular commodities is an essential to the administration of any rationing scheme.  Licences are necessary for trading in a very large number of commodities which are in short supply, and the issue of those licences carried with it, and must carry with it, the power to withdraw them again.  The aim of rationing is to ensure that every person in the community will get an equal right to a fair share of the available supplies.  In administering our rationing scheme we have to work through our existing trade organisations, and have to ensure that these trade organisations work satisfactorily to achieve the primary aim of the rationing scheme. It is obvious that if the rationing scheme is jeopardised by reason of the inability or unwillingness of traders to conform to the regulations, then there rests upon the State either the obligation to devise some new method of distribution or to remedy the defects in the existing method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The withdrawal of a trader's licence is a direct consequence of the evidence produced in court, following on his conviction, that he cannot be trusted to distribute fairly, or at a fair price, supplies of goods that are scarce, and that have been given to him for distribution. It is designed to protect his customers.  It is not intended to be a penalty.  There is no desire on the part of the Department of Supplies to add to the penalties which the court considered it appropriate to inflict, but there is on the Department of Supplies an obligation to see that no section of the people, and no number of customers are left dependent for their supplies of essential goods upon a trader who has shown himself to be incapable of being trusted to sell those goods at a fair price, or to distribute them evenly amongst his customers. This power to withdraw licences has been used only in cases where there <Col N="575" /> was no doubt about the intention of the trader to break the law, to fleece his customers and to take from the poorer sections of the people supplies to which they were entitled for the purpose of selling them at excessive prices to richer customers.  The impression has been created by statements made on this matter that a very large number of traders have been put out of business by the withdrawal of licences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That view is arguable. I think the figures that I am going to give to the House will support the view.  There are 41,727 traders who have been licensed to sell tea and sugar.  Of these 41,727 traders, 1,290 have been convicted of offences under price control and rationing orders.  I think it is a matter of comment that of the total number of traders engaged in the sale of tea and sugar, more than 40,000 out of 41,727 have not been convicted of any such offence.  Of the 1,290 traders who have been convicted, licences were withdrawn in 31 cases. It is true that notice of intention to withdraw licences had been issued in a number of other cases.  I decided that it was desirable to wipe the slate clean and start again, because the only argument which had validity advanced in the past against the action taken by the Department in withdrawing these licences was that proper warning had not been given to traders that their conviction for offences under price control or rationing orders would involve this consequence.  I felt there was some truth in that, that at any rate traders did not appear to appreciate properly what the consequences to themselves might be.  I feel now that that situation cannot be said to exist in the future and that consequently we can decide that in the future any trader who is convicted of serious offences under these orders should and will lose his licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say this also: failure to keep records or the keeping of inaccurate records is not and should not be regarded as a trivial offence.  The traders who want to chisel a few <Col N="576" /> ounces of tea or sugar from their poorer customers in order to sell in the black market will fail to keep records or fake their records.  The natural cover-up for anybody engaged in black marketing activities is failure to keep records or the faking of records.  These records are an essential part of the machinery for controlling the distribution of these goods. Traders cannot get away with the excuse that they regard it as a purely technical matter, nor is failure to keep records or the keeping of inaccurate records to be regarded as a trivial offence.  There are a very large number of trades for the carrying on of which licences are required.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that the power to withdraw licences should not be exercisable unless it has been recommended by the court.  We could not rely on the court to determine the circumstances of such cases.  There are many traders who were convicted of offences under these Orders who would have lost their licences, but who were allowed to remain in business because they happened to be the only traders in isolated country districts, or because there were other circumstances relating to their trade which made it impossible for us to transfer their customers to other traders and the appropriate supplies along with them.  It would be impossible for a district justice to decide the administrative problems which would arise in connection with cases of that kind, and consequently it is, I think, undesirable that the power to decide whether a particular trader should or should not lose his licence, following his conviction for some such offence, should be exercisable by a district justice.  A district justice is neither in the position, nor is he the most suitable type of person to decide these questions.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if the amendment were adopted, it would apply to licences or permits which are required not merely for the carrying on of trade in tea and sugar, but a number of other commodities. I will give as an illustration the most obvious permit, with which all Deputies are familiar&mdash;that required for the operation of a motor car.  Permits for the operation of a motor car <Col N="577" /> were withdrawn for no other reason than that supplies of petrol could not be made available, and it was necessary to limit the number of cars on the road.  Clearly, that is not a matter for a district justice to decide.  Whoever has the responsibility of administering the available supplies of these goods must have the power to determine the purposes for which the supplies will be utilised.  If we get this year only half the quantity of petrol we got last year, there can be only half the number of cars operated, and somebody knowing all the facts must decide for what purpose permits to use cars will be given, and any permits in existence for cars utilisable for other purposes must be withdrawn.  There is no question of an offence in these cases, but it would, I think, be foolish to suggest in all such cases that appeal should be made to the district court for an order to withdraw somebody's permit.</P>
    <P>The impression has been created also that the action taken by the Government here is exceptionally harsh. It is not.  Deputies will have read in the newspapers that in other countries far more drastic treatment is meted out to those who commit these offences. In Italy, according to newspaper reports, it is the common practice, when a trader is convicted of overcharging or of some offence under rationing orders, to close his establishment in addition to putting the proprietor in prison.  In Germany, the penalty is death.  In Great Britain, the practice is somewhat the same as here and perhaps it will help to round off my remarks if I read a statement issued by the British Minister of Food and published in the <i>Sunday Times</i> last Sunday.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There will be always a few people who respond to temptation in time of scarcity, and, when we find them out, we are ruthless.  Every trader in food must be licensed, and, if he offends, we can withdraw his licence and put him out of business.  That is a great deterrent and substantially we have driven the black marketeer out of business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was found in Great Britain that the power to withdraw licences was a necessary deterrent to the development <Col N="578" /> of black-marketing and a means of ensuring compliance with the regulations necessary to produce effective rationing.  We have found the same here.  It would be impossible for any Minister for Supplies to carry on the rationing schemes in operation and exercise proper supervision over the sale of goods, unless he had that power to require traders in particular lines to have licences and the power to withdraw them, if his regulations were not complied with.  We could not, therefore, at all agree to a withdrawal of that power, and it would, I think, be impracticable to make that power exercisable only subject to the approval of a district justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quite consciously accuses the Labour Party of being responsible for the continuance of the hunger strike at the Curragh Camp.  This hunger strike has been in operation for the past 46 days.  A question about the hunger strike was submitted only on Wednesday last.  No question was submitted last week or in previous weeks about it.  Yet it did not bring about a termination of the hunger strike, and I can only characterise the statement of the Minister to-day as a deliberate perversion and a deliberate misrepresentation of the attitude of the Labour Party towards the hunger strikers. When I raised this matter by question on Wednesday last, and on the adjournment on Wednesday night, I made it perfectly clear that my purpose in raising the question was based on humanitarian and national grounds. <Col N="579" /> I sought to take no Party advantage out of the fact that three unfortunate men were undergoing the torture of a hunger strike at the Curragh Camp.  I appealed to the Minister then on humanitarian and national grounds to release these three men from the torture which they were undergoing, and I urged in favour of their release that these men had not been charged with any offence, had not been tried and were as guiltless as any other citizen in the absence of a trial and a charge against them.</P>
      <P>I have had, like other Deputies, a telegram from Seán Mac Cumhaill, who is undergoing the hunger strike at the Curragh Camp, in which he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Would be grateful for public contradiction to-day of G. Boland's statement that &lsquo;he was going to persist in trying to involve this country in war&rsquo;.  British and American occupation of our Six Northern Counties; England's enforced partition of Irish territory and her denial of our full sovereignty constitute the only and real menace of Irish peace and neutrality in present world struggle.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is a declaration by a man on hunger strike that he has no intention of trying to involve this country in war, a declaration that he does not desire to involve this country in war, a declaration on all fours with previous declarations which have been made by the Taoiseach when he protested against the occupation of any portion of our country by the armed forces of another country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is most unfair for the Minister to try to twist a plea for the release of these men, on humanitarian and national grounds, into an assertion that the Labour Party is responsible for the perpetuation of the hunger strike.  We deplore the fact that these men have, apparently, found it necessary to resort to hunger strike as a protest against their detention.  It is a challenge to statesmanship in this country if, in the face of the fact that three men have undertaken a hunger strike for 45 days, it is not possible to <Col N="580" /> find some ways and means of creating a situation in which that protest against food will not end in tragedy in a country where, unfortunately, tragedies arising out of political convulsions follow tragedies in another sence.</P>
    <P>I still hope some effort will be made to release these three men.  I think there is a moral obligation on the Government to ensure that they do not die.  I think it is a most unequal struggle for the Government, with all its powers and resources, on the one hand, to engage in a battle of death with these three helpless, emaciated and mentally tortured men on the other hand.  Government strength will reside in the release of these men. Government strength will not be weakened by the release of these men. There will be very little satisfaction to the Government, very little satisfaction to the nation, if these three unfortunate men, untried and uncharged, are allowed to pay with their lives for the protest they are making to-day.  I still urge the Government to find a way out of this <i>impasse</i>, to find a way of reconciling the State's authority with humanity, to find a way of avoiding these potential tragedies.</P>
    <P>I refuse to believe that it is beyond the wit of Irish statesmanship to find a means of bringing to an end that unequal struggle, a struggle which promises nothing but bitterness and disunity for the whole nation at a time when unity is much to be desired and bitterness and evil to be avoided.</P>
    <P>I want, Sir, on this Bill to call attention to the type of lopsided censorship which we have in this country, lopsided censorship which is used for the benefit of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Some time ago the Labour Party tendered an advertisement to the daily papers.  One statement in the advertisement was that, so far as the Labour Party was concerned, neutrality was the keystone of its policy.  Is there anything wrong in that?  Could anybody see anything wrong in that?  The Labour Party was entitled to have any policy as the keystone of its policy, but even that <Col N="581" /> simple statement of reaffirmation of our faith in neutrality was something which annoyed the censorship here and the Press were prohibited from publishing the statement.  An advertisement of that kind and a declaration of that kind could only have one effect, to make it perfectly clear, that so far as the Labour Party was concerned, it was anchored to the policy of neutrality.  Fianna Fáil wants to pretend to everybody that it alone is responsible for the maintenance of neutrality here&mdash;a hypocritical attitude which, of course, nobody believed.  But, even a statement of that simple character as was tendered by the Labour Party was something to annoy the Press Censor. It could not be published and the Minister stood over the non-publication of an advertisement of that kind.  Can anyone see any danger to neutrality in reaffirming our faith in neutrality?  Can anybody see any menace to established institutions here in a declaration of that kind?  Of course not.  The only person who could see it was the Minister, and the Minister was jealous that anybody should attempt to affirm greater faith in neutrality than Fianna Fáil pretended to have.</P>
    <P>Bear in mind the simple statement which was censored by the Press Censorship, which censorship was endorsed by the Minister, and compare that simple statement with what Fianna Fáil was allowed to get away with in the last election.  I would like to hear from the Taoiseach whether or not he stands for this.  I have here a copy of an advertisement, which appeared in the <i>Evening Mail</i> of Tuesday, 15th June: &ldquo;Slaughter, Famine and Anarchy! From their recorded statements that is the only policy the Labour and Fine Gael Parties can give you.&rdquo; Slaughter, famine and anarchy, say the four Fianna Fáil candidates for County Dublin, is the only policy the Labour and Fine Gael Parties can give you.  Is not that a scandalous declaration for any political party to make?</P>

      <P>When did the Labour Party stand for slaughter in this country?  When did the Labour Party advocate or stand for a policy of slaughter in this country?  I would like to hear the Fianna Fáil Deputies for any constituency trying to justify the statement that the Labour Party stands for slaughter.</P>

I hope there will be no repetition of that kind of running amok.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the question to which I have referred, there is another aspect of this Bill which we are asked to continue to-day, that is, its bearing on the wage standards of the workers. I want on behalf of this Party to record our protest against this Bill and against the parent Act because of the manner in which it has been used <Col N="583" /> to depress the standard of living of the workers of this country.  When the Bill was passed originally in 1939, it was never contemplated that the Emergency Powers Bill would be used for the purpose of keeping wages low. From the discussion on the Bill at that stage it will be clearly seen that the general purport of it was to give the Government powers to deal with threatened invasion, threatened aggression, and with any attempt which might be made to undermine the liberties of the people of this country. But we have lived to see the powers contained in that Act abused in a most scandalous manner and used to depress the standard of living of the workers of this country.</P>
    <P>Under the Emergency Powers Act certain wage Orders were made.  It was stated that the purpose of these Orders was to peg down wages to a certain level.  Of course, we had the assurance of the Minister for Finance that if wages were going to be controlled on the one hand, prices were going to be controlled on the other hand.  We can see, in a few moments, the extent to which prices have been controlled.  The case made at all events for the issue of these wage Orders&mdash;&ldquo;Low Wage Orders&rdquo; is a more applicable title&mdash;was that they were to keep the wages of workers low. The whole philosophy enshrined in these Orders appears to be based on a belief that low wages would bring prosperity and would avoid economic chaos here.  If you concede that low wages, 1939 levels of wages, no matter how prices move upwards, will make a country prosperous, then lower wages still, or no wages at all, will make a country still more prosperous.  The Government appear to have convinced themselves that the less wages you give the workers the more prosperity you will bring to the country.  That, of course, has been found to be an economic fallacy in every country in the world.</P>
    <P>If low wages could ever make Ireland prosperous, Ireland prior to 1914 would have been the most prosperous country in the world, because the wage <Col N="584" /> standards of Irish workers then were appallingly low.  Then the trade union movement found its strength in 1913 and gathered strength from year to year.  After that, those appallingly low wage standards were raised, until such time as Irish workers could say that they had, in a large measure, shaken off the poverty-stricken outlook which was characteristic of the Irish-employing classes before 1914.  It is now recognised in every enlightened country in the world that low wages are not a passport to prosperity.  Low wages can only mean making less money available for spending, which means that less goods are in demand. When less goods are in demand, there is less employment available and the emigrant ship proceeds to take from our shores tens of thousands of men and women who ought to be working here creating goods, if our wage earners had the financial coupons necessary to purchase goods which could be produced here.  I should like to know on what grounds these Orders can be justified.  Were there any unreasonable demands made for wage increases? If there were, we have not been told what these demands were and the sources from which these demands originated.  We can only conclude, therefore, in the absence of information that there were demands and as to the source of these demands, that in fact no unreasonable demands were made and that they are not able to disclose the source of the unreasonable demands because they know that no such demands were submitted.</P>
    <P>What is the present position?  In 1939, we gave the Government the Emergency Powers Act for the purpose of giving them powers to deal with any threatened invasion or threatened aggression from within or without against the liberties and established institutions of our people.  We have seen that Act utilised for the purpose of invading the homes of our workers when ostensibly it was passed to defend the homes of our workers.  It is being used for the purpose of depressing the standard of living of all classes of workers.  Since 1939, when that Act was passed, the prices of commodities have risen by no less than 60 per cent., <Col N="585" /> even according to the restricted yardstick used by the Department of Industry and Commerce to measure the increase in prices, while over the same period the wages of workers have increased on an average by not more than 10 per cent.  Is it not obvious to everybody that if, on the one hand, prices rise by 60 per cent. and, on the other hand, wages rise only by 10 per cent., that that is equivalent to slashing the wages of the workers, because it debases their standard of living? They can buy less food, less clothes, the little luxuries of life are now but a fond memory, and, generally speaking, the standard of living has been driven down substantially below that of pre-war years.  The Government must know that that is the only consequence of their low-wage policy and low-wage Orders, and yet they proceed to argue the matter as if they were bringing security and prosperity to the workers by giving them less food, less clothes, and less of the amenities of life.</P>
    <P>But there are other people who are treated very differently.  One has only to look at the balance sheets of public companies to realise the very substantial profits that are being made.  Take up the balance sheet of any great drapery firm and have a look at the profits made, profits made, in many cases, by selling pre-war goods at wartime prices.  If you take up die balance sheet of any public company and analyse it, you will find that, so far as those who invest money are concerned, they are allowed to get away with a good deal of swag.  When the banks came to the Minister for Finance and said: &ldquo;We want to increase our charges for keeping customers' accounts,&rdquo; there was not the slightest difficulty in the banks getting all the authority they wanted.  When the Electricity Supply Board came along and said: &ldquo;We must get more money for electricity,&rdquo; the Government said: &ldquo;Of course, by all means get more money for electricity.&rdquo;  When the Gas Company came along and said: &ldquo;We must get more money for our gas,&rdquo; the Government said: &ldquo;By all means, get more money for your gas.&rdquo; The bacon curers, as has been pointed out, are rolling in wealth since the war commenced.  Anybody reading the <Col N="586" /> newspapers last year could see that even if you engage in the very prosaic task of making boot laces in Ennis, apparently you can get away with a good deal of swag.  All these have been allowed to get away with well-filled bags of loot.  But when it comes to regulating the wages of workers, they are kept down; their standard of living is forced down as low as it is possible for the Government to do it, as low as they dare.  On the other hand, we find the well-to-do classes in this country permitted to get away with any swag they can under the eyes of the Government, and, judging by their inactivity, with the approbation of the Government.</P>
    <P>Let us take some examples of the effect of this treatment, of the effect of this low-wage policy, in respect of certain classes of workers.  Take for example&mdash;because they are typical of the position in every country&mdash;the county council road workers in Kildare. They had a wage of 32/- per week in 1943.  A wage of 30/- per week on the Shannon Scheme was roundly condemned by the Fianna Fáil Party in 1925, 1923 and 1927, when the cost of living was very much lower than it is to-day.  As I say, these workers in the County Kildare had 32/- per week. The county council sought to increase the wages to 37/6.  That was done for the purpose of getting a unanimous decision from all Parties in the House. That proposal came before the Minister for Local Government.  Of course, the Minister for Local Government crystallises in his outlook the whole wages policy of the Government, because he apparently considered that 37/6 per week was too high a wage for a road worker to enjoy.  That 37/6 would give him an inordinately high standard of living which he was not entitled to, and the Minister therefore would only sanction a wage of 35/- a week.  I wonder would any Deputy like to have to live on 35/- a week and keep a wife and four, five, or six children. Yet the Department of Local Government, acting in accordance with the low wage policy of the Government, thinks 35/- is the maximum wage which a county council road worker ought to have.  That 35/- per <Col N="587" /> week was only wrung out of the Government by frequent protests from the county council and numerous questions in this House.</P>
    <P>Take the example of the agricultural workers.  Everybody knows how vital it is to produce food to-day.  Everybody knows that the agricultural worker is the most vital worker in the country, because it is on his ability and skill that we rely for food for the maintenance of our human and cattle population.  What is the position?  The Government have appointed an Agricultural Wages Board, over which presides a chairman who is paid £750 a year by the Minister for Agriculture, and apparently the function of that chairman and that board is to keep agricultural wages as low as possible. I think everybody must realise the vital work which agricultural workers perform.  Acting under the directions of the chairman, who is just an appointee of the Minister, the maximum that the board will allow agricultural workers is 36/- a week, over the bulk of the country.  Will anybody try to justify a wage of 36/- a week?  Will any Minister who believes that wage is good enough, work out the quantity of food, clothes and rent an agricultural worker can pay out of it?  If any Minister does work it out, I suggest that he will get a result which will be condemned by every medical officer in the country.</P>
    <P>Anyone can visualise the standard of living possible for a family on such a low wage as 36/-, a sum which, I submit, is incapable of sustaining health and physical vigour in existing circumstances.  The best proof of the adverse reactions of the Government's low wage policy is to be found in the fact that, although certain commodities are rationed, the rich can use their coupons in purchasing these rationed commodities but, if you go into the homes of the workers, you will find an abundance of these coupons for drapery and other goods because wages are so low and money, in consequence, is so scarce, the workers are unable to purchase anything of that nature.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> Is it any wonder that large numbers of our people, as evidenced by the reports of the county medical officers of health, are suffering from malnutrition and actual poverty?  Tuberculosis, a disease which has an economic inspiration, and which is due in a large measure to bad housing and bad economic conditions, is growing apace. It is growing apace because of the fact that people cannot buy food or get decent shelter, because they are not permitted, through lack of money, to enjoy the amenities of life, which are the best bulwark against tuberculosis and which are much better than all the lectures in the world on the treatment of tuberculosis.  Malnutrition, poverty and tuberculosis abound to-day because of the fact that we have forced down the standard of living of the masses of the people to a level which makes it almost impossible to maintain bodily health.</P>
    <P>All this chaos stands so nakedly before us that we cannot, dispute its existence: While we must realise that economic chaos abounds, we stand idly by and appear to be quite content with a situation in which tens of thousands of the finest of our men and women seek the emigrant ship as a relief from the workhouse conditions at home.  In the past two years more than 100,000 of the flower of our manhood and the cream of our womanhood have been driven to Britain, there to seek the employment which they were once promised here.  Fianna Fáil believed they could cure unemployment at home.  I put it to those who may have a flair for examining economic conditions, would it not be much better to keep these people in some form of employment at home, earning a reasonable wage, instead of driving them into exile, to create wealth for another country, sending back here the financial coupons which give them a lien on Irish wealth, which they are unable to create at home?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to pursue that matter further.  I suggest that it is very much better to keep our people in Ireland earning good wages rather than permit them to be attracted to Britain to earn higher wages.  I suggest it is better to keep men and women earning good wages here, creating wealth which can be shared among the Irish people, rather than drive them into exile, through a system of low wages, to create wealth for another country, to earn in another country money which gives them a lien on Irish wealth, which they are not permitted to produce here.  No one can blame these people for leaving their homes, their wives and their children.  They are driven to do it by economic necessity.  We ought to alter a policy which compels a relatively undeveloped country to send to another country the best of its manhood and womanhood, creating wealth there, while the vital need at home is to create wealth which will determine the standard of living which the people in Ireland can enjoy.</P>
      <P>I think after four years' experience of this low wage policy, as exemplified through the Emergency Powers Act, the Government ought to recognise that the time is long overdue for lifting the present control of wages and providing for a reasonable increase in the standard of living of the workers. If we do not do that, then we had better continue to follow the road which leads to depression of the standard of living of the workers, which means that they must tighten their belts, have less food and clothes, and that the amenities of life usual in a civilised country are something beyond their reach.  It is because of the pursuance of the present low wage policy, the authority for which is the Emergency Powers Act, that we are opposed to that Act.  We are opposed to it on the ground that it is being used for the purpose of depressing the standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would be false to every principle <Col N="590" /> we hold dear if we were to give the Government authority to continue that Act, necessary though it may be in certain respects, if the Government continue to declare that it is their intention to use the Act to debase the standard of living of the masses of the people on whom we must rely if ever our liberties are threatened from any external sources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to the deletion of certain words issued by somebody else on behalf of a candidate. Deputy Norton spoke about the activities of the Censorship Department during the election.  I want to say right at the beginning that on the day the President authorised the election&mdash;indeed, before it&mdash;I gave instructions to the Controller of Censorship that nothing that any candidate said on an election platform, and no advertisement issued by a candidate, was to be interfered with in any way by the Censorship Department.  The Censor did not interfere with, or stop, anything said by a candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Censorship Department was instructed not to interfere with advertisements issued by candidates.  The particular advertisement to which Deputy Connolly alluded was issued by a person not known to the Controller of Censorship.  I was not, unfortunately, consulted on the matter, or I would have recognised that it was a person who was acting as agent for a particular candidate, namely, Mr. McCool.  When this question of censorship was raised in the Seanad I indicated, in reply to Senator Sir John Keane, that while we were not going to interfere with election propaganda of any description, we could not put the censorship out of commission <Col N="591" /> altogether, because we wanted to make sure, if we could, that there would be a State here for whatever Government was to come in to control, and that it would not be blown up altogether by subversive activities during the course of the election.  We did try to prevent activities of a treasonable nature being reported&mdash;propaganda of a treasonable nature being published in the Press.</P>
    <P>In regard to this particular advertisement, the Controller of Censorship thought that somebody whom he did not know was trying to couple with an appeal for funds for a candidate subversive propaganda against the State. The Government did not make any effort to hide the fact that eight men went on hunger strike in the Curragh of Kildare a few weeks before the election, for the purpose, as it seemed to us, of creating antagonism to the Government.  That information was issued officially by the Government, so that it was up to anybody who wanted to see these men released to go ahead and vote for some of the Parties opposed to the Government Party. During some years, we have had to take certain steps not only to protect this country's neutrality, but to defend ourselves against people who were making war against this Dáil and the Government.  I do not think that the three hunger strikers at the Curragh would thank Deputy Norton or Deputy Connolly for their interpretation of their attitude in the House to-day.  I am sorry the men are on hunger strike.  I do not approve of their policy, good, bad or indifferent, external or internal, but I think it is true to say that they would not deny that they deem themselves to be at war with England to-day, and that they insist on their right to make war on England or any other country in respect of which they so decide, without reference to Deputy Norton or the rest of us here, and without reference to the Irish people.  Unfortunately during the election campaign, a number of people thought they could use both the international and the internal situation to make propaganda for their own purposes against the Government. <Col N="592" /> Deputy Norton knows as well as any man here, that during my control of censorship my attitude has been to prevent neutrality being made an issue or a cause of division between our people.  Whenever some Fianna Fáil supporter down the country, in a fit of enthusiasm, declared that Fianna Fáil was the sole bulwark of neutrality, the Press were not allowed to publish the statement.  That was done until, in the fulfilment of the promise I gave in the Seanad, I could not deny a right to one candidate that we were giving to other candidates.  I regret that any Fianna Fáil candidate should claim that Fianna Fáil was the sole bulwark of neutrality, but I had to allow the statement, when made, to be published.  I do not believe that Fianna Fáil is the sole bulwark of neutrality.  Notwithstanding what we did to make neutrality possible, I do not believe that we could have sustained that policy but for the cooperation of the other Parties in its defence.</P>

      <P>It had not been banned.  This Labour advertisement was issued some time before the election&mdash;at the time I was speaking of, when Fianna Fáil people down the country were saying we were the sole bulwark of neutrality.  The Labour Party came along with this advertisement in connection, I think, with the million-shilling fund.  In it, they referred to their policy and asked for subscriptions.  The advertisement was not as Deputy Norton quoted it to-day. I am merely speaking from recollection but I will bet him 10 to 1 that I am right in my recollection.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said that we stopped an advertisement saying <Col N="593" /> that neutrality was the keystone of the Labour policy.  In my recollection, that is not correct.  What we did stop was an advertisement stating&mdash;the Deputy will remember this&mdash;that Labour was the keystone in the arch of neutrality. I pointed out to the Deputy that there was no keystone in this arch, that we were all in it together and that we should all be equal in it.  The advertisement was changed.  It finally ran this way: &ldquo;Neutrality is item No. 1 in the Labour programme.&rdquo;  That was passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there anything sinister or likely to embroil us in war in the advertisement, no matter what interpretation you put upon it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There was not.  It was in this friendly spirit I discussed the matter with Deputy Norton&mdash;that we were all keystones in the arch and that we all had to combine to defend it, that it was wrong, and bad policy for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or anybody else to say that neutrality was dependent on them alone.  I always believed that.  I believe it now, and I said that during the election campaign, as Deputy Connolly will vouch, I hated to see the advertisement issued by some fool of a publicity agent in County Dublin about slaughter, famine and anarchy being the policy of the other Parties.  I was down the country at the time.  Owing to our general policy during the election, the Controller of Censorship had to pass it, as he had to pass some other advertisements by the Labour Party that I hated to see, and that Fine Gael would hate to see going through.  The director of elections of the Fianna Fáil Party got some whimper that this advertisement was being issued in County Dublin.  He got on to the County Dublin people and told them to withdraw the advertisement.  The Deputy can check this up with the <i>Evening Mail.</i>  The County Dublin authorities got on to the other newspapers and stopped the advertisement. They got on to the <i>Evening Mail</i> and the <i>Evening Mail</i> said they were not going to stop it: that it had been passed by the Censor.  So far as anybody <Col N="594" /> with authority in Fianna Fáil could do, the utmost was done to stop that advertisement.</P>
      <P>It had, unfortunately, to he passed by Censor because owing to my general instructions to them that they were to stop nothing, it had to be passed. Now, if we had been stopping advertisements or speeches by political candidates in this election, there is one advertisement that should have been stopped.  That was an advertisement issued by the Labour Party on the day of the election.  I do not know that Deputy Norton is responsible for this, or that any authoritative persons in the Labour circle are responsible for this advertisement, but when we are talking about advertisements, let me say one thing:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, here in this country, in a very dangerous position.  We are trying our utmost to get what supplies we can through the troubled waters of the Atlantic to sustain our people during the war.  One of the things that has enabled us to get through these troubled waters is, as is well known to members of the Labour Party, that both belligerents recognise that we are honourably neutral, that we are not trying to help either one side or the other when our ships are on their lawful occasions in the Atlantic Ocean. Anybody who gives the impression to one belligerent or the other that we are not playing the game&mdash;that while we are pretending to bring in supplies from abroad, we are actually scouting for one or other of the belligerents&mdash;is doing a bad day's work for the country, and I think Deputy Norton himself will admit it. In that spirit.  I hope he, too, will take the opportunity of condemning on some occasion the hand that wrote the advertisement that appeared on the 22nd of June, the day of the election, which condemned the &ldquo;criminal conduct of the Fianna Fáil Government in sending brave men to their doom on the &lsquo;Irish Oak&rsquo;.&rdquo;  Deputy Norton and the other members of the Labour Party will admit that the &ldquo;Irish Oak&rdquo;, no matter by whom she was manned, behaved in a strictly neutral way before she was sunk, and was behaving in a strictly neutral way when she was <Col N="595" /> attacked by a belligerent submarine, and that that belligerent submarine had no right in international or moral law to sink her&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.  It was a criminal and cowardly act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Deputy saying that it was a criminal and cowardly act&mdash;an act in no way justified by anything the Irish Government did&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the present advertisement and I am raising it only in a friendly spirit.  I am not putting any responsibility on Deputy Norton, because I do not believe that if he sat down in cold blood, he would have written it or passed it.  I think the sooner we forget some things said by both sides in the election the better. We are here now, during this disastrous war, to try to get the country safely through and the Government cannot do it alone.  It has to have the co-operation of all Parties, and one of the things we have to make clear is that no one in this country stands for Irish ships or Irishmen interfering in this particular war.</P>
      <P>Now, apart altogether from this question of our internal situation, I think the Labour Party know perfectly well that the men who are interned have a policy of making war upon one of the belligerents.  They do not deny that, and I am perfectly certain that as soon as they see what Deputy Connolly said, they will deny the Deputies' denial.  They are proud of the fact that they are at war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They say they are at war with England, that they are engaged in war, and they justify their engagement in war with England by the fact that British troops are in occupation of certain of our counties.</P>
      <P>I disagree as much as they do with the British occupation of six of our North-Eastern counties.  I do not believe that our people in these counties should be involved in this war, but I do not believe in the I.R.A. attitude of making war on their forces at the moment.  As you know, we have declared our policy of trying to get a peaceful settlement of these difficulties between ourselves and the British.  We do not believe that the re-union of this country is going to be helped by getting involved in this war, or by attacking the British forces in the Six Counties or elsewhere during the course of this war.  We hoped that the development of the policy which was so successfully pursued over a number of years, and resulted in the freedom of 26 counties, would ultimately result in the freedom of the whole 32, bringing the six counties into union with this part of the country.  There is one other matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people would repudiate Deputy Connolly when he asked them to indicate in some way that they were prepared to accept the ordinary peaceful political method of settling their differences. <Col N="597" /> They are not only involved in war against the British, and proud of it, but involved in war against this State, and proud of it.  Deputy Connolly and other people should think of what happened in this country during the last number of years.  I propose to give a few reminders.  At the outbreak of the war, we interned some of these people in order to prevent them from getting us involved in the European catastrophe.  What happened?  A judge of the High Court released them and said we had no right, constitutionally, to hold them. We released them and what happened? Three weeks afterwards, the Magazine Fort was raided, and over a million rounds of ammunition were taken. That was no sport.  It was not peaceful political activity.  It was an act of war against this State.</P>
    <P>That was not the last of it.  We had great difficulty in rounding up that ammunition.  Some of it we did not get.  Fortunately, we got even more back over a period of years than was taken from the Magazine.  We got Magazine ammunition&mdash;the numbers, plus a little more.  But, over this last period of three years they have been carrying on active war against the State by shooting the servants of the State, the people paid to protect this country, and to create a situation in which we can meet here and discuss our differences.  There were seven members of the Gárda shot dead&mdash; murdered&mdash;in 1940, 1941, and 1942, and there were 18 attempted murders.  It is only the other day that one of these people who escaped&mdash;he was not released but escaped himself&mdash;was again on the wargath, and attempted to murder two or three other Gárdai not a hundred yards from our door outside. There is an active war by these people going on against this State, and I think the Labour Party are doing a very bad day's work in trying to ally themselves, or to depend in any way on the support of these particular people.</P>
    <P>I have no enmity against the men in the Curragh.  All I am sorry for is that these young men, men who are prepared to do 48 days without food, men prepared to spend three or four <Col N="598" /> years in an internment camp, are not fighting for a better cause, for the cause we all have at heart, or not fighting for it along proper lines.</P>
    <P>We know perfectly well that, if these people pursue a policy of making war on this State and of making war on Britain, what they are going to do is to create disruption internally and to get us involved in the major European catastrophe.  We do not want that.  I hope the young men on hunger strike will get off the hunger strike, that, generally speaking, all of them on the Curragh, will pull themselves together, that they will realise that no good can come to the country, and that no good can come to any good cause, social, economic or national, through their activities, in making war on this State or in doing anything that would get us into the European war.  If they pull themselves together, and give some sign that, if released, they will not take up arms again, nobody will be better pleased than members of the Government.  We regret, much more than any member of the Labour Party, the necessity for interning these people, because nearly every man on these benches fought for the cause that they say they have at heart.  We have the cause of the freedom and the independence of this country as much at heart&mdash;its social development, and its cultural development&mdash;as any man on the Curragh or on the Labour Benches.  All I say, both to the men on the Curragh and to any men on the Labour Benches who speak of their activities, is that, at the moment, they are doing a very bad day's work for the independence of this country.</P>

Later, when the matter was further pursued, the Minister found, in fact, that the Deputy was right and that the words were omitted.  Of course the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures could explain that to the House.  That is why there was a difference between what the Minister for Justice and the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures said.  The Minister for Justice got earlier information and it was not accurate.</P>

      <P>What I wanted to refer to was the question of censorship. In the election the censorship was only an incident.  It was only a momentary matter.  I want to say in respect to censorship that neither I nor my Party stand for any interference with the rights of this country <Col N="600" /> as a neutral.  We do not want anything to appear in any paper which would hinder or in any way hurt any action which this country was taking in pursuance of its own powers.  In connection with the domestic aspect of the censorship, I should very seriously appeal to the Government to take a wider view.  We are a comparatively young State as countries go.  I am afraid that the censorship which we have established here is a dangerous precedent in a State as young as ours, and whilst I do not really accuse the Government of wishing to sabotage or to throttle discussion, it might be done by others who may follow them.  It is a very dangerous precedent, and I ask Ministers to consider seriously whether the censorship could not be alleviated in the broadest interests of the country, especially in relation to domestic policy.  I have not time now to go into the way in which the newspapers are at present suffering.  If the newspapers are suffering from the domestic censorship, the ordinary citizen is suffering, too.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter in connection with Emergency Powers Order 152 that I want to mention.  The railway stock holders feel that they are labouring under a very legitimate grievance under that Order, as they have not been able to get publicity or to put their point of view before the public. They appealed to the Minister and got very little justice and, in fact, their claim has not been met.  When I say &ldquo;claim&rdquo;, I mean their claim to be heard.  These were the two matters that I wished to raise.  I ask the Minister in all seriousness to keep before him the fact that censorship here has a very dangerous aspect.</P>

      <P>We have been appealed to by the Labour Party to release the men who are on hunger strike.  A similar appeal was made on the 9th November, 1939, by the Parliamentary Labour Party.  The appeal was made to me and, on that occasion, I came to the House and made a statement. I think if I re-read it it will be as good as making a similar statement now.  I got special leave from the House then and I said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am grateful to the House for <Col N="601" /> giving me this opportunity of stating what the Government's attitude in regard to the prisoners at present on hunger strike is.  Last night I got a letter containing a copy of a resolution which was passed by the Parliamentary Labour Party.  As that Party is represented in this House, I felt it would be proper that I should give the Government's answer in the House rather than by letter.  I have perhaps a further reason, and that is that the prisoners in question are in imminent danger of death, and I thought, therefore, that I should give that reply at once, or at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government's attitude in this matter is this.  There are no means by which the Government can secure the safety of the people here except the powers of arrest and detention of those who are in a position to bring this country to disaster. The policy of the hunger strike is aimed at taking away these means from the Government, and once these means are taken away what is to happen is obvious.  You are going to have organisation to such an extent that the only way in which ultimately the supremacy of the people can be established is by arms.  We know perfectly well that if arms have to be used many lives are going to be lost, and that the only way that is left to prevent that from happening is to restrain&mdash;because that is what is being aimed at&mdash;those who are bent on courses which will undoubtedly lead to disaster.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We all know that there is a body in this country with arms at its disposal.  We know that in the last year....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was on the 9th November, 1939.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We know that in the last year its activities have taken a new turn, that the body has definitely proclaimed itself as entitled to exercise the powers of government here, to act in the name of our people, even to commit our people to war.  Now we are in a time of peril, we have a war being waged around us, the outcome of which no man can tell. We have seen already in this war <Col N="602" /> nations, comparatively large nations, losing their freedom.  Is the Government of this country to be deprived of the only power that it has to prevent things taking place here which are going, I firmly believe, if not prevented, to rob us of the independence which has been got, so far as this part of the country is concerned, and in so doing to rob us of the fruits of all the efforts that have been made for the last 25 years? That is what is at stake.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We do not want to see any Irishman die.  We do not want to be opposed to any group of Irishmen. We would wish, in this particular time of danger and anxiety, that every section of the people was with us, and heaven only knows before the end of this situation we may want every section to stand with us to try to maintain the rights of our people.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not then in any spirit of vindictiveness that we have approached the consideration of this question.  We have sat down and considered every alternative that was possible for us, and we see no alternative, because we have been placed in a position in which there is no alternative.  The alternatives we are forced to face are the alternatives of two evils, one to see men die that we do not want to see die if we can save them, the other, to permit them to bring the State and the community as a whole to disaster.  But they have put us in that position&mdash; it is not we who have done it&mdash;they have put us deliberately in that position. And I wish that one half of the efforts that are being made to try to get the Government to abdicate&mdash;because that is what it means &mdash;were used to induce these people to see reason and to see that, in this part of Ireland, every political body that wants to do so can go out and advocate any programme, with the single sole reservation that they must not resort to force in order to achieve their ends.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not want to argue in this case.  As I have said, the Government have been faced with the alter native of two evils.  We have had to <Col N="603" /> choose the lesser, and the lesser evil is to see men die rather than that the safety of the whole community should be endangered.  We do not wish them to die.  We would wish&mdash; Heaven knows I have prayed for it&mdash; that these men might change their minds, and that the people who are with them might change their minds, and realise what our obligations and our duties are.  If we let these men out, we are going immediately afterwards to have every single man we have tried to detain and restrain going on hunger strike.  Some of them have been detained in their own interest, because they have been subject to orders, and some of these orders might mean their death. It is in their interest, as well as in the interest of the community, that this restraint has been used; but we cannot use it if these men are let out and then immediately afterwards others go on hunger strike.  We have had that experience.  We are anxious to avoid what I would regard as a calamity, the calamity of death, if it can be avoided.  We let one man out after 30 days' hunger strike. What happened?  Next day, I think, half-a-dozen more went on hunger strike.  If we let these men out now we are going to have to face a hunger strike by the remaining prisoners, perhaps.  Unless it is at some stage decided by the Government that they will face the second evil, we cannot rule here, and not merely would we be abdicating as a Government, but we would be making it impossible for any other Government to govern.  These are the considerations which have determined the Government not to release the prisoners.  Therefore, the answer I have to give to the Labour Party is that we regret we cannot release them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I made that statement in the House, and it explains fully the considered policy behind it.  Within five or six days, I was informed that one of the men was actually dying, and that there was no chance of his recovery in any case.  It was a question of his dying, not alone <Col N="604" /> as a result of the hunger strike, but in physical agony unless an operation were performed, and, foolishly, as I see now, I urged upon my colleagues&mdash;I take full blame for it, because in the event it was very blameworthy&mdash;to have the man concerned transferred to a civil hospital.  He was transferred there, and got out of prison, and within a year he was engaged with others in an attack upon the Gárdaí, in which two of the Gárdaí were killed, and he and another of the party engaged in that shooting had to be executed.  That meant four deaths.  Later on, we had two more: Two men who died on hunger strike because we had, at some stage, to stand absolutely firm.</P>
    <P>Now, it has been one of the great regrets of my whole life, and will be until my death, that I allowed any consideration of any kind to get me to retract from the position I had taken up.  It was one of the biggest mistakes that I have made in my life and, as I have said, I will regret it until my death, because, had it not been for my action, there would have been only one death, whereas, in the event, there were four deaths and two&mdash;six deaths in all.  That is the position.  We cannot carry on here unless we have powers of internment, powers of restraint and detention.  It is absolutely necessary to have these powers.  If we had not these powers, then we could not govern, and we are going to have a situation which will involve us again in another civil war.</P>
    <P>That being the position, I can only state to everybody who comes to me that the last word on this has been said.  We have to maintain our right to restrain people.  If anybody goes on hunger strike, then we cannot let him go out as a result of that hunger strike. That is final.  I have got&mdash;and I hope that by my example other people may learn&mdash;a lesson which is enough to teach me for the rest of my life.  There are times when it is fatal, absolutely fatal, to give way to representations such as are being made at present.  Now, with the example before me, the example which I have <Col N="605" /> given, I have to say definitely, to prevent any other representations coming in, that we cannot release anybody who is on hunger strike.  That is definite and final.  Those who wish to save the lives of those men, if they have any influence with them, will tell them to get off that hunger strike.</P>
    <P>I should like very much to have time to meet Deputy Connolly's speech. Generally, I think most of us can agree with the attitude behind it, except perhaps one thing.  He speaks of the philosophy of force.  I know as well as he does that there are occasions on which people will feel justified in resorting to force.  Every one of us, as he has pointed out, has at one time or another resorted to force to right wrongs which we felt could be righted through no other method.  That is not now compatible here with the duties which a Government has to carry out. No Government in charge here can admit that right for any group of citizens.  It must be quite clear that that is so.  If any group of citizens goes out on that basis, some time or other to use force against the State, then the Government must try to stop it.  It must be stopped at the start, because otherwise it is going to mean a larger clash.  That is a situation which I anticipated goodness knows how many years ago.  It was because of that that I made certain statements which, at the time, were misunderstood and misrepresented.  Once there is an organised Government here, the nature of its office and its duties to the community, compels it to prevent any organisation arising which is going to use force for political ends within its territory.  I cannot see any way out of this.</P>
    <P>What was the right thing for us to do?  We have tried to do it on these benches.  The inspiring motive of a lot of the work we have done has been to try to get a basis of unity here, to get an authoritative headship for our nation.  Here is the only place where there can be such <Col N="606" /> a headship for the nation, and it can tolerate no rival.  By our Constitution, which was passed by the people&mdash;it is the people's Constitution&mdash;every section of the people is permitted to go out and advocate any policy it chooses. There is nobody being imprisoned or restrained at the present time because of his opinions.  Anybody can go out and say that he wants a Republic for Twenty-Six Counties, or for 32 Counties, or anything of that sort.  Nobody is against that.  What we have to resist is any group organising to say: &ldquo;We are going to achieve that object, by force, ourselves, irrespective of what the Parliament does.&rdquo;  If this Parliament were to decide to use force for the national ends, it would be within its right in doing so, but as long as it exists and claims to have rightful authority, as it does, based upon the will of the people, it cannot tolerate any other body setting out on its own with such an objective.  There must be some one headship.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution the whole position has been cleared in such a way that any body of citizens who want so to advocate can go out and say: &ldquo;Elect us.  Give us a majority, and the day we have a majority in the Dáil we are going to use force to try to bring back the Six Counties.&rdquo;  They can do that.  We do not think that that is the way it should be done, but there is nothing to prevent them from doing it.  If they have got a majority, and the people are prepared to adopt that method, they can do it.  But what we cannot permit them to do is to say: &ldquo;We do not recognise at all that Assembly or the representatives who have been duly elected by the people&rdquo;.  I do not need to pursue the matter.  I think our position is clear.  On the other question I repeat we cannot give way, on any consideration whatever, to the release of those men on hunger-strike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 25, to delete the words &ldquo;2nd day of September, 1944&rdquo;, and substitute the words &ldquo;1st day of April, 1944.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to afford an opportunity to the Government during the period from now until the 1st April next to take measures to deal, primarily, with the cost of living. Meantime, it will have the opportunity to review the extensive use of this Act. As I have said before, on many occasions, the Act was given vary generously, and its exercise should be <Col N="609" /> attended with meticulous care.  What is given generously ought to be accepted in that spirit.  The various criticisms that we have had to make on this measure have been ventilated in the House on many occasions.  They have ranged over the very extensive use made of it, and of the manner in which it was administered.  Generally, where decisions are taken, one might almost say star-chamber decisions, that interrupt the normal life of the people, these decisions should not be taken without due consideration being given to the interest concerned.  In our view very much greater co-operation could be got in the circumstances of the emergency if the Government were to approach the persons concerned whose interests were affected.  Where the commercial life of the community was being interfered with, or where industry was being regulated, it is likely that a more satisfactory method would have been adopted if there had been previous consultation with the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>Similarly, with regard to the use of the censorship.  In our view that matter would be more satisfactory if the people engaged in journalism in this country were taken into consultation in connection with the use of the censorship. There is no necessity for going into matters in detail, except to say that there is widespread dissatisfaction as regards the abuses that have taken place in the exercise of authority in connection with this measure.  I, accordingly, move to give the Government an opportunity of dealing with the matters that I have referred to, and, generally, of taking stock as regards the use of this measure. When that is done, there will be no hesitancy whatever, as far as I know, on the part of those who have supported the principle of this measure in extending it for 12 months or the period set out, that is, from the 1st April, 1944, to the 1st April, 1945, or whatever period of time may be necessary. I think I am interpreting the views of the House generally when I say that the House is satisfied that the Government must have exceptional powers during the emergency.  I think, <Col N="610" /> therefore, that we are entitled to ask that this power will be exercised in a way that will give due consideration to all the interests involved after legislation has been decreed as being passed by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the request embodied in the amendment is a reasonable one, namely, to shorten the life of the Act so as to enable the Government to review representations made by very many people in this country who consider themselves aggrieved by the operation of the various emergency measures.  It will also give the Government an opportunity of getting into consultation with the various sections of the community &mdash;agricultural, commercial, and other sections&mdash;which feel that they can give useful advice to it in regard to the administration of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is being asked to take all stages of this Bill in one day.  That is a rather unusual procedure, especially for a Bill of the importance that we are now discussing. It is fair to say, I think, that the House has not had a very full opportunity of discussing the Bill, or the manner in which the Government have exercised the powers conferred on them by the parent Act.  I think it is only reasonable, therefore, that the Government should provide an opportunity, earlier than the normal opportunity, which will not arise until September, 1944, for reviewing the actions of the Government in the use of their powers under the parent Act. I put it to the Taoiseach that he should consent to limit the operations of the present Act to the 1st April, 1944, so that we may have an earlier opportunity than would otherwise be available to us of reviewing the activities of the Government as regards the administration of the parent Act.  In the meantime, the Government will have all their powers, and ought not to object to a review of their activities at any time.  There will be no handicap imposed on the Government in the interval.  I think, having regard to the rather restricted character of the discussion on the main <Col N="611" /> measure, that it is, a very reasonable request, and I hope that the Taoiseach will see his way to accede to it.</P>

      <P>Naturally, I would like very much to meet any request coming from different sections of the House, such as the one that has been made, if it were possible to do so in reason.  There is hardly any doubt, I think, that the emergency is not going to be over in the sense in which we want it to be over, in which it is likely that either the Government would bring a resolution declaring it to be at an end, or that the two Houses would pass such a resolution within the time that is mentioned.  Now, it is not as if the House had no opportunity for reviewing the position except when a Bill like this comes before it.  Deputies must know, if they consult the debates, that there is probably no subject which has occupied the attention of the House during the emergency period as much as the exercise of these special powers.  The House, at any time, can bring in an annulling Order to have a discussion on any particular part of this measure.  I believe that it is very much better for the House to have a confined motion of that sort, because much closer attention is given to it than if you had a discussion on an omnibus motion which the House can always have on a Bill like this. There is also the opportunity for discussion on the Estimates, on the Estimate for my own Department, and on a number of other Estimates.  These will come up for discussion when the Dáil reassembles.  I think it is unreasonable to cut down the period from a year to six or seven months.  If you do that there is no reason why it should not be cut down to three months.  I think there is no need for this amendment. It is not, as I said before, as if no opportunity was being provided for the Dáil for discussion.  I do not like to appear to be resisting a request from different parts of the House.  I believe however, that it is not right that we should have to bring in those omnibus resolutions at particular <Col N="612" /> times.  I am afraid that I will have to resist the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We are being asked to consider the power that we have of moving an annulling Order under this measure.  What does that mean?  It means that something that has been the law for a fortnight, three weeks or perhaps a month, comes up here for consideration.  That is a very different situation from bringing in a measure and passing it into law.  Up to 1932 it was customary, except in special circumstances which were envisaged by the Act passed in 1931, when tariffs were to be imposed, to have resolutions brought before the House by the Minister for Finance.  A very different situation arose in 1932.  We got this new method of decree, by the Government. When the decree was passed it became law, and the Government could wait for six months before bringing in the necessary legislation to make it the law.  The decree, however, having been in operation for six months, was the statute law of the country during that period.  The same thing applies here.  We are to be presented with a <i>fait accompli</i>, and then asked to be satisfied with negativing that.  I cannot accept that explanation.  It is merely an excuse&mdash;saying that we have the opportunity of doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case that I put is this: (1) the cost of living has risen in this country out of all proportion to what ought to have taken place if there had been the necessary attention paid to it; and (2) the powers which were conferred on the Government were for the emergency and to deal with emergency problems to deal with a situation in which ample opportunity would not be afforded to the Government for introducing legislation.  One can quite conceive that during the period of an adjournment, if that adjournment were for two or three months, it might be necessary to bring in decrees which would otherwise be brought before the <Col N="613" /> House, but from the very commencement of the operation of these measures, we were presented with a pile of legislation the like of which would not be introduced if it were not for this power being there.  I consider that the power has been abused.  It has been exercised far more extensively than it ought to have been. There would have been a greater respect for the legislation had it been introduced in the House and dealt with in the House.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, having regard to the generous disposition on the part of the House in respect of giving this measure, there ought to be at least evidence on the part of the Government that there will be no abuse of these powers, that they will be used only when it is necessary to use them and that the ordinary practice of introducing measures into the House will be adhered to.  It would be in the interests of the legislation itself.  Let me take one particular instance which occurred here about 12 months ago. On a given day, we were presented with a situation in which restrictions were imposed on the sale of drapery goods.  That decree was probably 24 or 48 hours in existence, when it was amended.  There was a demonstration in the City of Dublin against the proposal.  These things are most objectionable to people who think that, in a time of crisis like this, it should not be necessary to stage a public demonstration of disapproval in connection with a matter of that sort.</P>
    <P>What happened in England when they had to face a similar position? They called in wholesalers, retailers, and industrialists, and said to them: &ldquo;There is the problem.  We want you to settle it.  If you cannot do it, we will have to do it.&rdquo; They told them what they wanted.  There was no necessity for the precipitate action which characterised our treatment of the problem.  The matter was settled in a satisfactory manner in England, and, in my view, proposals for regulating and regimenting a trade of that sort ought to have been introduced in the House and dealt with in the <Col N="614" /> House.  There would not have been that disturbance, that interruption of business, and that uneasiness of mind which affected so many men who had committed themselves to huge borrowings in order to stock their shops, by reason of a decree being put in force of which they had had no notice. I do not think this is an unreasonable request.  We are taking four months off the period, and asking for greater co-operation on the part of the Government in connection with the regulation of business and the introduction of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I am to gather from Deputy Cosgrave's remarks that he is seriously proposing that the rationing of drapery goods should have been the subject of ordinary legislation.  That is what he said, and I ask Deputies to try to imagine what would have happened if we announced our intention to pass legislation, which would become operative a month or two months hence, for the rationing of drapery goods or any other non-perishable product.  Do they think it would have been possible to prevent the complete exhaustion of stocks, to prevent a rush upon the shops during that period which would have completely disorganised sales for months and years to come?  That would have happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely, Deputy Cosgrave appreciates that when it becomes necessary to ration or control the distribution of some non-perishable product, it must be done without notice, that a control has to be brought into operation which may be modified subsequently.  All our controls were modified subsequently-following consultation with the interested parties, but it is inconceivable that we should go to the people directly interested and say: &ldquo;We are giving you warning that in a week's or a month's time we are going to impose these controls, and you have all that period in which to forestall the results which the Government wants to secure.&rdquo;  That would not be a serious way of doing the nation's business.  I am quite certain that if <Col N="615" /> the Government had attempted to introduce the rationing of drapery goods in that manner, members of the Fine Gael Party and other Parties in the House would have denounced them, and rightly denounced them, for having approached the problems in an incompetent manner and made a mess of it.</P>
    <P>We got the control into operation. I announced on the wireless the coming into operation of a rationing system the next day.  I announced that any parties, whether representatives of manufacturers, distributors or any other class affected by the Order, who wished to make representations concerning its provisions were welcome to make such representations.  There was no difficulty about having these consultations after the control had been brought into effect.  We recognised that modifications would become inevitable following consultation, and modifications were made following consultation when they appeared necessary and desirable.  I think it is entirely incorrect to say that in any other country they gave notice in advance of intention to ration drapery goods or non-perishable goods of that kind. In Australia, I read in the Press, they actually closed the shops by order for several days, so that there could be none of the forestalling which did to some extent occur here.</P>
    <P>Orders had to be printed and instructions had to be given to a large number of officials, and inevitably rumours leaked out that rationing was coming.  Everybody knows what happened. There were queues outside every shop.  People were rushing to buy, and those who had long purses were able to forestall the introduction of the scheme to some extent; but what occurred was insignificant in relation to what would have occurred if we came here with proposals for legislation to be discussed on Second Reading, on Committee Stage, on Report Stage, and then to be sent to the Seanad and enacted after all that process had been completed, with everybody knowing it was coming.  I do not think it can be seriously suggested <Col N="616" /> that that would have been the right way to do the thing.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is frequently made here that there is an absence of consultation between the Department of Supplies and Industry and Commerce and business interests, whether manufacturing or distributing.  That is entirely incorrect.  The standard complaint made to me by the heads of business concerns is that they have to spend far too much of their time attending conferences in the Department either as members of committees advising on particular matters, or at conferences called to discuss particular problems.  These conferences are held regularly.  There may be, and frequently is, complaint by individuals that the advice given by particular interests is not acted on, but that is an entirely different matter.  These manufacturers, industrialists and distributors naturally give the advice in closest accordance with their own interests, but we have to consider a wider interest than theirs, and it is frequently impossible to take their advice; but there is no serious complaint voiced by any section of the community that there is not full and ample opportunity given to them for consultation.  If the Deputy will make inquiries, either amongst the distributive and manufacturing trades, or amongst the representatives of the workers, he will find that in relation to all these Orders brought into force from time to time, there is full and frequently protracted consultation whenever it is possible and before the Orders are made.</P>
    <P>The only other point I want to refer to is in connection with Deputy Cosgrave's reference to prices.  Prices have risen.  It is a preposterous suggestion that there is any action which we could have taken which would have prevented a rise in prices.  There is published periodically in official statistics published and made available to the Deputy an index of import prices. That index shows that the average cost of imported goods has risen since 1939 by 150 per cent.</P>
    <P>To the knowledge of every Deputy <Col N="617" /> here, the prices of agricultural produce have also risen by about 80 per cent.  These increases in the cost of imported goods and in the cost of all home-produced foodstuffs have inevitably resulted in a rise in the cost of living, a rise in the price of goods sold in shops.  We have to try to check that rise as best we can.  It was impossible to do so in the early months of the war.  There has been no appreciable increase in the cost-of-living index for the past nine months, which would suggest that the forces which operated in the initial period to force prices upwards have spent themselves or have been checked.  I do not say there never will be another rise in the cost-of-living index, but for the time being these forces have been arrested, and the cost-of-living index has, in fact, been stationary for the past nine months.  But it would have been completely out of the question for us to hope to prevent any increase in the cost of living during the war.  Prices have risen in every war in every country.  The rise in the cost of living has been off-set in some countries by heavy subsidisation of food prices.  We have been able to do that only on a limited scale, but we are doing it to the extent of several millions a year. It is true that to that extent there has been a rise&mdash;a rise, however, which is attributable mainly to causes outside our control.  In so far as it was due to causes within our control, it has been checked and, in fact, arrested for some considerable time.</P>

Nothing could have been easier than, having made these arrangements, to bring in a Bill.  It could be agreed by us in a night, passed in the Seanad the same day&mdash; no objection or no interference of any sort or kind.  Why was not there consultation prior to it?  That is the only thing I am looking for.  In connection with these matters which affect business, employment and people's livelihood there ought to be prior consultation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Cosgrave's amendment.  I do so because of a statement issued within the last ten days, apparently emanating from the Department, with regard to the withdrawal of tea and sugar licences.  Tea and sugar licences that were withdrawn are to be restored, up to the 1st July, and in connection with any offences thereafter, the law will be enforced for the duration.  I was rather amazed this morning to hear what the Minister said with regard to the withdrawal of tea and sugar licences.  He mentioned how humane he was when one considered the penalties inflicted in other countries, such as sentence of death.  I would like the Minister to tell the House the difference between sentencing a man to death and taking away his means of livelihood, that had, perhaps, been built up by his family over three or four generations, and throwing himself, his wife and family and his employees on the roadside, with no opportunity of earning a livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree, and it has been admitted from this side of the House, that there is a necessity for this Bill. I fully appreciate the great difficulty there must be in equitably enforcing it.  I appreciate all the obstacles and difficulties, but there are things that seem to me completely inequitable and unjustifiable.  Take for example the case of a shopkeeper who is prosecuted for selling one tin of milk at ½d. over the fixed price and who then <Col N="620" /> gets notice of the withdrawal of his tea and sugar licence.  That has no relation at all to the offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It never happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister deny that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It never happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not indulge in unparliamentary language.  That has happened.  All that the Minister has to do is to look up the records.  I know people to whom it happened. That is the reason why I want to emphasise the importance of getting an undertaking from the Minister that, if he is going to enforce this measure for 12 months, in the meantime an opportunity will be given, if a crisis arises with regard to the withdrawal of these licences.  I approve of the withdrawal in appropriate cases, but I strongly object to withdrawal in inappropriate cases.  I think this thing should be dealt with in the Department by officials of some considerable experience and I think, in that connection, it would be wise to have a committee in the Department with a business man at its head to advise the officers who are unacquainted with the difficulties of business.  Surely such men can be got.  There are plenty of honest men in this country, thousands of them.  I think it would be a wise thing to have some business man, or two or three if the Minister thought necessary, to advise the officers on the facts of a given case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also emphasised to-day the necessity of keeping the right to withdraw tea and sugar licences because the district justice would not be acquainted with all the relevant facts with regard to the distribution of goods in a given area.  Are not these cases heard locally?  Are not the witnesses local?  Could not the officer of the Department who is giving evidence instruct the solicitor appearing for the Department to indicate to the district <Col N="621" /> justice the position with regard to the distribution of goods and whether any local hardship would be imposed in a given case?  I think it would be better for the administration of the Department&mdash;I put forward this advice only to be helpful to the Minister&mdash;that politics and Deputies should be kept out of it.  When such cases occur. Deputies are inundated with letters to make representations to the Minister to get the matter settled.  Would it not be much better that there should be an independent tribunal, that the district justice should impose the appropriate penalty?</P>
    <P>The officer of the Department who gives evidence could instruct the solicitor to say whether or not in the circumstances, if the licence were withdrawn, there were alternative means of distributing the goods.  I would like that this thing should be lifted entirely out of the arena of politics, that Deputies should not be brought into it. The Minister referred to the keeping of forms.  That is essential, but surely there are very many trivial cases coming before the Department concerning some illiterate man or woman keeping a little shop, without assistance, and who have a limited number of registered customers.  The complaint was that, if they had not this power, people would not get their tea ration. The people who have registered for tea have a very simple remedy.  They can write to the Department if they are not getting their tea ration.</P>

It is true that I moved a formal motion to allow a few minutes, if required, for an amendment which was to be put in. If we are to go on like this, it will be found that many Deputies were left under a misapprehension <Col N="622" /> with regard to the work here to-day.  Staffs and so on have been given their orders on the basis that the business was to conclude at 2 o'clock.  I do not know whether we are now to have a continued full dress debate all day.</P>

      <P>This is a simple matter. It is a question whether we should have this automatically brought up for reconsideration again on the 1st April.  I do not think a case really has been made for that, because every single question can be raised here individually in the House.  I think if we go over the debates here we will find that no subject has occupied the attention of the House so much as this question of Orders made under this measure.  It is a question whether the Government are, in principle, to get this power or not, I take it that that is the position. If it is, the question is whether next April we are to have a discussion of the whole thing all over again.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has reminded me that motions for the annulment of these Orders get priority in the Dáil.  Therefore, I do not think that any case has been made for this amendment.</P>

      <P>This is an Emergency Powers Bill, and its purpose is to give the Government power to protect the nation and its citizens in any situation which may confront them during the currency of the declared emergency period.  I should like to direct the Taoiseach's attention to the position of our nationals who are at present employed <Col N="625" /> in Great Britain.  As the Taoiscach knows, our citizens there, under British legislation, are liable to be conscripted into the British armed forces, notwithstanding the fact that under our laws they have separate Irish citizenship.  Our citizens in that respect are in an entirely different position to the citizens of any other independent country.  For instance, if a Dane is domiciled in Britain, he cannot be conscripted under international law.  If a Belgian is in Britain, he cannot be conscripted into Britain's armed forces.

However, I am not raising that issue; I am saying that under the Act the Taoiseach and the Government have certain responsibilities, one of which is to protect the rights and liberties of our citizens, once they are our citizens, no matter where they may be. I say that they are in Britain and they are being conscripted and not being treated the same as citizens of other independent countries.  I want the Taoiseach to take energetic steps to bring to the notice of the British Government that this being an independent <Col N="627" /> State, our citizens, being Irish, are entitled to enjoy the same liberty and immunity from conscription as the citizens of every other free country in the world who happen to be domiciled iu Britain in certain circumstances.

Arrangements have been in existence since March, 1941, whereby men enlisted for the duration of the present emergency and Reservists on permanent service may be granted agricultural leave on the basis of one month for sowing operations and one month for harvesting operations, and are issued with free return travelling vouchers to their home addresses or places of employment.
