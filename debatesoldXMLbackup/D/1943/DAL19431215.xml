    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Manufacture of Superphosphate.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Scientific Research Bureau has given consideration to the possibility of manufacturing superphosphate without the use of sulphuric acid; and whether, in view of the article by Mr. P.S. Syme in the <i>New Zealand Journal of Agriculture,</i> August 15th, 1942, on the manufacture, use and advantages of serpentine phosphate, any consideration has been given by the Bureau to the production here of this new type of fertiliser, having regard to the fact that we have the necessary raw material, namely, slippery rock or soap rock containing silicate of magnesia for admixture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Superphosphate is a water-soluble phosphatic fertiliser which is normally manufactured by the treatment of phosphate rock with sulphuric acid.  A concentrated superphosphate is made in the United States by the use of phosphoric acid in place of sulphuric acid, and the Bureau has under examination the question of such a process being operated here. Concentrated superphosphate possesses a much higher soluble phosphate content than ordinary superphosphate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should, perhaps, explain that in phosphatic fertilisers the phosphate may be soluble in water or in an aqueous solution of citric acid.  The phosphate present in many mineral <Col N="812" /> phosphates has to be converted to one or other of the soluble forms before it can be readily assimilated by plants. Phosphates which are citric-soluble are found to respond to the action of certain natural acids present in the soil. Both types have been found satisfactory in this country, but the water-soluble class have been preferred particularly for tillage crops.</P>
    <P>Serpentine superphosphate is a fertiliser containing phosphate in the citric-soluble form.  Other examples of such fertilisers are basic slag, certain forms of ground mineral phosphate and mineral phosphates which have been subjected to certain special treatments. Citric-soluble phosphates are held by some people to have an advantage over the water-soluble type in soils where there is a tendency for the phosphate to be &ldquo;fixed,&rdquo; that is, rendered unavailable to plants when applied in the soluble form.</P>
    <P>Serpentine superphosphate is the product obtained by mixing one part of ground serpentine with three parts of freshly-made superphosphate.  Serpentine is a mineral composed mainly of magnesia and silica.  The Bureau has not examined the possibility of the manufacture here of this type of fertiliser, and has no evidence that the use of such a material in this country would have any advantage over ordinary superphosphate.  The investigations carried out by the Bureau have, however, included laboratory experiments on the treatment of Clare phosphate with magnesia and silica.  Serpentine superphosphate is a reverted superphosphate, that is, one in which most of the water-soluble phosphate has been converted to the citric-soluble form.  As already explained, this reduced solubility is regarded as an advantage with certain soils.  It contains the magnesium and silica of the original serpentine, and its beneficial action has also been attributed in part to the presence of these and of traces of other elements such as cobalt, which is considered valuable on particular soils in New Zealand.  Inasmuch as serpentine contains no phosphate, the phosphate content of serpentine superphosphate is reduced as compared with <Col N="813" /> superphosphate according to the amount of serpentine added, and to this extent it must be considered largely as a diluent rather than an addition by way of a manurial ingredient.</P>
    <P>The use of serpentine superphosphate was developed mainly in the U.S.S.R. and New Zealand.  The primary object in using this particular fertiliser is not clear from the literature.  It is said to be in a better mechanical condition than superphosphate but, as phosphates have been in short supply in New Zealand, part of the object may have been to ensure better distribution of the available supplies.</P>
    <P>The Bureau's investigations in regard to phosphatic fertilisers have been mainly directed towards converting the insoluble phosphate present in Clare phosphate to the citric-soluble form.  In this work, attention has been concentrated on the processes which appeared the most suitable to our conditions from the information available in regard to developments in other countries.  The investigations have included experiments on a semi-technical scale on the heating of the rock alone, or with sodium carbonate, or lime.  These experiments have shown that a product with a high degree of citric solubility can be obtained by treating ground Clare phosphate rock with sodium carbonate at a sufficiently high temperature. Consideration has also been given to investigating the merits of this process on a commercial scale, but as this would involve the allocation to experimental work of a large proportion of the very limited supplies of Clare phosphate available, it was decided that this part of the investigation should be postponed until the supply position improved, or until the fertilising value of the experimental material was confirmed by field trials.</P>
    <P>The whole matter of the most suitable type of phosphatic fertiliser for use here in present circumstances is being actively pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated that it appeared to the Scientific Research <Col N="814" /> Bureau that the primary object in using this fertiliser was not clearly set out in the literature.  Surely the Taoiseach and the members of the Research Bureau have studied the literature.  It is clearly set out that the object is to prevent the fixation of soils with a high content of iron and aluminium.  That occurs in many cases of acid soil.  It would have the effect of stretching out the phosphate that is added in the way of artificial manure and that is, to a large extent, not recoverable by the plant where fixation occurs.  Fixation does not occur in citric form and the purpose is to convert the phosphate from water-soluble to citric-soluble form.  That is the whole purpose in adding silicate of magnesia.  Our peculiar problem is that we are suffering from an acute shortage of the raw material of superphosphate. Will the Taoiseach have the matter further examined and have field experiments carried out as to the advantages of this superphosphate? Even in the present issue of the <i>Scottish Journal of Agriculture,</i> there is a very long article on this whole question of the manufacture of superphosphate and its advantages.  Will the Taoiseach see that we are alive to this problem and that scientific discoveries of this nature will be made available to our farmers at the earliest opportunity?</P>

      <P>As I have told the Deputy, this whole question of fertilisers is being actively pursued.  As regards literature, I myself took pains to get the particular article referred to by the Deputy as I thought I would get something about manufacture in it. In the whole article there is only a passing reference to pastures, and there is nothing in it about manufacture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The representations referred to by the Deputy have been under consideration, but it will be realised that these cannot be dealt with as an isolated factor. They must be considered in relation to the general problem of Government commitments and responsibilities in regard not only to the public services but also to other sections of the community and to the taxable capacity of the country.  When the investigation of these matters has been completed, no time will be lost, I can assure the Deputy, in announcing a decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, I understood from the concluding speech of the Minister for Finance on his Estimate recently that he expressed the hope that he would be in a position to announce a decision on these representations at an early date.  Bearing that in mind, can the Parliamentary Secretary say whether there is any likelihood that a decision will be reached before Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the amount of time devoted to this problem when the Minister's Estimate was being discussed in the Dáil only a short time ago, and the statement made by the Minister, I think I cannot add anything to what he said on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement was made about three or four weeks ago, the belief then being that the Minister would be in a position to announce a decision shortly.  His decision affects large numbers of people earning £1, £2 and £3 a week who cannot live on that wage having regard to the present high cost of living.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary hold out any hope that a favourable decision on the representations made will be announced before Christmas?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered very fully the question of postponing the recent increases in electricity charges before finally deciding the matter.  I may say that the increase allowed is insufficient to recover in full the increased costs falling on the Electricity Supply Board. The increase in electricity charges permitted to date, which represents 20 per cent. on pre-war charges, cannot be regarded as unreasonable having regard to prevailing circumstances and the increases which have taken place in the cost of other commodities and services.</P>
      <P>I decided that I would not be justified in refusing the recent application of the Electricity Supply Board for an increase in charges in view of the consequences of such refusal on the general position of the board.

      <P>I am aware of a shortage of leather for boot and shoe repairs, and representations have been made to me in the matter by boot repairers. I have had the position fully investigated and have now decided to control the distribution of leather to wholesale merchants on a quota basis. Arrangements are being made to introduce the quota system in the near future.  Steps are also being taken to prohibit the diversion to boot factories of leather intended for the repair trade.  Supplies of leather, which should be reasonably adequate to meet the needs of the repair trade, will be allocated to wholesale leather merchants for distribution to their retail customers.  It is anticipated that these arrangements will remedy the difficulties which now exist, but the position will be kept under review.</P>
      <P>I have received no general complaints of a shortage in the repair trade of materials other than leather.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the difficulty in importing component parts, there is a very substantial reduction in the number of shotgun cartridges produced by Irish Metal Industries, Limited, <Col N="825" /> Galway, who are, however, distributing the supplies available to ammunition dealers on the basis of these dealers' purchases in 1941.  Ammunition dealers have been requested to have regard to the number of cartridges formerly purchased by shotgun licensees, in the distribution of their limited supply of cartridges to their customers.  It should be possible, therefore, for shotgun licensees generally to obtain a proportion of the number of cartridges purchased by them in preceding years.</P>
      <P>I have decided that the difficulty and expense of administering a scheme of rationing cartridges, so that each shotgun licensee would receive the same number of cartridges, would not be justified.</P>

      <P>Men with small I.R.A. pensions and British pensions are not debarred from signing the register at employment exchanges nor is it the position that such men cannot get work on employment schemes.  The area from which men for such schemes are to be recruited is specified by the employing authority and in the submission of men from that area, which so far as they are available is confined to recipients of unemployment assistance, the rate of unemployment assistance payable is the determining factor in the order of their submission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary states that the rate of unemployment assistance payable is the qualifying test for employment.  In view of the fact that the people referred to in the question lose their priority because of their pension, how does he say they are not debarred? The people concerned, who are receiving 5/- or 6/- a week in pension, cannot get anything like the maximum amount of unemployment assistance.  In many cases their pensions debar them from any unemployment assistance at all.  How can they qualify for work then?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>

      <P>My Department has availed itself of every suitable opportunity to impress upon the responsible local authorities the desirability of fixing adequate maintenance rates and clothing allowances in respect of boarded-out children, and has also consistently favoured a policy of placing destitute children, suitable for being boarded out, in rural foster-homes in preference to retaining them in institutions.  The services in respect of which the State and local authorities make payments on a <i>per capita</i> basis to the authorities of industrial schools include the education and training of children sent to such schools.  Teachers are employed and paid for that purpose, and books and other educational requisites are supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Boarded-out children, on the other hand, are taught in the local national schools, and books, etc., and any educational requisites for which charges are necessary are met by the local authorities.  The services covered by the weekly or monthly payments in <Col N="830" /> industrial schools and in foster homes are, therefore, not quite analogous.</P>
    <P>In recent years large numbers of children were sent to industrial schools on the ground that their parents were unable to support them.  Local authorities have been advised to have the circumstances of such parents reviewed periodically, so that where the continued detention of children on the ground of poverty of the parents is found to be no longer warranted, steps may be taken to secure their discharge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is the Minister aware that district justices now complain that there is no room in the industrial schools, and so they are unable to send delinquent children who clearly require institutional treatment into these institutions? Would it not be desirable, in view of that new development, that the Minister should again advise local authorities that where they can get a good family to take destitute children in, they should be prepared to pay the foster parents as much as they are prepared to pay the institution, and thus provide a family background rather than institutional treatment when there are no special circumstances surrounding the children except the loss of their parents or extreme poverty?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister have a circular issued to the local authorities pointing out that the capacity of the industrial schools is exhausted, and that this is an additional reason for renewing their efforts to get good families to take the children in by increasing money payments to foster parents?  I am convinced that a very small additional sum would get 70 or 80 per cent. of the children taken into decent homes.  There are plenty of good foster parents if the local authority would give anything like what they give to the institutions. Would the Minister consider doing something?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state what the present position is regarding the approved scheme of non-municipal housing schemes in various towns and villages in West Cork, such as Courtmacsherry, Timoleague, Ballineen, Dunmanway, Roscarbery, Drimoleague, Bantry, and Ballydehob; and whether he will arrange with the <Col N="832" /> county manager to have all land for such schemes fenced without delay, and all other preparatory work completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately four acres of land for the crection of 50 cottages in towns and villages in the West Cork area were compulsorily acquired by the local authority and compensation determined.  Plans and other documents were first submitted to the Department in 1940.  These were found to require extensive revision, especially the layout plans, from which contours and details of sewer and water services were omitted.  They were returned for revision in December, 1940.  The employment of a temporary draftsman to assist in the preparation of the plans was authorised in September, 1941.  In October, 1942, the engineer reported that pressure of other work and shortage of petrol was delaying the preparation of the plans. Completed documents for the towns of Courtmacsherry, Roscarbery, Timoleague, Ballineen and Dunmanway were received in May last.  Modifications were deemed necessary, and details thereof were submitted to the local authority on the 4th August last. Recently at the request of the local authority's engineer an inspector of the Department visited the area and discussed the plans and other documents relating to these areas.  The preparation of plans for Ballydehob has been deferred pending a survey of the site.  Documents for one of the sites at Bantry cannot be finally prepared until levels for a sewer extension have been ascertained.  There do not appear to be any proposals before my Department in respect of Drimoleague.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained to the Deputy in November, 1941, in reply to his question in regard to this and other roads in Cork County that the acute effect of the emergency on the revenue of the Road Fund rendered it necessary to discontinue the making of grants for the improvement of main roads.  There has been no change in that position so that a grant for the reconstruction of the Drimoleague Road cannot be considered.  No representations have been received from the local authority as to the present condition of the road.  The grant from the Road Fund was intended for the improvement, as distinct from the repair and maintenance of the road, and the fact that a grant for improvement cannot be made <Col N="834" /> does not affect the responsibility of the county council for the maintenance of the road.</P>

I am aware that supplies of potatoes in West Cork towns are not plentiful and that prices are rather high.  The question of the feasibility of measures to relieve possible shortages will be considered.  In connection with the Department's seed distribution scheme (under which seed for foundation purposes is sold at reduced prices to smallholders in the congested districts), special consideration is being given this year to those districts in West Cork where the yields of the potato crop were lowest.  A subcommittee of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture has also been set up for the purpose of considering the best means of procuring good seeds of potatoes and corn for the coming season.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will give an estimate of the aggregate production during the present cereal year resulting from the introduction of the new compound flour of (a) wheat offals, (b) barley offals; and if he will state what steps he proposes to take to ensure that such offals will be available for stock feeding only and that grain producers will get their fair share of such offals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the wheat and barley for the production of flour are being milled together and that in the present cereal year about 50,000 tons of the mixed offals will be produced.  Under the provisions of the Emergency Powers (Milling Offals) Order made by me on 7th December, 1943, about 25 per cent. of the offals produced are at present being made available to manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs for inclusion in compounds such as pig and poultry meals which are in very short supply. The balance of the production will be distributed by millers through the customary trade channels for sale to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that it is wise to continue that <Col N="843" /> policy, in view of the possibility of adding adulterants to these compounds? It is well known that adulterants have been added to them, and, in face of the acute shortage of feeding stuffs, does the Minister not consider that it would be wise to make that 50,000 tons available for agricultural purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, there are two views in connection with that matter.  Some farmers favour it, whereas others do not favour it, and therefore we have adopted this compromise of giving them 25 per cent. of the offals for compound feeding stuffs.  Undoubtedly, in the case of a small feeder who can only buy four stone or eight stone at a time, it would be more convenient to have the feeding stuffs, whereas it is all right for the big farmer who can do his own mixing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy's question refers to lands actually in the possession of the Forestry Division.  Approximately 64,000 acres of such lands have been planted since 1932.  The area of lands on hands nominally available for planting is about 28,000 acres, but this includes land utilised for nurseries and accommodation land attached to cottages, etc., and an appreciable portion is not at present available for planting owing to claims to grazing and other rights, not yet disposed of.</P>
      <P>The question of expanding planting operations after the war to the maximum area consistent with the economic needs of the country is receiving constant attention, and steps have been taken to build up stocks in the nurseries.  The prospects of expansion, however, depend upon the possibility of securing sufficient areas of suitable land, and in view of the enhanced value of grazings in present circumstances, landowners show no great desire to part with their mountain land at prices which would permit of economic afforestation.</P>

The Land Commission are not aware of the percentage of land in the districts in question at present let for grazing; and I would remind the Deputy that the commissioners are not at the moment in a position to undertaken fresh commitments, owing to the emergency conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest, further, to the Deputy that a very considerable amount of land division work has been done in Offaly during recent years.  In the county as a whole the Land Commission <Col N="848" /> have divided under the Land Acts, 1923-39, a total area of approximately 41,400 acres, of which some 33,200 acres were divided during the last 15 years.</P>

Having heard the objection, the Land Commission on the 6th November, 1925, disallowed the objection as such, but decided not to proceed further with the matter in view of the working of the lands.  After some years proceedings for the acquisition of these lands were reopened, but the owner again lodged an objection and sustained it successfully on legal and other grounds, against various proceedings instituted by the Land Commission.  It was not until the enactment of the Land Act of 1939 that the way was open to the Land Commission to acquire the lands, and the owner's final objection was disallowed on the 12th June, 1941.  By that time, <Col N="849" /> however, the emergency conditions prevented further action for the time being, and the price for the lands has not yet been settled.</P>

      <P>Before we adjourned last evening, I asked the Minister why he was definite, about maintaining Section 8, because that would determine our attitude on this amendment. His explanation was very difficult to follow.  It was to the effect that the sole aim of the proposal was to bring the general body of legislation governing officials and local authorities into harmony and to see that the highest standard of efficiency was maintained. With that we would all be in agreement. The only instance he gave as to why he was adamant about retaining this section was to bring his staff into line with prevailing conditions.  The Minister instanced the removal of a chief executive officer and quoted a document for which no Party in this House was responsible.  It was an extraneous document and it was bad taste of the Minister to quote it.  I hold that that should not constitute a good reason for maintaining this section. It is on a par with the method of reasoning adopted by the Minister in reference to the question of fixing the retiring age not lower than 65.  He mentioned the necessity of lowering the age of physical training instructors. As the Minister admitted, there are probably two or three officers of that class in the whole service, so that he would hardly require legislation to govern these exceptional cases.  I do not think we can maintain that there is likely to be any other case of a chief executive officer continuing in office long after the age which might be considered reasonable or at which he would be competent to carry out his duties.  I cannot follow the reasoning of the Minister as to why this section is to be retained.  With due consideration of the points made, I consider it necessary to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only defence that could be made for retaining this sub-section was that there was a similar one in the Local Government Act.  That raises a question as to whether it is a good defence in a legislative assembly to argue along such lines.  It would much more likely be considered correct if it were raised from the judicial point of view. If the Minister were a judge it would be quite correct for him to say, as a defence for a certain kind of action, that it was already the law of the country, that the legislative assembly had passed it and that nothing further could be done.  Our function here is to change the laws for the better and, if a section included in another Bill is detrimental to a certain class of officers, then we should avail of this opportunity to rectify a mistake made by this House on a previous occasion. An argument on the same lines was used by the Minister for Agriculture, but on the Agricultural Bill Deputy Corry stated that two wrongs did not make a right.  I agree with him.  We have an opportunity of rectifying the position now.  When the original Act was passed, Deputy Corry stated that the House was then considering more important things.  This sub-section slipped through and is now duplicated in other Acts.  As far as can be gathered from an examination, the tendency is to shift the balance of power from local committees to the Minister's Department.  That deprived these local groups of whatever power they had in the past.  It should be remembered that while the officials of other local bodies come under the county manager, and while the argument in their case might be much stronger, there is a slight difference in the case of the vocational education committee's officers in so far as they do not come under the county manager as yet.  They are exempt from that. As far as we understand, these local bodies are democratic bodies and whatever power still remains to them should be left untouched.  That is the whole point of our argument against the section.  It would, I think, take the <Col N="855" /> sting out of a great deal of Section 8, against which we have put up a strong opposition, if even sub-section (3) were deleted.  Accordingly, I move its deletion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Connolly on this amendment. It would appear to me, reading this sub-section, that the Minister takes on himself the right to remove people from office without holding any inquiry.  If that be so, it is entirely uncalled for. I do not think that any of these officers should be removed without having the matter properly inquired into.  This is an extraordinary provision, even though I understand it is a repetition of what has appeared in other Bills. It provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the Minister is of opinion that any of the statutory grounds for removal from office exists as regards the holder of an office, the Minister may send by post to such holder at the principal office of the vocational education committee, under which such holder holds such office, a notice in writing stating the said opinion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is, in other words, that he is of opinion that one of these statutory grounds for removal from office exists in regard to that officer.  The section goes on:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... and if the Minister, after the expiration of seven days from the sending of such notice and after consideration of the representations (if any) made to him by such holder, remains of the said opinion, he may, by order, remove such holder from such office.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that that is really a bit thick. No matter what the holder of the office in question may put up by way of representations to the Minister, if the Minister decides to dig his heels into the ground and ignore anything said by the holder of the office, he will just merely inform him: &ldquo;I still hold the opinion that I formally expressed by notice to you,&rdquo; and he will forthwith proceed to remove him from office.  I think any removal from office should be after inquiry duly held, at which the person charged would be in a position <Col N="856" /> to put up a defence.  Even though the inquiry would be held in the ordinary way by the inspector of the Department, the holder of the office would probably come with a case prepared in his defence in a way which would be far more convincing than a case made in a letter to the Minister replying to the notice referred to in the sub-section.  I think that this section should go out, and as far as I am concerned I am strongly in favour of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also in favour of the amendment.  I think that the proposal contained in this sub-section is most arbitrary and high-handed.  The Minister here constitutes himself judge and jury and denies the officer any opportunity of defending himself, except whatever he can do by personal representations to the Minister by way of correspondence&mdash;it may be by pulling strings, for all I know.  It is a most objectionable sub-section.  Surely if an officer is charged with dereliction of duty, he is entitled to an opportunity of defending himself?  The Minister has made no effort whatever to justify this provision.  I suggest that it is only ordinary justice to give any man charged with dereliction of duty an opportunity of defending himself and that an inquiry should be instituted at which he will be able to avail himself of legal advice.  I think that the sub-section ought to disappear.  There is ample provision already in the Bill to cover cases of suspension and I think a very full investigation should be made as to the circumstances before removing any individual from office and that a report should be made to the Minister by a competent person after the holding of an inquiry.  The Minister has not attempted to justify this provision and, in our circumstances, there is no justification for it. It is a denial of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Connolly and other Deputies because I think the sub-section goes even further than Deputy Hughes suggested. Deputy Hughes stated that the Minister was constituting himself judge and jury.  He is doing far more than that.  No judge of the High <Col N="857" /> Court or of the Circuit Court, or no district justice dealing with a criminal matter, has powers anything like those which the Minister takes in this sub-section because an aggrieved person, if he is not satisfied with the sentence imposed upon him in any of these courts, has at least the right of appeal.  Under this sub-section the person aggrieved has no right whatever to have the matter reopened.  I cannot see why the Minister should want this power because this sub-section obviously is not put in to deal with what one might term the more serious offences such as, for instance, if one of these officers were convicted of a criminal offence.  In sub-section (4) the Minister takes power to remove from office any official who is convicted of an offence which in the opinion of the Minister renders him unfit for such office.  One can quite understand that, but as far as this sub-section is concerned I cannot understand why the Minister should seek such powers.</P>
      <P>Even assuming that some type of inquiry were held, my experience of similar inquiries is that everything is weighted against the accused, if I might put it that way, and in favour of the Department.  My experience of inquiries as regards national teachers is that, while I have found the inspectors very fair, it is practically impossible to conduct any kind of defence before them.  The person about whose status the inquiry is held will get a notice that he or she is entitled to be legally represented but that the person who represents him or her is not entitled to examine or cross-examine witnesses or ask questions.  The legal representative of a teacher brought before an inquiry such as that has to write down any questions he wishes to put to witnesses, hand them to the inspector who can then decide whether the question will be asked or not. Even in that type of inquiry, the scales are weighted against an officer. I cannot see why the Minister should assume these powers of removal from office and base them merely on his own opinion, which may be right or wrong, and give the aggrieved person no right of appeal whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> There is another point in the sub-section which is most objectionable.  It provides that the Minister may send by post to the holder of an office under a vocational education committee a notice in writing.  I can quite visualise the case of a vocational officer in Bantry whom the Minister, this evening, considers should be removed from office.  He posts a letter to the principal office of the vocational education committee in Cork City.  First of all, it would take two days at present for such a letter to reach the office and it may affect a person very seriously.  It would take two days to get to the main office, and the Lord knows when it would get to the man in Bantry, and it is quite possible in the present circumstances in outlying districts that the period would have expired before the unfortunate man would get it at all.  I do not see why this sub-section should be retained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. Martin O'Sullivan Mr. Martin O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that this clause is entirely unnecessary, and I would urge on the Minister to agree to its deletion on account of its objectionable nature. He has all the powers necessary to deal with any officer who offends against the statutory grounds named. There is another aspect to this.  It would have far-reaching effects as far as the staffs themselves are concerned. If this section stands they will feel that they will have no shield at all as between the local inspector who holds the inquiry and reports an officer to the Minister, and the belief that the inspector will have to report according to the views that the Minister may hold.  Therefore I suggest there should be some local shield, so far as the officer is concerned, as the Minister already has all that he requires in sub-section (2).  I put it to him that the only need for a section of this kind would be if there were widespread cases so far as vocational committees generally are concerned.  My own experience is that the present procedure has worked rather smoothly and, that being so, why should the Minister consider it necessary to throw a spanner into the works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge on him the absolute necessity in the interests of an important <Col N="859" /> staff to agree to the deletion of that section.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to find Deputies who were present in the House when a proposal similar to this one was inserted in the 1941 Act now proclaiming that something very tyrannical was done.  If this is a tyrannical attempt on the part of the Minister to assume dictatorial powers in regard to a limited branch of the service under the local authorities, then the Minister for Local Government, upon whom the House&mdash;the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party in particular co-operating&mdash;conferred these powers, must be certainly a far greater dictator than I could possibly aspire to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that it was an agreed amendment.  I think that if Deputies will look back on the reports of the proceedings they will see that the <Col N="860" /> Minister reconsidered his original proposals in accordance with objections that were made, and that the proposal, as it now stands in Section 25 of the 1941 Act, was received with general agreement.  I explained to the House last night that there are some 900 teachers, and that if a situation arises where, if the repeated reports of inspectors are to have any weight as to the continued inefficiency of a teacher, and the committee fails to take action against that teacher, the only remedy at present available to the Minister is to have a sworn inquiry locally.  I fail to see how an inquiry, with all the embroidery that Deputy Linehan as a legal man would like to see about it, as to whether in fact a teacher's inefficiency is such as to render his continuance to hold his position undesirable, can have two authorities in this matter.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that since inspectors report upon teachers in the other branches of the service they must be considered to be equally competent in regard to teachers under the vocational education authorities.  There must be some finality.  It is not merely through a casual visit of an inspector that this situation arises.  I explained the procedure last night&mdash;that notice is first given to the teacher.  The inspector then carries out a formal inspection.  He may report the matter to the committee.  If the situation still remains unsatisfactory and the teacher fails to improve, the inspector, as a result of a further inquiry, may recommend to the committee that his services should be dispensed with. The teacher then, in the other branches of the service&mdash;and it would certainly apply to this branch&mdash;would be accorded an opportunity of having an independent inspection by an inspector of senior rank, and all that procedure would be known to the committee. If necessary it can be brought under the notice of the committees officially.  I am quite prepared to set out the whole of the procedure very carefully and to call the attention of the committees to it.</P>
    <P>I think that is a form of inquiry that is sufficiently public, because in the normal course of events the reports of <Col N="861" /> the inspectors go to the committee and these find plenty of space in the local Press.  So that the question would be one about which public opinion would have an opportunity of expressing itself, and the members of the committee and all concerned would have intimate knowledge of the matter right through.  If necessary, also, I am prepared to amend Section 3 to ensure that, as well as sending the notification that the Minister regards the holder of an office to be unsuitable for retention to him, a copy would be sent to the committee, and also that the committee, as well as the officer in question, should have an opportunity of making representations.</P>
    <P>It is quite true, as Deputy Linehan says, that a period of seven days may appear short, but that is the period laid down in existing legislation to cover the great body of officers of local authorities.  When I have asked the question whether officers of vocational education committees are seeking more beneficial conditions than other officers of local authorities, I have not got the answer that they are.  I think it has even been admitted that they seek only the same conditions.  It was certainly never intended that they should get more beneficial conditions than other officers.  I am quite willing to see whether the period might be extended to ten or 14 days, but I do not think it would be possible to accept the other amendments.  Generally, my position is that, in the case of teachers, I feel there is no necessity to have a sworn inquiry.  There is a certain procedure which, if necessary, can be brought before the committees by official circular and the committees, if they wish to do so, may suggest amendments. We can set out for their information the form of procedure to be followed in cases of inefficiency of teachers.</P>
    <P>I should like again to stress&mdash;and those who have any acquaintance with what takes place in cases of inefficiency of national school teachers or secondary teachers know&mdash;that between the first notice and the final action of removing a teacher, a very long time often elapses.  It may be up to two years or three years, and it has frequently <Col N="862" /> come under my notice that teachers who were inefficient have, by reason of the fact that chances were given to them from time to time, in fact remained teaching for considerably more than three or four years, so that I think that Deputy M. O'Sullivan is perhaps underestimating the position of the committees in the matter when he suggests that there will be no shield.  I suggest to him that if amendments are introduced by which the period will be extended so as to make quite sure that some time will be given for representations to be sent in, and that, if a committee wishes to make representations, it will have legal power to do so, it should be quite sufficient. Unfortunately, the Deputy and other Deputies who have spoken were not here last night when I dealt with this question and explained that there may be certain cases where the facts are admitted.  I stated in my Second Reading speech that where there was any doubt whatever, an inquiry would be held, and I said last night that except in the case of teachers, where, I think, the procedure should follow that in the other branches of the service. I could assure the House an inquiry will be held in every case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of them was to ensure that whatever action was taken by the Minister in a case of this sort, the approach would be to the committee, which would be directed to deal with the officers, and further, that where a sworn inquiry was requested by the holder of an office, such request would be put by the committee to the Minister.  Looking at the section as it stands, it appears to me that the Minister must have some such power as there is in sub-section (3), if it is to work, but although it is necessary for him to have the power, it does not follow at all that he should get such powers as might inflict injustice. The first sub-section says that the <Col N="863" /> word &ldquo;office&rdquo; means an office under a vocational education committee; which is not a very informative description. When I first read that, I understood it to mean some person in the office, but I gather from what the Minister has just said that it means a teacher. These are two entirely different interpretations.</P>
      <P>With regard to the statutory grounds for removal from office, one would imagine that one of the first grounds would be neglecting to perform the duties of the office; but that is not a statutory ground here.  A man may be quite fit to hold office and still not do his duty, but that is not a statutory ground for dismissal.  I do not think the House or a committee would stand for keeping an official who neglected to perform the duties of his office.  In an earlier section, that is mentioned as one of the reasons for holding an inquiry. I see no earthly reason why, in the event of an office holder, whether a teacher or an official, asking a committee to send forward his request for a sworn inquiry, the committee agreeing with him in that request, he should not have the privilege of an inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think that, in the case I have outlined, the prolonged inefficiency of a teacher over a period perhaps of years, it is necessary to have a sworn inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is asking me to accept that position with regard to prolonged inefficiency.  I would not stand for inefficiency for one month. If it has gone on over a period of months or years, there is something wrong.  The initial complaint in that case, I should say, is with the committee, but if the Minister or his office was aware of it, it seems almost inconceivable to me that some action was not taken to rectify the situation.  I am not standing for that, but, with the very best of intentions, there may be a lack of harmony between an official in the State Department and the official or teacher in another section of the service. I have known it all my life; I knew of it 30 years ago in connection with the administration of affairs here in Dublin.  I want to avoid anything of the sort happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> Everybody is prepared to concede to the Minister ample powers to deal with inefficiency, to ensure that the boys and girls attending these schools will be properly taught and that the persons teaching them will be properly qualified.  We are prepared to concede all that, but we want a safeguard in respect of a person so qualified and so teaching, so that the retention by him of whatever office or whatever teaching position he holds will not be at the whim of any official and so that, if charges are made against him, he will have an opportunity of rebutting the charges, of making a defence and making good his title to his position.  That is not unreasonable.  The Minister surely does not hold that an official or a teacher, properly fulfilling all the conditions of his office, whether in the office of the vocational committee or in the class-room, a competent teacher getting proper results, should be &ldquo;fired&rdquo; at the whim of an inspector? That is all we are anxious to guard against.</P>
    <P>In the three amendments we are endeavouring to let the administration of this measure, and Vocational Acts generally, run between the committee and the officials, and the Minister should use the committee as a buffer in dealing with teachers or officials, not to have, as it were, two masters, as they may please one and displease the other.  Let there be only one, and I suggest it should be the vocational committee, and supervision in connection with these matters should have the co-operation rather than the hostility of the committee.  That is really the purpose of the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were only a case of dealing with the inefficient teacher, then there would be no quarrel on our part.  We have stated that we have every intention of maintaining the high standards of our profession, and we are at one with the Minister in his attempts to weed out inefficiency, if he can show that it exists.  But he has not shown us that it does exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has talked about the system of inspection, and one might enlarge on that somewhat to show there could be no prolonged period of <Col N="865" /> inefficiency on the part of the teacher. Not only is there individual inspection by an inspector who arrives without notice, who walks into the class-room whenever he desires, and who checks up on the work of the teacher, but there is also a general systematic inspection by several inspectors who descend on the vocational school at the same time. These would include the senior inspector, the assistant senior inspector, and three, four or five inspectors.  They take over the school and run it, with the teacher in the background, and they have the best opportunity then and there of examining his work.  In addition to that, they have regular conferences in the case of general inspections, and, practically every quarter, two or three inspectors hold a staff meeting and discuss points with the teachers, showing them where their methods of teaching are not, perhaps, up to the best standards, and generally bringing the teachers into line.  Under such conditions, where could inefficiency exist?  Unless the Minister has some knowledge of which we are not aware, it would appear to me that there is little ground for this talk of inefficiency.</P>
    <P>We have heard references to unfitness for office.  If we knew that the Minister was talking about inefficiency in teaching, taking the technical acceptance of the term, there would be no question of trying to restrain his powers to deal with the matter.  But unfitness for office may not mean educational unfitness at all.  It may not mean that, so far as the Minister is concerned, but some succeeding Minister may hold that a teacher with advanced republican views is unfit for office; he may hold that a teacher with advanced sociological views is unfit for office; a teacher may have advanced agricultural views, and he may be considered unfit for this educational office; a man may be a crank, he may have his idiosyncrasies and all sorts of ideas, and in the opinion of some future Minister he may not be considered fit for this office. That is why there is this rumpus about the section, not because of unfitness, but because there are so many things which might, in the opinion of some future Minister, constitute unfitness on the part of the official.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> The Minister stated that this is in the 1941 Act and that this was an agreed amendment.  An explanation of that is here, in the words of Deputy Corry, who was a member of the House at the time.  He said: &ldquo;The fact that the House at that time, when they were fighting larger issues, did not realise the importance of these things, is no reason why we should allow them to remain for ever.&rdquo;  The Minister put the question again and again, whether the officers require better conditions of service than other officers.  Categorically, we do not, but we say the purpose of a legislative Assembly is to advance, to progress, and if the officers, through some negligence on the part of this House, let these things slip through, as Deputy Corry says, then there is no reason why, when we get this opportunity, we should not try to rectify a wrong.  That is our point: we are trying to rectify a wrong.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned by the Minister, to my astonishment, that there had been no discussion on this&mdash;that it was an agreed amendment.  I looked up the records to verify that and I found that the Minister, when he was discussing this part of the Bill, talked about embezzlement&mdash;that it was to deal with questions of embezzlement on the part of local officials.  That is rather remote from any question concerning vocational education officers.  They do not hold money.  The chief executive officers have charge of any funds and there could be no question of embezzlement by them.  Therefore the whole case falls to the ground.  There was this question of what might be done with officers accused of embezzlement. In the Seanad there was a reference by Senator O'Donovan, who pointed out, as Deputy Linehan has, the difficulties of postal services in Cork.</P>
    <P>There is another point raised in a later amendment.  I did not specifically refer to it, because I thought it would come on later, but now I find it may not come on later.  It is in reference to the word &ldquo;sending&rdquo;, in line 48 of sub-section (3).</P>

      <P>Perhaps we might be satisfied if the word &ldquo;receipt&rdquo; were inserted.  Deputy Linehan and other legal personages could tell us that for the slightest misdemeanour&mdash;for instance, not having a bicycle lamp&mdash;the Guard has to swear that he actually delivered the summons; he has to prove receipt of the summons.  Here the Minister merely wishes to send out the document; he merely has to say that he sent this message to the teacher and whether the teacher got it or not is no concern of his.  We have been told the Minister is reasonable, and we are prepared to believe he is, more particularly as he says he will bring forward an amendment to the section.  If the Minister will give us more information with regard to the amendment he proposes to bring in, I am prepared to drop my opposition to this section.</P>

      <P>The trouble about a receipt is: in what way are we to ensure that it is received?  If a registered letter will be considered sufficient evidence, or if any other simple proof of that nature can be devised, I see no objection to amending it.</P>

      <P>Well, on Section 9, on the Second Reading we talked on this matter of the hardship inflicted on many of the existing officers.  &ldquo;Many&rdquo; is relative to the number of those affected by the immediate enactment of the retiral age and so on, but I wonder, now that the Minister has listened to these representations, whether he would consider that he might make more definite the statement that he has already given us, that he will consider every case on its merits.  Would he confirm with regard to Section 9&mdash;I do not want to traverse the whole case again&mdash;that where the border-line cases I have mentioned are concerned, he would have the same power under the Act?  Then we might finish the business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We have talked about the question of officers.  It is stated that immediately there is a declaration that this Act comes into force, the <Col N="869" /> position of such an officer is altered in regard to tenure, age, and so on.  Section 6, sub-section (3) (a) affects the officer who may have very nearly the service that would entitle him to the maximum pension.  I have given instances before where the officer might be 63 years of age and yet might be only, say, 38 years in the service. Actual facts indicate that he could not receive the maximum pension, because he would be retired immediately, and there is no possibility, under the Act, of his being allowed to continue for another five years, or whatever shorter period would be required to enable him to secure the actual pension.  There are cases of that nature where the Minister has stated, if I understood him correctly, that he was prepared to consider each case on its merits in view of the record of the officer and without interpreting the Act in a harsh and arbitrary manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the position in the case of existing officers where, first of all, the Minister is taking definite power to break an existing contract duly entered into.  That has already been fully discussed, and it appears to me that officers of that type are entitled to some rather special consideration.  By legislation here you are going in the first place to break the contract, and, in the second, there are officers who, in peculiar circumstances, enter the service late in life, some of them coming over from the technical schools when the Vocational Education Act was passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of those broke their service through doing a course after the 1925 Act.  Because of their breaking their service they will have only a small number of years' service for the purpose of computing superannuation. From the fact that some of them have entered the service rather late, it appears that many would not be entitled to the maximum pension at all, or would not approach 40 years' service. Then, there is the question of added years.  The Minister might be prepared to assure the House that particular circumstances would be taken into account, and he might point out to the House that there is provision under <Col N="870" /> the 1925 Act to add the number of years for service, but the difficulty I see is this: that a definite precedent has been established, so far as the application of the 1925 Act is concerned. For a long time the practice has been that over 60 no years have been added for pension purposes. Where such a definite precedent has been established in the application of the 1925 Act, no matter what pious wishes we may subscribe to or assurances we may get from the Minister, I think there will be a great difficulty in getting over this established precedent.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will have sympathy with certain cases when this Act comes into operation, if say, the retirement age is going to be 65 and men are required to go out at that age on a small pension.  The Minister might be prepared to deal sympathetically with cases of that sort.  But, will he be in a position to deal sympathetically with such cases if a definite precedent has been established by the operation of the 1925 Act over so many years when the principle has not been applied?  I am aware of no particular case, where representations have been made for added local service by a local authority, that has been sanctioned by the Department of Local Government.  Their policy has been definitely established, and that determines it.  I wonder if the Minister could tell the House, in view of his sympathy, how he proposes to get over that difficulty?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why Deputy Hughes persists in speaking of a breach of contract.  Of course, this would really be a matter for the courts, but it seems clear to me that a vocational education officer can only claim that Section 99 of the original Act assured him that in the service to which he was transferred in 1930 he would not suffer any loss which would make the new conditions of service inferior to those in the service which he was leaving.</P>

Am I to take it that Deputy Hughes, in his anxiety for educational and agricultural advancement, desires officers to continue to 75 or 80 years of age?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  The point is that I am informed by those who have some knowledge of the position that we are never likely to deal with problems of unemployment unless we cut down at the other end.  If we do not try to make openings below for new entrants, then our problems will become very difficult.  I have told the House that the matter of superannuation is entirely one for the Minister for Local Government.  If a body recommends added years, it is a question for the Minister, and I cannot say what attitude he will adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have explained also to the House that added years are intended to cover only cases where it is difficult to find an officer to fill a particular post at such an age as would enable him to draw his full pension.  In cases where such an officer came from an outside post and gave up a position demanding high qualifications at a mature stage of his life, the Minister for Local Government has stated, officially, I think, that he is prepared to consider sympathetically an application for added years of service.  We cannot give added years of service in all cases.  I wonder whether Deputies who are interested feel that Deputy Connolly's case is a strong one in the case of the officer who is about to reach the age of 65 and who has 37 or 38 years' service.  Such an officer, when this Bill becomes law, will be doing far better than the average civil servant and the average man who has been given the weight of responsibility of a large Government Department on his shoulders for many years, because <Col N="872" /> that officer will only get a pension of 30/60ths at most, even if you add in that he will get a gratuity of a year's salary as a lump sum when he is leaving, still, I think, his position is not as favourable as that of the officer for whom Deputy Connolly is now claiming this favourable treat ment, who will get 37 or 38/60ths.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government is going into the question of superannuation and it may be possible to bring about an improvement in certain aspects of the superannuation code. In considering the matter he must have regard to the fact that, whatever concession he grants to vocational education officers, there will naturally be a demand for similar concessions to all other officers in the employment of local authorities, so that his position as the authority in these matters is that he cannot very well agree that officers responsible to the educational authority or, let us say, to the agricultural authority, should receive better treatment than the ordinary run of officers, and very much better treatment than the Civil Service is getting.</P>
    <P>The type of case I had in mind was that of the officer who, in spite of the fact that he or she is reaching the age of 65 years, has short service&mdash;say, somewhere about ten years.  If the retiral age were fixed next year, and if he or she had to go out on a comparatively small pension, it might be hard treatment or might be considered to be so.  There might also be a type of case of a teacher or officer who had service in other branches, officers, say, teachers who had service as Gaelic League teachers, and who have already been dealt with, in so far as the vocational education committees can give them added years of service for their period of work as Gaelic League teachers or organisers.  In a particular case, at any rate, a committee has jibbed at giving the full amount of additional years' service.  As a superannuation matter.  I do not think that, before the next stage of the Bill, I could deal with that problem now.  Even if I were able to introduce an amendment to <Col N="873" /> enable committees to give the added years of service in certain contingencies where, say, a teacher had given proved service as a secondary teacher, there is no assurance that the vocational education committee, unless perhaps the service had been given in its own area, would be prepared to give the teacher the full added years of service.  In the long run, all that we can do is to make it permissive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of them have followed what the Minister has laid down.  The only exception, I think, was the one committee that the Minister has mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking now of the other cases where the pensioning authority, in the case of a national teacher or of a secondary teacher, is the State, and where the pensioning authority, in the case of the vocational teacher, is the local authority.  The local authority will naturally ask why it should pay the full added years of service.  If special reasons such, for example, as national service, come into the matter, the committee may be prepared to agree or it may not.  As I have said, the most that we can do is to make it permissive.</P>
      <P>In connection with the fixing of the retiral age, I promised that I would see whether it would not be possible for the Minister to declare any specified age to be the age limit for a particular class of officer.  I will have to look into the point and see whether the fact, as my friends on the Opposition have suggested, that the phrase in the Bill as it stands on the fixing of an age limit is &ldquo;for all offices or for such offices&rdquo; will not make it difficult to deal with particular cases in that way. The cases that I had in mind were cases of officers who would have short service, and not officers who had almost reached the full period of service which would entitle them to the two-thirds pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the cases that we had in mind because of the greater hardship that would apply to them.  I think the Minister should not try to misrepresent the intentions of the House.  We stand for efficiency <Col N="874" /> just as much as he does.  We are not opposed to this provision to retire people at the age of 65 in order to make room for young fellows who are coming along.  We know that young men starting out will, when they enter the service and make a contract with the local authority, be aware of the fact that they must retire at 65.  Here we are dealing with a group of existing officers who, at the time they entered into their contract of service, were not aware that it could be determined by the intervention of legislation at this particular time.  We are simply saying that because of the intervention of this legislation those officers are entitled to special consideration.</P>

      <P>I hate to repeat myself but, from what the Minister has said, I think it may be necessary to indicate briefly again that we do not stand for the continuance in office of any officer under the vocational education scheme beyond the age of 65.  We have no intention of making a brief for anyone to continue in office until he reaches the age of 70 or 80 years, as the Minister has stated.  We are very interested in trying to find berths for our young graduates, just as much interested in that as the Minister is. What we do say is that there are cases of officers who came into the service many years ago when this matter was not being discussed.  They came in away back in the period when the technical branch under the old Department of Agriculture was set up.  We are asking the Minister to give special consideration to these cases.  He does not appear to be concerned with them, or to be sympathetic enough but, on the other hand, he has shown that he will give consideration to cases of short service in which there would undoubtedly be hardship on the enactment of this Bill.  I think that is all that need be said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> We would like that the age of retiral would be reduced even to 60.  After all, 40 years is long enough to be engaged in teaching or in any other job.  I think we would all like to see the age reduced. It was not the age that concerned us so much as the question of the pension rights of those officers. We have been trying to mitigate any hardship that would fall upon this rather small section, a section that, as years go on and as death takes its toll, will be eliminated and will be no longer under this or any other Act.  It is for these cases that we are asking special consideration.  I trust that the Minister, despite his statement just now, will turn a sympathetic ear to the representations which have been made to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>As nobody else is speaking, I suppose that I might as well reply to the statements that have been made.  I might say that I have listened with very great sympathy to the views which have been put forward by various Deputies on the motion before the House.  I fully appreciate the feelings which imbue the various Deputies desiring that everything possible should be done for the members of our Defence Forces and their families.  I might say that I myself yield to no one in the extent of my desire to do whatever is possible for these men, but at the same time I must point out that the language of exaggeration&mdash;and a fair amount of that has been used in the course of the debate upon the motion&mdash;does not in fact help me in whatever I desire to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne (Senior) in the course of the debate gave us details of a case which he said was fairly typical of a soldier's wife.  He pointed out that a soldier's wife had met him recently and pointing towards the child which she was carrying in her arms had said she was getting 3d. per day for the upkeep of that child and that a bottle of milk cost 4½d.  I presume that that child that she was pointing out had to be at least the fourth child of the family.  There would have to be three children as well as that child, and I should make it clear to the House that the first child is entitled to 7/-, the second is also entitled to 7/- and the third child is entitled to receive 3/6, and from that onwards it is 1/9 per child.  Actually for these three infants, for that is all they could have been, there was some 17/6 available for the purchase of food. Now the Deputy also stated that the children would not be entitled to free milk.  I understand that the question <Col N="877" /> of the distribution of free milk is a matter purely and solely for the people who administer these schemes.  If they deem the children of a family deserving of that free milk in the cities and towns where the scheme operates this free milk can be given to the children. The same thing I think applies in respect of school books.  If the manager deems the family to be in such circumstances that it would be desirable to give them books he can do so, but the decision of course rests with him.  Deputy James Larkin (Junior) in the course of this debate again referred to the fact that a sergeant's wife, I think it was, with nine children was only getting, I think, £2 5s. 6d. I pointed out that the husband was getting 28/- in addition to that.  The point that the Deputy wanted to make was that the 28/- should not in any circumstances be considered in addition to the marriage allowance and the children's allowance which the wife was receiving.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how he can in the circumstances relate that type of dis cussion to the fact that there you have a family with £4 8s. in the coin of the State going into the hands of the husband and wife.  I cannot see how he cannot count that £4 8s. as being money available to that family for the purchase of the necessities of life. £4 8s. is a reasonably good wage. There are large numbers of people in this country at the present time who would regard themselves as being considerably well off if they had that amount of money.  But apparently Deputy James Larkin wants to divorce the 28/- from the amount that the wife receives: in other words the soldier should have no responsibility whatever for his family but the State should be solely and entirely responsible.  Now that is the sort of argument that is not helpful to me when I am making efforts, as I usually am, to secure improvements not only in the pay of the members of the Army but in the allowances of their wives and other members of their family.  I suppose there is no member of the Government more harassed than the Minister for Finance especially at the present time. Everybody, at least every Minister, is <Col N="878" /> trying to secure improvements for the particular people who come under his care.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose there is any Minister who harasses that Minister more than I do in trying to secure improvements for the members of the Defence Forces.  I can assure the House of that, but I do not think it is necessary for me to go into any great detail on this question, because, as I said in opening here, I fully appreciate the motives which have moved every Deputy who has spoken.  They are in sympathy with my own ideas, and from that point of view we are at one.  Beyond saying it is my intention as far as it is humanly possible to continue my efforts to secure still further improvements, if they can be secured, I do not think it is necessary for me to say any more on the subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Liam Cosgrave Mr. Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Liam Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I just desire to say a few words in support of this motion.  In doing so I have the honour to speak as an ex-soldier who had the experience of a smaller rate of pay than is paid at present to privates in the Army.  Since I left the Army, or rather after I was promoted, the rate was increased by 6d. per day.  Prior to that the wage of a private was 13/2 per week.  Now I can say quite honestly, and I think every Deputy here, including the Minister, must realise that many private soldiers living on the 13/2 as it then was, or 17/6 as it now is, are helping to support a widowed mother or possibly other members of their family.  I do not pretend that I had to try to live out of the allowances which I was paid, but the vast majority of the soldiers had to exist on that allowance, and as well as existing on it many of them were sending home something to their dependents.  Now such an allowance is totally inadequate, even at 17/6 per week, to meet the cost of the bare necessaries of life.  While the Minister has argued that the cost on the Department of Finance is already high, and that he cannot see his way to raising it any more, this whole question of Army allowances is one of extreme importance.  First of all, many of the men in the Army at the present time joined at the start of the emergency. <Col N="879" /> and at that time they considered, possibly wrongly, that the emergency might not last very long.  It has, anyway, lasted longer than most of them expected it would.  Anyone might be prepared to suffer certain privations which he would not be willing to endure in ordinary times on account of the danger which then threatened the country, but I think it is absolutely unfair to expect men who joined the Army out of a sense of patriotic duty to try to exist on 17/6 a week, as it is for single men, and on the allowance made to men in respect of marriage. In regard to the marriage allowance, there are not a great number, but there are a fairly substantial number of married soldiers who are not in receipt of the marriage allowance.  We go back to the question of the marriageable age permitted under the regulations.  Again I must draw the Minister's attention to the fact that these regulations were originally fixed for a peace-time Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that we cannot discuss that on this motion, that is, the question of the age for marriage in the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Liam Cosgrave Mr. Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Liam Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that while we are not discussing the question of the marriage age in the Army we are discussing the question of marriage allowances.  A number of soldiers are not in receipt of marriage allowances due to the fact that they were under 23 years of age when they joined the Army or they have less than two years' service or in some cases, if they have two years' service, they are under 23 years of age.  It may be unpleasant, but I think that it has a harmful effect on the welfare of a large number of soldiers.  I think the motion is a fairly general one.  It is not worded very closely, and I submit that I am in order in mentioning the question here. Many of these men if they had not joined the Army might have wished to get married in their civilian occupations.  The position is that while outside they would have been permitted to get married, in the Army, due to this regulation, they are not allowed to get married, or if they do get married, they do not <Col N="880" /> get the marriage allowance.  One of the best methods of securing a serviceable fighting army is by ensuring that the members of that army are contented. I maintain that married soldiers who are not in receipt of a marriage allowance have a genuine grievance.  Many of them joined for a short period, as they thought, and they are now being penalised for coming forward at a time when recruits were called for by the Government and by all sections of the House.  I maintain that they should get better treatment.</P>
      <P>The allowances have been increased on a couple of occasions, particularly on one occasion since the emergency, and that was in September, 1942.  But the vast majority of the soldiers at present are what are known as Class II privates whose pay at present is 2/9 per day.  Out of that 1/- per week is stopped for his wife, if the soldier is married, and also 10d. for haircutting and widows' and orphans' pensions, which leaves that soldier with 11/5 per week.  The wife gets 10/6 marriage allowance, which leaves her with 17/6 per week; the soldier gets 11/5 per week, making a total of 28/11 per week.  Nobody in this House can say that it is possible to live in any kind of a decent way on an allowance such as that in view of the steep increase in the cost of living.  Eggs are 4d. each and butter is 2/4 per lb.  Then soldiers are allowed 3d. per day for each child in excess of three.  Even a small bottle of milk will cost 4½d.  Surely the Minister realises that such pay as that is absolutely inadequate to meet the increase in the cost of living which has taken place since the emergency.</P>
      <P>I quite agree that an improvement has been made in the rate of pay since September, 1942.  But these allowances were originally fixed at a time when the cost of living was about half what it is at present.  While 6d. per day deferred pay is also credited to the soldier, I submit that, at the present time, so far as most people are concerned, what they have in hand is worth three times what they are likely to get at the end of the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are living in a time of rapid change.  No one can visualise what conditions will be at the end of the <Col N="881" /> emergency.  No one can visualise what the conditions will be for these soldiers when they come out of the Army at the end of the emergency.  But they realise and Deputies, I am sure, realise the conditions under which they are living at present.  It does not require much imagination to see that 6d. per day paid to him now would be better for a soldier than deferred pay at the cessation of the emergency.  There is a possibility that there will be a reduction in the cost of living at the end of the emergency.  There is a possibility that supplies of necessary commodities will then be available in greater quantities and at reduced prices. The 6d. per day deferred pay is retained to meet that situation.  But, at present, when the cost of living is far in excess of what it was when these rates were fixed or, at any rate, what it was prior to the slight increase which was given, the vast bulk of the soldiers are expected to live on the allowances which I have mentioned. If we take pride, as we must, in our Army, I think that we owe them a duty.  There is no doubt that, if it were apparent to people that a grave emergency was upon us at present, every section of the community would strain every nerve and give everything they could in order to see that our rights and our territory and our people were protected.  Such a situation existed in 1940 when these men were asked to come forward, and the reward they get is an allowance wholly inadequate to meet the cost of living at the present time.  Surely that is not the thanks which we should give to those who came forward to defend our country and to guard our homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to endorse what has been said by the Deputy who has just spoken.  Soldiers' wives with four or five children get £2 per week, and out of that it is impossible for them to provide anything in the way of footwear or clothes for their children. They are just able to eke out a miserable existence on that sum.  Great hardship is also suffered by men who were classed as A1 when they joined the Army, and who have been discharged as unfit for further service, and <Col N="882" /> are now thrown on to home assistance or the dole.  That is a very bad recompense for some of our youths who joined the Army and got into bad health as a result of their service.  If they had joined the British Army they would now be drawing good pensions. I am sure that when these young men joined the Army they never imagined that they would be treated in that way by the Government.  I have particulars here of the case of a married soldier at the Curragh who has not got any marriage allowance.  When I wrote to the Department about the matter, he was interviewed by his officer, who writes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have interviewed the private, and he has promised to send his wife 10/- a week of his pay.  I trust this will meet the requirements of the case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That man, with 17/6 per week, has to send 10/- per week out of that to his wife.  Up to that time his wife and child were existing on home assistance. Is it any wonder that members of our Army are crossing the Border to join a foreign army?  I do not see what is to keep them in our Army under these conditions.  I say that the wives of married soldiers in the rural areas and towns throughout the Twenty-Six Counties are starving because of the miserable sum given to them.  If we are to have a contented Army we must pay them.  Nothing is more dangerous than a discontented Army&mdash;they could revolt any day because they are not being properly paid.  I ask the Minister to go into the matter very carefully. A few weeks ago we voted money for the relief of distress in India.  We should be able to find money to pay our Army properly.  I say that there would not be any objection on the part of the taxpayers to our Army being paid properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give special consideration to these men who are being discharged from the Army as unfit, some of whom have to go into a sanatorium.  Those men, after serving two or three years, have been discharged. I understand that, when joining, recruits have to sign a document providing that they will not make any <Col N="883" /> claim when they are going out.  Recruits will not be obtained by that system&mdash;by telling them to join up and, if anything happens, they will get no compensation.  There is another matter to which I should like to refer. There are a certain number of men in the Army who, after serving two years. are entitled to 6d. a day, which has been held back.  If these men could get that money, especially during the Christmas season, it would be a great help to them.  Will the Minister make any extra allowance to the dependents of soldiers during Christmas time?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but the reason we have desertions is that the allowances are too small.  Why should soldiers remain in the Army at present on a very mean wage which the Minister for Defence should be ashamed to stand over?  The Army is supposed to be the mainstay of our defence.  A soldier has at present a very responsible duty to the nation to perform. When the country was in danger in 1940, we had the Minister and many members of the House appealing for volunteers for its defence.  We want the volunteers and the soldiers in times of emergency and we should be prepared to pay them.  I agree with everything that Deputy O'Leary and other Deputies said&mdash;that the soldiers are not being paid.  There is no use in the Minister telling us that he cannot do this or that.  If he wishes to pay the soldiers, are not we the Dáil and do not we make the laws?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that question arises again.  The taxpayer has to meet the bill.  That is because we have not control of our own money, and that is why the Minister cannot give the soldiers a wage on which they can live.  I know the position myself because I am meeting and speaking to soldiers every day of the week.  The last Deputy who spoke referred to the way the soldiers were leaving the country.  The reason is that they are not being paid.  The Minister is responsible for the desertions from the Army.  Why should the soldiers remain when they can get better pay elsewhere?  If we want to keep our Army, we shall have to pay the soldiers.  I am in full agreement with the terms of the motion in the name of Deputy Byrne, and I ask the Minister to give more sympathetic consideration to it and to see that the soldiers, whom we are so proud of, get a wage on which they can live and bring up their families in Christian decency.</P>

As a result of this debate, we are faced with the position that these allowances are to be continued on a scale which means that a wife with one child receives. 17/6, a wife with two children 24/6, a wife with three children 28/-, a wife with four children 29/9, a wife with five children 31/6, a wife with six children 33/3, and a wife with seven children 35/-, with an additional 1/9 per week <Col N="886" /> for every child over the seven.

      <P>Well, if the allowances are a little more than these figures they are very little more, and they are still very inadequate.  They could not possibly provide, and are not providing, for the people who receive them.  That is the fact of the case.  These allowances are not providing the comforts for the soldiers' families to which they are entitled. Even since September, 1942, the time of the last increase, the cost of living has gone up further, and if the allowances were brought up at that time with a view to making them more commensurate with the cost of living. surely they must go up again because the cost of living now is much more than it was even in September, 1942.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in the two weeks that have elapsed since I put down the motion we have a position in which a family of a wife and five children must pay at least 1/- per week more for butter, and the day before yesterday they found themselves having to pay at least 6d. per week more for bread.  All <Col N="887" /> these little things mount up.  There are things such as footwear and cloth ing which have gone absolutely beyond the ability of the soldiers' wives to pay for.  No matter what way you reckon up the family budget of the soldier's wife you will find that she is hard put to pay for food and rent and the bare necessities of life, and there is no margin left for such things as hospital expenses, which very often crop up, or the cost of school books, which frequently is heavy, and nothing whatsoever for such little things as the tram to Dollymount in the summer, or the cost of a picnic in the country or at the seaside.</P>
    <P>Very many men in the Army have to try to provide a little out of their miserable allowance towards the maintenance of an old or infirm relative&mdash;a mother or father, or an invalid brother or sister&mdash;apart altogether from their wives and families.  Many of these noble women are, in fact, doing without a sufficiency of food or clothing in order to give a little more to their children.  Many of them will tell you that, and those who go into their homes will not deny that the women are almost hungry themselves in order to ensure that the children will have a little more.</P>
    <P>We have the position too that many soldiers' wives at the present time find <Col N="888" /> that they have exhausted the little savings which they had put together before their husbands had given up good jobs and had entered the Army four years ago.  These savings have been used to supplement the income from the State.  Others, we will find, are depending on help from relatives.  The point I want to stress is that the general body of the public does not know of the hardships which these women and children are undergoing. If they did, they would not have the slightest hesitation in saying to us: &ldquo;Go ahead, increase the allowances that you are paying to soldiers' wives; we will willingly give up a little towards them.&rdquo;  I am sorry that the Minister did not announce his intention to do that to-day.  I thought he might possibly do so, and I will not give up hope that he will very shortly realise that those who have property and money will have to be told straight and fair: &ldquo;Look here, you are very lucky to have property to be protected, and if you want to have a continuance of that protection which has been afforded by my Army to you and to your property, the least I will expect you to pay for it is a reasonable standard of comfort for the wives and children of your protectors.&rdquo;</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Allowances to Blind Persons&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredPByrne" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne (Junior) Mr. A. Byrne (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence, Sir, of Deputy A. Byrne (Senior) I beg to move Motion No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the allowances to blind persons are totally inadequate, and requests the Government to introduce amending legislation that will permit the total payments from all sources to be increased.</P>
      <P>I hope and believe that this motion will meet with unanimous support from all sides of the House, and that Deputies will accept its principle.  It will not be necessary for me to elaborate the principle of the motion at great length, and I think it should only be necessary for me to state a few bald facts in connection with it.  We are told that there are 7,000 registered blind, or partially blind, people in Éire, and it is reckoned, on good authority, that 75 per cent. of these people lose their sight after middle-life.  Now, the position, in regard to the way in which we help them, is this: A blind person at 30 years of age receives a pension from the State of 10/- a week.  In addition, the local authority concerned may grant a supplementary allowance up to not more than 6/- a week.  If the local authority were to add to the 6/-, the State, under the present law, would have to reduce the blind pension to the extent of that increase. Accordingly, no matter what is done by the local authority, the total pension paid to these blind persons cannot be more than 16/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The means test applied in the case of blind persons, I understand, is the same as that applied in the case of old age pensioners&mdash;which, I think, amounts to £15 12s. 6d. of an annual income&mdash;in order to qualify for a pension of 10/-.  In other words, under no <Col N="891" /> circumstances can a blind person be in receipt of a total pension of more than 16/- per week.  Now, when we consider the cost to-day of necessities, such as food, clothing and shelter, I think that every member of this House will realise immediately that that sum is totally inadequate, and that it is very unfair and unjust that we should not be able to do better for people who have been afflicted by blindness.</P>
    <P>Very many blind persons are not able to get the necessary fresh air because they are perhaps not in a position to engage a guide to bring them out.  Blind persons are in a special category in that, as I think everybody will agree, they need something more than the ordinary person needs.  They need more fuel because they are much more confined to their homes than other people; they need something to help them to send their clothes and bedding to the laundry or to cleaners because they are not in a position to do their own cleaning. In addition, they often have to engage somebody to clean down the little dwelling.  These three items are typical of the many little comforts to which blind persons are entitled and which we ought to see they get.  My suggestion is that the law should be amended in order to ensure that there will be no means test and that every blind person will receive something from State funds to help him or her to overcome the handicap of blindness.  I do not propose to elaborate on the matter of the means test, but it appears as if the Government are beginning to repent in that respect.  When the Children's Allowances Bill came before us the week before last, we saw that the means test had been deliberately left out of it.  The Government are coming to realise that a means test involves undesirable inquisitions and is a most revolting provision which nobody wants.</P>
    <P>My second suggestion is that, having abolished the means test, there should be a disability pension of at least £1 per week&mdash;I am suggesting merely the minimum&mdash;to a single blind person and that proportionate sums should be <Col N="892" /> granted in those cases in which there are wives and families.  There is, I suppose, no sense in my arguing this matter any further.  The bald fact is that they get no more than 16/- under the existing law.  I do not propose to put forward any list of necessaries and their costs, because every member of the House knows full well that it just cannot be done on that amount.  I suggest that the time has come when we should realise that persons afflicted with blindness should get much more adequate help from their more fortunate fellow-citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding the motion, I appeal to the Government on behalf of these people, because, as Deputy Byrne has said, the number of people afflicted with blindness in the country is very small.  They number only 7,000, and, in a Christian country, it is too bad to think that a great percentage of these unfortunate people are in want to-night.  There is no question about that.  Under present arrangements, they can receive no more than 16/-, and when we realise that it costs 25/3 to keep in inmate in the Dublin Union, what chance have these poor people who must live in a room in Gardiner Street or Mountjoy Square, where they have to pay a heavy rent?  I am certain that every member of the House has sympathy with these poor people who are so badly afflicted, because we must all agree that loss of sight is a great affliction, and, the number being so small&mdash;thank God, it is so small&mdash;we should treat them generously.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne said they should get £1 per week, but I say that £1 per week is not sufficient.  A sum of £1 per week at present would not keep a person able to look after himself and surely we should not be so stingy in dealing with these few blind persons. I thought Deputy Byrne would have suggested at least 30/- per week, and, even if the bill amounted to a couple of thousand pounds a year, I guarantee that not one person in the nation would complain that the Dáil was over-generous in giving these people that amount, because everybody has sympathy with people so afflicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> With regard to the means test, I am definitely against any means test, but if it is public property that some person has £1,000, with home comforts and somebody to look after him, I am not very worried about the application of a means test.  There is, however, too much capital made of the means test.  It is right to have a means test in certain cases.  If everybody in a district knows that a person who has lost his sight possesses thousands of pounds&mdash;I do not care how unpopular it may be to say it&mdash;I am not in favour of giving 30/- per week to such a person. In the case, however, of a poor person in a room in Dublin and with no relations to look after him, I certainly would give 30/- per week.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will say that the Government agrees to review the position with regard to blind persons.  I am certain that if the Deputies on his own side gave expression to their views, it would be found that they are as much in sympathy with this proposal as I am or as Deputy Byrne or any other Deputy is.</P>
    <P>I appeal to him to be generous with these persons, because, as Deputy Byrne said, they are in cruel want all the time.  Why should they be in want of food, particularly in a country like this where we can be so <i>flaitheamhlach</i> with pensions to others who never needed them, never deserved them and should never have got them?  I appeal to the Minister to do the right thing and to give at least 30/- to these few blind persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with this motion.  The people to whom it refers, the blind, are more deserving of sympathy than any other section of the community.  Their numbers are not large so that without making any great encroachment on the taxpayers it should be possible to help them.  Every Deputy knows what a meagre pension most blind pensioners receive.  The maximum amount, between the State contribution and what is granted by local authorities, is 16/-.  It is not a very generous provision but, in the case of a blind man or woman, who is unable to do anything, it is not only ungenerous but completely inadequate. <Col N="894" /> It does not need any remarks from any quarter to bring the position of these unfortunate people to the notice of the Minister.  If the Minister cannot accept the motion he should make some gesture indicating the intention of the Government to meet the needs of these pensioners.  While many of us do not like to ask to have expenditure increased, the amount that would be needed to increase blind pensions would not add a great deal to the general taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>While everybody would be glad to provide for blind persons what Deputy Byrne suggests, with the present national income, that cannot be done.  The money is not available. The national income will not permit this country to provide for all persons who are blind such a standard of comfort as Deputies wish could be provided for them.  We are dealing with a restricted number of blind pensioners, but everybody is convinced that a similar case could also be made for increasing old age pensions and pensions of other persons who are prevented from earning a living by infirmity, sickness or affliction of some kind.  I think it would be a mistake if this House simply failed to make any gesture at all, once the issue of the inadequacy of the existing rates of pensions has been raised.  Members of the Opposition, of the Labour Party and other Deputies have called the attention of the Minister to the fact that the condition of persons depending on small pensions has become extremely acute and difficult.  Bearing in mind the sum total of our resources, I do not think we can altogether relieve afflicted people from the financial hardships which they are suffering at present, but I do say to the Parliamentary Secretary, that the time has come when he, as representing the Minister for Local Government, ought to discuss with the Minister for Finance whether something should not be done to meet the acute crisis that has been created by the increased cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is as much a charge on this country to prevent afflicted persons suffering from the consequences of the war situation as it is to maintain an <Col N="895" /> army for its defence.  I suggest that the time has come when the pension rates of these people should be reviewed, and if to increase them means that the strain on the Exchequer would be more than we can finance out of revenue, then we ought to make up our minds to do so out of borrowed money.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is bound to say that one reason why he must resist a general scheme of 30/- for blind pensioners is that it is obviously impossible to deal only with the blind.  I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that the position of all this class of persons was under review, and that he hoped with the introduction of the Budget, by whatever Government is then in office, something will be done to increase the provision made for them but that it must be done as part of a general scheme which would have in view total State expenditure.  I know that the argument of inflation which will be pleaded as a defence against failure to make any provision is a strong one, but it can be carried too far.  The damage done by being too conservative is greater than the danger that might arise from some slight departure from financial orthodoxy.  For the duration of the emergency I suggest that the Minister ought to make some concession with a view to relieving the special circumstances of these people.  I believe he will receive the united support of the House if he takes reasonable methods along these lines.  On the understanding that it would be confined to the period of the present crisis no insurmountable difficulty would confront the Minister for Finance, when faced with the task of raising the revenue necessary to meet whatever concession the Minister for Local Government intended to make to this class of person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that the proposer and seconder of this motion did not satisfy me, or the <Col N="896" /> House, that they had given this problem very much consideration. What Deputy Dillon has said is quite true, that everybody in this House has the greatest sympathy with those afflicted persons, with all afflicted persons, from whatever cause their affliction might arise, and it is regrettable that we cannot deal with them in a manner which will satisfy everybody, including the beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>Some of us take a very active interest in blind persons, not only in the House but outside the House, in so far as we can do it, in a somewhat practical way.  I believe that if a motion had been brought forward here, suggesting an examination of the whole question, with the object of seeing to what extent improvements can be made in regard to certain blind persons, it might be more satisfactory. So far as blind persons are concerned, there are some well-off and there are others very badly off.  I believe the position is such that an investigation could usefully be made in order to see how far the situation can be met and how far pressure can be brought on the Ministers concerned to make available whatever sum would be necessary. We have to deal with persons who are partially blind and persons who are becoming blind, and in view of the fact that the total number is small, comparatively speaking, I think a complete examination could be made and suitable recommendations could be submitted not only to cope with what Deputy Dillon has correctly described as this inflationary period, but to deal in a more permanent sense with those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the category of blind persons you have the young people who have been blind from birth, you also have persons who have become blind through accident, and then there are people who have become blind through a variety of causes.  Blind pensions are applicable to persons once they reach 30 years of age.  So far as young people are concerned, there is what I consider, and what I think Deputy Dillon would consider, adequate provision in the sense that the local authority can, if satisfied that a young person who is blind is not being properly <Col N="897" /> taken care of, send such person to an institution.  The local authority pays portion of the upkeep of that person in the institution and so does the Department of Local Government, so that so far as necessaries of life are concerned that young person is adequately provided for.  In addition, that young person is taught some trade in the institution if he or she is considered suitable.  Adults can go into institutions for the blind and provision can be made in a similar way, so that they can be taught trades and later they will be in a position to go into the world and earn a livelihood.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne and the seconder of the motion did not appear to get very much together on this matter.  Deputy Byrne made it clear that what he wanted was that over and above the 16/- provided there should be an additional £1 given to those people.  I understood him to say that they should be given an additional £1 by way of disability allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person is so badly provided for on 16/-, twice that amount might not mean the comfort we would like to see provided.  If the Deputies who proposed and seconded this motion are really anxious to have something done, they ought to propose that some committee of the House, or some Departmental committee, should be set up to inquire into the conditions of blind and partially blind persons who are or are not adequately provided for, or who can or cannot earn a livelihood.  On top of that an effort should be made to see if better provision <Col N="898" /> could be made for the training of these people for future employment on a permanent basis.  The existing arrangement is not at all satisfactory.</P>
      <P>We need not go far outside this country to see what are called State and locally-paid institutions, specially fitted to train and maintain in employment persons afflicted with blindness. We have not so many of those people to deal with, and we should endeavour to make better provision for them. From what I know about the problem, I would not feel happy if this motion were accepted, and even if the limit of what is asked was granted, I would not consider that that would deal satisfactorily with the situation.  It would only mean that later on we would regret we did not deal with the matter in a better manner.  I suggest to the proposer and seconder, and to all who are interested, that further consideration should be given to this question with a view to seeing if something better cannot be done for those people than discussing whether we should give them a few shillings extra in the week.  We ought to deal with the matter in a more permanent and more satisfactory way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise with a certain amount of hesitancy to support this motion.  I realise, after all, there is a limit to our resources and that this is a small country I think, however, in view of the very high cost of living, it is impossible for these poor people to experience even what is known as bare comfort.  Deputy Tunney stated that there are about 7,000 people who will be affected if this motion is passed. So far as I understand it, Deputy Byrne's contention was that we should bring the amount allowed to £1, from the existing allowance of 16/-.  We must take into consideration what that would mean annually.  Assuming that 7,000 persons would receive £1 a week, that would mean £350,000 a year and, of course, if Deputy Tunney's suggestion were adopted, it would mean a lot more.  It is questionable if we can afford all this.  Then there is the other consideration, that every other person suffering from old age or any other infirmity would be equally entitled to some increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> Deputy Briscoe referred to the fact that even with 30/- they might not be comfortable.  My answer to that is that millions might not make them happy either.  I am one of those who believe that money alone does not make a person happy, but I do agree that £1 a week is much better than 10/- a week, and that with 30/- a week a person would be much better off than with £1.  But I look at things from a common-sense point of view.  Deputy Briscoe suggests that this motion should be changed to ask that a committee should be set up to examine the whole situation.  I cannot forget that were it not for the fact that Deputy Byrne put down the motion, the suggestion would not have come from Deputy Briscoe.  However, it is not too late.  The Parliamentary Secretary has the right, if he desires, to intimate to the House that he is prepared to set up that committee, and I am sure that Deputy Byrne will accept that guarantee, so to speak, and that every member of the House will accept it also.</P>
    <P>I am not here for the sole reason of being in a position to cast a vote against the Government at all times. After all, each and every one of us has a certain responsibility to those who sent us here, and we must use a certain amount of commonsense.  We have to realise that we are not a great empire possessed of vast wealth and resources of almost inexhaustible extent, and anything of a reasonable nature put by the Parliamentary Secretary will, I am sure, get favourable consideration from the House, including members of the Opposition, and also Deputy Byrne, who proposed the motion.</P>
    <P>But, coming back to the terms of the motion and having personal contact with these poor people, I can quite realise the unfortunate position in which they are placed, especially those who are left on their own resources, having to fend for themselves with a maximum weekly income of 16/-.  A great many of them do not enjoy that 16/- because public bodies do not make the supplementary contributions which the law enables them to do.  Very few blind persons receive anything more <Col N="900" /> than the 10/- and have nothing else to live on.  Speaking on behalf of those people, I think I would be prepared, if the Parliamentary Secretary intimates to the House that he would be willing to set up a committee to inquire into the whole position as it affects all the blind pensioners of this country, to support him and as a result to improve their position.  That is really what Deputy Byrne wants to do through his motion.  If it can be done by any other means, I am sure he will be satisfied and the House, in turn, will be satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I agree, of course, with Deputy Dillon that if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance were to accede to every request made to him for increases in allowances, either to blind people or to others, eventually taxation would reach such a point that people in this country would not be able to bear it.  Nevertheless, I consider, in view of the present exceptionally high cost of living, that some case can be made for, at least, an examination of the conditions under which many of these unfortunate blind pensioners exist.  After all, they are suffering from a terrible affliction&mdash; one of the worst that could affect humanity&mdash;and that, as well as the unfortunate conditions in which they have to exist, should, undoubtedly, make an impression on the Parliamentary Secretary and induce him to grant exceptional treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the local authorities can to some extent subsidise the amount granted by the Minister to blind pensioners but I agree with Deputy Coburn that local authorities do that in very few cases.  In fact, in my experience of one local authority I do not think they assist more than two or three blind pensioners, and I think that could be taken as an index of how pensioners are treated in other counties.  I am perfectly certain that Deputy Byrne will not press his motion if the Minister will give an undertaking that he will consider the case on behalf of pensioners and will if necessary, set up a committee to examine their conditions and the nature of claims made on their behalf. <Col N="901" /> I do think that the changes brought about by the emergency, by the war and the circumstances of the times make it necessary to give some special consideration to the claims of these unfortunate people.  If the Minister is satisfied to set up such a committee, I feel that the House would give him every assistance and that the notice of motion on the Order Paper could be withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment Deputy Briscoe on his approach to this question.  All of us realise what a grave hardship it is for any person to be deprived of the use of his sight.  We realise also that the allowance at present provided for those people by the State is very inadequate if they have to depend upon it for their support, but as Deputy Briscoe pointed out, merely adding to the allowances provided for those people, while desirable and perhaps necessary in this present emergency, is not by any means enough.  It is, I think, the feeling of every Deputy, and I am sure it is the feeling of the Parliamentary Secretary, that everything possible should be done to enable those people to secure that measure of happiness which the ordinary person enjoys through being able to indulge in some employment.  Whether it may be employment that brings profit to themselves or not, it certainly occupies their time and keeps them from brooding on the unhappy conditions in which they have to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything that can be done, therefore, to provide for the training of those people, particularly at an early age, through institutions and other courses, is something which every Deputy will wholeheartedly support, and even more enthusiastically support than any request for an increased allowance.  While I say that there is in this present emergency, having regard to the high cost of living, a case for increasing the allowances, at least temporarily, I would like to urge strongly on the Minister the desirability of accepting the suggestion, put forward so forcefully by Deputy Briscoe of an inquiry into the needs of those people, an inquiry extending beyond the limits of this State, where <Col N="902" /> necessary, to find out what is being done in other States and to see how far we could enable those people to obtain the training which would allow them to employ their time fully and usefully, and in a way beneficial to themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is one that will naturally appeal to people in general.  It is an appeal on behalf of those unfortunate people who suffer from the affliction of blindness.  Such an appeal strikes a sympathetic chord in the hearts of us all.  However deserving it may be, the proposal&mdash;to my mind, good intentioned&mdash;is capable of very serious reactions.  Personally, I agree, as I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary and everybody in the House will agree, that it would be a magnificent thing if we could afford to give these poor citizens an increase.  I believe they should get it.  There is no use in trying to hide the fact that very serious increases in the cost of living have occurred, and it is absurd to say any more that inflation in this country has not set in.  But, to select one class of people, and single them out for special treatment, and play on public feeling on their behalf, leaving out many other sections of the people who require an increased allowance, is not just.</P>
      <P>I am reminded, at the moment, of one section of the community, a most deserving class, which has been left out of consideration entirely.  I refer to disabled people.  There are many families who have included in their numbers some person disabled from birth.  These persons are a burden while their parents live, and probably are well looked after as long as their parents can afford it. After that, when they are almost unable to do anything for themselves, the household is perhaps badly able to support them and to buy the requisites they require in their condition. Why an appeal for that most necessitous class of people has not been made in the past indicates to my mind that the present application is not seriously intended, and has not as its foundation real consideration for the most necessitous class of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> I also have in mind many of our workers who have fairly big families, and who are tied down to a standard of wages not comparable at all with the cost of living.  Why should not that section of the community also be included in the increased allowances from the State or from the industry in which they can make their living, if industry can afford to pay the increase?  They, too, are deserving of consideration.  I could draw very telling pictures of many of the working families I know throughout the country.  They are compelled to exist on a standard of wages which, in view of increased prices, has not kept in step with the necessary outlay of their families.</P>
    <P>Why leave out old age pensioners? They, too, are compelled to live on the restricted allowances they had before the war.  Why not include them?  Why are they left out of consideration?  I think that the proposal, however kindly and well intentioned it may be, to consider one class of the community for special treatment over other classes is not equitable, and I do not think that a Legislative Assembly should pursue that course of action.  What we should do is to face the position that the allowances of three or four years ago&mdash; even of last year&mdash;are no longer equal to the demand or to meet the cost of essential things.  The Government will, one day, have to realise if this condition of affairs continues, that it is absurd to try to hold down prices and wages to a standard unless, at the same time, the conditions of the people are being kept in step with the increases in the cost of living.  They are not.</P>
    <P>No matter how vigorously the Minister for Supplies tries to control prices, he has not succeeded entirely, or anything like it.  In regard to certain commodities prices continue to rise beyond those fixed by the Government.  We are only closing our eyes to the facts when we quote statistics and show that the cost of living is such-and-such a figure.  That figure is not at all representative of the cost of living.  Whatever the Government may do about it, I think that the Children's Allowances <Col N="904" /> Bill has more effectively brought people face to face with the realities of our economic condition here than any other Bill that has come before the House.  These family allowances must be paid for by the poorest of our people.  In all probability the financing of it will lean heavily on the poor as well as on the middle classes.  The latter will have to contribute pretty heavily, to an extent probably beyond their means.  If we are going to extend these services indefinitely, we know that we will have to do with a lesser number of things and contribute to the point where it will hurt most.</P>
    <P>It is probable that an examination of the whole order of affairs here will be necessary.  If our economy is going to be controlled by the present system of capital, under which we live, and if that order is going to be continued, then I am afraid it will have serious reactions.  The point will be reached wherein conditions will hardly be able to bear the strain that is going to be imposed on them.  I have said before in this House that the only solution for all this, to my way of thinking, is that we should try to get our people's minds away from the thing called &ldquo;money&rdquo; instead of making it the be-all and end-all of every enterprise, and of every plan that actuates men's minds, in the Dáil and elsewhere. When we ask for an increased allowance of money for this or that section of the people, we have got to realise that far more importance must be placed upon the things that we buy for money, and that an abundance of goods is of infinitely greater importance to the community than money in abundance.  The thing is to find the means by which, when goods are there, they can be made available for those who need them.</P>
    <P>At present the medium for doing that is money.  Money is not plentiful enough in circulation.  Probably, in some quarters it is so plentiful as to be beyond the needs of those who have it, but, in a general way, it is not available to the general community to enable them to keep in step with the ever-increasing cost of living.  It may be that if the strain proves to be too great for the social conditions which <Col N="905" /> we have been seeking to build up, we may then have to find some alternative such as increased allowances for blind people.  I would strongly urge that every other section which is living upon a narrow margin should also be provided for.  I am against making sectional differences, and because of that I am opposing the motion.  I will accept it and support it if all other sections who are needy are included in the survey.  Whatever inconveniences the Government or the community may find in providing for a levelling-up in the case of those sections of our people which need a levelling-up, I am prepared to incur the risk of taking responsibility for such a levelling-up, but only, as I say, if all sections are included in a general survey.  I am opposing any sectional advance on the lines suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recommend the acceptance of this motion to the House.  It is not necessary that I should say much in defence of that attitude because other speakers have already indicated fairly clearly to the House that we cannot concede what this motion is intended to secure to one section of the community without taking into consideration its repercussions on other sections of the community who are perhaps in equal, if not greater, distress.  The motion, as Deputies are aware, describes the present allowance to the blind as totally inadequate.  It calls for amending legislation that will permit of the total payments from all sources to be increased. The motion clearly contemplates that not only will the allowances to blind persons by way of State pension be increased, but that the allowances under the food voucher schemes, the cheap fuel scheme, the local authorities' schemes shall all be increased, with no very definite indication as to the extent of the increase.  It is true that Deputy Byrne has mentioned the figure of £1 a week for single blind persons.  In the particular area that Deputy Byrne is most concerned with, as I shall show the House later, single blind persons are at present in receipt of more than £1 a week.  I, personally, <Col N="906" /> would be more concerned about the married blind pensioner who has a wife and dependent children, but they, too, are in receipt of fairly generous allowances taking all things into consideration, under present conditions.  At any rate, if we are to improve the financial condition of our blind pensioners we must make a similar improvement in the financial condition of old age pensioners, widows and orphans, unemployment assistance recipients, the recipients of home assistance, and so on.</P>

      <P>But I will be pardoned if I remind the House that 12 years ago, when I tried in this House to improve the conditions of the blind, I did not get the support of some of the Parties who are supporting this now.  I welcome the change.  But, I am entitled to point out to the House that since this Government took office the conditions of the blind have been very substantially improved.  Away back in 1931 when a Bill was introduced in this House that embodied improvement of the conditions of the blind it was passed by a majority of the House but it was not accepted by the Government of the day.  It has since been made effective and is to-day the law of the land.  It is well that Deputies should realise that that particular enactment is a substantial improvement of the position of the blind.  There are three important changes in so far as the blind <Col N="907" /> are concerned.  Under the old age pensions law before this Government came into office a blind person in order to be qualified to secure a State blind pension had to be so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eyesight was essential.  In other words, if a claimant to a blind pension had sufficient sight to be able to perform any work for which eyesight was essential he could not qualify for the pension.  The claimant had to be stone blind.  Now we altered that and at the present time the claimant can qualify for a State blind pension if he is so blind as not to be able because of defective sight to follow his ordinary occupation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the only change that was made.  Before the Act was passed by the present Government, the claimant had to be 50 years of age as well as satisfying the test as to the degree of blindness before he could be eligible for a blind pension.  We reduced the age to 30 years.  That I think was a substantial concession to the blind, but the most important amendment with the most far-reaching results for the blind, was the removal of the section that provided that in estimating the means account should be taken of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by the claimant.  Under that section no matter from what source a blind person secured a benefit or privilege, whether from a charitable organisation or whether from a child who had got on in the world to be in a position to maintain a blind parent, that maintenance was estimated as income against the claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We changed that and we are entitled to some credit for that.  I do not suppose we will get it, but at any rate I think nobody can complain if I direct the attention of the House to the radical changes that this Government has made in the law in so far as it <Col N="908" /> applies to blind persons.  I should like to see a whole lot more done for them. I have already indicated that it is not to-day or yesterday that I have manifested a practical interest in them and in other sections of the depressed classes.  But these things cost money. That is the trouble.  I would be as happy as any Deputy in this House if we could provide the 30/- for a single blind pensioner that Deputy Tunney considers would be necessary.  More would probably be necessary to maintain him in complete comfort, but if we are to be asked to do this do not let Deputies in the same breath complain about rising taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and you will want £2,250,000 for a Bill that is before the House.  The Government is in the position that the line has to be drawn somewhere, and when Deputies go down the country and get on to the platform, or even at the cross-roads, they sometimes describe this Fianna Fáil Government as being very extravagant, and point to the fact that we have increased taxation.  They do not always point out the manner in which we have imposed taxation or the purposes for which we have exacted the additional contributions.  Now if on this social question we could put our heads together and if we could agree, unanimously agree, to go before the country and defend before the country any expenditure that was for the purpose of improving the economic conditions of the poorer sections of our community, whether that charge was going to be a charge on the central taxation or whether it was to be a charge on local taxation, we would prove our earnestness in these matters. If we stopped the criticism about rising rates and taxes and if we used a little influence over newspapers over which we might have influence, so that they should not complain of rising rates and taxes if they were increased for purposes such as we have under discussion to-night, we could then claim to be sincere in our concern for the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not hope ever to see in this country a condition of things under which charity will no longer be necessary. <Col N="909" /> Speaking for myself, I want to confess quite frankly that I do not think it is a desirable aim at all.  It seems to me that there will always be scope in this country for charitable organisations and it seems to me that there is more spiritual benefit from the assistance that is provided through a charitable organisation than there is through the financial assistance that is disbursed by what is sometimes called the cold hand of the machinery of the State.  In the City of Dublin that Deputy Byrne (Senior) and Deputy Byrne (Junior) have been returned to this House to represent, there is an enormous amount of work being done by charitable organisations, such organisations as the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Catholic Social Service Conference to mention only a couple.  I do think that if the State bears a reasonable share of the burden it is far from being wrong in this Christian State to leave scope for the exercise of Christian charity.  That view may not find a general acceptance but it seems to me that it is a better demonstration of Christian charity voluntarily to part with some of the extra world's wealth that you happen to have in order to assist your fellowmen than that you should wait to have it extracted from you by process of law.  By all means let it be by process of law too, and particularly from the classes of the community who are not willing to part with a share of their wealth.  That raises other thoughts and it is a matter we may, perhaps, have an opportunity of talking about again.</P>
    <P>Let me say this: some Deputies hinted at it, some Deputies seemed to have a vague notion about it, but no Deputy who spoke in this debate to-night seemed to understand clearly what provision is made within the law for looking after our blind pensioners in this State.  At the present time in addition to providing a sum, namely 10/- per week, from the State, the law also provides that local authorities shall put into operation a blind welfare scheme within their area.  It has been said to-night truthfully said, that the cash income cannot exceed 16/- a week, that is 10/- <Col N="910" /> from the State pension with 6/- pension from the local authority or some other source.  That is true, but the local authority is not restricted in that way in the matter of making provision for the blind.  They are not restricted to giving assistance in the form of cash.</P>
    <P>The local authority can incorporate in their blind welfare scheme provision for assisting the blind in kind, by way of food allowances, by way of clothing allowances and in the hundred and one ways that they can assist, and they are only circumscribed in the amount of cash that can be given in addition to the 10/- State pension.  Only 6/- in cash can be given in addition, but they can come up to Deputy Byrne's £1 per week without restriction whatever by making allowances in kind.  In fact in the City of Dublin at the present time, when we take into consideration the combined State pension scheme and the local authority scheme, we find that a single blind person gets a State blind pension of 10/- per week, he gets 6/- from the local authority blind welfare scheme; he gets food vouchers to the value of 2/6 a week under the Department of Industry and Commerce food voucher scheme.  He gets in addition vouchers to the value of 4/- a week, which has recently been sanctioned, to purchase food or other requisites.  In fact, a single blind pensioner in Dublin at the present time has a weekly income of 25/-, including fuel allowance.  That is getting very near to the point at which Deputy Tunney set his flag.  When we come to the married blind pensioner with two dependents, we find that he has 10/- of a State pension, under the corporation blind welfare scheme he has 12/- for himself and his wife 6/-, for the children, food vouchers to the value of 7/6 under the State food voucher scheme, and under the corporation food vouchers scheme 4/-.  In addition to that, each recipient of the blind pension is entitled to a fuel allowance valued at 3/2 per week.  The married blind pensioner with two children is at present in receipt, between cash, food vouchers and cheap fuel of 42/2 per week.  It may not be sufficient, but it is a fairly <Col N="911" /> generous allowance taking all things into consideration and remembering that it has to be related to the provision that the State and the local authority are able to make for similar sections of the depressed classes of the community.</P>
    <P>I therefore do not think that we can at the present time make any further concession.  I have not the separate figures for annual State expenditure on blind pensions, because the pensions are subject to the same means test as old age pensions and, consequently, I have only the inclusive figure.  But I would remind the House that in 1931-32 the figure stood at £2,695,632, while the estimated expenditure for 1943-44 is £3,935,000&mdash;almost £4,000,000.  It may not be enough, it may not be near enough, but it ought to be granted at any rate that it is a very substantial improvement on the provision that was made ten or 12 years ago.</P>
    <P>If the House should think that the whole field of our social services ought to be surveyed, that is a different matter.  A motion can be put down to deal with that matter and it can be fully discussed, and, as I said earlier here to-night, the House can decide on the standard of security that the State is to provide for the poorer sections of the community.  The House can decide a more important factor; the House can decide how that huge scheme is to be financed, if we are not doing sufficient for these depressed classes at the present time.  I will repeat that, personally, I should be very glad to see more generous treatment for all sections of the poor and, particularly, the blind.  But we are in the position that expenditure is mounting rapidly, taxation is mounting rapidly, rates are mounting rapidly, and that there is a good share of criticism, notwithstanding the fact that the improvement in our social services to a very large extent, when you leave out the additional expenditure on the Army, is largely responsible for the increased taxation which the general community are called upon to bear.</P>

      <P>While I, in common with everyone else, naturally would have the greatest sympathy with any <Col N="912" /> person who suffered the tragedy of being afflicted with partial or total blindness, I see great difficulty, particularly as regards this motion, and generally as regards all the Private Deputies' motions that are now placed on the Order Paper.  There are, I think, 13 in all, and ten of the 13 are making demands for increased moneys from the State for the benefit of particular people.  There is a demand in this particular one, which possibly would be the smallest of the lot in terms of actual cash, for additional money.  There is a demand from other parts of the House for money in respect of tillage.</P>
      <P>There are demands for additional money for other types of pensions and assistance.  The difficulty I see, if we are to legislate by motions such as this, is that we will get nothing here&mdash; even though they may be justified in point of time or of necessity&mdash;but demand after demand from sectional interests in the community that the State should provide extra benefits for each particular section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something in what the Parliamentary Secretary said, that if we do face the situation as a whole and have a survey of our people's needs in their entirety, one can then consider burdening the State to a great extent with the moneys that would be necessary to give everybody in the community a reasonably good standard of income.  But I doubt very much the wisdom of this House or any Government giving way time after time to purely sectional demands of this kind&mdash; not of course that this particular one could be described as an actual sectional demand.  What I feel about it is this.  We have to face the situation that we have a very small pool from which to draw our national taxation. We have to face the situation that every penny we pay out in increased benefits and allowances of any kind will have to be got from the people of the country, and that there is a vast number of people, even though they are workers or farmers or small traders who are actually earning and in gainful employment, living on very small incomes at the moment and who have been for many years living upon very small incomes.  These are the <Col N="913" /> people that this will react upon and that every bit of money spent by this House will react upon in the shape of increased taxation, and the benefits that will accrue to individuals will merely mean handing them out money, whether by way of cash or vouchers, and taking it back from them by way of increased taxation and an increased cost of living.</P>
    <P>I can imagine that a case could be made&mdash;as some Deputies have made it &mdash;that, naturally, persons afflicted with blindness are in a much more serious position than anybody else; whether the allowances made for them are adequate or not is hardly the real point.  But there are thousands of other people, people with families, even people who are working, who are on such a low income at present and whose standard of living is so low, that it is very hard to justify giving way to any type of sectional demand that will impose on them a further burden by way of increased taxation or an increased cost of living.  I am not sure that we are facing the position properly by attempting to deal with motions like this, because I am satisfied that, if this continues, every section of the community, if they find the House or the Government giving way to one section, will make demands upon the State for increased benefits for their own particular section.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that this House would be justified, apart from this particular motion, in passing a whole series of motions which will increase the general taxation of the country and increase the burden placed upon the community at large, and which will naturally be particularly heavy on the poorer section of the community.  I believe that, if this House were to give way to all these demands, it would be a tragedy if the vast majority of the people, who are living on very low incomes and facing a very uncertain future on a very low standard of living, and who have no possible prospect of increasing either their wages or their business or the means they have of earning extra money, were to be more and more harassed by increased taxation and by an increased cost of living.  If there was any of these motions which I feel we should give <Col N="914" /> way on, it certainly would be this one dealing with the blind, but I am doubtful about the wisdom of any Deputy merely putting down a demand of this nature asking for increased benefits for any section without facing the situation as to what the reaction will be on the poorer section of the community and what the reaction will be on national taxation.</P>

      <P>The debate, I think, has done some good in providing an opportunity for discussing the conditions of the blind.  Members of the Government Party have contributed to the debate.  Most speakers referred to the general question of the conditions of blind persons and the arrangements for educating and helping them in other ways.  I am glad the suggestion came from a member of the Government Party, Deputy Briscoe, that the Parliamentary Secretary should go very deeply into the whole problem.  This motion was primarily intended to draw attention to the urgent necessities of blind persons whose allowances, in present circumstances, cannot exceed 16/-.  The Parliamentary Secretary has himself admitted the position in that regard. No Deputy made any effort to show that that was a fair allowance for those persons.  It is generally agreed that the amount is inadequate. The Parliamentary Secretary spoke about the changes which have been made by the present Government.  We all appreciate those changes.  The Government have done a certain amount of good work even if they have been slow in doing it.  But that is not enough.  Many blind persons are living in a condition which we ought not to tolerate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the assistance in kind received by blind persons.  I am surprised that he spoke about the 4/- food voucher, sanction for the issue of which was recently given.  He did not tell the House of the struggle which various organisations working for the blind, and other persons interested, had to get the sanction of his Department for that small concession.  The Parliamentary Secretary also referred to the leaving of a certain amount of scope for the work <Col N="915" /> of Christian charity.  That is all very well but it would be preferable, in this case, at any rate, that blind persons should not have to depend on charity and that the State should help those of them who are not able by their work to bring a sufficient income to their homes.  Many organisations are doing very good work, but it is very wrong that any person should, because he is afflicted with blindness, have to look for, or receive, charity.</P>

      <P>Up to to-night, I thought that the motion which I now propose would be much criticised.  On account of the fact that it is one of the few motions which does not provide for expenditure but rather tends to help the Department of Finance, I expect that it will have the support of the Government Party.  Moreover, I was much struck by the statement made by Deputy Linehan and I expect it will have his support also.  I shall not detain the House very long in moving the motion as I shall have an opportunity of replying to the debate. I have a few reasons for moving the motion.  I think that the one thing which we, in this House, should never do is set ourselves up as a privileged class.  When we, as legislators, decide that certain sections of the community <Col N="916" /> outside should contribute in income-tax and leave ourselves exempt, we lower the dignity of the House and, to a certain extent, we put ourselves in a position in which the respect that should exist for us does not exist.  Of course, the case will be made that this is an allowance, not a salary, but my opinion is that it is a salary and a good salary.  It is a salary of £480 a year to people who come in here to work for their constituents.  No man can deny that it is anything else.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that there is anything in the contention that it is an allowance and that allowances are not subject to income-tax.  Let us look at the matter without prejudice.  Take the case of the medical officer.  To a certain extent, you can say that his pay is also an allowance.  Take the case of the clergyman.  To a certain extent, you can say that his income is also an allowance.  Therefore, I think that there is no reason whatever why Deputies' allowances should be exempt from tax.  I believe that this proposal will be unpopular and I believe that quite a few Deputies have been all day waiting for me to move this motion so as to be able to tell me that it is propaganda. Such is not the case.  It is not moved for propagandist or any such purposes.  So I hope that I am forestalling those Deputies in what I am now saying.  I bring forward this motion because, to a certain extent, when that measure was passed, it amounted to this: We said to the country: &ldquo;Do as we say, but do not do as we do.&rdquo;  That is class legislation. As I have said already, I shall have an opportunity of replying to the debate, and I shall conclude now by formally moving the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the amendment is moved, I would like to say that I am afraid that Deputy Donnellan is not a good prophet.  He says he expected support for this motion from the Government Benches, and, in view of <Col N="917" /> Deputy Linehan's speech, from the Fine Gael Benches also.  I have no hesitation in supporting his proposal from the Labour Benches, though apparently he did not expect that he would get any support from this quarter. When the allowances, as they are called, were passed for Deputies, I expressed in the other House how unjust it was that they should have got this increased allowance, and that it should be free of income-tax.  I have no hesitation in repeating the same to-night.</P>
      <P>When I see the small miserable amount on which we ask the farm labourers in this nation to go out and toil in the production of food for ourselves, the men on whom we are dependent to produce our breakfasts, dinners and suppers, and when I see Dáil Deputies, who can go on holidays tomorrow and return in February, getting £480 compared with £100 to the farm labourers, I think it is wrong, and I have no hesitation at all in saying that the Deputy's allowance should not be free of income-tax.  After all, the ordinary man in the street must be taken into consideration, because income-tax in this country is reasonably high.  As far as I am concerned, I would like to see everybody with such a high salary that he would be forced to pay income-tax.  But everyone of those people who are now liable for income-tax feels very keenly the fact that the people who pass the law forcing them to pay are exempt from it themselves.  I would like to appeal to the House to have this motion passed unanimously.  The previous motion was criticised because it involved extra taxation.  Nobody can criticise this motion for that reason because it means a reduction in taxation.  The case was put up during the debate on the previous motion that the State could not afford to give more than 10/- per week to an unfortunate blind person, unfit and incapable of providing for himself in any shape or form; but the same State can give £480 free of income-tax to Dáil Deputies who can spend almost half the year on holidays if their consciences do not compel them to do otherwise.</P>

      <P>I would like Deputy Dillon to understand that I am not dealing with the motion as it affects the nation to-day but as it affects the nation for all time.  I am one of those who realise that the allowance the Dáil Deputy gets is not all his own.  There are certain costs and demands which a Deputy must meet whether he likes it or not.  The majority of Deputies like to subscribe to different charities and other things, both in their constituency and in other parts of the country. Nevertheless, it would be far better-if they were forced to increase that amount, and at the same time be left subject to income-tax.</P>
      <P>It is a very bad principle and a bad headline to the State.  In expressing this I am expressing not alone my own personal view, but I hope it is the view of every member of the Labour Party, because I feel that one section of the community should not be so privileged as Deputies and Senators are.  I think, as Deputy Linehan has said, that the time has come when there should be a review of the whole position.  Is it not ridiculous that in a nation where we starve the most important section of the community&mdash;the farm labourer&mdash;that we have such a lavish allowance for people in other directions?  I do not believe that there is one Deputy in this House who will get up here and say it is just that the members who make the laws compelling other people to pay income-tax should vote to exempt themselves from it.  It is not a matter of the amount involved.  It is the principle that is involved, and for the sake of keeping up the dignity of the House I hope that, on principle alone, the motion will be accepted unanimously, and in supporting it nobody can say that I am supporting increased taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to <Col N="919" /> agree with the principle that members of this House should pay income-tax, but at the same time, if I might express my own personal opinion, I may say that before I came into this House I was very independent and I owed nothing.  But since I came here I lost that independence as I owe money.  I must admit that there are certain Deputies who do not travel throughout their constituencies, and there may be Deputies who may not be very active as far as correspondence goes. In my case I receive a cheque of £40 a month.  My postage bill for the month is £8 and sometimes £9 for 2½d. stamps alone.  In a hotel here I have to pay £6 a month, and every time I go down to the restaurant here to get my dinner, it is 3/6 or 4/2.  It is in the restaurant that we pay our income-tax. It is wholesale robbery.  If you stay here for three days it is 15/- for dinners alone, and if you stay for your tea, it is three times 7/6.  A Deputy who smokes will sometimes spend a shilling or two in cigarettes every day, and by the time he has his meals and his smokes paid for, and by the time that a new Deputy, like myself, has his election debts paid, it is very easy to talk about a cheque at the end of a month. There may be Deputies in this House that could live if they were never elected, but we must talk plain facts. I am a Deputy with no other job, and if I were a married man I could safely say that I could not discharge my obligations to the satisfaction of my constituents, judged by the way I am going on at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are expected from time to time to attend social functions.  By every post that comes in, there are letters coming to Deputies appealing for subscriptions for this, that and the other.  We have to acknowledge them, especially if they come from our own constituents.  If we do not acknowledge them, I can safely say that when we next appear before our constituents for election we shall be told: &ldquo;We sent you an appeal for a subscription and you did not think it worth while to reply to it.  We are responsible for <Col N="920" /> paying you £480 a year and you would not think it worth your while to give us a contribution of 5/-, 10/- or £1 towards that particular fund.&rdquo;  It is all very fine for some independent Deputy, like Deputy Dillon, to say that he is agreeable to pay income-tax on his allowances but he is getting his share out of the people by other means, as well as by the fact of this being a member of this House.  At the same time, I am inclined to agree with the principle of the proposal but when we look at it from the point of view of our pockets it is different.  We are the very men who make our constituents pay income-tax but we do not pay it ourselves on our allowances.  There is something very wrong with that arrangement and I shall, therefore, support the principle of Deputy Donnellan's motion.</P>
    <P>There is, however, another point I want to make in that connection. While it may be all very well to make Deputies pay income-tax on their allowances, I think it is time that they should be allowed free postage.  The question of free postage for Deputies has I think been brought up time and again in this House.  It should be free because a Deputy is dealing with somethings like 400 or 500 letters a week.  I have often received as many as 70 letters a day.  The reply to each of them must have a 2½d. stamp and, in order to forward the reply you get from a Minister, you must purchase another 2½d. stamp.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment in my name.  The amendment was put down by me because I was aware that outside the House a campaign had been carried on against members of this House.  That campaign has now been carried into this House by some members of the House. It was in order to expose what I consider a dishonest motion&mdash;though I do not think it is really dishonest in intention, but rather a motion that was put down without any realisation of the facts&mdash;that I carefully framed, in language which I think meets the income-tax code, the amendment before the House.  The motion which we are discussing says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the allowances paid to members of the Oireachtas should cease to be exempt from income-tax.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mover of that motion is the head of a new Party.  I think I can fairly <Col N="922" /> say that when the members of that Party made their first Speeches in this House last summer, after the general election, I welcomed them here.</P>
    <P>If there is one thing calculated to secure the continuance of democracy in this country it is that politicians should not be put up, to be made cockshots of, by the public because they are politicians. The country must have a Dáil and it must have the number of Deputies provided for by legislation attending here.  If we were not here, an equal number of other people would be here.</P>
    <P>It may be a very popular thing to decry the members of this House.  One paper, in particular, has carried on a campaign against us for the purpose of suggesting that in some way we are placing ourselves above the members of the public, that we want to be something better than other members of the community because this House, or a previous House, voted a certain small allowance free of income-tax for Deputies.  If Deputies will be kind enough to examine the amendment standing in my name they will see that there are two very important words in it.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To add at the end, after the word &ldquo;tax&rdquo; the following words: &ldquo;and that for the purpose of arriving at the amount of assessable income in respect of members of Dáil Eireann a sum of at least £250&rdquo;, etc.</P>
    <P>I would ask members of the House to consider these words &ldquo;at least £250&rdquo;, so that members of the Farmers' Party will understand that we are dealing with realities here.  Do they suggest that what we are getting, £480 a year, is earned income?  Do they suggest it is something for which we are paid for work?  In their own motion the word &ldquo;allowances&rdquo; is used&mdash;&ldquo;allowances paid to members&rdquo;.  Let me disillusion the mover of this motion on one important point.  I am not here speaking individually as a person who is averse to the idea of income-tax. For years past I earned my living night and day outside this House and paid income-tax on what I earned.  Do the members of the Farmers' Party realise this&mdash;I assume that, as they are <Col N="923" /> a Farmers' Party, they have farms&mdash; do they realise that if they succeed in carrying this motion through the House, their local income-tax inspector will be around with them the next morning to ask them to make out an income-tax return&mdash;not on the allowances that they get here or anywhere else, but according to the valuation of their farms?  Do they realise that?  Do they realise also that when they presume to speak on behalf of the farming community in this matter, they are going to bring into the income-tax arena every farmer whose poor-law valuation is over £100?  Of course, there might be a case of a farmer who has money in the bank, or invested in Guinness's or something of that kind.</P>
    <P>This, Sir, in my opinion, is the most dishonest motion that has ever been put down in this House.  I seldom speak so strongly, but that is my opinion, and my amendment was put down solely for the purpose of directing attention to the dishonesty of the motion.  Let us take another example.  Let us assume that some members of the Farmers' Party have no farms themselves&mdash;that they are people who have come to be known by the public, generally, as professional politicians.  I say that, because to most of the people in this country the most unpopular person, next to a lawyer, is a politician.  However let us assume that some of these people have no farms and come in here and get an allowance of £480 per year.  Where do they get off in that case?  Assuming that they succeed in carrying this motion, I presume that when the local income-tax inspector comes around to see them, they will say: &ldquo;Certainly; assess me for income-tax on £480 a year&rdquo;; but then, of course, they will get advice from their friends who will say: &ldquo;Do not you have to send many letters and telegrams, and do not you have to pay your hotel expenses in Dublin; do not you also have to pay your costs in the last election and make provision for your costs in the next election?&rdquo; I suggest that you will not be able to arrive at a figure of less than £250 a year by way of legitimate expenses in the case of <Col N="924" /> members of the Dáil, or £150 in the case of members of the Seanad.  I think I can vouch for the fact that a sum of £250 per annum could be reckoned as legitimate expenses, and if you deduct that from £480, you get £230 as assessable income.  Does the mover of the motion realise that the result of that would be, with the allowance of one-sixth on earned income, amounting to £40, there would be left only £190 on which income-tax would be payable?  It is for that reason that I say that this is a dishonest motion.  If the person concerned is a married man without children, he is also entitled to further relief, amounting to £225, and so he does not have to pay income-tax at all, and if he is a single man he would only have to pay a tax on £65.  As I have said, this is the most dishonest motion that was ever brought into this House, and it was brought in merely for the purpose of currying favour with the public.</P>

      <P>The object of this motion, in my opinion, is to show the difference between the action of this Dáil and the previous one; but the point is that, if these allowances were to be subject to income-tax, a number of people would get away without having to pay any income-tax. Reference has been made here to the principle of the matter.  I do not think that there is any question of principle here at all, however it may be claimed by certain people that there is a question of principle involved.  We hear the phrase used that the principle of income-tax should be applied to members of the Dáil &ldquo;in the same way as to everybody else&rdquo;.  I do not think that there is any question of principle involved here at all.  We have got very little information from the mover or seconder of this motion with regard to that matter.  What is meant by the phrase &ldquo;the same as everybody else&rdquo;? Why, even in this Dáil, there are marked differences between the allowances that certain people are in receipt of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" /> Take the case of a Minister with £1,500 a year of earned income; does he pay tax on that whole amount? Of course, he does not.  First of all, on the £480 a year, which is an allowance from this Dáil, no income-tax has to be paid.  Why is that?  That is an allowance made by the Dáil; but in the case of a person, who is not a member of the Dáil, and who is also in receipt of £1,500, there is no such deduction.  What, then, is the meaning of this phrase, &ldquo;the same as everybody else?&rdquo;  Even in business, there are allowances in respect of depreciation, or things of that kind&mdash;sometimes not sufficient, but more often in excess of the amount claimed.  Therefore, I think that there is very little in the use of this phrase, &ldquo;the same as everybody else.&rdquo;  The real question at issue here is: what is a fair sum to be paid in connection with either salaries or allowances&mdash;whichever you like to call it&mdash;compared with what is paid in other countries, and I think that what is paid here compares favourably with what is paid in other countries.  Take, for instance, the British Commonwealth of Nations, with which, perhaps, we have had more contacts than with other countries. There is only one member of the British Commonwealth of Nations which pays less, in cash, than we do, to their representatives.  New Zealand pays £480 per annum, but it gives other allowances and privileges which the members of this Oireachtas are not in receipt of.  In South Africa, the members of the Legislative Assembly are paid £700 a year.  In Canada, representatives of the Legislative Assembly are paid £4,000 dollars a year, which is the equivalent of £800 a year; and in Australia, the allowance is £1,000.  Now, some people regard these payments as salaries, while other people regard them as allowances. What exactly is meant by the word &ldquo;allowance&rdquo;?  Let us take this motion at its face value.  It says that the allowances payable to members of the Oireachtas should cease to be exempt from income-tax.  Well, in that connection, let us take the case that was made a moment ago by Deputy Flanagan&mdash;perhaps I should say Deputy O'Flanagan.</P>

When the question of being allowed for these subscriptions arises, can it be conceived that an income-tax inspector, seeing in the one case a subscription of £5 and in the other a subscription of 5/-, will allow the man who gives the £5 subscription the amount of his subscription, whereas he will allow Deputy Flanagan only 5/-?  There is discrimination there.  If he does not allow the £5, obviously the Deputy who gives that subscription is being charged in respect of a sum in excess of what he has in income.</P>
      <P>I thought we would have heard some case made when the motion was being introduced.  No case was made for it. We are prepared to listen to a case. I would have much greater respect for the motion if it ran: &ldquo;... shall cease to be exempt from income-tax, and that the assessment shall be at the rate of 7/6 in the £ in respect of every £1.&rdquo; We would know where we were then. We do not know where we are now, or what it means.  For something like 20 years there has been criticism of the amounts paid as allowances to members of the Dáil.  We had the Fianna Fáil Party, when it was in the wilderness, attacking it.  After a while they dropped it, and a change was made some years ago.  I took no part in the discussion of that change.  I think that such a case as was made here by Deputy Flanagan is a case which would appeal to me.  I should rather see somebody else getting off with perhaps a few pounds extra than to do an injustice to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum involved is not very considerable, because if we take the whole <Col N="928" /> value of 7/6 in the £ on every £1 of the £480 paid here and every £1 of the £360 paid in the Seanad, it would not amount to 33,000.  The best effort which can be made in respect of the rehabilitation and reinvigoration of this country by the Party responsible for this motion is to put down a motion to take up time talking about a possible saving, an exaggerated saving, a saving that would never be achieved. of £33,000.</P>
    <P>Is it not nonsensical that, at a time when the world is rocking round about us, when we have problems to discuss here, when we have post-war conditions to envisage and present conditions to consider, the best gesture that can be made by the Party which has just come into existence is to save £33,000, on the assumption that there was added to their proposal the sentence I have suggested: &ldquo;That income-tax shall be charged on every £1 of that allowances at the rate of 7/6 in the £1&rdquo;?  That is not there.</P>
    <P>Some people want to get out of this without paying 1d., merely on the basis of indicating to the people outside that we are going to impose income-tax here &ldquo;the same as every body else&rdquo;, when, as I have said, there are probably not two persons in the country assessed on the same basis of assessment.  What is the matter with regard to this motion is that people outside, this being a poor country in certain respects, consider that whatever is paid here as an allowance or salary&mdash;whichever way you wish to regard it&mdash;is a large amount. It is a large amount to a person down the country who does not leave his neighbourhood, except for the purpose-of whatever business he is engaged in, going to the parish church on occasion and so on.  A sum of £480 appears to him to be a sum which can be put in the bank.  We have heard from one Deputy this evening that that is not the case.  Will he be allowed any sums in excess of what he would spend if he were at home?</P>
    <P>This whole matter would tax the ingenuity of income-tax inspectors all over the country, if it were to be interpreted as it is phrased at present.  Its <Col N="929" /> meaning is not perfectly clear to me. It says that these allowances &ldquo;should cease to be exempt from income-tax&rdquo;. Is there to be any allowance in respect of one-fifth of earned income?  Is it to be regarded as earned income?  We are not told that by the mover.  I wonder does he know.  Surely when a proposal of this sort comes up, we are at least entitled to hear a clear and lucid explanation of it.  Is the mover prepared to add to his motion that these allowances should be liable for income-tax at the full rate of 7/6 in the £1?  He will get a very different reception in the House if he does.  I suggest that, in the interests of public decency, a matter of this sort should be dealt with finally, and if there is no better way of dealing with it, a select committee should consider it.  If the £480 now paid as an allowance is considered by a select committee to be excessive, then fix a figure, and let those who are best qualified to inform the committee as to what the expenses are set them out.</P>
    <P>We had that procedure before.  We had this matter subjected to examination by a commission.  It was examined by a commission of mixed people, representing, I might almost say, a cross-section of the people.  It is quite true that that committee did not make any recommendation for a change in the sum of £360 then being paid, and, no recommendation having been made, the Government, in its wisdom or unwisdom, brought in a proposal to increase the amount to £480, submitted it to the House, and carried it. There has been a general election since.  It is quite true that a great deal of criticism was passed upon the increase then made, but if we take the change which has taken place in the representation as an indication of support of that criticism, there is no evidence whatever of it.  As I said before, this matter has been dealt with very largely on the platform and in the Press, and, assuming that the motion means more than it says, the full and entire saving which would ensue amounts to £30,000.  Is it worth it?</P>
    <P>We are told that there is a question <Col N="930" /> of principle involved.  What principle is there in it?  Does anybody know that, under the income-tax laws, allowances pass as free from tax?  The only question that remains is: is it an excessive amount?  I am prepared to have that discussed and settled by a committee which will take counsel with persons who have experience, and, in that case, those who live farthest away from Dublin and who have consequently to meet greater expenses than those who live in or around Dublin should get the opportunity of putting a case before the committee</P>
    <P>I hope we are not going to be told, so far as our richer neighbours across the water are concerned, that there they pay only £600, of which £100 is non-taxable, being regarded as an allowance.  Representation in the Parliament across the water is drawn from a section of people who are far better off than will be got for representation in this House.  More than half of them would not require any allowance while the other half, if the necessity arose, would have institutions or other organisations which would enable them to take part in public life, regardless of whatever expense they might be put to.  A very good case could be made for paying nothing whatever, but that was not considered advisable in any of the Dála elected since the inception of this House.  That was the view taken by them.  The only question to be solved is whether or not the amount allowed is excessive.  I think whatever amount is paid, it should be the same to every person and that there should be no distinction made between one Deputy and another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this motion for two reasons, the first being that in the present emergency members of this House should set a good example. They should show a cheerful willingness to shoulder the added burdens which the war has brought about.  Members of the Dáil are not the highest paid or the best-off people in the community.  Everybody admits that.  Every Deputy realises that there is no need to be told that by any side. <Col N="931" /> As co-equal citizens we realise that there are others whose wallets or purses would weigh down ours.  For example, the average industrialist or big landlord would scoff at £480 yearly free of income-tax.  I realise that to suggest to such people that £480 free of income-tax was an excessive allowance would be like Deputy Cosgrave or his colleagues suggesting that we have barely sufficient or not enough. Time and time again the Deputy demanded to know the reason why this motion was put down.  Indirectly he suggested that it was put down for political reasons, in order that we might be able to secure some political advantage when we go before the people in the near future.  I shall explain to the House why the motion was put down.  There are sound reasons for doing so.  It is no wonder that Deputies opposite, who voted for the increase in 1939, combine when the motion touches them.</P>
      <P>On October 13th the <i>Irish Press</i> in a leading article stated: &ldquo;There is not a prominent company director whose income is not treble what a member of the Cabinet receives&rdquo;.  That is probably true.  In 1940-41, the second year of this war, 65 people in this State had incomes well over £10,000 per annum. It is doubtful if any of the 65 are members of this House.  Why?  They would be losing money by becoming members of this House in view of the fact that they have a better means of making money and of saving it.  They would look upon it as a disadvantage to be here.  Deputy Cosgrave, the mover of the amendment, and other Deputies may try to make the case that the Farmers' Party put down this motion for the purpose of showing what patriots they were, what they were doing for the working classes, or that they came here to denounce honourable colleagues for failing to pay income-tax. That was not the object of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a different conception of our duty.  The fact remains that, although we are not the richest people, we think it is absolutely necessary that we in this Assembly, which is the cornerstone <Col N="932" /> of our democracy, should set an example.  It should be a guiding lights for all minor institutions.  It is to this House other bodies should look for example.  There in lies the principle at stake.  If this institution is not prepared to set a headline, what do we expect minor democratic institutions to model themselves on?  This Parliament, of which we are part, has passed laws compelling people to pay income-tax when their incomes are above a certain amount.  It is only reasonable that Deputies should also pay income-tax. Deputies should not be above the laws they make.  We know why Deputies walk out when they are not going to receive the reply they demand. We are the law makers here, we are the supreme court.  If we make laws for this country, and then decide that members of this House are above the position of the ordinary citizen, and are untouchable, then we are not prepared to shoulder the burden of these laws.  Why should we ask other citizens to shoulder that burden?  Deputy Cosgrave wants to know exactly what we mean.  We mean that income-tax should be applied to our allowances in the same way as it is applied to the salaries of people outside.  Suppose I was in the position outside that I earned £480 a year.  I would be allowed so much as a personal allowance, say £120, and I would be allowed £60 for a wife and £20 for a child.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely quoting certain figures; I am not giving the exact figures; I am not saying they are right and I am not saying I am infallible. What we want is that the income-tax code applicable to people outside this Chamber should be equally applicable to us.  We are the law makers.  Whatever might have been said before the war, I think it is now really necessary that this House should set a good example.  I want Deputy Cosgrave and, in particular, Deputy Esmonde, to listen and I will give them reasons why we are demanding this. As I have said, the House should set a good example.  The burdens the war has brought should be shared equally&mdash;<Col N="933" /> I think that will be admitted by everyone. None of us wants somebody else to do all the work and bear all the burdens. We are all men&mdash;at least we hope we are&mdash;and why should we expect one section of the community to shoulder the burdens if we are not prepared to assist in lightening those burdens&mdash;the trials, worries, difficulties and shortages brought about by the war?</P>
      <P>The members of the Government have talked about the need for equality of sacrifice.  The Taoiseach is a very able man when he gets behind the &ldquo;mike&rdquo; or on the platform, and he tells us a lot about equality of sacrifice. I have no doubt that in days gone by, when sacrifices had to be made, he made them.  But we must remember that we are living through a war which has brought heavy burdens upon us and I could not imagine the Taoiseach or his Party, or any Party in the House, demanding of the people that they must equally share the burdens that the war has brought, if they themselves were not prepared to do so, and if they were to put themselves in the position that they could easily evade those burdens.  If the members of the House do not show a willingness to make some sacrifice, how can they expect the agricultural labourer or the small farmers cheerfully to bear the burdens the war has placed on their shoulders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Taoiseach when he was replying to the debate on the motion dealing with Government policy and, looking at me sitting here, he appealed to the farmers to be prepared, in the name of God, to shoulder the burdens which this war had brought upon them, not to be discontented or narrow-minded about it, but to be prepared to accept their share of the burden.  The war has meant a shortage of bread, butter, tea; it has meant less clothing; it has meant a huge emigration and a breaking-up of family life.  The family is the foundation of this State, but family life is being broken up all over the country. Young men and women are leaving their fathers and their mothers, they are leaving the land they love and are going across to face the trials, the <Col N="934" /> worries, the burdens and the difficulties which a nation engaged in war has to face.  They have left this country in tens of thousands.</P>
    <P>The Government which is now in office is not as dictatorial as it was in 1939.  They should have had more foresight in the earlier stages of the war. Instead of laying-in stores of essential commodities, raw materials such as coal and wheat and petrol, they were thinking of other things.  What were they talking about in this House at that time?  On what subject did they spend days of debate?  They were discussing an increase in their allowances &mdash;that is what they were engaged at, at a time when even the smallest child in the country could have informed them that war was inevitable.  Instead of making preparations for that war, they were discussing how best they could fill their purses, make their purses heavier at the expense of the public.</P>
    <P>By accepting this motion the Government will remove a bad impression. Their action in 1939 undoubtedly created a bad impression throughout the country.  I know the Taoiseach could tell me that that particular matter was talked of prior to the election, that after the people were aware of these increases there was an election and the Government Party were returned to power.  But I say that the people were ignorant of the facts; not ignorant in the sense that you and I understand it, but they were what I would term suffering from an ignorance not due to any fault of their own, but due to the fact that you as their tutors, or as their representatives, failed to tell them what you really intended to do if you got back here again.  That is what I mean by ignorance on the part of the people at the time you went to the country.</P>
    <P>Deputies should realise that by exempting themselves from their own laws they are setting themselves up as a privileged section of the community. If there is one Deputy in this House &mdash;I do not care what his profession may be or what Party he may belong to&mdash;who thinks that he can, by making laws which he expects to be <Col N="935" /> applied to the people in general while refusing himself to accept these laws &mdash;by elevating himself in some little way by calling his salary an allowance and saying this allowance is not to be subject to income-tax&mdash;hoodwink and fool the people, I want to tell him that he is mistaken.  By such action.  Deputies may help to bring democracy and Parliamentary government into disrepute.  I want to ask Deputies: can they, during a general election campaign, blame any new Party for pointing the finger of scorn at every one of us if we fail to put this motion into effect?  They cannot and they know it if they have got any shame at all in their hearts.  People who are opposed to democracy and to democratic institutions, and mind you there are a few of them, will be prepared to utilise this particular case to score an advantage, in order to destroy democratic institutions and to paint a picture for the people that we, their representatives, are corrupt, if the use of that word is permissible: that we are merely here making laws for one group of people representing about 99.9 per cent., while we elevate the other little group, which is composed of ourselves, by saying that we cannot shoulder the burden that we put on others.  I want the Taoiseach and the Chair to see this principle, but perhaps it would be better if I said I want the House to understand my point.</P>

      <P>As I have said, the people who are opposed to democracy and to democratic institutions, and there are such people in this country will gladly seize on such things as this and grapple them to their heart.  I hope that every Deputy will see that those people, even though small in numbers, will not be able to use whatever little point they can get hold of, to enlarge upon it and try to blacken Parliament.  Now it is for that purpose and for that purpose alone, in order to vindicate this House, to put it above suspicion, to put it in the position in which nobody, no matter how hostile or what venom or hate he may have for this institution which is the foundation and cornerstone of democracy in this country, that we are moving this motion to apply the payment of income-tax to members of this House. If the motion is accepted, then such people as I refer to will not be able to make scapegoats of us or of the House, but if the House refuses to accept the motion then members will only have themselves to blame when they find themselves denounced as self-seeking, corrupt and unprincipled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government may say that Deputies' allowances are not excessive, and that members need all they get to enable them to carry out their duties properly.  I quite understand that.  I am not standing up here as a fanatic or as an unreasonable individual.  I am standing here on the basis of a principle, and not on what can be saved out of this, not because Fianna Fáil brought this allowance into being or because it was supported by Fine Gael. <Col N="937" /> The sole reason why we are moving this is because of the principle that is behind it.  I want to say to the Fine Gael Deputies who seem to have been hurt so much by the introduction of this motion&mdash;I may be wrong in this, and I am open to correction&mdash;that in my opinion it would be preferable to have increased allowances for Deputies on which income-tax would be payable.</P>

By doing that <Col N="938" /> you would be adopting a principle which nobody could lift a finger at.
