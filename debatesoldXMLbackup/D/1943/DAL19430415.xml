      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the impassable nature of roads leading to some bogs along the Kerry side of the Cork-Kerry boundary where turf cut last season, and in some cases the previous season, is still in the bogs due to the condition of these roads; and if he will give an assurance that these roads will be repaired before winter sets in, with a view to encouraging the further cutting of turf this year and to enable tenants to remove the turf now stacked and saved.</P>

      <P>I presume that one of the cases referred to is that in which the Deputy recently made representations regarding the proposed construction of a road into a bog in the townland of Clydaghroe, County Kerry.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that while motor cars plying for hire in the county boroughs are subject to control in the matter of fares charged, no such control is exercised in the cases of cars plying in country districts, with the result that often poor people who are forced to hire cars in time of urgency such as sickness, etc., have to pay exorbitant fares for such cars; and whether the Minister will take steps to fix the fares for hackney motor cars in the country areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Taxi fares in the Boroughs of Dublin and Cork are normally controlled by orders made by the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána with the consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Since the outbreak of the war such control has been exercised under the Emergency Powers following consultation with my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The charges made by hackney car owners in districts other than the two county boroughs mentioned, including provincial districts, have been examined in my Department on several occasions since the outbreak of war.  I have not considered it necessary to control these charges by Order.  Many obvious difficulties would arise in determining charges appropriate to all areas and circumstances.  Should it become evident, however, that the serious exploitation of the public by hackney owners has become prevalent, <Col N="2013" /> I will consider again the control of their charges by Order.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that there has been an abnormal increase in the number of rats in the country, principally due to the attraction of beet, and that these rats are the source of a serious malady called Wiel's disease, which has had increasingly fatal consequences in many places; and if he will, through the agency of the county medical officers of health, spread a knowledge of the danger of this disease and the means of combating it, and, at the same time, cause effective steps to be taken for the eradication of the rats themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information which would indicate that the rat population has increased.  County medical officers of health are aware of the danger of the disease referred to and the means of combating it.  A circular letter was issued in 1941 to county and county borough councils regarding destruction of rats and mice, and recommending the adoption of certain appropriate measures, including the use of poisons.  A good deal of publicity was given to the measures recommended at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alfred Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that a large number of persons have been disqualified from benefits in National Health Society on the grounds that they were fitted for light work; and if, in view of the scarcity of employment for persons fitted only for light work, he will introduce legislation to provide amelioration of their hardships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence in my Department does not support the view expressed by the Deputy in the first part of his question.  Health insurance benefits are payable to insured persons whilst rendered incapable of work by some specific disease or by bodily or mental disablement.  In determining claims for benefit, the Health Insurance Society is entitled to make a decision as to payment of benefit on the medical or other relevant evidence or information.  If the opinion expressed by the District Medical Referee, after examination of the insured person, is to the effect that the person is capable of light work, the society almost invariably allows a period of at least four weeks to the member to seek suitable work; and at the end of the period usually refers the case for further examination by the medical referee before finally deciding the question whether the person is or is not to remain in benefit.  The society reviews all cases of this kind with the utmost consideration.</P>
      <P>As regards the latter part of the question, it must be pointed out that the provision of assistance for persons fitted only for light work does not form part of health insurance.  If they require assistance to provide amelioration of their hardships, they can be dealt with under the Public Assistance Acts.  An extension of legislation is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it, from the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, that <Col N="2018" /> he admits that people are discharged from national health benefits when they are found 50 per cent. fit for work. If there is no work of the type that such people are only fit for, that is, light work, surely he will give them some benefits&mdash;a 50 per cent. benefit for 50 per cent. disability?  There is no work for these people at all, and they should not be discharged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>But they are discharged when they are 50 per cent. better of a serious trouble.  They are discharged to go back on the market to compete with those who are 100 per cent. fit, and there is no opportunity for them.  The benefits ought to be reconsidered and some provision made for them.  I leave that to the commonsense of the whole House.</P>

I have not received any evidence of a tendency on the part of landlords to exact increased rents during the emergency or to eject tenants as a preliminary to <Col N="2024" /> attempts to obtain higher rents.  I can only conclude from this that there is, in fact, no such widespread practice as might be inferred from the Deputies' questions.  In those circumstances I would not feel justified in taking action at present on the lines suggested.  If, however, satisfactory evidence is forthcoming at any time of attempts on any general scale by landlords to take advantage of emergency conditions to exact increased rents from their tenants, I shall consider recommending to the Government that the matter should be dealt with by means of an Emergency Powers Order or, if necessary, by special legislation.</P>

      <P>The main Vote will be disposed of before the Supplementary Estimate is taken.  At the outset of business yesterday, there seems to have been a certain amount of misunderstanding as to the procedure.  If Deputies will look at footnote (K) on page 340 of the Book of Estimates, they will find it identical with the footnote (A) to the Supplementary Estimate. The sum of £280,000 asked for in the Supplementary Estimate is an addition to the amount set out under sub-head G of the main Vote, not provision for a new service.  In such circumstances, it is not usual to have a separate debate or separate decisions on the Vote and on the Supplementary Estimate. Technically, however, a Deputy would be within his rights in asking for separate decisions, I take it that the motion to refer back is an equivalent to a motion to reduce sub-head G. Therefore, on the main Vote, discussion on peat fuel should be reserved for the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious from the note to the <Col N="2029" /> Vote that the Supplementary Estimate is an enlargement of the amount provided under sub-head G of the main Vote but owing to the short notice given to the House and the substantial amount provided for in the Supplementary Estimate the Deputy was entitled to ask permission to refer it back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned last night, I was pointing out to the House that the Minister, in dealing with the many difficulties and complex problems arising out of the emergency with regard to the supply of essential goods and the distribution of such goods, has failed completely to secure the necessary public co-operation or to create the necessary public spirit.  I think that that lack of public co-operation is apparent to all.  I feel it is due in large measure to the attitude of the Minister in dealing with this whole question, his attitude towards the trading public generally, his attitude to those people who are primarily concerned with the distribution of goods and his attitude to this House.  His attitude to any matter coming before the House has been, in my opinion, completely wooden.  He has adopted the attitude of sticking definitely to whatever proposal he has brought in. No matter what amount of help, co-operation, or constructive criticism was offered from any Party in this House, the Minister's attitude was that he was not prepared to use the House as it should be used to vary or improve whatever measures were brought before the House for its consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2030" /> His attitude towards price control has created many bitter feelings throughout the country among decent honest traders.  His attitude has been to narrow down a fair margin of profit. Obviously traders cannot operate in difficult times like these if a reasonable margin is not allowed.  Their interests have been ignored time and time again by the Minister.  These traders were not worthy of his consideration or consultation. He felt that he and his cloistered officials in Kildare Street and Ballsbridge were alone capable of making decisions on these vital matters affecting the everyday lives of our people.  I think it is a very stupid and silly attitude for the Minister to adopt, particularly at present, and the Minister's attitude is in very large measure responsible for the appalling situation in which we find ourselves to-day.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not appealed for any public co-operation.  His policy is to send officials all over the country, and in some cases to adopt methods that are repugnant to the minds of decent men.  The <i>agent provocateur</i> has been active in some districts, and I do not think there is a Deputy who would approve of these efforts to induce people to commit offences.  With regard to honest and fair criticism, the Minister's attitude is shown by his treatment of a local paper, the <i>Kilkenny People.</i>  Because the manager of that paper has dared to criticise, and to have the courage of his convictions on matters affecting the public, he has been punished and penalised.  This man was a great supporter of the national movement.  He is a well-known journalist, an able man, capable of expressing decent, honest criticism on national matters. The attitude of the Minister is both intolerable and contemptible so far as his treatment of that individual is concerned, and it comes very badly from a Government composed of men who boasted in the past that they were the champions of the liberty and freedom of the individual and of the freedom of the Press that because this man has the courage to criticise Government methods, and particularly the Minister's methods, he should be penalised.</P>
    <P>He has been denied his legitimate <Col N="2031" /> right to Government advertisements. On the basis of circulation, his paper was certainly entitled to those advertisements, and when an attempt was made at some sort of reconciliation, when the Secretary of the Department invited Mr. Keane for an interview, the Minister gave as his excuse for cancelling that interview that he took exception to the tone of the paper and would have nothing more to do with Mr. Keane.  I think that is a contemptible attitude on the part of the Minister.  It is a purely partisan attitude and the Minister is permitting himself to be influenced by political considerations.  The sooner the Minister mends his ways in that respect and treats people as they ought to be treated and does not deny the liberty and freedom of the individual and of the public Press to express views and criticise Government policy, if they see fit to do so, the better.  Obviously the Minister will not accord to any paper which dares to criticise either his Department or the Government any privileges which may be in his gift or in the gift of the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the alarming number of notices of the Minister's intention to revoke licences.  I and my Party appreciate the necessity for rigid control in order to safeguard the people's interests, and especially the interests of the poor, but this problem is not being properly tackled.  Many traders have been penalised for trivial offences, for what are purely technical offences, and have been severely punished in the courts.  That is as it should be.  If an individual is prosecuted for failing to comply with certain emergency Orders, and is brought to court to answer for his offences, the justice is entitled to inflict certain penalties.  No one can take exception to that.  At least, I do not take exception to it, but what I do take exception to is that, having brought the offender to justice, the Minister afterwards sits in judgment on him again and decides to revoke his licence, regardless of his position and regardless of the consequences to his future and the future of his family.</P>
    <P>The Minister can make no claim to that right to sit in judgment on any <Col N="2032" /> man.  If there is a question of revocation, the recommendation ought to come from the justice dealing with the case.  It should not be a matter for any Minister to decide that, after an individual has been brought to trial and dealt with in the ordinary way, he should be brought further to trial by the Minister and his officials, and a decision come to that his licence shall be withdrawn, very often for a trivial technical offence, such as carelessness in not keeping the records he is bound to keep under certain emergency Orders.</P>
    <P>I have a particular individual in mind who has his records of tea sales complete, but who, when the Minister's inspector called on him, was not able to put his hand on the records which had been mislaid.  He was prosecuted for failing to produce his tea and sugar sales records and for failing to keep a sugar record&mdash;he had not kept a sugar record in fact, but had all the necessary material for completing both records. He was fined £1 and £2 in respect of the offences, and the justice commented that it was merely bad business or carelessness on his part, and that there was no suggestion whatever of overcharging or of any black market activity.  Having been fined by the court, he afterwards got a letter notifying him of the Minister's intention to revoke his licence.  Surely that kind of offence does not justify such drastic action.  I suggest that in all these cases, if the Minister thinks that the revocation of a licence is necessary because of black market activity or overcharging in respect of essential commodities, the recommendation ought to come from the court.  Let the individual feel that, whatever consequences he has suffered as a result of his failure to comply with certain Orders, he has been tried in a court of justice and that whatever penalties may be inflicted on him were inflicted in that court and not in a court set up by the Minister in his own Department.</P>
    <P>As I said before, I think that quite a lot of those offences, in the way of overcharging and black market activity, have been produced as a result of the wrong approach of the Minister <Col N="2033" /> and his Department to this matter of price control.  Take the case of butter, for instance.  A margin of a penny a lb. profit for traders selling butter is simply ridiculous, and that kind of thing is definitely going to promote black market activities.  Just fancy the case of a small trader, who has already suffered a reduction in the volume of goods he is handling, having his profit on butter narrowed down to one penny per lb.  He knows very well that if he sends that butter up to Dublin he will be able to get a profit of 4d. or 5d. per lb., and that is encouraging black market activity, because the Minister is squeezing such people out of the just profit to which they are entitled.  In my opinion, the Minister himself is an agent of the black market because he is not facing the matter in a proper way or as a businessman would face it.  He has acted the part of the dictator all along, and the result of his action has only led to further black market activity.  At least, one would expect the Minister to consult the people who are primarily concerned.  It was only by reason of extraordinary pressure that those people who were concerned in this matter of the price of butter, after making half a dozen recommendations to the Minister's Department, were heard, and then the Minister did not think it worth his while to receive them personally.  Of course, he was too busy and had not time to receive deputations from country people&mdash;he left that to his officials.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that this whole problem of overcharging and black market activity is due to the attitude of the Minister for Supplies. On the other hand, other aspects of price control are completely neglected. Take the case of agricultural machinery.  I suggested to the Minister 12 months ago that it was necessary to control and fix the price of agricultural machinery&mdash;not only new machinery, but old or second-hand machinery.  There is such a scarcity in tractors, power-driven machinery, threshing sets, and all that kind of machinery which is in very short supply at the moment, when there is an increased <Col N="2034" /> demand for it, that the price has simply hit the sky, and that is due in a very large measure to speculators coming into the market to buy up such machinery.  For instance, if there is to be an auction of agricultural machinery in a district, some unfortunate man who needs the machinery finds that when he goes into the market to bid for it he is up against a speculator who will force up the price to such an extent that he cannot buy.  The speculator will get hold of that particular plant with a view to getting some sort of a profit, and generally a very high profit.  The same thing applies even to new machinery.  Prices are demanded far beyond the normal margin of profit.  The Minister has not concerned himself with that aspect of the problem at all, although I suggested to him in this House, 12 months ago, that it was essential to have price control there.  In Great Britain they have control of all essential machinery, whether old or new, and that will definitely prevent the activities of the speculator and the gambler who come into the market and prevent the legitimate buyer from getting what he is entitled to get.  The sooner the Minister does something about that the better.</P>
    <P>I think that the greatest revelation this House has got for a long time was divulged by the Minister yesterday in dealing with the price of turf.  This House has adverted several times to the fixed price of turf of 64/- a ton.  We have adverted to it time and time again, and a great many people looked upon it as too high a price, but now we find that the 64/- a ton is the controlled price to the consumer and that it has to be subsidised by an amount of 23/6 a ton, making a total of 87/6.  We are also told that 80 per cent. of the turf produced in this country is produced through the efforts of the county surveyors, and that a considerable proportion of the price is caused by loss of weight or damage to the turf in the dumps.  Yet we find that the cost amounts to 87/6 a ton.  You must add to that price the grants that are made to the Turf Development Board under sub-heads K (1), K (2), K (3), K (4), K (5), K (6) and K (7).  Under subhead <Col N="2035" /> K (1), the grant is £522,400, under K (2), £20,000; under K (3), £2,000; under K (4), £1,000; under K (5), £5,000; under K (7), £30,000&mdash;a sum amounting in the aggregate to over £600,000.  Now the Supplementary Estimate gives us a revised figure of £660,000; so this extra money by way of subsidy to the Turf Development Board gives us a further subsidy of over £1 per ton or, possibly, in the neighbourhood of 22/- a ton.  That makes the actual cost of producing turf over £5 per ton.  Now, what does that mean in terms of coal, assuming that a ton of coal is worth two tons of turf?&mdash;and that is a moderate estimate. In terms of coal, the price of turf to-day is £10 per ton.  That is an appalling figure.  It is a staggering figure, and yet we are asked to vote that sum and asked to vote the moneys under the various sub-heads from K (1) to K (7) to the Turf Development Board, and we have a footnote to the Estimate which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Issues from the Grant-in-Aid will be made to the Turf Development Board, Limited, from time to time by the Minister for Supplies with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Any amount remaining unexpended out of the sums so issued during the financial year will not be liable to surrender at its close, but any balance of the Grant-in-Aid remaining unissued at the close of the year will be surrendered.  The expenditure by the board of issues out of the Grant-in-Aid will not be accounted for in detail to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, all I can say about that is that, bad and all as are the figures revealed here, this habit of asking the House to vote large sums of public money to a board which has not to account for that money is a pernicious habit that is growing up in Government Departments and seems to be encouraged by Ministers generally.  I should like to ask is it the Minister's intention, or the Government's intention, to turn the Committee of Public Accounts into a farce.  What is that committee there for?  What useful purpose can they serve if they can only examine part of <Col N="2036" /> the national expenditure?  The purpose of the Committee of Public Accounts is to examine, with the help of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the expenditure of the various sums of money voted in this House, and here we have a sum amounting to £600,000, which this House is asked to hand over to a board of which we have no proof of its competence or efficiency. We do not know whether it is capable of spending those public moneys in an efficient and businesslike way.  I think that this system that is growing up is a disgraceful one, and that this House should strongly object to that method of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Our system, just as the British system&mdash;and Great Britain is particularly jealous in this respect&mdash;is based on this, that every penny of public money expended must be properly accounted for through the Comptroller and Auditor-General and by the Committee of Public Accounts.  What are we paying a Comptroller and Auditor-General for?  What are we setting up a Committee of Public Accounts for, if the members of it are not entitled to examine expenditure of this sort?  I think, on this aspect alone, the House should refuse to vote this sum.  In my opinion, it is highly improper.  We are here in our capacity as public representatives; we are the custodians of the public purse, and every Minister who is head of a Department has to ask the House to vote the sum necessary to meet the expenditure of his Department.  That is the basis of our system, and I regard it as absolutely sound in every way.  The Minister must account for every penny expended, and his accounting officer, when he is before the Committee of Public Accounts, must justify the expenditure in his Department.</P>
    <P>Why should we vote such a large sum to what appears to me an incompetent body?  Viewing it from the angle of the price of turf alone, the business capacity of the Department is condemned. I suggest that on a big principle like this we should not give way. We should jealously guard the people's right of control in relation to public expenditure.  Under this method I submit that we are denied that right.  This <Col N="2037" /> seems to be a closed book so far as the House is concerned, and even so far as the right of the Committee set up by the House to examine public expenditure is concerned.  I suggest that that is financially wrong and highly dangerous. The precedent was set up some years ago by the present administration, and every year there is a further encroachment on the people's rights.  While that method prevails, I will vote against contributing any sum. I object to the House being denied the right to ensure that the money is properly accounted for.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us how we are indebted to our shipping company and our sailors for securing certain vital commodities, especially materials required for production purposes here.  I think the House agrees that we are all deeply indebted to these brave men who have risked their lives to secure essential requirements for us.  The Minister mentioned that we have received 20,000 tons of phosphate rock from Florida.  Of course, that is a negligible amount so far as our phosphate requirements go, and in the coming year the Minister should endeavour to get further supplies.  The Minister made a passing reference to the possibility of securing sulphate of ammonia. We have got a small percentage of nitrogen in a compound mixture for beet.  I understand that that nitrogen was secured by exporting some seed potatoes in exchange.  That is a basis of trade I am particularly keen on.  I have given expression to my views on that matter already.  I do not think sufficient efforts have been made to develop that type of exchange of goods with our neighbours.  The Minister told us that the position with regard to binder twine is comparatively safe.  We have secured 1,000 tons of sisal and 1,000 tons of twine.  The Minister might have gone on to say that we have exchanged flax fibre for the sisal.</P>
    <P>It is not because of the Minister's interest in the matter, but because of the activity of private individuals, the manufacturers very often, that this condition of affairs has been brought about.  At the moment we are exporting agricultural machinery from Wexford <Col N="2038" /> in exchange for certain raw materials which keep factories like the Wexford Engineering Company and Messrs.  Pierce of Wexford going.  All these things have been done as a result of individual effort.  I have no doubt that if representations were made to our neighbours in the proper fashion&mdash;direct Ministerial representation&mdash;we could secure a quota of sulphate of ammonia, which is so vital to production here.  The Minister and other members of the Government do not seem capable of making that representation. I suppose they have not the courage to go across and suggest we are entitled to more in exchange for our live-stock exports than merely getting a credit chalked up.  The one thing so vital to production is nitrogen in the form of sulphate of ammonia. There is a synthetic product in Great Britain and I have no doubt we could secure quantities of it, judging by the supplies available for the British farmer and for farmers in Northern Ireland, and judging by the quantities coming into the black market here at very high prices.  Perhaps even at this late hour the Minister might consider making personal representations to the British Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some reference to wheat and he said that the amount that has come into the mills on an acreage basis appears to be very disappointing. He more or less suggested, when speaking of the relatively small amount of wheat that has come into the mills generally, that there was a leakage somewhere.  I suggest there is not a leakage and that the explanation is the low yield.  We will have progressively lower yields if some effort is not made to secure the necessary supplies of nitrogenous manures. Quite a good deal has been said on that point already, but I believe it is a matter of sufficient importance to encourage us to reiterate our demands.</P>
    <P>The Minister adverted to the possibility of controlling the price of fresh meat and controlling the price of potatoes. I think there the Minister is on very dangerous ground.  He must now know from experience that undue interference <Col N="2039" /> with certain agricultural products had the effect of drying up production.  It might be fatal to a flourishing branch of agriculture if the Minister were now, unwisely, to interfere with it.  If he thinks there is any necessity to protect the consumer with regard to supplies of meat and potatoes, then I warn him to be very careful as to how he takes action. Deputy Belton asked a question with regard to the possibility of securing rubber tyres for tractors.  I want to support that appeal, and to ask the Minister to take every opportunity that presents itself of securing big tyres for the back wheels of tractors.  Many of these big tyres are very worn now, and if it is possible to secure replacements then steps should be taken in that direction at once.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the provision of bicycle tyres.  I think the Minister mentioned that 300,000 of them would be available in the coming season.  The Minister should pay attention to their allocation.  Agricultural workers and others in remote rural districts are suffering the greatest inconvenience and hardship, due to the fact that they cannot get a bicycle tyre, or a couple of them.  They are now obliged to go to their work on shanks's mare.  The impression held throughout the country is that unless you are a member of the local defence organisations you cannot get a bicycle tyre.  Quite a number of useful, efficient and skilled agricultural workers, who are too old to join those organisations, find themselves in the unfortunate position that they are unable to procure a bicycle tyre and, consequently, have to tramp to their work.  The food production service is, surely, the most vital in the country at the present time.  I, therefore, put it to the Minister that he should make some effort to see that those engaged in this vital national work will get their share of the bicycle tyres available.</P>
    <P>These, I think, are the only points that I wish to touch on.  I think that, even at this late hour, the Minister might adopt a different attitude to this <Col N="2040" /> whole problem.  I do not want to minimise the magnitude or the difficulties of the problem that he has to deal with.  His job is by no means a sinecure. The problem that he has to deal with requires a very big organisation. It also requires public co-operation and the right type of public spirit which the Minister has failed to secure by his attitude.  A change of front on his part might be very useful.  If he were to mend his hand, he might be able to secure more public co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not forget that Deputy Lemass, according to his own claim, has been Minister for Supplies in this country for four years.  He claimed in this House, long before the war started, that he knew all about it, and that he had set up an establishment in the Department of Industry and Commerce of that day to provide for contingencies.  How did he provide for them?  By retaining in operation all the quotas, all the tariffs and all the restrictions on imports into this country of goods that were vitally required for carrying on the life of the people until such time as those goods were no longer available.  Then he took the restrictions off.  That did not happen in one case.  It happened in dozens of cases.  I remember that I, myself, two years ago in this House, got up and urged that all restrictions on the imports of agricultural machinery should be removed.  Deputy Allen was clamouring that there was plenty of agricultural machinery in the County Wexford to supply the whole country.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Supplies said that he had no intention of removing the restrictions since abundant supplies of the necessary types of agricultural machinery were to be had from the factories in Ireland.  Where is the agricultural machinery now?  In Great Britain where we cannot get it, but when we could have got it we would not be allowed to bring it in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same story can be told of 70 per cent. of the commodities that are in short supply at the present time from agricultural machinery down to cotton stockings.  I remember the time when <Col N="2041" /> we could have bought thousands of dozens of pairs of cheap cotton hose that poor people require.  We were told that we would not be allowed to bring in a single pair, but when supplies of that commodity were no longer available in Great Britain we were told that we could bring in as much as we liked.  Time and again that has happened, and though nobody but a fool would propound the theory that the Minister for Supplies is responsible for all the shortages that we are experiencing in this country at the present time, I have no hesitation in saying that he has greatly exacerbated the shortages that at present exist.  The root cause of the shortages in this country is that we are learning to our cost that the insanity of economic self-sufficiency is &ldquo;cod,&rdquo; was &ldquo;cod&rdquo; and always will be &ldquo;cod&rdquo; like most of the Fianna Fáil programme.  We nursed the illusion.  God be with the day when the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures was praying that all the ships that sailed the seven seas would be sunk so that we really could know the blessings of genuine economic self-sufficiency, and when he assured the country that if they were all sunk in the morning it would not make the slightest difference to us, that we would have everything we wanted within our four shores. Well, it is an expensive education that Ministerial gossoon is receiving.  The whole country is obliged to suffer because of that mentality.  Nevertheless, it influenced the Government at a time when it was possible to bring in to this country very substantial supplies.</P>
    <P>Are the memories of Deputies so short that they do not realise that up to very recently there was a prohibitive tariff on artificial manures?  You would not be allowed to bring in a bag.  That was done in order to keep the manure ring in its position of being able to rob and plunder the public of this country.  It is because you would not be allowed to bring in a bag that the country is now experiencing a shortage of artificial manures.  At the very time when the manure ring was encouraging the Government to prevent the importation of artificial manures into this country they would <Col N="2042" /> not invest their illgotten gains in procuring reserves of phosphate rock. Goodness knows we have enough waste land in this country on which reserves of phosphate rock could have been stored.  We had a Minister who foresaw the shortage 12 months before the war began.  Did he succeed in persuading the gentlemen whom he had authorised to plunder the farmers of this country to invest some of the plunder in the piling up of reserves to meet the present shortage?  Not a penny.  They would not buy an ounce of reserve stock.  The Government could go and buy it.  They wanted to have public funds invested in it, but they would not risk their profits and dividends.  I know they are regretting that now, because they could have made a nice profit on it and would have got away with it, of course.  They did not see as clearly as some others did what profits could be made by accumulating stocks and therefore there was not a stone or a cwt. laid by for our people.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister for Supplies who is responsible for permitting that kind of thing to happen in this country, who gets up quite blandly on the eve of a general election and says that things are not so bad after all, oblivious of the fact that six months ago he was standing at the corner of Capel Street telling us that we were on our last legs.  The soul was frightened out of him six months ago.  For the last three years our people have demonstrated their capacity to face any kind of emergency they have been asked to confront.  But if, by false pretences, you represent to our people that there is a desperate situation to be met and they brace themselves to meet it, only to be told six months later that it was a canard and there was not any desperate situation, you will find that by crying &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; in that way you will cry it once too often, and when it does become necessary for the people to brace themselves to meet a severe ordeal they will say: &ldquo;In three months' time he will be telling us there is no danger.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister got up to-day and confessed that he so far misrepresented the rubber situation six months ago <Col N="2043" /> that he warned the nation there would be no tyres to maintain public traffic and that now, after the passage of six months, he is in a position to say that there is sufficient to keep us going for 12 months and that he intends to increase the ration of bicycle tyres.  If he has all the elaborate machinery he is continually patting himself on the back about, he ought to be able to make a better guess six months ahead than that, and we are entitled to ask of him a better estimate in future, if he undertakes to make an estimate at all.  I would have great sympathy with the Minister if he said: &ldquo;My position is that I am not in a situation to make any formal estimate except to say that from week to week and month to month I will do my best.&rdquo; But he has not adopted that course.  He has seen fit to come out with harangues at the street corners of Dublin.  He spoke of what he foresaw and he warned the people and spoke advisedly and, six months later in Dáil Eireann, he said it was all hullabaloo, that he was mistaken and the situation was not as he described it to be.  He will do that once too often; he is doing it too often. Deputies will ask themselves why is this mass of contradictions so much emphasised by me.  It is because it is all done with a purpose.  It is done for the purpose of persuading people to forget his own record in office.  It is done for the purpose of obliterating from the public mind this salient fact which must be remembered if our present situation is to be fully understood&mdash;that there were supplies available and the Minister prevented us from bringing them in.  In every case, when the time was passed for acquiring supplies, the prohibitions which he had so sedulously maintained were removed and we were told to get all we could when we, who were in the trade, knew there was none to be got.  That is the root of a great many of our difficulties at present.</P>
    <P>I instance two isolated and dissociated commodities in connection with which that happened&mdash;cotton hosiery and agricultural machinery. There are dozens of others you could quote if you had a schedule of them before you.  In the middle of this crisis <Col N="2044" /> we were informed that there was a heavy tariff placed on cotton wool in order to protect a factory out in Clonskeagh. At a time when it was difficult to get any cotton wool for a suit tailored in this country the trade was required to depend upon the supplies from Clonskeagh and prohibited from drawing its supplies of that now extremely scarce commodity from its usual sources.  I suppose 95 per cent. of the tailors in the country were drawing supplies of that commodity from Manchester.  But, at a given date, the whole trade was stopped, and that in the middle of a period of emergency when supplies were almost unobtainable.</P>
    <P>Do Deputies realise that for 18 months after the war began you could not get a yard of flannelette from Great Britain?  It was not because there was a scarcity of flannelette in England&mdash;there was plenty.  You could have bought and secured delivery of all you wanted to buy, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce would not let you bring it in, so that at the moment there is not a yard of flannelette in the country.  You know what that means for the country people and for the poor.  When they want underclothes they have to make them out of whatever rags and tatters may be left about the house.  Then the Minister here will tell you that our present shortage of flannelette is due to the fact that our cotton supply was reduced to 20 per cent.  Who reduced our supplies of cotton and cotton textiles when the available supplies in Great Britain were 200 per cent?  I know one small shopkeeper in Ballaghadereen who could have got sufficient to clothe all the people of Ballaghadereen for two years.  He would not be allowed to bring in a yard of it until he could not get an inch of it, and then he was told to bring in all he liked.  Will the Minister explain that? Perhaps the Minister for the Coordination of Defensive Measures will come in and join in the chorus of explanation and demonstrate to us now how we would benefit by the sinking of all the ships that sailed the seven seas.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister for Supplies <Col N="2045" /> talking yesterday about how rubber came in.  I interjected: &ldquo;Where are you getting it?&rdquo; He said he had nothing to add to the explanation.  If we are getting supplies from Great Britain, if the British are carrying these supplies across the seven seas at the peril of their lives and, when they are landed in Great Britain, they share these supplies with us, albeit on a much smaller scale than they did prewar, would it not be a gracious and civil thing to say: &ldquo;We are getting so much rubber and we are getting it from Great Britain&rdquo;&mdash;if that is where it is coming from?  Are we so neutral in this country that we cannot discharge the obligations of common civility and gratitude?  When men risk their lives to get supplies to keep us going, do we owe them no debt of gratitude except that which can be discharged in coin of the realm?  Is that the view which obtains here?  If so, my fellow Deputies are of a different type from what I expected them to be; from what I know them to be.  I know well that most of the rational Deputies recognise that when men risk their lives to carry supplies to a country like this at the present time, those who receive and benefit by them have some debt of gratitude and public recognition to discharge.  It seems to me to be a mean thing to preserve that shameful anonymity under which you say: &ldquo;We are getting in supplies,&rdquo; but do not dare to say whence they come.</P>
    <P>I read in the papers and I heard very often in Dáil Eireann very stringent attacks made upon shopkeepers in this country.  I wonder do Deputies in this House understand the ordeal through which shopkeepers in rural Ireland are passing at the present time?  I know a shop and it is keeping 15 different registers of rationed commodities, most of them rationed by the Government, some of them rationed by the manufacturers. How do you imagine the retail shop in rural Ireland distributes butter or jam at the present time?  The Government has funked the duty of rationing these commodities, but the people expect their normal supplier to see justice done, and the shopkeepers are trying <Col N="2046" /> to do it.  How do you expect the country shop that is engaged in retail and wholesale distribution to carry on with machine-like precision, considering the measure of co-operation they are getting from the Government? Have any of the Deputies of this House ever asked themselves how a small shopkeeper with, perhaps, 200 tea customers, rations out his tea for the week?  He has to ensure that ¾-oz. of tea goes to each member of each of the 200 households&mdash;no more, no less.  He has to keep a record of the sales, and he must endeavour at the end of every month to demonstrate that he has weighed out every pound of tea in ¾-oz. packets, that they have all been delivered, and that no tea has been mislaid.  That is only one commodity. He has to weigh out sugar in ½-lb. packets, and he has to ensure that each person in each household gets a ½-lb.</P>
    <P>I am not quarrelling with the Ministry of Supply.  They have their difficulties the same as the country shopkeeper has his, but I often wonder do they envisage the type of trade done in rural Ireland or are they founding their systems of rationing and so forth on the experience of city shops.  Do they think of one shop selling tea and sugar, another shop selling bacon, another shop selling cornflour and grocers' sundries, or do they understand that in rural Ireland everything from the candle to the plough may be sold in the one shop?  Do they realise that in rural Ireland marketing is not done spread out over the six days of the week?  You have three days in which there is practically nobody in the town and one or two days in which the whole population comes in and you have to be prepared to ration practically your entire output on market day and, possibly, on Saturday afternoon. Do they realise that in many country shops; in addition to furnishing groceries, wine and spirits are consumed on the premises, and drapery and boots are sold?  You have to be just as strict in rationing reels of thread and boxes of boot polish as you have in ½ lbs. of butter and ½ lbs. of rasher bacon.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest, Sir&mdash;<Col N="2047" /> because it would not be true if I did&mdash; that if you bring these specific problems to the Department of Supplies or the Department of Industry and Commerce you are met with blank refusal or other lack of sympathy. That is not true.  My experience is, certainly, that when I have gone to the Department of Supplies or the Department of Industry and Commerce and exposed peculiar problems which had not been foreseen, they have been met as fairly as it was possible, within the circumstances that obtained, to meet them.  But, everybody cannot go to the Department of Supplies.  I can go, but I am thinking of the thousands of small shopkeepers who do not even know where the Department is and who, if they once got into the Department, would get lost in the Department.  We, in Dáil Eireann, know the man.  We do not go to the Minister or to the secretary.  We know the head of the division or we know some man in the division who can put us in touch with the man who is handling the particular problem.  We can thread our way through the various corridors and myriad rooms until we can find someone to give us yea or may in regard to our particular problem. But the mass of the people cannot do that, and the bewilderment with which they find themselves overwhelmed is painful.</P>
    <P>I know that a Minister sitting in Dublin, when he sends out two inspectors to make a routine review, cannot see that that should cause any undue consternation.  I wish the Minister would come down the country and watch the reactions of some unfortunate woman in a country shop when two strange men come in, one in a fedora hat and the other in a tweed cap, and say: &ldquo;We come from the Department of Supplies.&rdquo; If Dick Turpin and Jack the Ripper came into her kitchen, she could not be thrown into a state of wilder confusion.  I do not want to suggest that the attitude of these gentlemen is that of Dick Turpin or Jack the Ripper.  If she would take herself easy she would probably find that they were reasonable people and the thing would work out <Col N="2048" /> all right, but she never does take herself easy.  She gets excited, frightened, consternated.  These are busy men and they have to do their work and get on to some other job and they have not time to sit down and cosset her and restore her equilibrium.  For the period that they are there she is in a state of hysteria and for six weeks afterwards she is waiting for something to hit her, waiting for a letter indicating the appalling consequences that have eventuated as the result of the arrival of these two gentlemen.  All the neighbours are coming in for the next week, sloping around to know who were the strange men.  They know quite well who they were but they want to know more about it, if they can get information.</P>
    <P>I suppose that is largely unavoidable in the situation in which we find ourselves, but we ought to recognise the difficulties of people who have to endure all that kind of supervision and interference, to which they are not accustomed, and which frequently they do not understand.  What is peculiarly exasperating is that it is the common experience in rural Ireland that the man who keeps his records most meticulously, so meticulously that he reveals his own mistakes, gets caught and is prosecuted, while he knows there is a fellow across the street who keeps no record at all, because his transactions are of so nefarious a kind that nobody would dare to report him and, because he keeps no record and because he is acute fellow, he gets off acot free.  The Minister's reply to that is: &ldquo;Do you know such a person?&rdquo; Of course I know him.  Is there a Deputy in this House who does not know that, but knowing it and proving that they are doing it is another thing.  I know people who have been in to them, and who have bought tea at 1/6 an ounce, but to get them to come and tell the Minister for Supplies is quite another story.  The very people who are dealing with them will say: &ldquo;Where else could we get it?  What good is ¾-oz. of tea?  We drink it in two days.  So-and-so has tea and will give it to you at 1/6 if you deal with him for sugar&rdquo;&mdash;and he has all the sugar he wants, and he is <Col N="2049" /> riding high, wide and handsome. Next door to him there is a poor devil sweating to make 224½-lbs. out of a 112-lb. bag of sugar; sweating to divide his monthly deliveries of tea into ¾-oz. packets.  He is short in the sugar and has too much tea at the end of the month, and he is prosecuted.  He is held up as the type of the black marketeer, grey hairs having appeared in his head in his efforts to maintain a series of forms, the like of which he never contemplated before in his entire business career.</P>
    <P>Are not these things true?  I do not minimise the Minister's difficulties. The purpose of ventilating these facts is to try to persuade Deputies to get the circumstances of the country shopkeeper into reasonable proportion. There are bad hats amongst the country shopkeepers but, by and large, 95 per cent. of them are decent men and women who are trying to earn a modest living and who are having at present a very hard time.  Those who were rich enough to acquire large stocks have, undoubtedly, made considerable profits but the vast majority of small country shopkeepers buy their stocks from week to week.  In many cases, they are left short by the wholesalers who usually supply them and, in the remainder of the cases, their profits bear a close relation to the prices they pay for their goods.  Having to buy from week to week, as the prices are rising, they are paying the full rise every day.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister for Supplies quite deliberately that I consider his entire policy of rationing to be misconceived and mistaken.  He has allowed himself to be bustled, largely by the Labour Party, into the utter folly of attempting to control everything. It cannot be done.  The net result of attempting to control everything, unless you set up a system such as obtains in Great Britain and the other countries at war in which you control everything from the source of production down to the point of consumption, is that nothing will be effectively controlled.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Supplies had determined to ration or control a few vital commodities, without which <Col N="2050" /> people could not get on, and if he had taken entire control of these commodities from the point of production down to the point of consumption, then the thing could have been effectively done.  But the attempt to control the price of thread and biscuits and 101 luxury commodities, which ought never have been controlled may simply convert the retail trade into a pandemonium of confusion.  It has resulted in the services of men who ought to be engaged in controlling vital commodities being dissipated in chasing round after a shopkeeper who has sold a ½ lb. of Jacob's Fairy Biscuits at ½d. more than the controlled price. That is what is happening.  It has forced unfortunate shopkeepers to attempt to maintain a system of records applying to 30 or 40 commodities which they are quite unable to keep.  This has resulted in their frequently losing sight of vital commodities which ought to be rigorously controlled, and which could be rigorously controlled if the number of controlled commodities was reasonably delimited.</P>
    <P>I do not desire to criticise the Minister without making suggestions.  I do not want to suggest that the Minister is oppressing the shopkeepers without pointing out, at the same time, how the position can be equitably rectified. There is an equitable way of dealing with the present situation.  That is to review the whole system of rationing. Let the Minister make up his mind that he must go whole hog over to the British system or the system obtaining in other countries actually at war&mdash;a system of rationing primarily designed to limit public expenditure and divert wealth into savings&mdash;or, if he has resolved that that system of rationing is impracticable or undesirable in the situation in which we find ourselves, let him relinquish the attempt to ration or control the prices of luxury articles. He should take butter, milk, sugar, tea, bacon, flour and certain other vital commodities&mdash;in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, I think these should include candles and paraffin oil&mdash;and control them rigidly from the port of entry or the factory of production all the way through to the consumer, so that, when he gives the consumer <Col N="2051" /> sumer a ration card for any one of these commodities, it will not only entitle him to get that quantity of the commodity, but it will indicate to him to what shop he can go and demand that quantity, knowing that the Minister for Supplies has, directly or indirectly, placed a supply there for him. Have Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party not told the Minister that, in large parts of the country, when people go in with tea and sugar cards, they do not get anything at all.  They are simply told by the shopkeeper that there is not any and they go away. I suggest to the Minister that the proper situation ought to be that, if a person holds a ration card for a given commodity, he ought to know that when he goes into his registered supplier the Minister will see that he is supplied or know the reason why from the shopkeeper, the Minister having placed in that shopkeeper's store the necessary supply to meet the ration card held by the customer.</P>
    <P>At present, it is a common experience for shopkeepers who have tried to supply their customers every week with the required ration to find letters addressed to them by the Department of Supplies directing them to take on a new customer for a rationed commodity. You discover, when you investigate the facts, that you are being asked to take on a tea customer from a shopkeeper up the street who has been turning his regular customers away because he wants to sell his tea on the black market.  He dumps his customer down on top of you to absorb the tea which you had earmarked for regular customers who had been dealing with you for from ten to 20 years.  He does not do that because of scarcity.  He tells his customers he has no tea but he is selling it out by the back door at 24/- a lb.  So long as the present hit-and-miss system is pursued, that will go on. With our present machinery, we cannot contemplate the rigid form of rationing I envisage for the 100 and one commodities the Minister has sought to control.  I, therefore, make a concrete suggestion to the Minister.  Take a dozen articles which may be regarded <Col N="2052" /> as vital necessities and control them from the source to the point of consumption as, in fact, you do in respect of sugar, which is one of the most successful branches of rationing so far put into operation.  Let that apply all round.  Limit the number of goods to be controlled.  Then you can reasonably ask shopkeepers to keep exhaustive records and you can be reasonably certain that consumers who have ration cards will get that to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The Minister, from his own experience of the rationing system as applied to sugar, will agree with me that it is working better than any other system of rationing or control.  Let him extend it to such number of commodities as he is able effectively to control.  Let the others find their own level or, if they are truly luxury products, stop their manufacture completely, if that is necessary.  If they can conveniently continue to be supplied, well and good. Any little luxuries that relieve the darkness that surrounds us at present are very welcome.  But if they cannot be conveniently supplied, or if their supply simply gives rise to marketing abuses, let them go.  The raw materials from which they are being manufactured can be very profitably employed in the production of some bread-and-butter article of which there is a shortage in another sphere.</P>
    <P>I am keenly aware of the appalling inconvenience caused by the want of candles and paraffin oil.  It is very difficult for a man living in Dublin to understand what that means for people living in rural Ireland.  The man in Dublin is accustomed to a man turning on the electric light or the gas, and he does not care about the position of people in the country who find themselves in the dark at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and have to remain so until 9 o'clock next morning.  It does not occur to the man in Dublin what it means to a man in the country who has to make his way out to a cowhouse in the dark at 3 o'clock in the morning to look at a cow calving.</P>
    <P>That was the daily experience of many people in the country last winter. I cannot, however, hold the Minister responsible for that.  What can he do? <Col N="2053" /> He is exclusively dependent, as far as I know, for supplies of raw materials and paraffin wax on America or Great Britain, and I presume is getting as much as he can.  I direct his attention to it as, no doubt, other Deputies will, and I urge him to keep that position constantly in mind.  Owing to lack of personal experience of that kind of life, I urge him to be on guard against underestimating the magnitude of the inconvenience and real hardship that is being caused in rural Ireland. I suppose he is doing his best and therefore I cannot make a hullabaloo about it.  If I were in his position I do not know that I could do more than he is doing in order to get candles and lighting materials.</P>
    <P>I want to ask this question of the Minister.  Why are tea coupons cut out of ration books?  There are 300 or 400 coupons for tea and when they are cut out they are put into boxes in which they lie.  What happens then?  They are never asked for.  I have boot boxes full of tea coupons, and they are there to provide food for mice.  Think of 10,000 shopkeepers blunting their scissors cutting tea coupons to provide food for mice.</P>
    <P>I want also to protest against the practice of prosecuting well-known and respectable shopkeepers for overcharging ½d. or a ¼d., for which junior assistants are responsible.  I saw a case in the courts where a firm was brought up for overcharging ½d. and heavily fined, although they were able to prove that they had 1,000,000 transactions. They took every conceivable precaution to avoid overcharging, and had notices in the shop begging anybody who thought they were overcharged to draw their attention to it. Because one junior assistant overcharged that firm was prosecuted. Surely that was not necessary.  There ought to be some discretion shown before the Department institutes prosecutions of that kind, and there ought to be some evidence brought to the attention of the Minister which would lead him to believe that the price charged was in excess of the fixed price.  When talking about the charging of excessive prices I wonder if another section of the Minister's <Col N="2054" /> Department investigated the prices charged by the Turf Development Board.  I want to tell the House an illuminating story about what happened on one occasion, and I am telling it to the Minister so that he can investigate it.  I understand that the Minister for Supplies may investigate the affairs of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The Turf Development Board produce good turf charcoal and quoted £7 10s. 0d. a ton and got an order, but when the time for delivery arrived the price had gone up to £15.  There was to be no delivery until £15 was clapped on the table.  The firm concerned said: &ldquo;Very well, I suppose we have to stand and deliver.&rdquo;  They sent a supplementary cheque.  They then rang up the Turf Development Board to inform them that the lorry was going out, asking that their order should be ready.  They were then informed that there was a little matter of £5 for which a cheque was wanted.  When it was pointed out that there must be a mistake the reply was: &ldquo;Oh, the price has gone up. The charge is now £20 a ton.&rdquo;  I assure the House that at £20 a ton three tons were loaded on the lorry and brought home.  If that is not an astronomical price I do not know what is.  God help some unfortunate publican in Ballydehob if that happened. If it could be proved against him his name would stink in the nostrils of Caitlín Ní Houlihan.  God knows if anybody did that kind of thing his name would deserve to stink in the nostrils of the public.  If the facts as stated by me are true&mdash;and I know them to be true&mdash;the Minister when he comes to reply will, I hope, be good enough to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>There are all over the country large numbers of lorries laid up, on which the tyres are rotting, tanks leaking, and the batteries worn out.  Owners would sooner have scrap prices than have their vehicles disintegrating. There is at present no means of turning these lorries to a useful purpose. The Minister has stated that they should be sold through the ordinary channels of trade.  I do not know anybody who would buy a lorry at present. The Minister will not allow them to <Col N="2055" /> be sold in Northern Ireland and will not allow them to be renewed.  If they are left as they are they will rot. Surely these lorries ought to be acquired or taken over by the Army, in view of the fact that there are men there to maintain them and to look after them.  They could be sold at the end of the war.  In the meantime these lorries could be kept in some state of repair and would give a great many fellows who, I suppose, are short of work, employment.  If they were in charge of an Army maintenance staff they might turn in useful, and post-war might be sold, might be exported, or perhaps sold back to people who will require them, with the knowledge that they would be in good repair.  Many of them are lorries that could do with an overhauling.  Here you have a large staff of motor engineers attached to the Army, and I am sure that in their spare time they could find profitable occupation on that work.  We would then have a guarantee that at the end of the emergency we would have a fleet of motor transport upon which we could depend until new vehicles are available through the ordinary channels of supply.  After the emergency it will not be possible to buy a motor lorry in Eire for five years, because our place post-war, in priority of supply, is going to be very low, and a good deal of lorries of a commercial type will be required everywhere.  It is a shame to let them rot away, especially when you consider that most of them have five heavy tyres, and all of them have batteries, which I am informed are practically impossible to get at the present time.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I want to refer is Irish Shipping, Limited.  I have no desire to asperse in any way the directors of Irish Shipping, Limited. There are amongst them representatives of some of the oldest and most respected families in this country, men of whom any nation might be proud. But on more than one occasion here the Minister has sought to establish that, when speaking of Irish Shipping, Limited, we are speaking of five gentlemen who, without any reward whatever, are giving public service as <Col N="2056" /> directors of that board, and not infrequently he has compared Deputies in this House unfavourably with those gentlemen.  On an occasion recently he said that Deputies are well paid for anything they do, whereas those men are doing all they are doing for nothing. I want definitely to lay that &ldquo;codology,&rdquo; because &ldquo;codology&rdquo; it is. Technically, the five directors of Irish Shipping, Limited, receive no remuneration for their services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter was raised in Seanad Eireann yesterday by Senator Douglas, to which I want to refer.  Deputies may remember that about three weeks ago I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce a question relating to <Col N="2059" /> the proposal to apply the licensing system to the sale of textile goods in this country, and he replied that it was his intention to introduce such a scheme, because a practice had grown up of people running into shops and establishments of one kind or another and buying textiles, and then going out and selling them to other merchants at fancy prices.  No one who knows the drapery trade will deny that that abuse has existed.  I went on to ask the Minister a supplementary question as to whether it was true that part of the purpose of his licensing scheme was to confine the supply of textile goods to manufacturers; and, if so, whether he realised the consequences that that would bring down upon the country dressmaker, the country tailor and shopkeeper?  He said he believed that this plan would result in a more abundant supply for those persons.  But, now, what emerges?  Within three weeks of that statement, I understand that he has made, or contemplates making, an Order confining all supplies of shirting to the makers-up and all supplies of linings to the ready-made manufacturers in urban centres.</P>
    <P>I want to warn this House that if you permit the Minister for Supplies to limit the distribution of linings to the makers-up of ready-made clothing in urban centres you are going to carry destitution into hundreds of houses in this country.  There is not one amongst us who does not know some widow in our own town who set up as a dressmaker and reared her family on her earnings, or some poor tailor who is having a hard enough time as it is, with the competition of Polikoffs and other firms who are prepared to make up clothing on merchants' measurements after those have been sent through the post to Dublin.  The system was that if a man in a country town wanted to get a suit made, he bought the cloth and trimmings, and the tailor measured him and made up the suit for him.  Most of those people are now catered for by the shopkeeper measuring the customer on a special measuring chart supplied by the makers-up here in Dublin, and sending the cloth <Col N="2060" /> to Dublin, where it is cut and made up, with the result that many a country tailor is half idle as it is.  If all the linings which can be found are sent to the makers-up, it means that the country tailor may shut his shop, because no customer will cross his threshold, if he cannot bring the linings and trimmings, as no small country tailor has any stocks of them to carry on with.</P>
    <P>The drapers' shops in rural Ireland have a department devoted to ladies' dress goods and 80 per cent. of the dress goods&mdash;I am not talking of Manchester goods&mdash;finds its way ultimately into the hands of the country dressmaker. She may be good or she may be bad, but whatever she is, she is earning her living.  Usually, she is the mainstay of a family.  As we all know, it is pretty rarely that a married woman keeps on her dressmaking business after she marries, unless she is widowed or has a sick husband.  If you cut off the supply of linings and confine them to the makers-up in the City of Dublin, there is no use in a girl in the country buying a costume length: she cannot get the linings and buttons to trim it with, and no dressmaker can make it up without them.  If every dress goods counter in Ireland is to find itself confronted with the situation that it has no linings or trimmings to supply with dress goods offered for sale, a third of the shop assistants in rural Ireland must go out of a job, since there will be nothing for them to do.  Most of them are young people and, I suppose, they can go to England or fend for themselves in one way or another, though it is a great hardship that they should be sacrificed in order to enable a few warriors in back streets in Dublin to keep the wheels turning. I would be glad to see all the operatives in Dublin working, but I do not believe that every shopkeeper, dressmaker and tailor in rural Ireland should be sacrificed in order to keep four or five workshops open in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  Let justice be done, and let every one get a fair share.  I do not want to see all the workshops in Dublin, Cork or Limerick closed in order to keep the country <Col N="2061" /> tailors at work, but neither should be wiped out.</P>
    <P>There might be greater evidence of poverty amongst the families of those in the tailoring trade in Dublin than amongst the families of the country tailors or dressmakers, but those of us who know the interior, intimate life of the country tailor and dressmaker know that poverty may be just as near to their homes as to those of the factory worker in Dublin, but the country people, living in a country way, keep a better front.  But take away that little source of income and some of the proud, dignified, self-supporting people will be turned paupers.  The Taoiseach may dance a fandango, and say you cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.  You have no right to break eggs.  It is contrary to justice to sacrifice one side of the community who pay their share of the public costs, and take away their right to live, in order to render another section completely immune.  There ought to be justice between all parties.  The operatives in this city have their trade unions to speak and agitate, but the people for whom I am speaking have no one&mdash;they have no cohesion, no organisation, no influence, and no pull. Nevertheless, they are an essential part of the social life of the country town and parish and of the rural district with which those of us who live in the country are familiar.  We should protect them.  I am warning this House that, unless it is made perfectly clear to the Minister now that Deputies will not stand for an abuse of that kind, every tailor and dressmaker in the country will be out of a job, and a large number of shop assistants as well.  And remember that, in regard to a very large number of tailors and dressmakers in Ireland, if their trade connection is once broken, they are down and out and finished; they lose their skill and their connection and they never get back into it.  It will be a cruel injustice if that is allowed to happen.  In my opinion, it would be a great misfortune for the whole rural countryside.</P>
    <P>I do not want to depart from the Minister's Estimate without saying <Col N="2062" /> this.  I think it is pretty generally agreed by people on all sides&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, and others&mdash; that he has made a hell of a mess of it.  There is no use in crying over spilt milk.  He was always a bluffer&mdash; ever since he came into public life. The leopard does not change his spots. He bluffed his way in the period of emergency and the bluff was called. He had only four hearts and a club in his hand, and was trying to persuade the Powers of the world that he had a straight flush.  Well, there is no use in crying over that: that milk has been spilt and we have to make the best of the situation in which we find ourselves. That is what is important.  I suppose those of us who warned this House and the country against the danger of leaving a man of his character in the position in which the present Minister is would be entitled to a sort of bitter satisfaction in finding ourselves vindicated by events; but the time for that is not now.  The difficulties are too great to allow people to derive any satisfaction from a vindication of that kind.  The question is whether we have learned anything from the mistakes.  I very much fear we have not.  I think he is the same old bluffer and that he is getting ready to double the ante again, trusting that no one with a pair of threes will call him.  It seems to be absolutely certain, however, that he will be called.</P>
    <P>This emergency will go on for a long time and you cannot play poker against a situation of this kind if you have four hearts and a club in your hand. He thinks it is pedestrian and dull to play with a good hand, as it is not exciting.  For the time being, I think we would all prefer someone who had a more pedestrian approach to the problem than this brilliant and scintillating Minister whom we have now. An opportunity will be provided shortly to make that change.  I hope the country will make it.  For that reason, I do not regard the future as being as gloomy as I otherwise might.  I do not believe that you can get this man to do anything of an effective kind: I do not think it is in his nature to do it.  I do not think he is fit for his job.  We <Col N="2063" /> would be very ill employed arguing in this House on this Estimate, unless we had the hope of a chastening result from the impending general election. But with that in mind, I want to repeat what I have said repeatedly before.  The greatest bargaining asset we could have with the British at the present time is a supply of barley.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, I prepared and delivered to the Taoiseach a memorandum pointing out to him that, if he would arrange for the growing of sufficient quantities of barley in this country, we could use it as a bargaining counter with Great Britain, to secure supplies of wheat or of a variety of other valuable commodities of which we stand in need.  On that occasion, the Taoiseach, with great civility, told me that the thing was impracticable and could not be done.  Twelve months later, he found himself put to the pin of his collar, without any wheat, and trotted off to the British with Guinness's porter and swapped it for wheat.  It does not take much intelligence to realise that Guinness's porter is barley.  I put down a question in Dáil Eireann to ask when the practical difficulties which he then foresaw were overcome.  He begged me to take the question off the Order Paper as, he said, it would embarrass the negotiations in train.  I at once took it off the Order Paper.  Within three months, he came in here, like a cat with two tails, to announce the marvellous achievement of his own project. I wish to make a suggestion to the Minister for Supplies&mdash;and I address him as a corporation sole, in the belief that some other man will occupy his seat after the next general election.</P>

On this occasion I address the Minister <Col N="2064" /> as a corporation sole.  I think it is too late now to get anything effective done by the present Minister, but this is not going to be the last year of the emergency.  There are several years ahead and I suggest to the Minister that he should take up with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, who, God grant, is a corporation sole, the question of getting produced from our own soil and resources an abundance of barely in the knowledge that (1) it is an invaluable bargaining counter in dealing with Britain whether it be used by them for brewing or distilling or as a bread admixture, that (2) it is a valuable potential constituent of our own bread supply, and (3) that it is a most valuable weapon against the wheat racketeers when they attempt to bring pressure to bear on the Government to jack up the price of wheat.  I suppose they are even now gnashing their teeth or blooding their claws to raise the price of wheat by blackmailing the promoters of the wheat policy and the Government will have to stop that blackmail.</P>

I now suggest that they store all the barley they possibly can for the three purposes I have outlined. If the Minister for Supplies, the present occupant of the office, gives an undertaking to give effect to those suggestions I would even suspect myself that he showed signs of reform.  However, it is pretty certain that he will not.  Therefore, we may all look forward with complacency to the general election that lies ahead, which will have only one redeeming feature. Undoubtedly, it will place this country in great peril, but it will remove from it the incubus of the Ministers for Supplies and Agriculture, and if we can get rid of them, it will be well worth experiencing the great danger which an election at this stage entails.</P>

      <P>The Minister in the latter portion of his statement yesterday evening said that he hoped that contributions to the discussion would be of a constructive character.  It appears to me that we might have expected that with more confidence if the Minister had taken the precaution of committing his statement to paper and issuing it to Deputies.  In the course of his statement he had to give the House quite a number of figures, percentages and so on.  It was not so easy to follow them and at a later stage&mdash;I think it was in answer to Deputy Belton&mdash;the Minister added something which he had not got in his statement. I am not making that statement positively but that is my impression because I took down what the Minister said.  He did not give us the letters <Col N="2066" />&ldquo;c.i.f.&rdquo;.  If he did they escaped my memory.</P>

      <P>It is strange that I took it down, but I have not got these letters added.  However, that is a small matter.  Speaking for myself, I should say that I have very little hope of impressing upon the Minister or the Ministry any views with regard to supplies.  I think that the administration of the affairs of this country from the commencement of the emergency up to date has been simply deplorable. The worst feature was, perhaps&mdash;though this is not exactly the Minister's responsibility, but rather that of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;that during a period of almost 12 months they allowed to go practically unchecked a foot-and-mouth epidemic in this country.  The Minister may reasonably ask what that question has to do with this debate. During the period of that epidemic our imports naturally decreased, and by the time we had some agricultural produce to export, the price which had to be paid for imports which we did get had risen considerably.  While the epidemic cost us £500,000 by way of loss of stock which had to be slaughtered, it is more than possible that the increase in the price of goods which had to be imported, and the fact that we had to do without them during the period of the epidemic cost us four or five times that amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We exported practically nothing during that period and, consequently, we imported nothing. If the Minister will look at the returns for that period he will find that our imports diminished as our exports diminished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time of emergency like this when shipping space is at a premium, does the Minister not know that no country, belligerent or otherwise, is going to send out full ships if they are to return empty, particularly a country like Britain which, at that particular time, had no shipping to spare?  The Minister's attempt to explain away that is typical of the entire Government approach to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy suggest that there were goods waiting to be shipped at the other side and that there were no ships to convey them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Our exports went down and our imports went down also.  We had no agricultural exports during this period and consequently we had no imports or at least our imports were very substantially reduced.  That is my case for saying that there is no hope whatever for the future of this country under the control of the present Government. The view which the people of this country hold of the men responsible for that condition of affairs is such that these men will not be in their offices after the next two or three months.  There is no question about that.  You may humbug the people for a long time but not for all of the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn next to the question of the administration of this office.  The Minister, last week, in reply to a question by Deputy Pattison, dealing with advertisements in the <i>Kilkenny People</i>, said that he had intended to give the editor of that paper an interview but that in view of an article which appeared in it he had decided otherwise. I have already pointed out many times to members of the Ministry that this country is not theirs, that it belongs to the people, that they are expected to administer the affairs of the country fairly and justly, that they have neither right nor title to parcel out in a corrupt or unfair manner any <Col N="2068" /> patronage or power they have got.  The Minister has no right whatever to refuse advertisements to that newspaper, merely because it criticises either him or members of his Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the reason they were refused at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is stated now. What was the reason for saying that, in view of an article which appeared in that newspaper, the Minister would not see the gentleman concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I declined to be blackmailed by personal abuse into giving advertisements to a newspaper which would not otherwise get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That newspaper has a larger circulation than any other paper in these counties.  The information which the Government has got for the people of this country is for the people, and it should be got to them through and by the means which is most extensive. I say that it is corrupt and verging upon the criminal to refuse to publish in that newspaper information which is for the people.  Would the Minister explain in the course of his reply why it is that another newspaper here in Dublin has cause for complaint in connection with the issue of newsprint?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That arises on the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>And does the same apply to the <i>Kilkenny People</i>?  Then, I have this to say, that it is more and more clear that the same Minister ought not to have charge of Supplies and Industry and Commerce.  It is enough, and apparently too much, to give him either one or the other of these two offices.  It is far beyond his capacity to deal with the two of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to prosecutions, it is quite true, as the law stands, or rather under this endless circulation of decrees and amendments of decrees, the Minister has the power to <Col N="2069" /> withdraw a licence once given, but he has not the right to do it on an improper basis.  If, by reason of a breach of the law, a person is convicted in court, a penalty is fixed and the judge appointed in accordance with the laws of this State administers the law in the court.  No second court is provided for.  The Minister is not a judge; no official in his Department is a judge; and no exercise of the power of administration gives the Minister the power which should be only that of a judge.  He can, if he wishes, place amongst the penalties a fine and loss of a licence.  He can have that dealt with by the court and let it be part of the penalty, but he has no moral right to assume power to prosecute and power to take revenge.  If the Minister knew his Scripture properly, he would know that &ldquo;&lsquo;Revenge is mine,&rsquo; saith the Lord.&rdquo;  It is not the Minister's, and he cannot afford to usurp a power which is not his.  He had better put that matter right and let the courts decide the penalties following prosecution and conviction.</P>
    <P>I should say, speaking again for myself, that it appears to me that the manner of bringing prosecutions which has been the practice for some months past in the Minister's Department is little short of a joke.  It is a mockery. An officer from the Minister's Department calls upon a man engaged in business and puts to him a proposition that he should buy sugar from him or sell sugar to him.  He gains the man's consent, and the transaction is completed. The man is prosecuted, but he is not prosecuted in one of the courts set up for the purpose.  He is prosecuted before the Military Tribunal. That officer of the Minister's Department is, in essence, the Minister, and he enters into and perpetrates a criminal act.  The Minister is the criminal in that case.</P>
    <P>What respect will there be for either the law or the administration of the law if no person in the State, when he interviews an official, can be satisfied in his mind that he will not be tempted to a breach of the law?  Are Ministers above the law?  Are the officials of the State above the law?  If they do not keep the law, is it not to <Col N="2070" /> be expected that ordinary citizens, who are taxed to pay Ministers' salaries and officials' salaries, will in future be suspicious of every official calling upon them, fearing they might be tempted to break the law?  These <i>agents provocateurs</i> constituted one of the complaints against the British administration here.  They were held in contempt by every public man and private citizen in the State at the time, and were denounced on all sides.  Have we lived through these years to reach a position when a miserable number of prosecutions are brought, in the first place, and, in the second, when the most notorious of them is the result of the criminal act of a Minister of State and officials of his Ministry?  If the Minister wants constructive suggestions, I put it to him that that should stop.  Whether it will be possible to get back any respect for the Ministry once it is stopped, I cannot say, but at any rate there can be no respect while that practice is in operation.</P>
    <P>We hear on occasion of new regulations in the form of restriction or impositions of one kind or another. This time 12 months, we put it to the Minister that, before embarking on any new series of regulations, restrictions or impositions, the persons engaged in the trade ought to be consulted, that in the case of a neighbouring country very much larger than this country and having a much more extensive industrial business than we have, that system had been in operation practically since the commencement of the emergency, and that it had worked well.  Here we have had recently quite a plethora of communications to the Press, addresses by people in business and so on regarding their complaints about prices.  When there is a dispute or an application in connection with an increase in wages a tribunal is set up to consider both sides of the case.  Both sides are heard, the matter is investigated thoroughly, and a decision is given by an impartial appointee of the Minister, but one outside the service.  I should like to know what happens with regard to this matter of prices.  Is the matter decided behind closed doors, without taking the advice of the people who <Col N="2071" /> are concerned in the matter and who would be able to give an expert opinion?  I suggest to the Minister that some such body as that which considers applications for increases in wages should be set up to consider the matter of the control and fixing of prices.</P>
    <P>I would also put this constructive suggestion to the Minister: that there should be an issue of sugar for the manufacture of jam.  I think it would be very unfortunate if, as a result of the non-issue of sugar in this country, the fruit available for the manufacture of jam should be lost.  This is a period of stress in which we cannot afford any loss of that kind, and however big the drain may be on the reserves of sugar, I think it would be better in the interests of our people as a whole that an issue of sugar should be made for that purpose.  While I am on that point, I should like to know why it was decided that there should be an importation of oats some time ago.  I am presuming that the oats came in through the shipping company that was set up by the State.  Now, the price at which it came in was 35/-.  Is there any person in this country, with oats available, who if he were offered 35/-, would not have been willing to sell?  Why then, if it were so expensive, could not some other commodity have been selected for import rather than oats at 35/-?  It was most expensive from many angles. If we take one angle that, perhaps, might appeal more to the Minister than others, I might point out that in the judgment of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, the price of oats was fixed at 25/8 as the maximum that could be given to anybody in this country for oats last year.  Why not have imported sugar?  Was it not anticipated that there would have been a sugar shortage?  I suggest that a greater saving, from the national point of view, could have been effected by the importation of sugar for the manufacture of jam, rather than by the importation of oats, because it would have meant that we could have put an extra foodstuff on the market.</P>
    <P>The figures that the Minister gave us in connection with the price of wheat <Col N="2072" /> appear to me to be very different from the figures that were given to us some 12 or 18 months ago.  My recollection is that the price then was far greater than this 50/7, c.i.f., and perhaps the Minister will tell us what has happened in regard to the fall in price.  Has there been a reduction in respect of freight or insurance charges, and would he give us some information regarding the profits of the Irish Shipping Company&mdash;profits that have been made in connection with the transport of those goods?  Would he tell us to what purpose those profits are being devoted; whether they come into the Exchequer or whether it has been found that the original charges for freight were excessive and that it was found possible to reduce them?</P>
    <P>The last item about which I should like to say a word is turf.  I think that of all the ghastly failures for which this Government were responsible, the greatest is in connection with the turf business.  I have experience of turf in two houses&mdash; an office and a house.  I would not say that the quality of the turf could be given a certificate by even the most optimistic supporter of the Minister. Assuming that the figure we got yesterday, of 87/6, is correct, the price is absolutely prohibitive.  This is apparently a kind of a step-ladder arrangement, where everybody puts on something in order to increase the price.  The last time we heard of a synthetic price here it was 85/&mdash;the Minister's own figure&mdash;and it has gone up by 2/6 since.  It does not surprise me in the least that persons engaged on the bogs in this country are not looking for increases in wages.  The information that was given to us at the meeting of the county surveyors some 12 or 18 months ago&mdash;within the last couple of years at any rate&mdash;was that turf was being produced in certain bogs in the country for about 10/- a ton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What bogs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Down in Mayo.  That was the cost, of course, of production in the bogs before the turf was taken out of the bog or put on rail.  It was the first operation and, probably, the <Col N="2073" /> cheapest one of the lot, but 10/- was the figure.  By the time that turf gets up here, evidently, there are all kinds of extravagant costs added on, but does it not seem extraordinary that there should be a cost of 87/6 a ton by the time it gets here?  Can the Minister tell us whether the turf transported by the Turf Development Board, or Fuel Importers, Limited, or whatever combination of these bodies and his Ministry are responsible for the cartage of turf up to Dublin, cannot be stopped at, let us say, Lucan or Celbridge, to supply the people there, instead of having to come up to Dublin and then having to be brought back there again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This business, of course, was managed in the usual way in which a Government or a municipality goes into it.  If it can spend money extravagantly, it will do so.  I think that any business person in this country that you could ask at any given moment to handle this matter would be able to beat that price of 87/6.  I understand also that the county councils have suffered a loss that is not provided for here.  I hope that that is not correct.  Was there ever an attempt made to put this matter on a business basis?  Did any single Department of State undertake this business of the transportation of turf? You have two Departments: one is the Board of Works and the other is the Army.  Could they not have done it more cheaply than at this prohibitive and exorbitant price that we have to-day?  Did they get in any better quality of turf?  Some time ago I put some questions to the Minister regarding the quality of the turf sold in Cork. The people there, as a matter of fact, have nothing to tell me about the inferior quality of the turf we are getting, because I saw it here in Dublin and I know it.  I did not see it in Cork, but I was told that the quality was not good, and at £4 7s. 6d. a ton there is still a bill to be met by the county council.  The Minister wants constructive suggestions.  What constructive suggestions does he expect me to make in regard to that matter? I suggest that the most constructive suggestion I could make would be that <Col N="2074" /> he and his Government should clear out before the people take the matter into their own hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather a good thing that this Estimate has followed the Estimate for the Department of Justice.  During the discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Justice, the Minister for Justice proved himself a very dismal Jerry.  He told us that crime had increased by 200 per cent.  In the course of the discussion on that Estimate it was made clear that that increase in crime was due mainly to the maladministration of supplies; that it was due to the fact that the ordinary channels for the distribution of supplies had been upset and disorganised and, as a result, people were engaged in exchanging commodities by other means than through the lawful channels and that was the real reason why crime has increased to such an extent.  It is, therefore, upon the shoulders of the Minister for Supplies that we can place the entire responsibility for the enormous increase in crime which has taken place in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another new one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Through his maladministration, through his failure to provide the people with essential requirements, through his failure to ensure that what supplies were available would be equally distributed, he has created an illegal trade in every sphere of activity. Heretofore the ordinary citizen purchased the things he required from a lawfully established retailer; the retailer purchased his requirements from the wholesaler or the importer. To-day the citizen who requires certain essential commodities must make contact with, perhaps, some absolute stranger.  We have heard and read of large sums of money changing hands in public houses and at street corners for goods and, so long as that situation prevails, is it not certain that the criminal, the person who is out to rob and to defraud, will get ample opportunity for so doing?  Heretofore the thief had few opportunities of securing a market for articles he unlawfully <Col N="2075" /> appropriated.  Now he has ample opportunities provided for him through the failure of the Minister for Supplies to do his job.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, there is an attempt being made to squeeze out of business the small businessman.  His business has been surrounded by every form of restriction and control and, not alone is he subject to drastic penalties under the various emergency Orders, but, in addition, he is likely to be subject to the wiping out of his business by the Minister for Supplies.  Nothing can justify that form of tyranny.  It is criminally unjust to take from a man his means of livelihood.  A citizen who is brought into court, and tried, knows the charge that is preferred against him and knows the penalty which is likely to be imposed upon him.  But when, in addition to that, a Government Department, without any court procedure, without any tribunal or trial, proceeds to wipe that man's business out of existence, it is time for the House to call a halt.</P>
      <P>Most of us in this country have sprung from farming stock.  Our people fought hard to secure fixity of tenure in their homes.  That is the principle which formed the backbone of the national movement.  It was and is the accepted principle that a man must be secure in his means of livelihood. To-day the small businessman who has built up a connection finds, as a result of the action of a Government Department, his entire business wiped out, his home gone and his family left without means of existence.  That is one of the greatest injustices that could be imposed upon the people.  It is being imposed on small businessmen by a Department which has proved itself, and by a Minister who has proved himself, incapable of performing even ordinary duties.</P>

    <P>The Minister may find shelter behind the fact that he has under his control a number of Departments.  If he is criticised for his action in one particular connection, he can say that that is the function of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is difficult for Deputies to distinguish between the <Col N="2076" /> Minister's functions as Minister for Industry and Commerce and as Minister for Supplies.  One would imagine that the main business of the Department of Supplies is, first, to make supplies available and, secondly, when they are available, to distribute them. Yet, yesterday, when the Minister for Supplies was questioned in regard to the newsprint for one newspaper, he found shelter in the plea that that was the function of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  What the Department of Industry and Commerce could have to do with the distribution of newsprint, which is imported, it is difficult to understand.  The Minister is developing into a kind of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and it is impossible to follow his activities.</P>
    <P>In connection with one of his activities for which, I think, he acknowledges responsibility as Minister for Supplies, he said that over 500,000 tons of merchandise were brought in last year by Irish Shipping, Limited, and that 55,000 tons were conveyed by other companies.  It would be of great interest to know how much of these supplies represented foodstuffs, and how much manufactured articles or other essential requirements, such as artificial manures and raw materials for the manufacture of goods which could not, under any circumstances, be produced here.  It is quite clear that a very large proportion of the shipping provided by Irish Shipping, Limited, is being utilised for the importation of goods, such as foodstuffs, which could have been produced here if the Minister and his colleagues had done their job properly.  There is no doubt that the area under tillage was not stepped up quickly enough early in the emergency.  It could have been done if the Departments concerned had realised the magnitude of the problem they were up against in providing food for our human and animal population.  If they had realised that, and were responsible men, they would have provided, in the first year of the emergency, sufficient money to make that increased production possible. To finance that rapid and extensive expansion in tillage might have entailed the floating of a loan of £20,000,000, but such a step would <Col N="2077" /> have been amply justified by the results.  Because of the failure of the Minister to ensure that sufficient supplies of wheat for essential foodstuffs were produced here, a vast amount of Irish shipping has had to be devoted to the importation of food, and the lives of Irish sailors have had to be sacrificed to bring to this country essential requirements which the Irish farmer and farm worker could have produced if given the opportunity, with the necessary remuneration, equipment and finance, to carry out the operation. Last year we had to import a considerable quantity of wheat.  We also had to import sugar.  That would not have been necessary if adequate steps had been taken to ensure that our production was brought up to the necessary standards.</P>
    <P>I think there is no justification whatever for the Minister's statement that the consumption of butter has increased by 126,000 cwts.  I do not know where he got that figure.  A very large percentage of our butter is produced on the farms and sold locally.  Therefore, it would be impossible for the Minister or the Government to check up on production or consumption. Those with a knowledge of rural conditions are aware that home-produced butter has fallen by at least one-third of what it was before the emergency. That is the real cause of the present serious shortage.  Does anyone imagine that the action of the Minister in fixing the present price for butter will bring about increased production?  Is it not obvious that it will still further depress production?  In addition, retailers are being cut down to a margin of profit which will drive them completely out of the business.  That will mean that, in a short time, butter will not come on the markets at all, but will be sold through other channels than retailers. That is just another example of the way in which people are being driven out of old established businesses by the incompetence of the Minister's Department, and of the creation of new and irregular methods in the distribution of supplies which make for dishonesty and for criminal activities in every shape and form.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to a <Col N="2078" /> matter that is mentioned in the Estimate, namely, that quite a considerable number of the officials in the Minister's Department who have control over the distribution of supplies &mdash;321 temporary clerical assistants&mdash;are earning salaries of 19/- per week.  They have charge; to a large extent, of the distribution of goods here.  They have very far-reaching power over the business of the entire community.  Does anyone suggest that officials remunerated on that basis are qualified, or could be expected to be qualified, to take over such serious and responsible positions?  I know, of course, that there is some bonus attached to the 19/-.</P>

      <P>The Minister may try to get away with it that way, but those who know anything about the Department of Supplies know the way things are managed there.  They know that the junior officials there have very far-reaching powers.  They deal with correspondence and with application forms, and by their method of doing so they may, and very often do, deprive people of supplies which they require or delay the issue of supplies for such a prolonged period that when they eventually reach the people for whom they are intended they may be of no use to them.  That is why I say these officials have very important functions. <Col N="2079" /> I told the Minister before, and think it necessary to repeat it, that the whole system of controlling the distribution of supplies is wrong.  The centralisation of this Department in the City of Dublin is also wrong.  It is impossible for a staff centred in this city to understand the needs of the rural population: the small farmer, the small trader, the tradesman in our rural towns and villages.  Therefore, they have to be guided by the correspondence received.  They have no actual contact with the people who make the written applications and whose interests are involved.  If the Minister were wise he would accept the suggestion which I made to him already, namely, that in every area a responsible person would be put in charge of the distribution of supplies so as to ensure close personal contact between the Department and the people interested.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of it is to clarify the position so far as the annual certification of solicitors is concerned. Up to recently it was thought that the Chief State Solicitor was exempted, from the provisions of Section 58 of the Solicitors (Ireland) Act, that is, from paying his annual certification fee.  But in a recent case in which the State was successful, when he claimed costs he was held not to be entitled to them.  It is to rectify that position that this Bill is necessary.  It has to be made retrospective because other cases may be pending.  It was always understood he was exempt, but the Taxing Master ruled against him.</P>

It was believed that, under one of the British Acts, the State Solicitors would be exempt here as, I think, they were in the British times but, apparently, that is not the case.  The number would be about 20.  There are some solicitors in the service who do pay the annual fee, that is, the State pays it for them.</P>

      <P>I presume the reason why the Minister for Justice was given charge of this Bill is because of his well-known disarming method of introducing Bills into this House.  He has lived up to his reputation, certainly, in introducing this particular Bill.  Judging by the casual way in which he threw it at the House, one would <Col N="2083" /> think it was a perfectly innocuous Bill that all Parties should be willing to acclaim and pass in the shortest possible time.  He has not told a story which is very far from being innocuous and which is at the back and basis of this Bill.  It is a Bill which, in my opinion, this House should oppose.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Should oppose.  There is, as I say, some history behind this Bill.  The Bill, as it stands, purports to release all solicitors in the employment of the State from a statutory duty to pay the necessary annual licensing fee payable under the Solicitors (Ireland) Act, 1898.  As I understand, the practice in the days before this State was established was that, with the exception of the Revenue Solicitor, who was by statute exempt from the payment of this duty, all solicitors in the employment of the State paid this duty or had it paid for them by the State.  The position since the State came in is that, with the exception of, I think, the Revenue Solicitor and the Chief State Solicitor, all solicitors in the employment of the State in fact either paid their annual licence duty or had it paid for them. All solicitors have to do this and there is a very severe penalty attaching not merely to nonpayment but to non-punctual payment of this annual licence fee.  It is a penalty which affects not merely the solicitor who fails, perhaps through oversight or excessive business, to pay punctually within the period mentioned in the statute the annual licence fee, but it affects also the client because the provision of the Act of 1898 prescribed that if the fee is not paid within the specified period, even though it is paid perhaps an hour after the specified period or a very short time after it, the penalty attaching to that is that neither the solicitor nor the client can recover any costs to which he has been declared entitled by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a solicitor conducts on behalf of a client successful litigation in court, and gets from the court an award of <Col N="2084" /> costs against his opponent, who is well able to pay it, if the solicitor, through a mere oversight or through being very busy at the time, or perhaps through neglect of one of the clerks in his office, fails to pay the duty and has not paid the duty when the costs come for taxation, then neither he nor his client can get either the costs or the actual out-of-pocket money that has been expended in the course of the litigation. The counsel who are employed in the case, unless they get it from their client, cannot get paid; and if, as is usual and the normal practice, counsel get their cheque from the solicitor with their briefs, he paying it out of his own pocket, that solicitor can never get it back.  If the client has put&mdash;as the phrase goes&mdash;the solicitor &ldquo;in funds&rdquo; to pay the expenses of counsel, witnesses' expenses and medical expenses, or matters of that kind, and those expenses are paid by the solicitor in due course, he cannot recover nor can his client recover that amount.</P>
    <P>That is a very severe penalty imposed both on the solicitor and the client.  There is no reason, the law being applicable to State solicitors and solicitors in the employment of the State, why it should not apply to such solicitors.  Certainly, there is no justification whatever for the retrospective operation of this Bill because it is going to affect rights already acquired.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Allow me to develop and I will show you that it is.  The first section of the Bill proceeds on its face to declare a statutory lie, if I may put it like that.  We are going to lie statutorily.  We are going to declare that it is not and never was obligatory for a solicitor employed in the service of the State to take out a solicitor's certificate.  It always was the obligation of a solicitor to do it. That is the law.  That law has been given effect to in at least one case, and I think more, that have come before the taxing masters in which the State got costs and, when they came to tax them, were met with the objection that the State Solicitor had not taken out a certificate and, accordingly, <Col N="2085" /> the Act operated and the State was not entitled to the costs.</P>
      <P>There was something in the nature of peculiar poetic justice in the situation which confronted the State when this point was raised against them for it had been the practice&mdash;perhaps not the correct legal practice&mdash;for years here, where solicitors through a genuine oversight failed to pay for a few days their licence duty, not to raise the point on taxation but, a short time ago, directions were given from the Department of Finance that this point should be raised by the taxing masters in every single case.  That direction arose out of a case that was determined in the High Court on an application for <i>habeas corpus,</i> I believe. An application was successfully made, I think, to Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy, founded on the invalidity of one of the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act and Mr. Gavan Duffy gave the order for <i>habeas corpus,</i> declaring that that particular provision of the Statute was either unconstitutional or had been infringed. The solicitor who was acting for the applicant in that case was in fact either interned or detained.  By reason of that fact, he was not able to pay his licence duty but he wrote a letter from his place of detention, as I am informed, directing that his licence duty should be paid.  Perhaps in the circumstances confronting his office at the time, or for some reason that is certainly very explicable, his licence duty was not paid punctually but it was paid afterwards.  The solicitor, on behalf of his client, conducted that litigation successfully and got costs against the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be surmised that it was as a result of the letter that he wrote that it came to the knowledge of the Department of Finance, or the officials concerned, that his licence duty was not paid.  He had intended it to be paid, but could not pay it because of the fact that he was incarcerated. When his costs against the State came to be taxed the objection was raised on behalf of the Department of Finance, &ldquo;you cannot get your costs because your licence duty was not paid in time&rdquo;&mdash;although it was then <Col N="2086" /> paid.  He was deprived of a very substantial sum of costs, and the counsel engaged in the case was deprived of the remuneration which he had earned, and very hardly earned, in the conduct of that successful <i>habeas corpus</i> proceeding. He never got it, and, of course, he would not ask his client, in the circumstances, to pay what the State ought to have paid.</P>
    <P>That is the situation in which this Bill comes before the House.  The State raised that point against a man whom they had incarcerated and who, because he was incarcerated, had not his licence duty paid in time.  They declined to honour what was in fact a moral obligation to that man who successfully carried out proceedings of a a type that are embodied in the Constitution for the protection of the citizens of this State, namely, <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings.  The court, in the exercise of its discretion, had thought fit to order that the State should, in the circumstances of the case, pay the costs.  But, instead of paying the costs, the State raised the technical point that the solicitor who had conducted the proceedings had not paid his licence duty.  Now, because the same point is raised against the State, as the State did not comply with its statutory obligation, and the State is deprived of a small amount of costs, the Minister brings in a Bill to provide not merely for the future but for the past.  As I read this Bill, it will enable the State to recover a sum for costs against certain public bodies to which they are not entitled (1) on the law, and (2) on the practice initiated by themselves to gain an immoral advantage. In that state of affairs, this Bill is wholly indefensible.</P>
    <P>A case came before the Taxing Master in which, I think, the Minister for Local Government had been dismissed from certain proceedings and got costs against two public bodies&mdash; the county councils, I think, of Clare and Galway.  The State proceeded to tax these costs against the two public bodies and were met by this objection. There was only one thing for the Taxing Master to do&mdash;to follow the rule in the previous proceedings and decline to tax the costs of the Minister for Local Government.  Hence this <Col N="2087" /> Bill.  It was all right for the State to repudiate its moral obligation to a solicitor who had been&mdash;I think illegally&mdash;in custody but who was subsequently released.  He had directed his office to pay his licence duty but, owing to an oversight or for some other reason, it was not paid.  Solicitor, counsel and client were deprived of their costs by the State for the first time in the history of the State or even during the British régime.  The State repudiated what I say was a moral obligation, not merely to the solicitor, but to counsel and their client. Because the same rule which the Department of Finance initiated is operated against the State very shortly afterwards, in comes this Bill, with retrospective effect.  What is fish for one is flesh for another.  If this is to be done retrospectively for the State, it should be done retrospectively for all solicitors.  I know some solicitors who, following the ordinary practice, which had been winked at for some years, did not pay their licence duty on the day it was supposed to be paid. Although they paid within a few days, they were met by this objection and deprived, not merely of their costs, but of their out-of-pocket expenses&mdash;money which they had disbursed to counsel, medical experts and other persons of that type.  There is to be no retrospective remedy for those solicitors, but the State must get its costs against the county councils of Clare and Galway.</P>
    <P>This Bill proceeds to declare on its face something which is quite untrue&mdash; that it is not, and never was, obligatory for solicitors employed by the State to take out a certificate.  It always was obligatory.  The effect of this will be that, that statutory lie having been enacted, the Minister for Local Government, through one of the State solicitors, can re-lodge his bill of costs and get them from the parties to that litigation in circumstances in which they had acquired a vested right under the law as it stands at the moment, not to have these costs collected from them.  That vested right was given to them by the action of the Minister himself in initiating the practice <Col N="2088" /> to which I have referred.  When that practice is turned against himself, he introduces into this House legislation of a type which is always objectionable&mdash;retrospective legislation&mdash;but which is particularly objectionable in this case, because it is not universally retrospective but retrospective only in so far as Government Departments are concerned.  Those solicitors who, by inadvertence or for some other reason, did not pay their licence duty in time are not to get the same treatment as the Minister's employees.  The Minister casts his net more widely than it was ever cast before.</P>
    <P>I believe that the only solicitor exempt from this obligation during the British régime was the Revenue Solicitor.  I believe that that is the law at present.  It may have been the practice for the Chief State Solicitor not to take out his certificate, but it was contrary to the law.  It was equally the practice that such a point would not be raised against a solicitor who had overlooked this obligation for a short time but who had, in fact, paid the duty before the taxation of the costs which he was seeking to recover.  If the practice is to obtain in one case, it should obtain in the other.  If it was the practice for the Chief State Solicitor not to have his licence duty paid for the past 21 years and, nevertheless, to be able to recover costs, then it ought to be the practice in the case of other solicitors.  If this Bill is, retrospectively, to enable the State to recover costs to which they are not legally entitled, it ought to cover solicitors who can give a genuine excuse for the non-payment of their licence duty.  Unless this Bill is radically altered, particularly in its retrospective provisions, this House should reject it.</P>

      <P>It was the practice not to do so, and it was the practice not <Col N="2089" /> to raise the point.  Once the point was raised, then the practice on the other side should have been adhered to as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We took over the position exactly as we found it under the last Government.  The duty on behalf of the Chief State Solicitor never was paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to deal with that.  The licence duty was not paid, and it was believed that it was not necessary to pay it.  I have here particulars which, I am sure, are correct, as to what the practice was in the past. Section 58 of the Solicitors (Ireland) Act, 1898, exempted from its provisions as to examination, swearing, admission or enrolment or any rights or privileges, persons appointed to be solicitors to the Treasury, Customs, Inland Revenue, Post Office, any other branch of Her Majesty's Revenue, Solicitor to the Admiralty or the War Office, and the section, furthermore, expressly preserved provisions in the Customs and Inland Revenue codes which conferred further exemptions on revenue officers.  This section was in similar terms to Section 50 of the Attorneys and Solicitors Act (Ireland), 1866, which had been repealed by the Act of 1898.  Between 1880 and 1920 the organisation and division of work between the Chief Crown Solicitor and the Treasury Solicitor underwent many changes. Neither the Treasury Solicitor nor the Chief Crown Solicitor at any time took out and stamped the necessary certificate, and, of course, the same practice was followed by the solicitors to the Revenue and the Post Office.  Apparently, in Deputy Costello's time it was felt that it was not necessary for the Chief State Solicitor, who was understood to be the successor to the Chief Crown Solicitor, to take out a certificate.  Now, we are told it was the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder why the Deputy did not tell the Government <Col N="2090" /> that.  We believed that the Government was properly advised in the Deputy's time and we simply carried on the practice.  As to the statement that a man was illegally imprisoned, obviously Deputy Costello does not know what he is talking about there. It was on my warrant he was interned. I know all about that matter.  That man was not illegally interned.  The one mistake made was that he was allowed out.  I will try to ascertain if it is a fact that the solicitor referred to by the Deputy was not paid.  I believe he was paid.  I am not now prepared to say definitely that that is so, because it is too late in the evening to make inquiries.  I am told by my advisers that they believe that the solicitor was paid his costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that he was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept that statement.  I may be wrong but I will make certain about it later on.  I admit that the Department of Finance raised a point there.  It was not because the man had been interned. He was out long enough and could have paid the fee.  It was not correct to say that he was illegally detained. I am surprised at Deputy Costello saying so.  I know all about the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I know nothing about it.  I say that he was illegally detained or, in fact, detained, because it was in the course of that period that the matter was tested in the courts by <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings, and I presume, perhaps wrongly, that the order detaining him was covered by the decision of Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.  As far as the retrospective aspect is concerned, I admit that the Bill might debar some cases from rights they had acquired.  That is not intended.  The Attorney-General is not appealing in that case.  We are paying the costs but we are protecting the State against any other cases that might come along. In this case Clare County Council are paying up.  I am going to force this Bill through because we do not know how many other cases may be involved. I might have expected opposition from <Col N="2091" /> other people, but certainly not from the legal adviser to a Government from which we took over.  There was never any question about the matter when Deputy Costello was in office. The fee was never paid in his time, and was never paid in our time.</P>
      <P>Until this case was raised we never knew anything about it.  Apparently Deputy Costello believed that the position was analogous to that of a Chief Crown solicitor, and acted in that belief when he did not advise against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but the point was never raised.  It was also proper that it should not be raised against anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that it has been raised.  A specific case that went to court was settled and the man is going to be paid his costs.  The Bill is retrospective in case any other cases might arise.  As far as this particular case is concerned I say that we will not deprive anyone of anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have information, which I believe is correct, that the costs were paid subsequently.  If the Deputy consults counsel he will find that he was paid.  A question was raised by the Department of Finance but the solicitor was paid his costs subsequently. I could not be positive about it until I was able to confirm the facts.  Undoubtedly a point was raised, as apparently the Department of Finance look into these things, and they found that the solicitor had not <Col N="2092" /> paid the duty.  It should be remembered that this stamp had to be paid to the State.  If the State had to pay it would be a matter between one Department and another.  It should not be like the case of an outsider.  It was a case in which the State paid and exempted its own servants.</P>

      <P>As far as the State is concerned in any case that has occurred the exercise of objection will not take place in respect to costs.  I do not want to catch the Minister in case he could not answer definitely, as possibly the Department of Finance will have views to express.  I am <Col N="2093" /> taking it that in these cases we are putting a gown around State solicitors or whoever the Minister intends to shepherd, but there are other people affected.  Our case is that in at least one case a solicitor has not been paid and that the State owes the money.  It is scarcely fair that we should seek to get for the State a certain advantage which we would deny to an individual. As the Minister knows, we have no interest in any individual.  In this Bill we are taking power to give the State a retrospective advantage which is denied to the individual.  Will the Minister meet us on that point?  If he can, he can have his Bill now.  I am not making a bargain, but I tell him that the position we are seeking is one in which the State should not have an advantage which was denied to others.</P>

I do not want to use the word &ldquo;undertake&rdquo;, but, if it transpires that I am correct, will the Minister see to it that counsel in that case will be paid the fee to which he is entitled?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and he pays counsel.  Whatever views anybody may have of this solicitor's political activities, I can give him here in this House a certificate of honesty in regard to payment of counsel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly prepared to accept the Minister's word at once, but it may be that there is a genuine error somewhere.  If it transpires that there is an error, will the Minister see that justice is done?  I will make further inquiries myself, and let the Minister know the result <Col N="2094" /> to-morrow, or possibly in the course of this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  On the other point then, the retrospective provision would apply to cases where the Taxing Master has not taxed the costs.  Where he has disallowed on the ground of the Chief State Solicitor not being certified, then we are accepting that decision.  That is only one case. Where the other party has got his decision, we are letting him take the fruits of it.  I do not know whether or not the Deputy is satisfied with that.  We want to cover any other case that may be there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It may happen that some difficulty of transport or one thing or another might arise to prevent the Dáil assembling within seven days.  The Constitution at present provides that the Dáil must be summoned to meet within 30 days after the date of the poll.  The amendment proposed will make the periods coincide; the latest date for summoning the Dáil under this Emergency Bill will be the 30th day after the day of the poll, just <Col N="2095" /> as under the permanent electoral law the latest day is the 30th day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now dealing with the period of emergency, in which we have extended the life of the outgoing Dáil up to the day before the Clerk serves notice on the Taoiseach that the election is taking place.  In a time of emergency, when the desire is speed, it appears inadvisable to allow a period of 14 days to elapse.  I understood that the main purpose of this Bill was that the period between the functioning of the outgoing Dáil and the incoming Dáil be limited to a day, and directly that the incoming Dáil is elected and the Clerk serves notice on the Taoiseach to that effect there devolves upon somebody the responsibility to summon the new body.  If we are concerned with speed, there you have 14 days in which there is no meeting of the Dáil; at least you could go up to the fourteenth day here, and, allowing for the intermediate day, it is a fortnight in all.  I suggest to the Minister that it is inadvisable to split the period just there at that point. As I have said, we are concerned with a crisis, an emergency, in which it is desirable that the moment one institution ceases the other should come into commission.  I cannot see the purpose of extending the period&mdash;the hiatus, as one might almost describe it&mdash;between the expiration of one body and the coming into being of the other.  I think it would be better to leave it at seven days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the purpose of the amendment is not misunderstood. It does not make it mandatory upon the President to delay the summoning of the Dáil until the fourteenth day, but it does give additional time during which the necessary arrangements may be made. Let us assume what would be the most favourable case, the case when the count is completed in every constituency within 48 hours after the day of the poll.  The Taoiseach would receive a certificate from the Clerk of the Dáil to that effect, and within two days after receiving that certificate he would have to advise the President to <Col N="2096" /> dissolve the Dáil.  Now, the question with which the President as well as the Taoiseach is confronted is the date upon which the new Dáil is to be summoned for its first meeting.  As the Bill stands at present, that would have to be within seven days after this advice is given to the President.</P>
      <P>On further consideration, it has been thought that the margin of time within which everybody concerned would have to make those arrangements, which we know to be essential and necessary, is too short.  Even the Deputies themselves might find it difficult to come within the seven days.  The officials of the House might find it difficult to make the necessary arrangements within the seven days; and the Taoiseach, the members of the Government and the leaders of the various Parties who have to make their special arrangements may find it difficult.  The idea here is to make the procedure under this Bill conform as closely as possible to the permanent law of the land.  At the same time, there is a further consideration, to allow a reasonable margin to those who will have to deal with the post election situation to make arrangements for an effective meeting of the Dáil.  If we are moving this amendment, it is not to be apprehended that we do so with the desire to defer the first meeting of the Dáil any longer than may be necessary.  I would suggest that, in the circumstances, the 30 days is not an unreasonable margin to allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in ordinary circumstances, but in a time of crisis I should say that the moment one body goes out of existence the other should come in.  There should be no interregnum. It may be considered possible to adapt our procedure to the practice in another place&mdash;that is, to have a meeting of the Dáil at which there would be no business.  If the Dáil wishes then to adjourn for three or four days, or for a week, it could do so. At any rate, bring the body together without any delay: that is my intention. I understood that the main purpose of this Bill was to bridge over the period from the expiration of the old Dáil to the existence of the new body. I thought the original intention was <Col N="2097" /> that, when one went out the other came in, on a particular day.  Now you have a period in which, although the body is elected, it does not meet.  I suggest that that period should be as short as possible.</P>
      <P>I do not care what business has to be done&mdash;good, bad or indifferent.  The Dáil may adjourn for a fortnight, if desired, but if my judgement were brought to bear upon it, I would say that it should meet on the day following the day of dissolution.  In fact, if it were possible, I would have one go out and the other come in on the same day.  I am not anxious at all about the amount of business to be transacted, but I am anxious that the new body would be sitting&mdash;in other words, that we would have a Dáil.  In regard to this, it is possible that, as the Minister would have up to 14 days, there could be a fortnight in which there would be no Dáil in existence, although one had been elected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that it is quite clear that once the election is completed, the outgoing Dáil would have no moral authority to legislate. The incoming Dáil may be very different to that of the outgoing Dáil, so we can say that, during this interregnum, the outgoing Dáil would have no moral authority to legislate, except in a case of grave national emergency. I would ask Deputy Cosgrave not to press this point.  We do not know what the transport situation may be.  It is difficult enough, particularly in the remote areas, and many Deputies may <Col N="2098" /> live in places remote from railways. To compel us to bring the Dáil together without putting before it the immediate and most important business&mdash;the institution of a new Government&mdash;would be unwise, and would be imposing on Deputies an unnecessary inconvenience.  We wish to obtain the utmost measure of agreement possible on this measure and, therefore, I would not like to press the 14 days, if there is a very strong objection to it.  I do suggest, however, that it is not unreasonable to allow a margin.  Perhaps we could agree on something more than seven days, if the Deputy likes&mdash;say, 10 or 12?</P>

We would be quite prepared to admit the necessity to alter the Rules, Regulations and Standing Orders, but the changing or modification of an Act is a different thing. After all, an Act is something passed by this House and I do not think the Minister is entitled to modify such an Act in any way, without coming to the House.  Does the Minister foresee any difficulty?</P>

      <P>Yes.  I have already explained that we are anxious to have the election completed as quickly as possible.  One of the regulations made under the Act is that the count cannot continue after 7 p.m., except with the consent of all the candidates and their agents.</P>

      <P>It is a rule in the Schedule to the Act and, therefore, it has the force of law.  Another thing is that some individuals act as returning officers for more than one constituency and have been in the habit of conducting the counts in places outside the constituency.  That is, perhaps, their legal right.  I want, in view of the difficulties <Col N="2100" /> which may confront us in regard to transport and other matters of that kind, to have power to compel these counts to be conducted in convenient and easily accessible centres within each constituency and to have the counts conducted simultaneously. I want to have power to compel them to proceed to the conduct of the counts in every constituency not later than 9 a.m. on the morning after the election. Other matters of that kind may arise and it is necessary that somebody should have power to deal with them.</P>

      <P>The case I had in mind yesterday was that in which a candidate dies.  Perhaps I also mentioned the question of delay due to a hold-up of boxes on an island.  The question of voting facilities for islanders is at the moment under consideration. I am not able to say that we have found a solution for it and I may have to come to the House again to ask for powers to enable me to provide special facilities for island voters. There are certain difficulties to be considered. We cannot give people who live on an island exactly the same opportunity as people living on the mainland and there is some objection to granting facilities for postal voting extensively as the Deputy will appreciate. I have not yet determined whether these additional facilities will be by way of extending the right to vote by post to islanders or whether we shall have simply, in the special circumstances, to allow them to take their chance.  No matter what way we approach the question, there will be difficulties.  If we establish a polling station on the island, it must be remembered that it has happened even in summer time that the presiding officer has not been able to get out to open the station. When he is returning, he or his box <Col N="2101" /> may be lost and the election, in consequence, may be held up.</P>

There is not, I think, any doubt in the minds of those concerned with these matters that public opinion has been disturbed at the prospect of a general election while the present European conflict continues and, in fact, the suggestion has been made that the legal life of the present Parliament should be prolonged in order to avoid an election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not expressing any opinion on that matter.  The House has already shown that it appreciates the very weighty, fundamental and, in most cases, insuperable objections there are to a particular Parliament prolonging its own legal existence.  If the period for which the Dáil is elected is to be extended it is very desirable&mdash; it is in fact, I think, essential&mdash;that the legislation by which this is effected should not apply to the Oireachtas which passes it and should only become effective after a general election has been held subsequent to the enactment of the new law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are living in a time when this <Col N="2102" /> question of the duration of the Dáil is of almost capital importance.  We do not know what the future may bring, and most of us, I am sure, will not prognosticate as to how long the present critical conditions will obtain. But I am sure we are all agreed that in the interests of the State, and of the nation, the law should not be such as might compel us to hold another general election while the present emergency continues, or, indeed, during its immediate aftermath.  The purpose of this Bill is to give a wider discretion and a more liberal margin in that regard in the hope that it will enable the Oireachtas and the State to weather the storm without a further general election than that which the general provisions of the electoral law enforce upon us.  Article 16 of the Constitution requires that the same Dáil Eireann shall not continue for a longer period than seven years from the date of its first meeting and permits a shorter period to be fixed by law.  Under the present Electoral Act the period is fixed as five years. This Bill in Section 1 proposes a maximum duration of six years instead.  In accordance with what I have already said, it is not proposed that the provisions of the Bill should be applied to the present Dáil.  Provision is made therefore, in Section 2 that the Bill is to come into operation immediately after the dissolution.</P>
    <P>I have said that we are anxious in present conditions that a general elec should be avoided so long as the law permits us to do so.  Therefore, there is strong justification for this Bill, but I think that our experience of the past four years would indicate that we tied the hands of the Oireachtas too tightly when we fixed the limit of five years, apart altogether from the particular consideration I have mentioned.  I think we can all be trusted to ensure that if the maximum duration is extended to six years, that power of the Oireachtas will not be abused.  We do not exist here merely of our own volition. We exist by the will of the people, and I have no doubt that if a Government were in office which manfestly had not the confidence or support of the people, it could not continue to exist, notwithstanding <Col N="2103" /> the fact that the legal duration of the Dáil were six years and not five years.  The mainstay of the Dáil and the lifeblood of all Governments is that the confidence of the people should manifestly repose in them.  If there were extreme disaffection outside, I have no doubt that it would be reflected in the Party alignments in the House and that these alignments would speedily bring down the Government and, if necessary, force an appeal to the people well within the period.</P>
    <P>The Dáil normally under the electoral law can remain in existence for five years, but the history of this State shows that in fact the average life of the Parliament is very much less than that, and the only point is whether we have allowed ourselves sufficient margin to meet what all the practical vicissitudes which the State has to face.  I think the experience of the past four years, as I have already said, shows that we drew the line too stringently and too tightly, and that it would be advisable, having regard to what the future may bring, to allow a little more margin in that regard.  For that purpose, this Bill is not brought in merely as an emergency measure, though it is true that the need for it has been brought home to us by the emergency; it is brought in as a permanent amendment of the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The case made for this Bill has not convinced me of its advisability.  We are operating here under a Constitution which has been amended within the last few years, and so amended that although we have an Oireachtas, that is, the President and two Houses, in essence, we really might as well have only one House, because the system which has been devised is one which almost copper-fastens the second House as a reflection of the first.  That is a departure from what is called the bicameral system in practically every other country of which we know anything at all.  For the best part of 20 years, if not for even a longer period, the Parliament's life has been limited to five years by legislation, and when we were considering this matter on the amendment of the Constitution to <Col N="2104" /> which I have referred, in 1936 or 1937, that five years period was left in and at that time we were not operating in a crisis.  There was no immediate likelihood of an emergency arising, and during all that period the opinion of the Ministry was that no extension of the period of five years ought to be made in the ordinary law.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that the events of the last few years have upset to some extent the mental balance of the Ministry in this situation.  For the best part of the period, the speeches we listened to from one end of the Ministerial Bench to the other were after the manner and style of the prophet Jeremiah.  We were always approaching some terrible catastrophe and barely escaping it, and that we did escape it was entirely due to the efficiency of the Administration.  They have solved everything except our problems and it appears to me that an extension of the period through which the Dáil can run just now, when nerves on that side appear to have become a little frayed, does not appeal to me.  The period ought not to be spread out from five to six years, unless one were well satisfied that popular opinion&mdash;and I am not interpreting certain editorials in certain newspapers as expressing popular opinion; I am taking the measure of support behind the policy or behind the Government, as the case may be, during the period&mdash;was behind the proposal.  Unless that support were there, it would look as if an effort were being made to snatch something from the public which it was not the intention or the will of the public that the Government should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those cases in which Parliaments have lasted beyond the period allotted, one of two things has usually happened: either there is an extraordinary change in the representation or some one body, political party or otherwise, manages to get an overwhelming majority, representing a mass vote, a mob vote.  I do not think that is wise.  It is not advisable that there should be a remarkable change in a parliament&mdash;I am speaking now of such a change as would affect the personnel to the extent of 50 per cent.  A change of 33 1-3 per cent. is about as <Col N="2105" /> much as is wise, and, looking over the history of parliaments in which the pendulum has swung to the extent of 50 per cent. or more, we find that conditions have been less stable than in those cases in which there was a gradual alteration of representation, that is, less and less rather than more and more, and effecting, perhaps by reason of the fact that it is less and less, much greater reform and much better results than would be the case where you had such a state of affairs as existed in the period just prior to the French Revolution.</P>
    <P>Here in this State, having the history we have during the past 20 years, Parliament as well as the people is on trial.  Parliament is very much on its trial because whatever transpires here and whatever work we do here is judged, partly as a result of the violence of political thought in this country, cynically and with a certain amount of bias.  It is all the more advisable that for that reason there should not be an extension of the life of the Parliament which might give rise to the view outside that you had got a lease of power and proposed to keep it.  That would be inadvisable, and I should much prefer if there were an election, say, every two years and the representation changed to the extent of 20 or 25 per cent., up to 60 per cent., over three such elections.  It would be far better in that form than an immediate change of 50 per cent. in a particular Parliament.  For that reason, I think that until there develops a greater respect for the Parliamentary institutions of the State than exists at present, or than is growing at present, it is highly desirable that Parliament ought to last for no longer a period than five years and perhaps for even a shorter period than five years.  For those reasons I would suggest very strongly to the Minister that the Government ought not to persist in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Cosgrave that there is no real justification for this measure.  I must confess that I was extremely surprised at the reasons advanced by the Minister in support of the measure.  The first indication that was given to the <Col N="2106" /> public or to this House that there was any idea in the minds of the Government to increase the statutory life of Parliament was given, I think, in the speech of the Taoiseach on the motion that there should be no general election during the present emergency.  In the course of his observations in the debate on that motion, from my recollection&mdash;and speaking purely from recollection&mdash;the impression made on me while listening to him was that he stated that he was inclined to think that a period of five years for the life of Parliament was insufficient. According to my recollection, the reason he gave for that was that a period of five years did not give sufficient time to enable Government policy to be adequately tried out. That, certainly, was the impression left on my mind&mdash;that he was speaking of a permanent measure, a measure dealing with the length of a Parliament's life, apart altogether from any question of emergency war conditions.</P>
      <P>My impression was that in his view a period of six years would be better, and that the proposal had nothing whatever to do with emergency or war conditions.  Now, however, we have the Minister coming along and telling us, for reasons that we can guess at and, I think, guess at accurately, that this matter of extending the life of Parliament to six years is bound up with the present emergency.  Now, I hold that it has no relation whatever to it&mdash;at least, I hope not, because I do not think anybody would care to envisage the fact that the present emergency or war will last for the next six years and that, on that account, we must make provision for prolonging the life of Parliament for six years. That is not the reason at all but, of course, as I understand it, that is the reason given by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the shock of a general election to the people.  There is no question of any shock to the people as a result of a general election. They will take it with complete calm. There is no reason why there should not be a general election, and the desire for it was expressed by this House, but whether there is or is not a reason for the holding of a general election, <Col N="2107" /> there is certainly no public demand for or any adequate reason why we should increase the life of Parliament from five to six years.  In that connection, I might point out that the whole tendency of parliamentary institutions in Great Britain, from which we largely derive our own parliamentary institutions, has been to reduce the life of Parliament.  In 1912, in Great Britain, the period of the life of Parliament was reduced from seven years to five years. What is the necessity for a six-year period for our Parliament now?  I am absolutely satisfied that not one single reason given by the Minister for this proposal is the real reason.  I do not know of any justification for it.  There might be something to be said for the Taoiseach's contention that a five-year period did not give a Government sufficient time to have its policy tried out, but, if that is so, this present Government never gave their alleged policy a chance of having it tried out.  They first came into power in 1932, and, inside a year, they had another general election.  There was no talk at that time to the effect that five years was not enough to try out their policy. Twelve months, or even 11 months, was not sufficient for them and, in 1933, they had another general election. Four years after that, in 1937, they had another election, and they were not content with having two general elections in the one year formerly but, inside 12 months after the election in 1937, they had another election, and I think if there had not been a war on we would have had another general election long before this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, I fail to comprehend the reason for this.  It has been the established practice in Great Britain for a long time now to have a five-year period, and that has been shown to be adequate.  It must be remembered that at the end of a period of six years people will be voting who were only 15 years of age at the time Parliament was first elected, and if the Parliament lasts that time, it may be <Col N="2108" /> that it will have lost the confidence of the people, but wants to hang on to power, which is contrary to all democratic principles.  I can see no justification for this, as I have said.  It has no relation to emergency or war conditions. In my opinion, this Bill is being introduced as a permanent measure, irrespective of the emergency, but the Minister now tries to tie it up to conditions which have no existence whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke of there being adequate grounds for this Bill.  Well, I can congratulate him for keeping secrets very well, because he certainly has not given one single ground for the Bill.  In addition to what Deputy Costello said, I should like to point out that, apart from Great Britain, there are and were Parliaments in various countries in the world where an effort is made to secure real, democratic control of Parliament.  I think the Minister will find out that in many of these countries there is a method of partial general election&mdash; sometimes once or twice a year, and sometimes every two years.  For instance, in the United States of America he will find that some of the members of the House of Representatives go out every two years.  I think that that would be more or less in keeping with the point put forward by Deputy Cosgrave: that is that you would have a gradual instead of a quick change.  I think that if the Minister would look at the example of Parliaments in other countries, apart from England, he would find that it is by no means an infrequent practice to have a certain number of members of Parliament retiring each year, so that you would have what one might call a partial election.</P>

The <Col N="2109" /> Taoiseach, in his mathematical way, thought of five or seven years, and now it is a question&mdash;striking the mathematical mean&mdash;of six years.  And, really, that is as good a reason as any that the Minister has brought forward, and it is probably much sounder than any one he has brought forward.</P>

      <P>Before I moved the adjournment of the debate on this motion I was suggesting to the Minister that the present system of centralising his Department in the City of Dublin does not make for efficiency in the distribution of essential supplies. What I suggest, in order to bring this branch of administration into closer contact with the ordinary people in the country, is that every Gárda Síochána <Col N="2110" /> sub-district should be regarded as an administrative area for the Minister's Department.  I suggest, further, that one member of the Gárda in each sub-district should be appointed as a director of supplies and be held entirely responsible for the distribution of essential supplies and the enforcement of the various regulations.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister for Justice, referring to an observation that too much work is being thrown on to the Gárda, said that the tendency to increase the work of the Gárda would be greater, if anything, and that the policy in future would be to off-set it by increasing the number of the Gárda. I think that is sound policy.  I think that members of the Gárda Síochána, being in close contact with the people in each sub-district, would be better qualified to carry out the functions of the Minister's Department than the inspectors who are sent down there from headquarters, men unknown in the district, men who do not know the district and have no personal contact with the people there.  It might be urged that the Gárda Síochána could not afford to lose the services even of one man in each sub-district for this purpose.  Against that it could be suggested that the Gárda could be supplemented by the L.S.F. during the emergency, as this is purely an emergency service.  At any rate, the present system is not working satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Taoiseach referred, in a rather melancholy tone, to the fact that the number of craftsmen in our towns and villages has been steadily declining.  Of course, one of the effects of the regulations issued by the Minister is to wipe out whatever craftsmen we have in our towns and villages. For instance, in villages which are not electrically lighted, tailors and shoemakers have not adequate lighting facilities.  Again, it is now proposed to limit the distribution of piece goods and this will restrict the activities of tailors, dressmakers and others.  There are numbers of people in other trades who are being put out of business. During the past few years blacksmiths have been finding it almost impossible <Col N="2111" /> to carry on their business.  The Minister has indicated that the manufacture of steel and iron is about to be undertaken.  It is to be hoped that these products will be distributed equitably and that the smiths in the small villages will get a reasonable proportion of their requirements, particularly for horse-shoeing purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that this country has to rely entirely upon home produced wool for all its woollen goods. As one of the Minister's functions is to regulate prices, I should like to know how he compares the price which producers of wool have been receiving during the past year with the price woollen merchants are obtaining at the present time from the mills.  I understand wool is being supplied to the mills at over 3/- per lb., although it was purchased from the farmers for less than 1/5.  That seems to be too great a margin of profit for people who have practically nothing to do with the wool, who merely have gathered it from the farmers.  It does not seem justifiable that those people should get a larger amount by way of profit than what is obtained by the producers of the wool.</P>
    <P>The Minister foreshadowed that the price of potatoes would be controlled. I do not know for what purpose this regulation is being made.  I should like to make it clear to the Minister that if potatoes are in short supply, that is due to very abnormal circumstances over which the producers had no control.  In the first place, the crop was unsatisfactory, and in the second place there was a good deal of decay and loss.  I think that if there is any price-fixing, the producers should be assured of a price which will compensate them for the low average yield of last year, and for the losses which they sustained in trying to hold over the crop during the past nine months. It may be that the Minister intends the price fixation to apply only to next season's crop, but, if he is dealing with last season's crop, he should consider that the producers have suffered great loss through a disease in the crop.</P>
    <P>So far as transport is concerned, I <Col N="2112" /> think the whole position has been mishandled.  There should have been a much greater production of gas-producers and the fuel for those producers in the early stages of the emergency and since.  I think the production has not been on such a scale as the circumstances demand.  If it is part of the functions of the Minister for Supplies to deal with the licensing of private lorries, I think he should be very slow to adopt the policy which has been put into operation in Mayo of putting private lorry owners off the road.  In my opinion the private lorry owner can utilise whatever petrol is available to much greater advantage than a public company can.</P>
    <P>I can speak of the experience of a private lorry owner who has been pulled up by the Department of Supplies for conveying goods with his lorry on a return journey.  He was supplying wheat to a mill and on the return journey brought pigs back in the lorry.  For doing so he has been pulled up by the Department.  I think its action is quite unjustifiable.  There is no reason why a lorry should be obliged to travel back idle when it could be employed conveying supplies to a bacon factory.  To compel it to return idle does not seem to be a good way of economising fuel.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think the Minister has failed badly.  In the first place, he failed in the early stages of the emergency to procure essential requirements which could then be imported. He failed to procure shipping which could have been got in the early stages of the emergency.  He has failed to insist on the production of sufficient food within the country, and on the provision of adequate capital for the expansion of tillage and of food production.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon, in the course of his speech paid a tribute to the officials of the Department. I have had a fair amount to do with the officials of the Department. I have spoken to a number of Deputies of all Parties, and I can say this: that there is nothing but a full recognition on all their parts of the courtesy and helpfulness of the different <Col N="2113" /> members of the Department. Certainly, that holds true of any one of them with whom I have come into contact.  They are perfectly loyal to the policy of the Government, perfectly loyal to the Government, but, within the limitations that have been imposed upon them from the top, they are anxious, as far as I can see from a fairly extensive experience, to be helpful to the consumer and helpful to those who bring cases before them. Any criticisms, therefore, that I have to make fall completely and solely on the Minister.  The Deputy who has just spoken referred to his failure.  His failure in many respects is spectacular. Unfortunately also for the country it is catastrophic.  But it is more than failure.  From anything that I have heard from various merchants all over the country who have been accustomed to import various supplies, he has not only failed to be helpful: he has been decidedly obstructive over the years of the crisis.</P>
      <P>The problem of supplies presents two aspects: the lack of useful, and even essential commodities in the country, and the distribution of whatever supplies there are.  So far as providing the country with a sufficiency of supplies goes, the Minister has completely and wholly broken down.  He has, from the various things that I have heard, even prevented by his regulations and otherwise those who, through private enterprise, might have introduced a sufficiency of supplies to the country, from doing so.  I do not think there was anything more cynical on the part of the head of the Government than to re-appoint a Minister with such a record of failure in the Department of Supplies to another important Ministry, namely, the Department of Industry and Commerce, while allowing him to keep in control of the Department of Supplies.  With such a record, the only justification that I can see on the part of the Taoiseach for doing that was that he hoped that whatever the Minister's activities would be in the Department of Industry and Commerce they might keep him away for some time from the Department of Supplies, and then it might get on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2114" /> Whatever the general opinion of the country may be as to the politics and the policy of the different Parties, every Deputy must be aware of the opinion&mdash;it is not by any means confined to one Party&mdash;that prevails in the country as to the way in which the Minister has carried on and has performed his duties as Minister for Supplies.  We are often, of course, met with this particular argument: &ldquo;What can he do?  He has only a certain amount of commodities at his disposal and he has to do the best he can with these.&rdquo;  What we complain of is that it is largely, I do not say wholly, his own fault that he is presented with that unfortunate situation, namely, that supplies are so limited. The only foresight that I have seen recently on the part of any member of the Government was displayed in the last half-hour by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, when he introduced a Bill to provide what might happen in six years' time, namely, a Bill to extend the life of the next Parliament from five to six years. That is the only kind of foresight that I have seen displayed on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>Year after year in discussing this Estimate since the crisis arose one thing has had to be pointed out and that is lack of foresight.  I admit that on each occasion one was faced with the problem: &ldquo;Well, what do you propose to do now?&rdquo;  The obvious thing was that the man who was lacking in foresight in the first year of the crisis could not be trusted not to be lacking in foresight in the second, the third or fourth year of the crisis.  It makes me shiver when I hear that particular Minister say that he has plans for the future.  God help the country if he has.  He has failed to solve, or even to attack, the major portion of its problem.</P>
    <P>When we come to the other side of the question&mdash;distribution&mdash;I think it will be generally acknowledged that it is not an easy task.  I fully admit the difficulties and the intricacies of the problems that were bound to face any Department in a time like this.  With the plethora of Orders which it has <Col N="2115" /> been considered necessary to issue, I often wonder whether it is possible for people carrying on business here not to be driven out of their minds by these particular Orders.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy is aware that hardly a day passes on which we are not presented with what is practically a new Act of Parliament, because that is what these Orders amount to.  Now, many of these are due to lack of foresight. The Minister hastily adopts a certain measure.  I do not know whether at any period, even in his more vigorous days when the Government first came into power some ten years ago, he ever did examine in any detail the implications of his policy or certain lines of his policy.  He certainly does not do it now.  Both Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dillon have stressed the undesirable, shall I say, social effects that are bound to follow from some of the measures which the Minister proposes; that is in connection with the ordinary making of clothes by those in the country who have to live in that particular manner.  It may not be the most economic way, it may not even satisfy the Minister's aethetic taste as regards clothes, but socially&mdash; and remember the social aspect is very important&mdash;it is probably much more desirable to have a number of independent craftsmen of that kind than to have those rich, big manufactories.  I am not saying that it is the most economic way, but undoubtedly it is a thing the destruction of which should be regretted from the social point of view.  I doubt whether the Minister even considered that particular aspect of the case&mdash;the distress that he would cause in the country.</P>
    <P>Again and again various things have been put up to the Minister.  There are two members of that Front Bench who pay not the slightest attention to any argument put up in this House, no matter from what side of the House. One is the Taoiseach.  The more you argue with him, though he might agree with you in the beginning, the more you find that he is dead against you. That is his particular method of reaction. The Minister, with whom we <Col N="2116" /> are dealing now, shuts his mind to any suggestion.  He will listen to nothing, he will learn neither from what people say nor from the experience of the people of the country.</P>
    <P>To a large extent, therefore, in dealing with either of these Ministers&mdash;the Taoiseach himself or the Minister for Supplies&mdash;it is largely a waste of breath.  Now and then the Minister comes into the public Press and makes public pronouncements.  One of the Deputies to-day was rather shocked at the contradictions that appeared between the different statements of the Minister.  I doubt if there is anybody in the country at present who really expects a statement of the Minister to have any foundation in fact, whether his statement is pessimistic or optimistic. I think he is quite incapable of presenting facts as they are.  I do not say by any means that he is deliberately misleading the people.  But certainly nobody in the country could take his statement on Government policy, on the position of supplies, on the position of any particular commodity, as something on which that person could build his conduct for one month ahead. There is really no relation between the Minister's statements and facts. When it came to supplies, the main duty of the Minister during those years was to have got in an adequate supply when it was still possible to do so, or to see that an adequate supply was got in.  Leaving that on one side, when you come to the actual distribution and to the various Orders with which he has felt it necessary to flood the country, there were two ways in which he might have acted.  I remember a time when, dealing with tariffs and other things, if you suggested to the Minister that a certain amount of supervision was necessary to see that manufacturers who got all the benefit of tariffs did not profiteer at the expense of the country, the Minister got most indignant.  The suggestion that there was any necessity for watching over these people was a slur on the good Irish character of these manufacturers. But, if you are to take the line adopted by the Minister at present, it is the assumption that every shopkeeper, unless he is rigidly <Col N="2117" /> watched, is trying to profiteer, to deal in the black market, or, in one or another way, to cheat.  As I said, there were two methods of approaching the very difficult problem&mdash;I admit it is a very difficult problem&mdash;of the proper distribution of supplies in this country. He could have got into friendly relations with people&mdash;it would be a troublesome way, I admit; it would require thinking the matter out&mdash;he could have consulted people, even listened to them&mdash;which, apparently, is the thing he finds most difficult&mdash;and got their good will.  But I think it is apparent, not merely from what he says, but from what is being done, that he was convinced that the most effective way to deal with this situation was the big stick; to get as much repressive legislation as possible.</P>
    <P>I remember&mdash;I do not think my memory is playing me false&mdash;when we were discussing this or allied problems before, the Minister took up this particular line so far as defaulting distributors were concerned: It might seem an absurd thing, or it might seem unjust, or it might seem unwise, because a person was found to have charged a halfpenny more than the scheduled price for matches, or butter or anything else, that he should have a heavy fine imposed upon him.  But his argument was this: &ldquo;We must assume that only one in every 100, possibly one in every 1,000, cases of overcharging comes to the notice of the Minister and, therefore, it is necessary to come down extremely harshly or very ruthlessly on those particular cases that we can prove.&rdquo;  I think that was the policy of the Minister, and I think the Taoiseach gave his cachet to that particular policy on that occasion and used a similar argument.  Now that has to be looked at from two points of view.  I grasp the argument of the Minister, but I put it to him, and I put it to the Dáil, that it might involve a violation of justice.  There have been cases in which officials in the discharge of their duty have gone into shops, looked through the books of the shopkeepers, and found out a few cases of slight over-charges.  I do not say that all over-charges were slight.  It is the <Col N="2118" /> policy of the Minister, as I understood him to say previously in this House, that these people must be prosecuted and fined heavily.  I am not quite clear why that should be.  Is it the assumption that these people have been guilty on many other occasions, but that they were not caught?  There is no evidence of that.  We probably all know of people who have been caught in one or two cases of overcharging where there was no suspicion or no evidence that they were continually or frequently guilty of any such overcharges, even small overcharges. I put it that merely to teach a lesson to others&mdash;because that can be the only justification for it&mdash;it is unjust to punish people beyond what is fair for their offence.  It has been pointed out &mdash;and again, in this instance, we have a further violation of justice&mdash;that such a case is dealt with by the court and the court has the evidence before it. It may be said that the court only considers the two small offences but I must say, judging by the fines imposed &mdash;I do not want to exaggerate in the slightest&mdash;these particular fines certainly are not justified by the two small offences that may come before the court.  They are substantial fines. In other words, as far as I can see, the courts do take into account the existence of these malpractices and the justices inflict a fine that they think is adequate to meet not merely the two small violations of the law, but the general malpractice.  Is it fair, in that particular case, that the Minister should do what amounts to inflicting another penalty, a much more severe penalty, namely, withdrawal of a permit?</P>
    <P>The Minister, on a rather celebrated occasion, speaking in this House, took up the line that the giving of certain permits is a matter of discretion for the Minister.  He was dealing with a particular matter, but, apparently, we must assume by his conduct that what held in that particular case of a petrol permit should be applied all round, that is, that it is a matter of discretion for the Minister to give or to withdraw permits&mdash;a privilege to the trader.  I do not think that ought to be the case <Col N="2119" />&mdash;it is quite wrong.  I think it ought not to be a matter of discretion for the Minister that, because he thinks a certain person is not a desirable trader, he can withdraw the permit from him. The court has already dealt with that man.  What the Minister is doing is, using the verdict of the court as a proof that the bad character&mdash;in the commercial sense&mdash;of that man has been established.  I suggest that that is not just.  Let the fines be sufficient.</P>
    <P>There are cases against over 1,000 people outstanding at the present moment, I think.  That does not suggest that there is any laxity on the part of the officials of the Department of Supplies in finding out these offences.  There is another thing that has been stressed.  I think it is inevitable&mdash;and the Minister ought, therefore, guard against it, because the tendency of any Department, no matter how excellent, would be in that direction&mdash;that a civil servant is inclined to assume&mdash;and very often the better civil servant he is the more he is inclined to assume it&mdash;that an ordinary business man in the country must run his business like the Civil Service.  The Revenue Commissioners do the same.  I used to be amazed&mdash; and my amazement, I may say, goes back 20 years; I am not saying it is all confined to the period of office of the present Government&mdash;at the naiveté of the Revenue authorities in assuming that ordinary business men in the country had an accurate knowledge of how much they were making, and how much they were losing per year.  I know something about business men in the country, and the last thing I would credit them with is a knowledge of that kind.  It is no slur on the Civil Service; it is inherent in the very character, so to speak, of that body, but you must guard against it. That is all I say.</P>
    <P>I think there is here also too great rigidity.  Owing to the desire of the Minister to put down black marketing, there is too great a tendency to be too rigid in the application or in the working out of these particular rules.  No allowance is made for the ordinary business failures&mdash;or whatever you like <Col N="2120" /> to call them&mdash;of the ordinary people in the country.  It is a serious matter. There are Deputies in the House who know business people in every town and village in this country, and they must know perfectly well the extent to which a large number of these business men and women are practically driven off their head by orders, super orders, counter orders and amendments of orders.  You cannot get from the people in the country that apple pie system that you would expect from a Civil Service Department.  If you got it, probably the business in which it was attempted to be tried out would be bankrupt in a couple of years. That, again, is no slur on the Civil Service.  They are two different kinds of activity, but I suggest it is the business of the Minister&mdash;it is why Ministers are there as distinct from heads of Departments&mdash;to control that, to see that it does not work unjustly and to see that it does not work detrimentally to the general interests of the community.  I do not think he has done that.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made&mdash;I think by the last speaker&mdash;to the difficulty there is in getting certain things.  I was speaking a few weeks ago to a village carpenter.  I asked him &ldquo;What is the price of bands for cart wheels at the present time?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;First of all, you cannot get them at all.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;when you can get them?&rdquo;  I have heard different prices mentioned by different people.  His price was £12 a pair.  I asked him, &ldquo;What is the price of the ordinary cart, complete with bands and everything else?&rdquo;  He said, £30.</P>
    <P>Was it necessary that there should be a scarcity of these things?  We all remember&mdash;I think I referred to it before&mdash;the great campaign there was for the saving of paper.  I never saw any such effort to collect scrap-iron.  I do not know whether it was even considered or not.  It may be said that it would be too costly to collect, but there was a time&mdash;at least so I was assured&mdash; when there was a scarcity of iron for ordinary purposes such as horseshoes and bands for carts.</P>
    <P>Surely, an effort might have been <Col N="2121" /> made to collect all that scrap iron. There is hardly a house I know where the people would not be glad if somebody would call and take away the scrap iron.  The amount of scrap in any house might not be very great but the amount in a street might be considerable. I was told by a smith that he could only shoe horses if those who brought them to him brought iron with them.  That shortage obtains practically everywhere.  While that shortage exists and while carts are the price I was told they were, farmers are asked to put their last ounce of energy into production. As was frequently pointed out, there must be a measure of co-operation on both sides.  The Minister demands from shopkeepers, farmers and others full co-operation.  I suggest that many of the measures for which he is responsible and the way he has insisted upon these measures being carried out has made co-operation impossible and has made&mdash;I am sorry to say it&mdash;goodwill difficult.  That was one of the great failures of the Minister.</P>
    <P>One never knows where he is with any statement by the Minister.  At one period, there was a shortage of flour in the Dingle Peninsula.  I approached the Department, was met with the customary politeness there and everything that was possible was done.  A short time after that, there seemed to be an over-supply of flour.  I never heard what the explanation of that was.  I remember having to take up with the Department the supply of kerosene in the same Peninsula.  I have nothing but praise for the politeness with which I was met in the Department.  I am not referring to the recent shortage in respect of which an explanation was given to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney by the Minister.  I am referring to the winter months of 1941, when the people were left in darkness. When the attention of the Department was drawn to the matter, they did what they could.  I ask the Minister to consider specially the cases of very poor districts.  I am speaking for a district that has never voted very strongly for me.  Deputy Kissane will bear that out.  The people there are very poor and lead a hard life.  The fishermen, particularly, deserve special attention as regards a supply of <Col N="2122" /> kerosene for their boats.  I am not finding fault with the sub-department that deals with that.  They have to make the best of what they have got. I am only pleading for a little more generosity in what they do get from the general supply.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the lack of artificial manures.  Some reference was also made to the small quantity which had recently been introduced here from the United States.  It may be that our shipping space for bringing things into the country is limited but have we utilised that shipping to the best advantage?  Why is it that, at a time when there was so strong a drive for increased agricultural production, we got in no artificial manures?  Do not tell me that they were not there.  Twelve months ago or more, I heard the Minister for Agriculture in England speaking over the radio and thanking the American Government for the considerable help they had given to his particular industry&mdash;agriculture&mdash;by the amount of artificial manures they had sent into the country.  What effort was made, and with what success, by our Government to get a share of these artificial manures&mdash;absolutely essential,. as everybody knows, if the drive for increased production is to be successful? I cannot find that the Ministry made the efforts it should have made in the matter.  I am not dealing now with the members of the Department.  I think that they did their best in a very difficult situation.  I am dealing merely with the failure of the Minister and I am anxious to identify the policy of the Minister, as it has appeared in the past four years, with the policy of the Government.  Cynical Deputies, if there are any in the House, may suggest that I want to damage the Taoiseach.  Leave that reason aside.  He is responsible and the Government is responsible for the failure of this Department.  This Department and the Department of Agriculture are our two most important Departments and I doubt if, in any other instance, the Ministers have so completely fallen down on their jobs as these two Ministers.  Nobody in the Government can escape responsibility for that.  It is the responsibility not <Col N="2123" /> merely of these two Ministers but of the Government as a whole.  Whether one has regard to the Minister's failure to secure an adequate supply of essential commodities or the way in which he has harried and persecuted a large portion of the population, I say that the Minister responsible for this Vote has failed, and lamentably failed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that the Department of Supplies is costing the State a very large sum annually, including £126,000 for salaries, £17,000 for ration books, and £14,000 for travelling expenses.  I am able to state that the staff is a very efficient one, but with such a highly-paid and efficient staff there ought to be better results. I consider that the Department is working against the stream, and is trying to bring about order out of chaotic conditions.  The chaotic conditions that I find existing there are, in my opinion, due to a lack of system for which the Minister must be held responsible. It is a terrible state of affairs to have a staff dealing with complaints that should never have arisen if there had been system at the starting of the Department.  I have no idea, and I do not know if the Minister has any idea, of the number of complaints that reach the Department daily.  There is hardly one person that I know in West Cavan who is not writing once a week to the Department. If the staff were ten times as large as it is, how could it be expected to deal with such correspondence?  It would be out of the question.  The Department can never make headway until there is some sort of system there. <Col N="2125" /> It started by dealing with the flour question.  I know parts of Cavan where whole districts could not get a grain of flour.  It was supposed to be rationed at the time, yet there appeared to be no regulation of supplies. There is plenty of flour to be had now, thank goodness.  After flour, the Department went on to deal with tea and paraffin oil.  During the darkest months of the winter there was not a drop of oil to be got by half the population in Cavan.  Not a drop of oil was to be had during the month of December.  Why was not an arrangement made by which a gallon of oil would be available during the month of December, and another gallon or less in January?  If oil was rationed, why was it not possible for those controlling supplies to see that it was distributed? What is the use of issuing licences to retailers and wholesalers, and registering customers, if the Department is not able to see to it that supplies are distributed amongst those for whom they are intended?  There should be very little difficulty in doing that in a country like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was talking to a man from another part of Ireland, and when I asked him how they managed to ration so many articles amongst the people, he explained that there was no trouble about doing so, as there was an official in each area who took control over that area, and dealt with any question that arose.  If anything went wrong, he was on the spot, and was able to put it right.  Here a great deal of correspondence is involved from day to day, and from one section of the Department to another.  It seems as if it were impossible to have order, simply because a start was not made in a systematic way.  Not having started in the right way I think the Department cannot make any headway. For instance, at the time that the tea shortage arose, Deputies on these and on other benches asked that rationing should be introduced.  The Minister did not introduce rationing, but stated that tea was going to be scarce, and advised everybody who could do so to get in supplies.  Unfortunately too many people took him at his word.  They took advantage of the <Col N="2126" /> information and laid in stores of tea, and, as a result, we have the black market.  There is plenty of tea to be had at 20/- or 25/- a lb.  That is due to the hint that the Minister gave. The black market people are only carrying out his instructions, and he cannot say a word to them.  They are not to blame so much as the Minister.</P>
    <P>At the present time, while there is a shortage of sugar here, tons of sugar are going across into Northern Ireland. I know three restaurants in the town of Ballyconnell, and in the allocation of sugar to those restaurants no allowance is made for the people who come in there for refreshments on fair days, market days, and so on, although those houses have been in the habit of supplying refreshments to such people for the past 20 years.  I have been writing and they have been writing to the Department in regard to it, forms have been filled up and returned, but still nothing is done.  But the sugar is going across the Border.  How is it that the Department are not able to control that sugar?  They have control of it at the source.  Everybody is registered, the manufacturers, the wholesalers, the retailers and the consumers. How is it that they cannot control it?  Is it not obvious that there is some lack of system there?  It is for the Minister to look into the matter and put it right; he is the head of the Department, and he has a very efficient staff.</P>
    <P>I know the serious difficulties there are in regard to supplies of petrol, but, notwithstanding those difficulties, I have in mind the case of a man who, in my opinion, has been very harshly treated.  At the present time he is looking for petrol for a lorry with which to carry on his usual trade of dealing in bonhams.  County Cavan is noted for the rearing of more bonhams than they require for their own use. Districts in North Leitrim and other counties are in the habit of getting their supplies from West Cavan.  If this man is not supplied with petrol for his lorry he cannot carry on his trade at all, because it would not be practicable for him to hire lorries and keep them waiting for an indefinite period while he made his sales.  If the Minister <Col N="2127" /> does not wish to see that trade in bonhams completely disorganised, he should make an allocation of petrol to this man.  That facility has already been given to another man in East Cavan who is carrying on the same trade.</P>
    <P>With regard to oats and wheat, the fixing of prices for those commodities has been completely disregarded by the people, because the prices fixed were not sufficient.  If the people had to abide by the Minister's fixed prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get away from it then.  I suppose the Minister for Agriculture controls the price of oats.  I am not sure which of the Ministers is supposed to control the price of potatoes, but I think it is the Minister for Supplies.  If the Minister is going to control the price of potatoes I would warn him to be careful, because if he wants to have cheap potatoes the best thing to do is to guarantee a minimum price to the producer, and so ensure that plenty of potatoes will be grown.  I remember warning the Minister for Agriculture more than a year ago that if he did not encourage the growing of potatoes there would be a shortage not only of potatoes but of pigs.</P>

    <P>Unfortunately, that shortage has since become apparent.  The experience that the Minister for Agriculture had with regard to the production of wheat should be a lesson both to him and to the Minister for Supplies. We all remember the shortage of wheat and the shortage of flour which occurred last year.  What was the cause of that?  It was because the Minister haggled over a few shillings in the price of wheat, and did not give enough for growing it.  He increased the price when it was too late to sow the wheat, and consequently there was a shortage that year.  The same thing can happen with regard to potatoes if <Col N="2128" /> the Minister controls the price.  If he wants to put on a maximum price, say, in the City of Dublin, that is all right, but it would be advisable to guarantee a minimum price to the growers.  If plenty of potatoes are grown there will be plenty of them sold at a reasonable price.  Competition will regulate the price if the supply is good, but the Minister ought to know better than anybody else that he cannot control the price if the supply is short.  I hope that before he takes such a step he will consider what the consequences of it would be.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have referred to the strong action which the Minister has taken against individuals who happen to have committed some slight offence.  I do not believe there is a citizen in this State who is not inadvertently breaking some law.  A lawyer admitted to me that he does not know half the law.  Surely then, no ordinary citizen can be expected to know it.  Surely, no ordinary citizen knows the law, and yet people are deprived of their living if they commit an offence which they hardly thought was an offence at the time.</P>
    <P>I have one particular case in mind, of a man who was brought to court in connection with the sale of sugar.  He had been in the business of selling sugar.  He lives on the Border and had been selling to some people on both sides up to 1939, or whatever was the standard year.  Because of that, he got a larger quota than, perhaps, he was entitled to and, of course, he sold it, but he was taken into court.  The court, having regard to all the circumstances, and having considered all the evidence, decided that it was a very slight offence and imposed a nominal fine.  Yet the Minister threatened to take away his licence, not only for the commodity in connection with which he was penalised by the court&mdash;the sugar&mdash;but also for tea.  All this was because he sold a few pounds or a few stones of sugar, which he got and was not entitled to get.  It was not his fault: perhaps it was through some slackness of the Minister's Department that he got so much&mdash;I do not pretend to know.  In any case, if the court thought it was a matter worthy of a fine of 10/-, it cannot have been serious <Col N="2129" /> enough to deprive a man of his means of living&mdash;a man who had been in that trade all his life and who had a certain number of customers.  This matter has been dealt with by many other Deputies and I do not want to press it, but I think the Minister should try to put his own house in order and not take such extreme measures with others who, at least, have as well ordered a house.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could establish some sort of systematic order in his own Department, the staff he has there would be able to conduct it and carry out his directions.  I think the Minister makes too many Orders, that he takes on too much work and does not see it through.  It was pointed out here to-day that, if the Minister would deal with fewer commodities and deal with them more effectively, taking more time to examine them and consider how he would make a success of them, there would be very little difficulty about making a success of the whole problem.  They have all the information at the headquarters in Ballsbridge; they have everybody's name registered; they know the number of people who are getting tea and sugar and lamp oil from every registered distributor of these commodities. What difficulty should they have in seeing that each retailer has customers enough for the supplies he is getting, or in seeing that those who have more customers than supplies get extra by way of transfer from one to another? It is only a matter of a little bit of book-keeping, and the staff is large enough to deal with it.  If an inspector with proper authority were located in each county, he could deal with the cases on the spot, and half the staff working at Ballsbridge to deal with complaints would not be necessary.  A few men in a central position could get in touch on the spot and deal with complaints, and then there would be very few complaints.  I hope the Minister will introduce some kind of order in the Department and that things will go better in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies who have spoken in this debate seem to be satisfied that the civil servants were very agreeable and gave every assistance <Col N="2130" /> to any Deputy who had occasion to go to the Department of Supplies.  I certainly say the same myself.  Every morning I receive numerous complaints from people in my constituency regarding the Department of Supplies.  They are made more or less on the basis that the people do not understand the regulations which come into operation from day to day.  Each time I went to the Department to investigate a case, the officials were most agreeable and gave every possible assistance in dealing with the complaint.  However, every Deputy who has spoken seemed to feel that the complaints in general were to be attributed more or less to the head, so far as the Department is concerned.</P>
      <P>I wonder if I am correct in saying that, in introducing the Estimate yesterday, the Minister said that our normal supply of sulphate of copper was 3,200 tons and that the available supply this year will be 800 tons.  If that is correct, it represents a very serious position.  Every Deputy coming from the rural areas knows the necessity for good potato and wheat crops. If they failed, there would be nearly a famine.  Seeing that the available supply of sulphate of copper is only 800 tons, as against 3,200 tons&mdash;roughly a fourth&mdash;and seeing that there is increased production of potatoes&mdash;it means that there is only sufficient to spread over one acre out of every four and a half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very serious situation.  It is also serious, from the point of view of the shortage of manures, in connection with the fertility of the land&mdash; especially the poorer land in the poorer counties.  That land seems to be decaying a lot in the last two or three years and as a result the crops are not as early, so sulphate of copper is more necessary than ever.  There is a custom of spraying twice, and people are now getting the habit of spraying three times, which makes the shortage of sulphate of copper more serious.  I am sure the Minister did his best as regards the quantity available, but I would impress on him the necessity to make every possible effort to obtain more supplies.  If sulphate of copper is not made available and the potato crop fails, the situation in the <Col N="2131" /> rural areas will be very serious, as the potato there is on a level with wheat as a food.</P>
    <P>To consider another aspect of the matter, the more potatoes you grow, the more bacon, eggs and wheat you will produce.  If the acreage under potatoes is reduced, because of the difficulty of obtaining sulphate of copper for spraying, you will be afterwards confronted with a shortage of bacon, eggs and wheat.  That is a very serious situation to contemplate, and one that calls for immediate attention.  I would also suggest to the Minister that if there are only 800 tons available, he should have the price of sulphate of copper immediately fixed so as to prevent the creation of a black market in this commodity.  In my opinion it is necessary to fix a price for sulphate of copper immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced that the tea ration will be reduced to three-quarters of an ounce per head for the summer period, with the intention of restoring the ration to an ounce per head during the winter.  In that connection the Minister should bear in mind that in rural areas tea is a very essential article of diet during the summer.  It forms, in fact, the dinner ration.  People in rural areas have sometimes to travel three, four or five miles to carry on tillage operations, and the only food they can take with them is bread and tea.  It may suit certain urban areas to have a larger ration of tea in winter than in summer, but you are depriving agricultural areas of the larger ration at a time when it is most urgently needed.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the hardship endured by people in rural areas owing to the impossibility of getting an adequate ration of paraffin. They have to attend to pigs and cattle during the long winter evenings and that work usually does not start before 5 p.m., and continues up to about 10 p.m.  Then if there happens to be illness in a country house it is a great hardship not to have a sufficient supply of paraffin.  In the area which I represent <Col N="2132" /> a large number of people got practically no paraffin oil for the greater part of January and very little for either February or March.  I consider it a very serious state of affairs that some provision should not be made to ensure that at least portion of the quantity available for distribution would be allocated to each consumer in rural areas.</P>
    <P>In the broadcast announcements, the people were informed that the paraffin ration for November was to be half a gallon and a gallon for December. Portion of that December paraffin was not delivered until the middle of the month.  Some people succeeded in getting their ration in December, but many more could not get their December ration until January.  Practically half of the consumers did not receive the December ration until January.  In January consumers expected that they would get another gallon in respect of that month, but when half of that ration was delivered, the other half was cancelled.  In February there was a broadcast announcement to the effect that the ration would be half a gallon for that month, but I know many people who got no paraffin at all in respect of that month.  Taking the whole period of December, January and February the people on an average received only one and a half gallons per head&mdash;a very poor ration for an agricultural area.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear the Minister's statement in regard to the price of turf.  It is astonishing to hear that allowing for depreciation, freight and all expenses, turf in Dublin costs as much as 87/6 per ton.  I would point out to the House that when the price of turf was first fixed for Dublin, the figure was only 50/- per ton.  Then it advanced to 64/- and now we are told that it costs 87/6.  It seems to me extraordinary that turf which is produced at a comparatively low figure in the country should cost so much here in Dublin.  In Mayo, you have one of the finest turf areas in any part of the country, but the Department last year took turf only from some of these areas.  They did not go into the backward areas such as Erris, or Achill.  I think that when they <Col N="2133" /> require good quality turf they should give preference to areas where that turf is to be found in abundance, areas in which people live on the bogs and know how to produce turf properly.  If preference were given to those areas, I believe that turf would be produced at a much cheaper rate than that at which it is being produced in Kildare. I admit that the difficulty of transport is a big factor, but there are plenty of lorries in the country and there seems to be a reasonable amount of petrol available for distribution.  The turf in those areas is produced at a very reasonable price.  I believe that in the greater part of Mayo turf is being produced at 15/- per ton delivered at the side of the bog.  That at any rate is all the producer is getting.  I know that some turf was produced and put on rail at Ballina by private lorry owners at 25/- per ton.  When one considers the big difference between 25/- and 87/6, one can only come to the conclusion that the producers in the turf areas are not getting a fair share of the 87/6.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the question of tea and sugar licences. The Minister has stated that there are 1,114 prosecutions pending and that the licences of 32 traders have already been withdrawn.  I think that it is a very drastic step to withdraw a trader's licence.  As far as I am concerned, I oppose very strongly any dealing in the black market and I am prepared to give any assistance in stamping out illegal trading of that description, but I still consider that that can be done without inflicting this drastic punishment on traders for what in many cases are trivial offences.  I am informed that four traders in my area have lost their licences.  The offences were committed so far back as January, 1942.  The cases were not tried until September, 1942, and the licences were withdrawn in February.  In none of these cases was the offence serious but each of the offenders was fined fairly heavily in court.  I feel that the fine in court should have been sufficient to purge the offence without resorting to the extreme penalty of withdrawing the licence.  I think that penalty is altogether too extreme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2134" /> Two of these traders who got notices asked me to make representations to the Department on their behalf.  I made inquiries at the Department and was told exactly how matters stood.  I went back to the traders and said to them: &ldquo;It is a very serious offence and I am afraid that, unless something is done, there is a danger of your losing your licences.&rdquo; I then said to them: &ldquo;Make out a written statement of how it happened, giving the history from beginning to end, and give a guarantee that no such thing will occur again.&rdquo; They did so and I posted the two letters to the Department.  I never received any reply, and I was then informed that the inspectors were in Ballina taking the licences from these people.  The licences were taken up, and, although I got in touch with the Department the following week, I was told that nothing could be done as the decision had been come to.  I think that was very extreme action.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the offences took place at a period when a large number of traders in my area had not sufficient tea to meet their customers' cards.  I received numerous letters from people saying that they wanted 15 lbs., 30 lbs., 70 lbs. and 100 lbs. of tea in the month for their customers and a big number of them were in the position that they had 25 per cent. less tea than they required for their registered customers.  In January, 1942, when the offences took place, things were not so tightened up and were not looked on with the same seriousness as was the case a year later.  I feel that if the Minister would depend more on the business people and on the co-operation of the public in general, both parties would be very helpful to him.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, customers who have their tea cards with particular traders&mdash;and business people and traders are very helpful to the public from the point of view of giving credit and so on&mdash;are very annoyed by the taking away of their tea cards from these cases was the offence serious but other traders.  I feel that the Minister and civil servants do not really understand <Col N="2135" /> how business is done in the small towns and in the rural areas. People are customers of particular houses for years and years, and, if the records were traced back, it would be found that some customers are dealing with particular shops for upwards of 50 years.  They naturally do not want to leave these places, and I feel that it is very extreme to revoke licences for very trivial offences, committed at a time when matters were not regarded as being as serious as they are now.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reconsider the whole business and should fix a particular date from which the price of particular articles will be fixed&mdash;let it be 1st of January, 1st of December or 1st of November&mdash;and let the public be informed that if there is any violation of the law, licences will be automatically revoked.  Nobody will have any sympathy with, or make any representations on behalf of, any people who do not comply with the regulations. I suggest that the Minister might consider some kind of advisory committee consisting of three members of the trade, three consumers, three members of the House and three civil servants. I believe that at a round table conference the different views would be very helpful to the Minister and would have the effect of removing all these complaints.</P>
    <P>With regard to the importation of 5,000 tons of oats in January last, I have to complain that we in County Mayo did not get any of that oats. Mayo was always an oats-buying county and there was always a certain shortage of oats in that county, which is a very big bacon and eggs producing district.  None of that oats came into Mayo, and, as a matter of fact, practically none of it came into Connaught.  I believe a small proportion came into Ballinasloe and a big proportion went to Donegal, which is an oats-growing district.  I think the Minister treated Co. Mayo very badly in not giving the county an allocation. This oats was subsidised oats, and, being subsidised by the general taxpayer, each county should have got a fair proportion.</P>
    <P>Finally, I urge the Minister to forget <Col N="2136" /> about some of the things which have happened, leading to the prosecutions which are now pending and to the withdrawal of a number of licences, and to set a certain date from which fixed prices will operate.  Let him then caution the public with regard to them, and he will find that these complaints will not arise and that everything will be plain sailing, to the benefit and advantage both of the Department and the people generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only natural that, when the demand is greater than the supply, the Minister for Supplies should come in for much criticism and should be asked to explain why the public are not in a position to get what they want.  One or two factors are responsible for much of the criticism which has been levelled against the Department.  One is the fact that, by our tradition and our history, we have been trained to do everything more or less contrary to the Government's ideas.  That has been the tradition of the Irish people.  We have not been trained and disciplined into obeying the law.  Another factor is that the people have become somewhat disillusioned as to the exact position in which they find themselves.  Some years ago, members of the Fianna Fáil Party, with heads erect, said that this country could carry on serenely oblivious of what happened outside. We have got a rude awakening during the last year or two and possibly that awakening will be very good for us from the point of view not only of the present but of the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to a point, I sympathise very much with the Minister, and, being one who would naturally like to help him in his difficulties and one who has not got an eye on what will happen at the general election, I should like to make a few suggestions to him which may possibly make his work and the work of his officials somewhat lighter. If he would take his courage in his hands and remove many of the irritating tariffs or duties that are imposed at the moment on articles that are not, never were, and never will be produced in this country, it would be a very good thing.  Only last week I had occasion to call the Department <Col N="2137" /> in regard to the release of what is known as twine for the making of salmon nets.  A fisherman in Blackrock, County Louth, was enterprising enough to import that particular twine into this country on his own initiative, and I think that that bears out the statements that have been made here for the last four or five years to the effect that if the businessmen had been given the opportunity they could have imported much larger supplies than has been possible under the Department.  At any rate, this man got the twine imported, and he was in a hurry to get the nets made in time for the fishing season.  Everybody who knows anything about that particular matter knows that these nets have to be made by hand.  When this man called to the railway station he was notified that the twine was there, but that he could not get it unless he paid a duty of 33? per cent. It is only right to mention that when the Minister for Agriculture visited Dundalk, he gave encouragement to the fishermen, and promised that he would do all he possibly could in connection with providing twine for nets. Yet, this man had to pay 33? per cent., and had to get a licence to import the twine.  He was granted the licence, but not for a week or two.  If he had got the twine in time, he would have his nets manufactured now, but he lost almost a fortnight.  That is an example of the sort of irritations that people are suffering under as a result of the operations of the Department, and I think they should be removed lock, stock and barrel.  These things cannot be produced here, and their importation will not interfere with any industry existing here at the moment.  This is a special kind of twine which is not manufactured here at all, and, therefore, its import could not interfere with any industry here.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which seems to have given rise to a lot of the criticism that has been levelled against the Department, and that is the question of the supply of butter.  Deputies such as I who have to mix with the ordinary people cannot understand the position in regard to butter rationing as it exists at present in this country.  One week you read where <Col N="2138" /> the Minister made a statement, in answer to a question by the leader of the Labour Party, that the supplies of butter on the market at the moment were very little below normal supplies. Well, if English means anything &ldquo;normal supplies&rdquo; would mean the same supplies of butter as were on the market in pre-war days.  The Minister said that there was very little less. Now, if that is so, surely people should be entitled to get at least a ½ lb. of butter per head per week, but when you go around and meet people, as we have to do, they tell you that they are dealing in a certain shop and cannot get any butter.  I go down to the shop, and the shopkeeper says to me: &ldquo;Mr. Coburn, I have 400 customers and I am quite willing to give them a ½ lb. of butter per head per week, but I cannot get it myself.  All the butter I receive is 126 lbs., delivered fortnightly from the creameries, which means 63 lbs. a week, and how am I to divide that so as to be able to give a ½ lb. of butter per week to 400 customers?&rdquo;  Well, all I can say is that any man who could do that would be very welcome in this country.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I cannot understand the position in regard to butter.  I am not one of those who want to get in a rap at the Government.  I have no need to do it, and the Minister knows it.  I am doing my best to make things easy for the Minister, and I have told these people that, possibly, in a few weeks' time there will be plenty of butter, as there is always a shortage of butter at this time of the year, but what are you going to tell the people when the shopkeeper tells you that the only gets 126 lbs. fortnightly from the creameries to supply 400 customers?</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister for Agriculture on a previous occasion: can it be that some of the creamery managers think it possible to say to these shopkeepers &ldquo;I can only give you so much butter this week,&rdquo; and then send butter surreptitiously to another district where they can get a better price for it?  Could that happen?  Is it possible that an unscrupulous creamery manager could load up a lorry with a certain amount of butter, and then get rid of it at a bigger price and put the <Col N="2139" /> profit in his pocket?  I can find no other explanation.  We hear a lot of talk about the black market and so on, and the activities of traders in connection with it, but I am here to defend the traders.  It is not the traders' fault.  I was in a shop recently where people were trying to get butter.  I am only a customer myself but, being a T.D., the people thought that I could get away with it. All I am getting, however, is two pounds of butter a week, and last week the shopkeeper told me that I would be lucky to get one and a half pounds or even a pound.  As far as I can see, it is almost impossible to explain that position away.  The Minister says that the supplies of butter are only slightly below normal, but the fact is that the people cannot get butter.</P>
    <P>I know families in the country, and I am not exaggerating&mdash;I am leaving out the towns now&mdash;who find it impossible to get butter.  I know, for instance, of cases of men working very hard in quarries, lifting sand, who ride on their bicycles, sometimes four or five miles to their work, who have gone without butter for the last two months so that their children might have some.  To the credit of these men it must be said that they reserve whatever small quantity they get for their children.  I have been an eye-witness to that.  I went through the mill myself, and I am sure that anyone can visualise the position of a man working hard in a quarry with only dry bread to eat.</P>
    <P>I am not now exaggerating the position; I would be the last man in the House to do that, for political purposes or otherwise.  Definitely, that is the position in regard to butter, and I suggest to the Minister that there must be something wrong and he, in consultation with the officials of the Department of Agriculture, should have a through examination of the butter position, having special regard to the time it leaves the creameries, and even before it leaves the creameries.  He should see to it that the retailers of butter in our towns and villages will be able to get something approaching the quantity they require <Col N="2140" /> if the needs of their customers are to be met.  If, as has been stated by the Minister on several occasions&mdash;and no one doubts his word&mdash;that people are entitled to half a pound of butter per week, the Government should so arrange that this supply will be given them.  The situation should not be such as in the example I have given, where people did not receive even a quarter of a pound of butter.  That is one of the things that has caused a great deal of criticism to be levelled against the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I think is creating great confusion amongst traders, and possibly it explains the lack of that co-operation that should exist in times like these between the retailers, the Department of Supplies and the consuming public.  I refer to the revocation of the licences of traders whenever they are found guilty of infringing the conditions laid down when these licences are issued.  I know the Minister and his Department have a very difficult duty to perform.  I know they feel that everybody is out more or less to &ldquo;do&rdquo; the Department.  But there are always exceptions to the general rule.  I know a few traders in Dundalk who were fined recently for, as alleged, selling tea in a manner contrary to the regulations. When the inspectors called on those traders they had not the stocks they should have had and it is only natural to assume that the Department formed the opinion that the traders were disposing of the tea in the black market.  I suppose it is only natural to assume that the traders in Border towns are inclined to deal in the black market, simply because they live along the Border.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a grave injustice if the licences were taken from those traders.  I know them personally and I am aware that one or two of them certainly would give the last ounce of tea and the last grain of sugar to people they considered in need of it, and would do without it themselves. In this case it was not a question of making money.  The people who will feel most aggrieved if these licences are revoked are the customers <Col N="2141" /> who are dealing with these traders.  The traders have not made a penny piece extra in the sale of the tea or sugar that the inspectors found was not in stock.  One trader, in particular, said that he could not refuse the tea to the customers and he did not charge a penny extra for it.  &ldquo;I could not refuse to give it in the circumstances,&rdquo; he said.  I think it would be a great hardship if, in addition to fining those people, their licences were revoked.  It would mean that the businesses, towards the establishment of which they devoted their lives, would be crippled.</P>
    <P>Let me make a comparison with a licensed trader.  A publican who infringes the law once is fined.  If he continues to do it there will be an endorsement and there might be a second and possibly a third endorsement, but he would want to be a very careless man altogether who would lose his licence.  The ordinary trader, in addition to being fined heavily, is likely to lose his licence because of some technical offence.  I believe that that is overdoing it and I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should stay his hand and tell these people that if they were found guilty again of a similar offence he would have to revoke their licences.</P>
    <P>I am not a person who would support the black market.  I live near the Border and I hear a lot of talk about black marketing.  I think there is nothing to justify a lot of the talk about the black market and its depredations. We hear a lot of talk about So-and-so going across the Border into Northern Ireland, but we seldom hear of the people who travel the other way.  It is a matter of opinion whether the value of our imports over the Border would not be greater than our exports.  I think some people should not talk too bog when they are referring to the Border.</P>
    <P>We heard the Minister referring to the millions of gallons of petrol and the millions of gallons of fuel oil and kerosene that were brought into this country.  One has not to think very hard to realise what position we would be in if these millions of gallons of <Col N="2142" /> oil were stopped.  I can visualise many of our countrymen going out with spades to dig up the fields if we had not the tractors and the motor ploughs. I can visualise the vast amount of manual labour that would be involved in harvesting if we had not the petrol and fuel oil for the machines that now do that work.  When people talk about the Border they should not forget those things.  It would be well for them to recollect that we get a great many things across that are very useful to us.</P>
    <P>With regard to the revocation of licences, I suggest that the Minister is displaying a tendency to overdo things. I was greatly surprised when I heard that this procedure was being practised, that, merely because of some technical offence in relation to tea or sugar, licences were being taken away. To add to the grievance I should like to point out that in most cases the customers of these traders have been transferred to multiple shops.  The Minister must be aware that there is no such thing as credit in the multiple shops, that all transactions are ready money transactions.  In contrast with that; the traders from whom these customers are transferred gave long-term credit.  Many of the working-class people would be in a bad position were it not that the traders gave long-term credits.  I think if the members of the Labour Party were here they could vouch for that.</P>
    <P>In certain trade disputes that lasted for two or three months, some of the traders gave credits amounting to thousands of pounds and they had to wait for months and sometimes years before they got their money back.  In some cases where traders' licences were taken the customers were transferred to multiple shops owned for the most part by people who are not citizens of this country.  I think the Minister ought to be very slow in taking away the licences from these traders; especially when it was proved that the offence was of a very technical character.  That was indicated by the very small fine imposed by the district justice.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer, in passing, to the materials required by saddlers and <Col N="2143" /> shoemakers.  There are many articles incidental to the repair of boots and, if the tariffs were taken off, a good deal of raw materials which would be very useful could be imported by the people engaged in that business.  The Minister would be well advised to remove many of those tariffs which at the moment do no good and, in fact, in the present emergency, do a great <Col N="2144" /> deal of harm and are the means of making conditions more difficult, especially for people engaged in such trades as boot-making.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he has given an indication to county councils of the attitude of the Department towards a policy of raising the wages of road workers and other manual workers employed by county councils; and, if so, whether he will indicate the nature of the communication made in the matter.</P>

      <P>On the 19th December last in connection with a public announcement that increases of pay were to be made to lower paid civil servants, Gárda Síochána and national school teachers it was stated that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health would review proposals for increases in remuneration of employees of local authorities.  It was also publicly announced at that time that the wages of agricultural workers were to be increased by 3/- a week as from 1st February.  It is essential that agriculture should have prior claim on available labour throughout the present season and that agricultural workers should not be attracted to non-agricultural employment by the payment of higher wages. This fact was pointed out to county managers last December.</P>

      <P>The road workers employed by the Kerry County Council are paid at the rate of 35/- per week. In regard to the second and third parts of the question I am not prepared to do what the Deputy suggests.  The present financial position of this county when compared with that of other counties is most unsatisfactory.</P>
