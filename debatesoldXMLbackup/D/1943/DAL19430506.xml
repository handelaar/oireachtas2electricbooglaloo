      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that notwithstanding the butter shortage large quantities of butter are available at dances and entertainments in various parts of the country; whether in particular he is aware that two stone of butter was provided for use at a dance held in Templemore on February 17th last; and whether he will indicate what regulations now apply to the supplying of butter, tea and sugar for use at such functions.</P>

      <P>Butter is at present rationed only in the Dublin and Bray areas and, in so far as these areas are concerned, no butter is made available specifically for use at dances and entertainments.</P>
      <P>In other parts of the country, deliveries of butter to traders by creameries were restricted under an Order made by the Minister for Agriculture.  While I have no knowledge of the case referred to in the question, it is possible that promoters of dances and entertainments in the non-rationed area were able to procure butter for use at these functions.  It is the intention to extend butter rationing to the whole country and the abuses to which the Deputy refers will be kept in mind in this connection.</P>
      <P>With regard to tea and sugar, the position is that supplies of these commodities are not made available for use at dances and similar entertainments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that Messrs. Moran and Sons, Roscahill West, Kilmeena, Westport, made several applications to his Department for a licence to export carrageen moss, and that they have not yet received such licence; and if he will state the cause of delay in issuing the licence to Messrs Moran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Messrs. Moran applied to my Department in August last for an export licence for a considerable quantity of carrageen moss.  As a result of inquiries subsequently made, it was ascertained that they had only a negligible quantity of moss then on hands. They were, therefore, advised to submit a fresh application when they had a consignment collected for export, and to furnish certain necessary information. Two subsequent applications were made by Messrs. Moran in January and February last.  Each application ignored my Department's communication, and on each occasion the attention of the applicants was called to the terms of that communication. In the circumstances, the delay is attributable to Messrs.  Moran and not to my Department.</P>
      <P>I may add that responsibility for the issue of licences for the exportation of carrageen moss has been taken over as from the 1st April, 1943, by the Department of Lands.</P>

Tyres are, of course, being provided for fire-fighting vehicles as required.  New motor tyres for private cars are not being manufactured.</P>
      <P>As regards cycle tyres and tubes, I would refer the Deputy to the answer which I gave to a similar question on 3rd February, 1943.  No special provision is being made in this year for the supply of cycle tyres and tubes to members of the L.D.F. and L.S.F. services. In view of the limited supplies available it is not possible to make arrangements for special allocations to these services or to the auxiliary fire-fighting service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that Mr. Rigby has been refused by my Department the necessary facilities to enable him to emigrate to employment in Canada.  It has been decided by the Government that facilities enabling Irish citizens to proceed to employment outside the State should not be granted to persons who are in employment in this country or for whom employment here is immediately available.  Mr. Rigby is in the employment of the Liffey Dockyard and notwithstanding the recent deduction of 25 per cent. which is stated to have been made in his earnings, it is understood that he is receiving a standard rate for his work.  The Deputy will appreciate that applications for permission to emigrate from persons in employment in this country based on the ground that the applicants might earn more money elsewhere could not be accepted without making all control of emigration ineffective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present shortage of potatoes is due to a number of causes, of which the main one is the low yield of the 1942 crop.  Other factors are difficulties of transport under emergency conditions, and an increasing tendency to feed potatoes to cattle.  With regard to the second part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to the question asked by him on the 25th March, 1943.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the present shortage is due to his failure to ensure that a sufficient acreage of potatoes is grown so as to leave a safe margin to cover the risk of a falling off in the yield, disease or loss?  Is he also aware that in Great Britain, a country with less than three times our arable area, there is an adequate supply of potatoes for a population 15 times greater than ours? Surely, therefore, it is not unreasonable to ask the Minister why he has failed to take steps to ensure an increase in the acreage under potatoes by the payment of a direct subsidy per acre.</P>

No creamery butter was exported in the three months January to March, 1943, with the exception of a negligible quantity exported as gifts. A limited quantity of non-creamery butter for ships' stores was exported during this period.</P>

      <P>It does not matter what I meant or what the Minister thinks, the result will be the same and it is only the result that will count.  The Minister will never again introduce a Budget in the national Parliament.  Deputies who are opposite know that.  This Budget puts a full stop to Fianna Fáil.  There is no doubt about that.  If it is remarkable for anything, it is remarkable for this, and I welcome it in so far as this feature of it is concerned, that it makes a very welcome departure from the woolly and muddled thinking which has gone on in Fianna Fáil since the Party was first founded.  For the first time it shows an attempt, and a fairly courageous attempt, to face up to some of the facts&mdash;not all of them by any means, but to some of them.  That is a very remarkable document and I invite Deputies, particularly Fianna Fáil Deputies, to get that document and to read it very carefully.  They will be shocked at the difference between what is set out in that document and what they preached for so many years.  As I said, there are welcome departures.  In this Budget the Government have got away from what I might call the brass wall around Ireland mentality.  There is a recognition that our future, our economic future particularly, is bound up with the future of the rest of the world.  There is a facing up to facts to a certain extent but not to as many facts as we would like to see the Government facing up to.</P>
      <P>If there was one feature more than another stressed by the Minister in this Budget it was the provision being made for what he called social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2407" /> The Government and their supporters have got into the habit of boasting about their social services, boasting about the amount of money they have provided for unemployment assistance and for food vouchers and so on.  In my opinion that is nothing to boast about; it is something to be ashamed of that the necessity for doing that should be there.  It stamps very definitely the failure of the Government to provide work for people in this country who are fit to work, which has forced those people into a position that they have to accept, so to speak, alms from the State.  It is that or starvation. When the Minister tells us and, through this House, tells the country, that this year £20,500,000 is being provided for unemployment assistance and social services, again that is not something to be proud of. The Minister, in the very first page of his statement, faced up to certain facts, but he ignored completely certain other very important and very vital facts, facts which, in my opinion, not only should have their place in this review of the nation's resources and of its position to-day, but should have a very important place in this review.</P>
    <P>We find on page one that the Minister gives himself a pat on the back because the visible imports from the beginning of the war up to the 31st March last exceeded the visible export by some £17.3 millions in value. There is, unfortunately, one great exports of ours&mdash;a very visible one indeed&mdash;on which apparently the Minister places no value&mdash;our export of human beings.  We are told that this is a Budget of which Fianna Fáil is proud.  It discloses a state of affairs that any Government at the end of ten years should be ashamed of.  When we are talking of our visible imports and boasting of the fact that they are supposed to be £17,000,000 over our visible exports, surely there ought to be some recognition or some mention of the fact that not since the famine period has the export of humans from this country exceeded the numbers of the last year or two.</P>
    <P>The Minister also puts before the <Col N="2408" /> House and the country as a very desirable state of affairs that the deposits in the banks have increased by 40 per cent.  We built up a surplus of paper money.  But I put it to the Minister that, side by side with that, there is very rapidly being reduced the real wealth of the country in its men and its women, in useful material, in the fertility of the land&mdash;that is inevitable at the moment, I know.  But there ought to be a recognition of the fact that if we built up deposits of paper money in the banks, we are losing doubly and trebly on the other side in real wealth.  Our real wealth is being diminished.  There is no getting away from that fact.  That does not find any mention or emphasis in the financial statement that the Minister put before the House of his year's work.</P>
    <P>To return for a moment to the question of unemployment, to the question of the cost of living, to the question of pegging wages at a certain point, to the situation which demands food vouchers, which demands unemployment assistance, and so on, what picture does that disclose?  It discloses this picture: that a very great number of men who should be producing wealth from the land or somewhere else, because of the very high cost of living, because of the fact that they are unable to earn wages to keep place with that high cost of living, because in many cases they are unable to earn any wages and are dependent absolutely on the State for existence, are themselves and their children only half nourished.  Arising out of that, we are in the position that our men to-day are not A1 men in the sense that they are not fully competent to give 100 per cent. production which would be given by healthy, well-fed men.  We are storing up for ourselves, through our under-nourished children, a position that will give us all that flows from malnutrition.  We are heading towards a C-3 race.  People are trying to exist under conditions that can produce in children particularly, rickets, consumption, and everything else that one dreads to see even traces of in children.</P>
    <P>In his Budget, the Minister admits that there has been an increase of <Col N="2409" /> 60 per cent. in the cost of living since the war started.  I am very glad that the Minister for Local Government is present.  Is it reasonable, is it just or fair, that working men with families should be expected to meet a cost of living which has increased by at least 60 per cent.&mdash;and, if essential foods are taken, by a higher percentage than 60 per cent.&mdash;and, to be able to provide for themselves and their dependents on the wages which they had five or six years ago, wages which even at that time, even in normal times, were admittedly low?  Let me take just one class as an illustration.  There are thousands of road workers in this country, employed by the county councils, and with one or two exceptions the maximum rate of wages allowed is 35/- a week.  Is there any Deputy on any side of the House, with any knowledge of what it costs to run his own home or of the enormous increase in the cost of providing even the necessaries of life in his own home, who believes that a man can rear a healthy family on 35/- a week to-day?  It cannot be done, and I would like the Minister for Local Government to explain to this House why, in the face of the 60 per cent. increase in the cost of living, and particularly in the cost of food, he refuses to allow local authorities to increase the rate of wages to their employees by as much as 6d. per week.  He is the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Does he believe that he is doing his duty as Minister for Public Health, or that he is helping to bring up a healthy race, when he is forcing men with families of three, seven or eight children to exist on 35/-a week at the present day?</P>
    <P>In his statement, the Minister talks about the provision for educational services of almost £5,500,000.  We provide £5,312,000 to educate the youth, but we do not provide sufficient wages to feed the children first.  Does anyone think that full value will be got for the enormous sums of money that are spent on education, when we are trying to impart that education to children, many of whom are half hungry?  Is the Minister aware that, during last winter and this spring, up to a fortnight agó, <Col N="2410" /> even in rural Ireland where there are creameries and some of the richest land in Europe, children had to go to school on breakfasts of dry bread, as there was no butter to be had, even where the price was available?  I suggest to the Minister for Finance and to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, that they should consider the £5,312,000 in respect of education side by side with the problem of the man with four, five, six or seven children, trying to rear them on 30/- or 35/- per week.</P>
    <P>May I say in passing that, whilst I am glad to see that there is £5,312,000 for education&mdash;and even if it were greater, I personally would not object, if it were spent in the right direction&mdash; it is notorious that nobody in this country, outside the Department of Education itself, believes that that money is being spent to the best advantage, to give education its proper bent, or to impart the proper knowledge to the children?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure you that I have no intention whatever to deal with this in detail.  I say it is notorious that no person interested in education, <Col N="2411" /> outside the Department, believes that we are getting as much value as we could get from the expenditure of that money.</P>
      <P>Last year, in dealing with the Budget, I had occasion to complain that the Minister did not devote to our main industry the space to which it was entitled.  This year I have to make that complaint again.  The one thing that emerges from the Minister's statement, with regard to agriculture, is that, after four years of war, Irish agriculture is not producing to-day any more than it was producing four years ago.  If that is so, after four years of appeal by a united Parliament, from platform, press and radio, for increased production from the land, does the Minister not consider it a very serious matter?  Is it not reasonable to assume that, if the war lasts another 12 months or two or three years, we will be getting less and less, as the productive capacity of the land will be diminishing, owing to the absence of fertilisers and manures?</P>
      <P>Any man living in rural Ireland, or in touch with the farmers and workers on the land, knows quite well that our land is losing its fertility year after year.  That is inevitable, but if the last ounce of fertility is to be taken out of it, it is a fact we cannot afford to ignore.  The sowing of wheat on land which is not suitable for that purpose, and the sowing of a second, a third, and in some cases a fourth, corn crop in succession on the same land, can have only one result in the end.  You are then taking a lot out of the land and not in a position to put anything back, because the manures are not available from home or imported sources in the quantities required. Apart altogether from the question of the quantities of manures, it is well known to everybody that the quality is very poor, compared to the quality available in normal times.  Surely, the Minister should not have left off at that point, by saying that there was not any increase?  The position is far worse than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter which concerns every member of this House, whether he sits <Col N="2412" /> on the Government Benches or not, that in a country which used to be looked upon as one of the best food-producing countries in the world, we have a shortage&mdash;I will not use any stronger language&mdash;of butter, bacon, milk and potatoes.  I will not put it beyond that.  I know from my own personal knowledge, as I am living in a part of the country which thank God contains some of the best land in Ireland or outside it, and even in that part of Ireland this spring and during part of the winter a section of the people and their families were not able to secure anything like a sufficiency of butter.  There must be a reason for the shortage of butter, bacon, potatoes, and milk.  With proper organisation, proper co-ordination and proper contacts between the various Departments concerned I believe that these shortages could be considerably lessened, if not removed.  I am perfectly certain that while potatoes cannot be got in the City of Dublin, there are parts of the country where there is a surplus of potatoes.  I have no doubt whatever about that.  Apparently it was nobody's business to see where there was a surplus which could be transferred to places where there was a want.  I put it to the Minister that the shortage of potatoes this year has arisen mainly because of what happened last year.  The Government made an appeal to farmers when the wheat-growing season was over to grow more and more potatoes, stating that they could not grow enough.  The farmers responded to the appeal in a magnificent way and used practically all the farmyard manure they had to grow potatoes.  There was a bumper crop both in quality and quantity. What happened?  Is it not known to Deputies from all parts of rural Ireland that tens of thousands of tons of potatoes were allowed to rot in the pits because the farmers could not dispose of them?  As a result, nothing like the same acreage of potatoes was sown this year.  Hence the explanation, in part, of the shortage that now exists.  I am satisfied that if there was an even distribution of the potatoes that are available we would have more than a sufficiency for human needs to <Col N="2413" /> carry us on until the new crop is available.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that when he speaks through his Budget Statement he is speaking for the Government but, in times like the present; there are more things than mere figures, money, deposits in the banks or even in the Post Office to be considered. It would be very excellent to do so if we were living in normal times, but that is not necessarily a healthy sign to-day.  Unlike a great many people I do not claim to be an authority on finance, credit, currency reform or any of the other topics that we hear discussed, but I know that if a person has a 10/- note in his pocket and cannot buy a ½ stone of potatoes for his children's dinner, the 10/- note is not much good.  That is the distinction that I, in my ignorance of currency, of money and finance fangles that we read of, make and that I regard as the difference between paper money and real wealth.  Real wealth, in my opinion, consists of the people in the country and in the productive capacity of the land, and when I see both disappearing, I say that we have no reason to be complacent, or to think that we are doing the job placed on our shoulders to the extent that I believe it should be done.  I say that there is nothing in the Budget Statement of the Minister disclosing anything in the way of dealing with what has come to be known as post-war plans.  I read recently that the Executive or a committee of the Executive was sitting once or twice weekly and devoting their time exclusively to post-war planning.  Apparently it is a State secret still, because in the statement we have got no whimper about its proceedings. I want to put this question to the Minister: what would be our position if the war ended in three months or in six months?  I do not know the exact figures, but there are something like 50,000 of our young men in the National Army and I suppose between 50,000 and 100,000 or more of our people would return, either voluntarily or otherwise, from across the water.  These and the number of people that we have unemployed would present any Government with a serious <Col N="2414" /> problem.  In my opinion it would be a terribly grave and dangerous problem. I want to know if the present Government recognise that danger; whether they are facing up to it and whether they have any plans for dealing with it.</P>
    <P>I do not want in any way to disparage what has been done, because it has been useful work in its own way, but a great deal more vision and imagination will be required than has been brought to bear upon the problem of unemployment during the past ten years.  The making of bog roads, the starting of small relief schemes and the draining of farmers' land is all useful work, but it is merely putting a penny stamp on a broken leg as far as solving the unemployment problem is concerned and the gravity of it will be five times greater in the future. That will require vision, imagination and above all courage as well as faith in our country.  One begins to wonder whether the Government has any faith in the country when one hears statements such as that made recently by the Minister for Agriculture, that he could see no future for the dairying industry.  It was an appalling statement coming from a Minister charged with the responsibility of fostering and improving that industry.  I do not believe that statement.  If I did I would begin to lose faith in the country.  It was extraordinary that a responsible Minister would make such a statement.  The Budget is remarkable, so far as it affects the people to whom I referred at the beginning, those dependent on the State for a livelihood or to the extent that the State in one form or another helps to keep life in them, inasmuch as it promises nothing in the immediate future.  They will find nothing in the Budget that promises them anything more than their present meagre existence. I think the statement did not go far enough.  I agree that the problem has been aggravated by the emergency, but if these people have to put up with hardship the least we ought to be able to do for them is to hold out a hope that the conditions under which they have to exist will be <Col N="2415" /> brought to an end within a reasonable time.  I believe that the resources of the country are sufficient to do it.  It is only a matter of courage, vision and initiative.  We should have these three qualities in this House and, properly applied and properly worked, I believe they could change the face of this country economically and socially within a comparatively short time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;What is there in his Budget to-day?&rdquo;&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;&ldquo;He is a great man at doing nothing.&rdquo; That was the conversation I had yesterday with a friend of mine, and the only addition that I should have liked to have made to it was this: &ldquo;So are the rest of them.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance, by his Budget statement, gives the House an opportunity of indulging in a little stocktaking, of considering the policy of the Government as a whole and the success of that policy.  In the coming weeks, in places other than this, I do not intend to deal much with the Government or the Fianna Fáil Party. A little experience of some weeks past has shown me that that, to a large extent, is a work of supererogation. If anything, I find myself behind my audiences, that I am to a certain extent wasting rather limited and valuable time in criticising the present Government for its mistakes.  But, in this annual stocktaking, it is our business here to consider whether the Government has used wisely and efficiently the immense sum of money which Parliament yearly puts at its disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again and again, on various occasions, I have urged that one of the fundamental questions that the Government should have faced and that every Government ought to face, even more than the size of the actual amount that is demanded from the taxpayer, is the value that is provided in return for that money.  I would put it to Ministers, and to the Deputies of every Party in this House, to run through Department after Department, to pay attention to the increase in the costs of these various Departments&mdash;<Col N="2416" /> Agriculture, Education, Industry and Commerce, Supplies, Local Government, all Departments affecting the vital interests of the ordinary people of the country&mdash;and let Deputies ask themselves whether there is genuine value given for the immense sums spent.  If that examination is undertaken with any degree of impartiality and calmness, I think, at the very least, grave doubts must arise in the minds of anybody whether value is given.  In the case of some Departments one is sometimes driven to wonder whether they are not an obstruction rather than a help to enable the ordinary people of this country to carry on in the present emergency.  That is particularly so, I should say, in the case of the Department of Supplies, and I think the Minister, if he were in any position other than that of having to shoulder the responsibility of justifying this immense expenditure, however unjustifiable it may be, would acknowledge that in very few cases is there such an increase in efficiency and in the return given to the people for the money spent.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see a somewhat belated expression of opinion from a man in the position of the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance, about the importance to this country of an export trade.  I often think that it is a pity that the great importance of that had not dawned earlier upon the present Ministry.  However, so far as words go, they pay tribute to it now but let him ask his colleagues what is their opinion as to where this export is to come from.  He must know&mdash;it has certainly been pointed out often enough in this House&mdash;that one after another they have set themselves about trying to destroy the belief that there is any possibility of an export trade for this country. Two of the Ministers in University College on separate occasions&mdash;I often wonder why that pleasant and, on the whole, rather joyful institution should have been chosen for these lugubrious statements&mdash;have rung the death knell of our principal sources of export.  As he knows, if you take the statements at their face value the <Col N="2417" /> poultry trade is dead as an export proposition, the bacon trade is dead, as an export proposition certainly, if it is not dead even as an internal proposition, and the cattle trade has no future either.  Where are these exports, to which the Minister refers on page 37 of the typewritten statement he was kind enough to give us yesterday, to come from?  He stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt, however, that if, as must be hoped, economic progress is to be resumed after the war our concern with external trade and, in consequence, international currency stability, will be greater than before.  Our major task for the moment in this sphere must be to pursue a policy which will leave us in the most favourable position for taking our part in the resumption of external trade and for accommodating ourselves, in so far as it may be advisable, to any measures that may be devised in relation to the currencies of countries with which we have important economic relations.</P>
    <P>What steps are we taking?  Does the Minister believe the statements of his colleagues?  If he does, what steps can he take?  What can he suggest?  I might have referred to the general policy of the Government but looking to the future as we should like to look to the future what is being done in regard to the future?  Does the Head of the Government really believe that there is much use in troubling about the future?  I am not at all underrating the difficulties.  It is exceedingly difficult even vaguely to foreshadow the kind of world that will emerge from the present confusion, from the present war, from the present orgy of destruction.  Economically&mdash; and that is possibly the least important side of it&mdash;and morally and spiritually as well, we shall have to face a very different world.  It is hard, I admit quite readily, to form any picture of what that world is likely to be, but at least we should try as well as we can to put ourselves in a position to face whatever it may be.  I agree with the Minister that we must have external trade.  Are we taking <Col N="2418" /> any reasonable steps to see that his hopes in that respect will not be empty hopes, mere words?  I doubt whether the outlook is at all as black as painted by his colleagues, but it is certainly disastrous that men in such responsible positions should have such an outlook. Surely it is defeatism, of the worst type.  I am aware that modern transport developments may bring very distant competitors much nearer to us than they are at present, but I cannot forget that one of the results of the present destruction on the Continent will be the necessity of building up that Continent, and that our products may be necessary for that.  However much we may regret that destruction, and we do regret it, it does suggest that there will still be a market for our most characteristic and typical products. I should like to know whether the Government is taking any steps to see that we are not shut out from two things after the war&mdash;it could easily happen&mdash;from markets on the one hand and from the supply of such materials as we cannot do without on the other?  Is there any danger that, in the matter of getting supplies, we may be put very low on the list?  That is a problem which will face whatever Government is in power, and I think it is a very serious one.  I wonder whether the Government are facing that problem with the clarity of mind and with the courage and determination that it demands?</P>
    <P>Export trade is necessary.  The war must have convinced everybody in this country that we are not living in a universe by ourselves.  There is a number of things which we can produce, and we ought to produce as much as we can.  I admit that a number of industries has been established by the present Government.  Those industries must naturally be kept on and if possible made economic, but it is clear that we cannot continue unless we can import a number of articles, and we cannot continue to import a number of articles unless we have something to export.  Are we making efforts to see that that situation is met?</P>
    <P>I think that, apart altogether from any mistakes that have been made in the past 10 or 20 years, any Government <Col N="2419" /> in this country will be put to the pin of its collar to meet the situation which will present itself after this struggle has been brought to an end. I think every effort should now be made to get at least some idea of the problems that may have to be faced, and to put the country in a position to meet as far as possible&mdash;I do not say fully satisfactorily&mdash;the situation that may arise.  There is nothing to be gained by that defeatist attitude which was represented by one Minister after another in this House and elsewhere, and which was so pungently summed up by one of the chief defaulters on the Government Benches&mdash;I forget whether he was speaking as Minister for Supplies or as Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;when about 12 months ago he issued his now famous statement: &ldquo;There is no point in disguising the fact that in present circumstances our bargaining power is practically nil. Our production of bacon and butter has fallen to the point where there is no export surplus, where in fact it is inadequate to supply even the whole of our own requirements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Minister for Finance subscribe to that summing up of our economic, international position?  If so, what is the good of this Budget, taken in the light of some of the statements in it?  No bargaining power? That may be an excuse by the same Minister for indulging so little in successful bargaining.  Whether before the outbreak of the war or since the outbreak of the war, whether in big things or in small things, things affecting the avocations and the lives of large numbers of the community or comparatively small groups of people, there is very little to be shown in the way of successful activity on his part. When I asked a question in regard to the supply of absolutely necessary gear for fishermen, I found that it could not be got.  The same applied to machine parts, and without some supply of spare parts the engines will simply stop.  So many boats will be put out of commission and so many men out of employment.  With regard to nets, ropes, and mending material for nets, you can ask a question either of the <Col N="2420" /> Minister for Fisheries or the Minister for Supplies and the answer you will get is: &ldquo;Nothing doing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Turning to the bigger things, have we not had one muddle after another? In the last four and a half years there has been no evidence of foresight in big matters or in small matters.  That being so, what kind of foresight can we expect in the much more difficult times that lie ahead?  It is no wonder the Government are not revealing their plans.  We remember the statement of the Minister for Supplies 12 months before the war that all his time and the time of his principal officials was given over to the laying in of supplies. I am not denying that all the energy he had left in him was given over to that.  The only thing is that there were no supplies, and whichever period you take&mdash;whether the time of difficulty when it was difficult to get in supplies, or the time when it was possible to get in supplies&mdash;there is no evidence of forethought on the part of the Government. Is there any now?  If one were to read certain passages in the Minister's statement, one would be at least inclined to come to the conclusion that he thought there ought to be a little foresight.  There ought to be, but what we are anxious to know is: is there any, or are we still drifting on in the same way?  Remember, the lack of foresight strikes us every day.  Whether in respect of things we produce or the things we do not produce in this country, there is no effort to deal with the fundamental business of supply.  It is happening to-day.  We produce potatoes, and there is a shortage of potatoes in Dublin.  That shortage is dealt with when it occurs, and it was the same with everything else.</P>
    <P>The problem in the future will be difficult and the difficulty will not be altogether due to the Government.  It will be due to the whole situation and I think it will be due also&mdash;and here I agree with the hint which the Minister gave; I have spoken of it before&mdash;to a certain lack of insight on the part of our own people.  Here we are, happily neutral, watching the war taking place, as it were, and, being so comparatively comfortable in that position, not facing the problems that lie before us.  I am <Col N="2421" /> not speaking of the Government, or of this House, but of the people as a whole.  One of the difficult tasks which any Government will have to face will be the awakening of some sense of the realities of the situation in the minds of our people.  I wish the Government had devoted something to that point in the immense amount of propaganda they have carried on.</P>
    <P>They have carried on propaganda, but propaganda to the farmer, which has been very strikingly responded to, is not enough.  It will not bring back the land to fertility.  However rotten the propaganda may be, it will not take the place of fertilisers.  There is that danger there, in addition to many serious problems, to one of which Deputy Morrissey has already referred.</P>
    <P>We need not now discuss the question of responsibility, but it might be no harm to point out that under the previous Government there was a steady increase in insurable employment of about 10,000 or 11,000 persons per year&mdash;I am referring now to the rate&mdash;and notwithstanding all the great efforts of the present Government in the way of tariffs, has that rate been kept up?  I do not think it has.  I do not want to make Party capital out of the very serious state of affairs which has arisen for a number of years, that is, the emigration of the young men of this country.  It took place before the war, but the position now is that the draw on our young people which was previously exercised by the United States of America is now being exercised by England.</P>
    <P>I cannot blame these young people. We must face the fact&mdash;we need not bother about the responsibility for it at the moment&mdash;that they cannot find a proper livelihood at home.  Quite recently, I was paying a friendly call on a medical friend of mine in a southern county.  As I was leaving, there were at least from 15 to 20 young fellows in the hall waiting for examination for migration to England.  I asked my friend if that were usual.  I do not want to exaggerate and I do not know whether he gave me figures for a month or for a fortnight for his very circumscribed district, but he said that the <Col N="2422" /> average number that he certified as fit for migration to England was 45&mdash;either per fortnight or per month.</P>
    <P>What will the result be?  Is the future of this country to be that it is to be a country of old age pensioners, the old age pensioner paying the old age pension of every other old age pensioner?  The prospect is very serious. We all know the irresistible attraction&mdash;it was one of the problems of rural Ireland in the past, and, in my own part of my native county, it would be the Boston district of Massachusetts&mdash;of New York, Chicago, and so on.  We have the same problem now.  There was a young fellow, who was not a supporter of my Party, who complained to me that he could not, get sufficient material to carry on his trade.  He was a craftsman and he said: &ldquo;If I do not get it from the Department of Supplies&rdquo;&mdash;and it was the phrase he used which gave me a shock&mdash;&ldquo;I will have to leave for the &lsquo;good&rsquo; country.&rdquo;  He was not a Fine Gael supporter and his phrase hit me, so to speak, in the eyes, confirming my belief that there is that attraction which will make it exceedingly difficult to keep the young men at home. Whether they will come back after the war and whether there is anybody thinking of what is to be done with them if they do, I do not know.  If they do come back in large numbers, then you will be faced with a very dangerous, as well as a very serious, problem.  As I say, that problem of emigration is very serious.  I do not blame the young people for emigrating. It is a serious problem for any Government to face, and, although Deputies can form their own views as to the success of the Government in dealing with that problem, I have not tried to dwell on the Party side of it. The problem is so serious that for a couple of years past I have tried to avoid discussing it at all in reference to the various Parties.  There are certain aspects of it, apart altogether from the material aspects of the problem of migration, that seem to me so important that these aspects would make me more determined not to discuss the problem in reference, even, <Col N="2423" /> to a criticism of the Government, however much a number of people may think they are responsible.</P>
    <P>If we are going to resume and improve our position in the international market after the war&mdash;and in that respect we have had at last a very illuminating statement from the Minister as to where that market is to be found&mdash;we must see what we are determined to do for agriculture.  Mind you, the failure of agriculture in this country, so far as it has failed&mdash;the impossibility of young men or young women finding either an attractive or even an economic life in the country&mdash; has also bedevilled the problem in the towns.  Migration was one inevitable result.  With regard to emigration to England, and the flocking of people from the countryside, I suppose there is not a Deputy in the House who is not deluged with demands from young men or young women in the country asking them to find positions for them in Dublin, and I think that the same would hold good of every other town.</P>
    <P>That neglect, if I might call it so, of the fundamental interests of agriculture, has had a very bad effect on this whole problem, and I wish that these things were properly and sufficiently considered.  We have been fully responsible, now, for our own fate for 20 years and over.  Have we solved some of our main problems?  Have we even approached a solution of some of our main problems?  Apart from the prices that are due to war conditions, can anybody say that the situation to-day is not much more serious in many respects than it was, let us say, five, ten or 15 years ago?  Mistakes, of course, have been made in the past. For one reason, I did not dwell too much on the past failures of the Government, because I should like, if the past were referred to, that each Party would try to make out what mistakes it made and try to remedy them.  I have no doubt that every Party could learn a little, even from its opponents, but I want a proper facing of the mighty problems, even dangerous problems, that, it seems to me, will inevitably confront this country either <Col N="2424" /> if the war continues for any appreciable length of time or if peace should come soon.  In either case, this country will have a tremendous struggle for existence and, as Deputy Morrissey said, will require vision and foresight. I wish I could believe that the Ministers have that foresight.  They are still in control.  They have better means than anybody else at their disposal for knowing what is the future which we shall have to face.  When I think of the performance of each and every one of them, I think I would have to be a desperately optimistic man in order to think that they are capable of facing the responsibilities that will come upon any Government in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy O'Sullivan with great interest, and I am glad that he approached this whole problem, not in any Party spirit, because I think that the whole situation is far too serious, far too grave, and far too dangerous, to approach the problems that confront us at the present time, and in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, with that mentality.  Deputy O'Sullivan has attempted to give us a very fair and impartial <i>résumé</i> of how the country stands at the moment and of the dangers that lie ahead.  As far as this Budget is concerned, the people have reason to be pleased, I suppose, because there is no increase in the position of taxation for the coming year, but they have also very good reason to be alarmed at the unprecedented level of spending and the high cost of administration.  The main characteristic of the Budget is the characteristic of many Fianna Fáil Budgets in the past, the fact that it is unbalanced and that we are piling up burdens, by way of borrowing, that will have to be met at some future date.  As I said on a previous occasion, I would not be so much alarmed at a high bill of expenditure during an emergency such as we are passing through at the moment, if that money were spent in a proper way. During such an emergency as we are passing through, and situated as our country is, we are in a war atmosphere, and, naturally, the amount of <Col N="2425" /> money to be spent on the maintenance of social services, and on keeping our people in employment, would mean that there would have to be a rather high level of spending and taxation, but when one examines the ways and means adopted by the present Government in the spending of that money and using it in the national interest, one must be very seriously alarmed. The fact is that the people are getting very bad value for the money that is being taken from them by way of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already said that, in times like these, one would not criticise the high level of taxation if the money derived from such taxation was being wisely and judiciously spent.  We find, however, that, including taxation for Central Fund purposes and also local taxation, we are facing a bill of something over £50,000,000.  If you add to the figure appearing for Public Services, £1,500,000 for Supplementary Estimates, and over £5,000,000 for the Central Fund, that would put the figure up to £47,000,000, and when you include the local services, it would be long beyond £50,000,000.  If we take that figure as representing the amount for the Twenty-Six Counties, it amounts to a sum of £2,000,000 per county.  Now, that is an enormous bill to be faced by the different counties in Ireland.  It is an enormous bill for each county to foot in present circumstances and under present conditions. We have a falling national income.  We have a scarcity of raw materials for industry.  We have a scarcity of essential raw materials for agriculture, and we have the emigration of over 100,000 of the finest young men in the country. Forty thousand of our young men have gone into the Army.  It may be necessary to keep up the defence organisation. I am not criticising that.  There has been an increase in the Civil Service of 6,000 or 7,000 people.  That means that in this country the proportion of people engaged in non-productive work to the number of people in productive employment is far greater than ever it was before.  The most alarming aspect of the whole situation is the tendency under present Government policy to increase the number of <Col N="2426" /> those engaged in non-productive work. Those people are imposing further burdens on the productive element in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has boasted about the social services and the help given under various branches of public services. Surely that is not an indication of prosperity or of good conditions generally.  This House has to vote large sums of money for unemployment relief, unemployment insurance and for schemes of free fuel and food for large sections of our people.  Is not that a definite indication of unhealthy conditions in the State, an indication that we are socially and economically unhealthy and unsound? If there were conditions of progress and prosperity, these reliefs would not be necessary.  The amount of money that it would be necessary to spend on services of that kind would be far less and the producers would be relieved of the burden of providing reliefs that under present conditions must be applied in order to keep the wolf from the doors of many people.  In present circumstances, notwithstanding the drain of emigration, we still have to make these provisions.</P>
    <P>The dole is no substitute for a good day's pay for a good day's work and reliefs of the kind adverted to by the Minister are no alternative to prosperous conditions and opportunities for people to provide their own means of livelihood.  It is only because we have failed in that respect that substantial provision has to be made in the Budget for social services.  The Minister, on the Vote on Account, in reply to a debate in this House, boasted about the assistance given to agriculture.  He stressed the point that we are providing £700,000 for the dairying industry. Is that a sign of healthy conditions in the dairying industry?  Has not that merely the effect of crystallising the <i>status quo</i>?  I do not say for a moment that we should not subsidise it if the industry is in an unhealthy and decaying condition&mdash;as it definitely is.  No matter what financial help the Government has given, its productive capacity is declining.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2427" /> The fact that we have to vote a substantial sum of money for that industry is not an indication of healthy conditions. The thing the Minister boasted about, to my mind, is the thing that he cannot boast about.  We all must agree that, in view of the conditions developing in that industry, the provision of a subsidy was necessary to keep the industry going.  That was not enough.  Side by side with that, the responsible Minister should have had the condition of the industry properly examined and properly investigated with a view to removing whatever defects were in its structure.  That has not been done and the dairying industry in this country has been permitted to decay.  I suppose that is understandable, judging by the attitude of the responsible Minister who, when he went down to Cork, said that he saw no future for the dairying industry and the pig industry in this country.  If there is no future for great branches of Irish agriculture, how are we to live, what future is there for industry generally, to what are we to turn our hands?</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to our external trade.  Deputy O'Sullivan has referred to it also.  He has drawn the attention of the House to the Minister's reference to the importance of our external trade.  It is true that the basis of our economy is our ability to purchase and to import essential materials with our surplus agricultural production. In a complacent way the Government have permitted great branches of Irish agriculture to decay and completely to disappear so far as exports are concerned.  We have only cattle left.  Butter, bacon, live pigs, eggs, poultry, even mutton, for the last two years, have completely disappeared so far as exports are concerned.</P>
    <P>Is it not time to stop the rot?  What attempt has been made to stop the rot? In not a single sentence in the whole Budget statement has the Minister made reference to the necessity for stopping the rot.  It is an extraordinary thing that that rot should exist at a time when one would expect production from the land would reach <Col N="2428" /> peak levels.  Instead of that, there is a definite decline.  The Minister himself has admitted that.  He said the general volume of production in agriculture has not increased.  In fact, the Minister should have said that the general volume of agricultural production has definitely and very substantially decreased during the present administration. The subsidisation of industries is not enough.  The provision of largesse is no cure for an industry that is in a decaying condition.  It may be necessary to provide, for the time being, a subsidy that will help an industry; but surely it is only common sense to suggest that, side by side with that, the problem should be vigorously tackled, and that we should reorganise those industries if we believe that they have a future or that the exports from them will be advantageous to this country.  The Minister is right when he indicates that our exports must be watched in order to see that our position will be improved in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>What have the Government done about that?  The Minister has made no attempt to lift the curtain so far as future intentions are concerned.  He has made no reference to any provision about post-war planning or what our position is likely to be after this war. The Minister for Local Government went down to my constituency a few weeks ago to open some new houses in Kildare town and he envisaged a post-war condition when we would have no export trade, either livestock or anything else.  What is the policy of the Government in that respect?  Was the Minister for Local Government right when he spoke in Kildare, or was the Minister for Finance right when, in the Dáil yesterday, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our major task for the moment in this sphere must be to pursue a policy which will leave us in the most favourable position for taking our part in the resumption of external trade and for accommodating ourselves, so far as it may be advisable, to any measures that may be devised in relation to the currencies of countries with which we have important economic relations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We know there are many essential <Col N="2429" /> articles that we must import&mdash;coal, steel, iron, petrol, kerosene, crude oil, raw materials for industries, industrial machinery, vehicles of all descriptions for road transport, tea, coffee, and other essentials of life.  We must continue to import these articles if we are to maintain decent standards in this country and they can be imported only by exchanging for them the commodities that we are in a position to export. So far as exportable goods are concerned, we are now exporting only cattle, and evidently the Government are quite complacent about that situation.</P>
    <P>I think the most dangerous aspect of all is the fact that the Taoiseach, the Minister and, indeed, the Fianna Fáil Party generally, have admitted that for us there is only one export market, and we have failed to supply our only customer, Great Britain, at a time when her people are desperately in need of food, when they have to face the perils of the Atlantic and the menace of the U-boats in order to provide their people with the food that they normally got from this country. One would expect that it would be the policy of our Government to strain every nerve and muscle in order to keep up our exports with Great Britain, so that in the post-war period we could say that they were damn glad to get our food during the period of the war and, in the circumstances, that we were best entitled to supply their markets in the post-war years.</P>
    <P>What measures are we taking to develop our trade and to be in a position to chip-in during the post-war years?  Take the pig industry as an example.  It may be advanced as an excuse that the raw material for the production of bacon disappeared when our imports of maize fell off.  Have any experiments been carried out in order to find an alternative?  Is there any home product that we could substitute for maize?  The Northern Ireland Government have carried out a series of experiments and they have shown that pigs can be profitably produced on a mixture of 75 per cent. of oats, 25 per cent. of potatoes, with a small amount of meat meal in order to provide proteins.  That experiment <Col N="2430" /> was referred to in the <i>British and Scottish Journal of Agriculture.</i></P>
    <P>We are simply letting the position slip between our fingers, as it were, and we have let a great industry almost die.  We are not able to provide 50 per cent of our own requirements of bacon.  As a matter of fact, before the summer is out rashers will be so expensive that they will appear only on the tables of the rich.  It is true that the Canadians have cut us in the matter of price.  We were not able to compete with them.  They foresaw a situation where their normal market for wheat would be interfered with by the U-boat blockade.  They decided to convert that wheat into bacon and they set out to supply the British breakfast table, and they were prepared to supply the bacon at a price below our cost of production.  Of course, we had bacon of a better quality, our bacon was worth more and, from the British point of view, the point had to be considered that, whatever bacon could be secured here, it would not involve any risk so far as men's lives and shipping were concerned.  Notwithstanding that, we found ourselves unable to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>As regards post-war conditions I believe, notwithstanding what the Minister for Agriculture may say, that when the war is over and we are facing a starving Europe, the Canadians will revert to their former position and will supply the finest wheat in the world, Manitoba wheat, to Europe.  I believe that in a large measure they will go out of bacon production.  The Danes will not be able to supply the British market.  Will we have a basic stock sufficient to meet the expanding trade? Do we intend to make any provision for that basic stock?  If the Minister for Agriculture is right, that there is no future for the pig industry, then we do not intend to make any provision. What attempt was made in this country, even before the war, to improve that industry, to make it comparable with the pig industry in other countries, to adopt modern methods and the new technique in the matter of production?  There was nothing done about it.  It seems an extraordinary state of affairs that, in a country <Col N="2431" /> always associated with pig production, we should permit it to decay and to die in a period when it should be in a healthy condition, in a period of high prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies, when discussing trade matters here some time ago, stated that our power to bargain was nil and the sooner Deputies made up their minds about it the better. That is a dreadful thing to say.  I do not believe the Minister's statement. I think we have more than one bargaining factor.  I pointed out on one occasion here that we can produce dairy stock second to none, that this is the only country where Great Britain can get dairy stock, and in that alone we hold a powerful bargaining factor. I say we should encourage our people to breed more of that stock that is now necessary for milk production in England.  The problem of restocking Europe when the war is over offers great possibilities to this country from the point of view of providing the essential basic stock.  It will probably take a decade to complete that work. No provision seems to have been made in that connection here and no thought has been given to the possibilities, so far as I can see, by any member of the Government.  Take the case of the Government's pet scheme&mdash;wheat.  We have there the extraordinary anomaly that the admixture fixed here for milling early in the year at 70 per cent. Irish wheat as against 30 per cent. imported has had to be reduced to 50 per cent., notwithstanding the very substantial increase in the acreage under wheat.  The position now is that we are only able to supply 50 per cent. of our wheat requirements.  That, I suggest, is a sad reflection on the work of the Department of Agriculture.  We have not got the results simply because no attempt was made to organise and harness our people in the work of production.  The failure to get results was referred to by the Minister for Supplies when speaking on his Vote. He spoke of the small quantity of wheat delivered to the mills despite the large acreage under the crop.  He tried to suggest that there had been <Col N="2432" /> some invisible drain on that wheat. He cannot say now that the pigs are eating it because the pigs have disappeared. The fact remains that the wheat was not produced, especially off the lands with substantial reserves of fertility that should have given the best results.  Production was not properly organised.  The equipment was not there to get production, and no effort is being made by the Government to secure it.</P>
    <P>I was speaking lately to a man who had been a distributing agent for Messrs.  Ford in this country and who, in the past, supplied many tractors in the Leinster counties.  He told me that he had been speaking to the manager of Messrs.  Ford at Dagenham&mdash;this man was formerly Ford's manager in Cork&mdash;and when he asked him what the chances were of sending over here a few hundred tractors he replied that there would be no difficulty in doing so.  He said that they had them and could supply them but, he added:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Your Government, in my opinion, have not made the necessary representation to secure the tractors and equipment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe that is right, that the Government have not tackled this problem of supply on the right lines.  I do not think that the policy of using the Civil Service as a channel to secure necessary requirements for our productive efforts is the right line of approach on this matter.  By adopting it we are never going to get results, nor will we be able to secure the things that are essential to efficient production.  Our Ministers should have the courage to go across themselves and make representations along the right lines.  If there is expansion in production here the people at the other side will get the benefit of it, after our own requirements have been satisfied.  I think that if they were approached on the right lines they would be found reasonable enough, and would release the necessary amount of essential equipment for an expansion in our production.  I suppose it is considered beneath the dignity of a Fianna Fáil Minister to make any approach along those lines. If that is the attitude of the Ministry <Col N="2433" /> generally, then the reference the Minister made in his Budget to the need for giving attention to an expansion in our exports was merely a pious wish, and there is no sincerity at all behind the Ministry in that regard.  There is no evidence of courage to face up to the situation that we find here.  If our export trade is as essential as the Minister for Finance suggested it is, and I agree with him that it is, then surely it is worth while making the effort to try to secure those essential requirements.  So far as I am concerned, I will continue to blame the Government while no effort is being made in that regard.</P>
    <P>So far as post-war production is concerned, and even so far as our present production is concerned, we should realise that if war has the effect of doing tremendous destruction to material it also has the effect of quickening the means of production and of invention.  It has had precisely that effect on British agriculture.  The expansion there has been enormous. There has been the greatest attention given to organisation and detail, to the provision of credit and other things, all of which are vital to the bloodstream of the industry.  They have got results.  British agriculture to-day is far more efficient than ever it was before.  It is probably the most highly mechanised agriculture in the world to-day.  As regards the Minister's reference to an expansion of exports, he must appreciate to-day that if we are not as efficient as the British farmer we cannot hope to compete against him.  We are using the same money and selling in the same market.  Our efficiency must, at least, be as great as his.  Possibly, it must be even higher than his because we have to try to provide him with those goods that he possibly finds it more difficult to provide for himself.  In my opinion no attention whatever has been given to our major industry.</P>
    <P>We must face the facts.  Normally, we should expect a prosperous and expanding industry when the level of prices is high and when the market is attractive to the producer.  What we find here is that production is contracting, and that the results are disappointing. <Col N="2434" /> That is not because our people are lazy or indifferent, but because the organisation that is essential for increased production is not there.  The Government have not given the attention necessary to ensure that our people are in a position to produce.  They thought that the making of a compulsory order was sufficient to ensure production and left it at that. They are sending officials through the country to compel men, by the threat of prosecution, to comply with their orders, ignoring the fact that those men are not equipped to do the work that is required of them, and that, financially, they are not in a position to perform efficiently what is required. The result is that we have not got the production we should have got.</P>
    <P>The record of the Government is a record of blundering along from day to day, a record of planning for to-morrow's breakfast.  There is no vision about their policy and there is no long-term planning.  They envisage no future.  There was no reference or suggestion by the Minister as to what provision should be made to secure better conditions or to expand production. In replying to the debate on the Vote on Account, the only thing the Minister could boast of was the largesse which he provides&mdash;the bolstering up of dying industries and what he thinks are fine social services such as the giving of doles and food and fuel vouchers.  There are many items in the financial statement&mdash;tables 2 and 3&mdash;that indicate a diseased condition of the body politic.  One may take as an example the potato situation. It seems an extraordinary anomaly that in a country like this we should be short of potatoes.  A country with 12,000,000 acres of arable land and with less than 3,000,000 people should have no difficulty in providing native foods for the population.</P>
    <P>What is the cause of the present crisis as regards potatoes?  We had a big surplus of potatoes last year, much of which had to be sold for a song to the alcohol factories, while hundreds and thousands of tons were permitted to rot in the pits.  The farmers, remembering that and knowing that the price early in the season <Col N="2435" /> was unattractive and unprofitable, fed the bulk of their potato crop to cattle &mdash;not to pigs.  I know many farmers who fed all their potatoes except what they required for household use to cattle.  That is what has brought about the present situation.  It is not because we did not produce enough potatoes that the present situation exists.  But there was no provision to ensure that a sufficient supply of potatoes would be available all the year round.</P>
    <P>Take the turf position.  The cost of turf here is prohibitive.  The fixed price is 64/- and, in addition, the State provides a subsidy of 23/6 per ton, making the cost 87/6.  To that must be added £600,000 which we vote to the Turf Development Board.  That puts the cost of turf in the neighbourhood of £5 10s. 0d. per ton.  When national turf costs £5 10s. 0d. per ton, there must be bad management and bad bungling on the part of the Minister's Department.  No attempt is made to encourage private enterprise. The political mind is at work all the time&mdash;the greater the number you have feeding out of the Taoiseach's hand the better for the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is the mentality which has brought about the unhealthy condition which exists in the country.  There is no indication of prosperity or improved conditions.  The future, with the present Administration in office, is difficult, dark and gloomy in the extreme.  The position regarding our exports in the post-war period is doubtful.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister's attitude to the producer is the right one.  In his heart, I think, he has no respect for the producer in rural Ireland. When replying to the debate on the Vote on Account, he had the discourtesy to tell me that I was always too near the pig's tail.  At least, I can claim to be a producer.  The Minister can claim to be only a parasite.  The most he ever produced was a lot of hot air.  I take it that that represents the Minister's general attitude to the producer.  His attitude to the producer and the farmer is one of contempt-they are too near the pig's tail.  If <Col N="2436" /> that is the mentality of the Ministry generally, God help agriculture.  There is only one hope of a more efficient and expanded agriculture, of better conditions and of prosperity and that is to get rid of the present Ministry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has, certainly, displayed a keen knowledge of conditions in the country by making no attempt to balance his Budget by further taxation.  He knows that the country cannot bear any more taxation. I agree that his policy of borrowing, during these days of emergency, when money is cheap, is a very proper one.  I do not propose to complain of the Government's expenditure. My complaint will be as to the way the money is expended, but I am going to ask them to expend more.  I suggest to the Minister that he should borrow more so as to relieve the very grave hardships that many thousands of our people are at present bearing. To relieve that hardship and to ease that situation, it might be a very wise policy to borrow.  Thousands of children in this city are suffering from serious malnutrition.  I do not know much about country life but I have seen children in our city streets and one would know by their little pale faces that they were not getting sufficient nourishing food.  They may be getting a certain type of food in sufficient quantities, but it is not of the nourishing class.  &ldquo;Get ready for the good days that approach.&rdquo;  That was the slogan used in somebody's election address in 1933.  If the Minister would borrow more to relieve the present hardships, people might get ready for the good days that approach and I, at least, would say &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; to him. Very many efforts have been made to ease the situation.  But I would ask the Minister, if it is possible, at a very early date to reduce the age for old age pensions to 65 years.  There are hundreds, if not thousands, of men and women between 65 and 70 who are eking out a very miserable existence and who have to apply to the relief authorities for assistance.  I am hopeful that when the new social reforms are introduced all these things will get consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2437" /> I understand the Minister intends to bring in a scheme of family allowances, a matter which was discussed in this House on a motion that has not yet been finally dealt with.  The family allowances scheme I believe will get the wholehearted support of every Deputy.  No Deputy, whether belonging to the Government or the Opposition, will claim any credit for something being done in that matter, because it is a scheme that will be accepted by all Parties who would like to be in the position of the Government to introduce family allowances. I hope that the rotten means test which is applied in connection with other allowances will be, if not abolished, at least considerably modified.  I hope the Minister will borrow more money to relieve the distress amongst the old people between 65 and 70 who are not getting any allowances and the children who are suffering for want of suitable nourishment and who are insufficiently clad.  Mothers are not in a position to buy clothing for these children at the prices demanded to-day. If we have to go through another winter with clothing prices as they are to-day, something will have to be done to relieve the situation.  I have seen schoolboys and girls between the ages of ten and 14 shivering in school from the cold and in some cases barefooted. As I mentioned before in this House, on a cold winter's day I saw a little girl wearing washed-out, thread-bare summer clothes and barefooted in a school within one minute's walk of O'Connell Street.  These things must be ended.  I believe that the Minister desires to end them if possible.  He knows Dublin as well as I do.  If it is possible for the Minister to bring about the relief that I have mentioned, I believe he will do it, and I earnestly appeal to him to do it. Within the past couple of months I have seen women and children very scantily clad.  A few weeks ago I visited a certain school with a young priest who was a member of the School Meals Committee.  In one class there we saw nine children out of 20 who were barefooted and cold.  I hope something will be done under the family allowances scheme to see that <Col N="2438" /> that state of affairs in Dublin and in the rest of Ireland will be brought to an end.  Any proposal of the Minister's to borrow money to spend on the relief of distress will have my wholehearted approval and I believe the approval of every other Deputy.</P>
    <P>A question was raised to-day, and has been raised as often as we could do it, on the condition of the blind pensioners in this city.  The blind pensioners draw 6/- per week from the Dublin Corporation.  If they get any money from the relief authorities, well and good.  If they can earn any money by any kind of work, they struggle hard to do it.  The Dublin Corporation passed a resolution to give them a 25 per cent. increase. Those of us who were interested in the matter at the time thought it would mean an increase of 25 per cent. of their total allowance, but subsequently it turned out, according to the legal advisers, that it was only 25 per cent. of 6/-, namely, 1/3.  That is over a year ago.  We have appealed to the Minister for Local Government time and again to permit us to pay that miserable 1/3 extra to the blind pensioners, but we were refused permission. Later the corporation asked the Minister to agree to a 4/- increase. The blind pensioners should not have to ask the corporation for 4/- or 5/- or 6/- or 7/-.  The Minister should decide what it takes to keep a blind man and his family&mdash;if he has a family&mdash;until the family reach an age when they can look after themselves.  The Minister should provide a suitable allowance out of some fund for that purpose, which will give them the reasonable comfort which anybody else who had his sight, and who is capable of working and looking after his family, would have.  There should not be any hardship imposed on them.  They should be well treated, because they are sightless, and incapable of providing for themselves and their families. The same thing applies to other people who may not be able to earn a living for themselves.  When the family allowances scheme is introduced, I appeal to the Minister to take all these things into consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2439" /> Then there is the question of the allowances for soldiers' wives, which are very miserable indeed.  When I pass through a working-class district wives of soldiers will stop me and say: &ldquo;What are you going to do for us in the Dáil to get us a decent increase in our allowance?  We cannot buy things at the prices asked for them. We cannot clothe our children.  It would be better if we had our men at home.  They would get something equally as good as they are getting now and there is a chance that they would get something better.&rdquo;  I appeal to the Minister to see that the allowances for soldiers' wives and children will be increased immediately so that the children will not have to bear further hardships.</P>
    <P>I had a question on the Order Paper to-day regarding retired officials. Recently, I met a couple of men of the type that I have referred to already, between 65 and 70.  They were retired postal workers, on a small allowance of about 18/- or 20/- per week.  They were retired in pre-emergency days, when their small allowance purchased at least double the amount of necessaries that it would purchase to-day. No member of the House will deny that foodstuffs have doubled in price within the past three or four years.  Those retired officials of the postal services got £1 per week pension as reasonable when they were 65 and their Minister was satisfied that it was a reasonable allowance.  Now the high cost of foodstuffs means that that 20/- per week is being reduced by at least 50 per cent., to 10/-.  This State should be more gracious to them, and I am sure the Minister will get the wholehearted support of the House and the people outside if he will increase their allowance, and let the money that he gives them purchase at least what it was thought it would purchase three or four years ago when the men came out. I make an earnest appeal on behalf of that type of State official, who is retired after giving 40 years' service. The increased cost of living, owing to the high prices charged&mdash;possibly because of production and handling&mdash; should be taken into consideration in <Col N="2440" /> such cases by the Government.  I would ask the Minister, in nearly every phrase, to borrow and borrow still more, in order to relieve these hardships.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, some members of the Labour Party and myself raised a question about the 50,000 to 100,000 men away in other lands earning their living.  Talking about post-war planning, what are we doing to absorb the 100,000 men when they come home? What will we do if demobilisation starts compulsorily?  I do hope it will not.  If men want to leave the Army voluntarily to take up employment, I would give them every opportunity, when the emergency is over, to do so.  But if compulsory mobilisation should start in the bad days, what provision are we making for those who will be thrown on the unemployment list?  One hundred thousand men went to other lands, and I think the Minister has admitted that they were all unemployed.  At least 50,000 are out of benefit if they come back to Ireland with a little money in their pocket&mdash; which probably will not last a month&mdash; and they are not eligible for national health benefits, unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  I ask the Minister to make some arrangement with the British Government, or those who are putting stamps on their cards now, or even that the Government themselves pay the contribution to the benefit fund, in order to leave them in benefit, so that, when the time comes, they will benefit under the national health, the unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Another matter was mentioned by myself and several other members of the House.  We know at the present moment that there are people trying to pay high rents on inadequate allowances and that unemployment is overtaking them.  Unfortunately, the unemployment has increased considerably in the last couple of weeks.  Taxi drivers and those employed in garages appear to be the latest victims.  I know it is a question of the petrol supply, and we are told that, if the petrol is not there, it cannot be given out, but I think the Minister ought to try to get some petrol, if it is possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2441" /> No one is going to say that it can be done.  We know the Minister's difficulty in that direction, but he should try to do something, knowing that it will ease unemployment or prevent further unemployment.</P>
    <P>I agree with members on the Fine Gael Bench who said that we have something to barter.  We should arrange more barter, and exchange the surplus goods which we have with our neighbours across the water, or across the Border, and not for paper money. There is paper money in plenty, so we should exchange our goods for goods which would be of some value, and should not allow any of our goods to leave without something that our own people require coming in in exchange.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, I put forward in this House a proposal that we should appoint a food controller.  We were told that we had a Minister for Supplies. I agree that we had a Minister for Supplies, but he had to deal with steel, iron, petrol, and other things, as well as food.  As I said two years ago, a food controller was essential, and time has proved that I was right.  A food controller, with nothing else to do, should look after the arranging of our food supply.  I hope it is not too late to do something now, and that we will read some day, in a very short period, that a food controller has been appointed.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, our potatoes, our butter, our sugar, the half ounce of tea.  All these things might be improved. I had a question on the Order Paper yesterday regarding the scarcity of potatoes and flake meal.  Flake meal is a very essential foodstuff for our Dublin people, and the Minister had to say that there was a scarcity of it, due to the fact that the oats was not there, or was not ready.  When flake meal will come in, I do not know. The people are in queues in the City of Dublin, looking for potatoes. Yesterday I asked the Minister if he would supply Army lorries, if it were a question of transport, to collect the potatoes and bring them here.  No matter what it cost the Army and no matter what petrol had to be used, the potatoes should be brought in to <Col N="2442" /> Dublin and sold at the lowest possible price.  In some areas they should not be sold at all; they should be given away for nothing.  There are areas in this city where people, on inadequate wages and inadequate allowances, may be supposed to be getting something because of the rationing system.  Oh, no; the price prevents them getting anything at all; the price is so high that their ration books are no good; and they are rationed in another way, because of the high prices.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to the Minister who, I know, would do something if it were possible.  I am only giving a reminder and assuring him that the House will give him its wholehearted support in the matter.  This morning, coming down Wexford Street into Aungier Street, I noticed there was a queue 50 yards long outside one green-grocer's shop.  Our people are very good humoured&mdash;good humoured enough to stop me and have a chat. They were all hoping, out of the small quantity of potatoes going into that shop, to get a quarter stone each&mdash; where each one of them needed eight times that quantity for the family.  A food controller would get busy immediately and see that any potatoes or flake meal or other nourishing foodstuffs in the country, which it is possible to bring into the city, would be brought in.  In the old days, we used to talk about &ldquo;bacon and potatoes and cabbage.&rdquo;  Bacon, potatoes and cabbage are great luxuries now, and beyond the reach of the people who used to exist on them in those days.</P>
    <P>I did not rise in any way as a harping critic of the Government nor to question the Minister's desire to do the right thing.  I want to emphasise that boys' suits, for youngsters of 10 to 14, should be produced, of a standard design, of different patterns of material&mdash;so long as they are warm &mdash;and ought to be available for about £1.  Some of the people will not know where to get the £1 but, at least, we would be making some attempt to clothe the children one sees in the streets.</P>
    <P>Any day of the week barefooted and poorly-clad children can be seen in O'Connell Street, outside the picture <Col N="2443" /> houses.  It is the position of these children we should have in mind. When family allowances are being considered the allowances made to soldiers' wives should be increased, and the means test should not be as rigidly enforced as it is in other cases. There is no allowance for children over 16 years of age, except they are going to school.  I know a man who worked at the North Wall whose daughter is a complete cripple.  She is a nice girl but is not capable of earning a living as, owing to her infirmity, nobody would employ her.  While the father worked at the docks and earned good wages he thought a great deal about his daughter's comfort.  He joined the Army and then found that the daughter, because she was over age, could not get the 4d. or 6d. a day allowed to dependents.  There may not be 100 cases of that kind in our Army but, as we have talked so much about freedom, people in that position should receive special consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget is just what the people expected.  Nobody was disappointed.  We did not expect that things could be any better because this Budget is really an accumulation of all the defects of the Budgets of the past ten years.  Taxation has increased steadily, and now borrowing has to be resorted to.  Borrowing has gone on at an increasing rate from year to year.  With all the increased taxation and increased borrowing it would be something if we had accomplished anything but, as Deputy Byrne and other Deputies pointed out, the object aimed at has not been accomplished. For instance, a scheme of family allowances, despite the high cost of living, has not been put into operation.  Many families are suffering at present.  Many other things might have been done, such as the derating of land, which was promised ten years ago, but which is not mentioned in this Budget.  Even if we have reached the limit of taxation, and have to borrow to make ends meet, it is a serious matter to have a shortage of essential services.  We have many social services but, in spite of that, we <Col N="2444" /> have also many people who could be producing and who could help their neighbours, who are now a burden on the country.  They could be enabled to keep themselves and their families in decency and comfort if work of a reproductive nature was available for them. The trouble about the whole situation is that the Government seem to have no capacity to make sound plans that would put people into employment and encourage production.  They would not ask advice from people who could help them.  As Deputy Morrissey pointed out, the unemployment problem is a serious one and the prospects in the future will be worse, when those who have left the country return. What plans have been made to deal with that position?  Ministers did not seek the co-operation of people who could be of assistance.  That problem will loom up very seriously in the future.  Whether we are approaching the end of the emergency or passing into the post-war period, nothing but difficulties seem to confront us.  It is a gloomy prospect.  The Minister should take the long view by trying to get all the co-operation and assistance that it is possible to get, and not depend upon the co-called Fianna Fáil plan that has proved a complete failure.  My advice to the Minister is to seek advice and co-operation from any quarter outside this House, or outside the Seanad, and amongst business and industrial representatives who could give much better advice than anyone in this House.  Anyone who could help should be invited to assist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Minister things are very serious.  Certainly, that could be seen from the tone of his statement. Many families are suffering severely because of the shortage of commodities. The poor must be suffering seriously.  The trouble is reflected in the Department of Supplies.  We recently discussed the Estimate of that Department and the Minister then stated that they received 20,000 letters daily.  If that was the position many of these were complaints about tea, sugar, flour, petrol and supplies of different kinds.  There are many people suffering who do not write to the Department as they think it is no <Col N="2445" /> use to do so.  If the 20,000 were multiplied by 20, we might have an idea of the number of complaints that could be made to the Department.  That is a terrible commentary upon a Department which is costing this State nearly £3,000,000.  A sum of £2,700,000 odd is estimated as the initial cost of that Department and I suppose we may expect Supplementary Estimates in the course of the year.  It is a reflection upon the manner in which that Department is being run and it shows that there is something wrong there.</P>
    <P>The same remarks apply to the Department of Agriculture.  These two Departments overlap in certain directions.  It is hard to say which is responsible for certain of the supplies of which we are short at present.  For instance, there is a shortage of manure, a shortage of sugar, a shortage of butter and a shortage of pigs and bacon.  Both Departments are more or less responsible for these supplies. On some occasions in this House when I refer to these matters while the Vote of one Department is being considered, I am told that the responsibility is that of the other Department.  I do not think that anybody could definitely draw a line of demarcation and say which Department really is responsible. I would say that both Departments are responsible, but whoever is responsible, one, or both Departments together, should try to clear up the muddle that has set in with regard to these supplies.  It is a terrible shame that in a country such as this there should be a shortage of sugar when we can grow such a large quantity of beet or that there should be a shortage of butter, pigs or potatoes.  It proves beyond doubt that there is something radically wrong in these Departments. There would be no shortage of anything if the men on the land were paid the cost of production plus a reasonable profit.  They have been demanding that year after year and the Minister for Agriculture has denied it to them.  Last year there was an abundance of potatoes in this country and I warned the Minister that, unless he allowed the people a reasonable price for pigs, the result would be a shortage of pigs and eventually a shortage <Col N="2446" /> of potatoes because when people would find that they could not feed potatoes profitably to pigs, they would not chance growing potatoes again lest they might find them lying on their hands as they did last year.  It was inevitable that this shortage should have arisen even if there had not been a bad season, because the people on the land, having in mind their experiences of last year, did not go in for such extensive production again, whereas if the Minister for Agriculture had acted as I suggested, to ensure that people who had produced some extra acres of potatoes on his advice could turn them to proper use at reasonable profit, it would have encouraged them to grow more potatoes last season and there would be no shortage such as we are experiencing at present.  The same observations apply to oats.  There was a price fixed for oats but no farmer could afford to sell oats at that price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall pass away from that, but I would say that these are very important points.  It seems to be the general policy of the Government to discourage agricultural production, but agriculture is our main industry.  I suggest that, at a time like this, in an emergency, agricultural production should be encouraged so as to ensure that our people may be fed. There should be no shortage of such necessaries of life as we can produce in abundance in our own country, commodities of which we should have a surplus for export.  Instead of that, we have not sufficient for ourselves.  Was <Col N="2447" /> a shortage of bacon ever previously known in the history of this country? We got the Pigs and Bacon Commission, but no pigs and bacon.  We have the commission, but we would prefer to have the pigs and bacon.</P>
      <P>I should like the Government to consider the difficult problems which are cropping up, and which unfortunately are growing worse and threatening to grow worse from year to year and day to day.  They should start planning for the immediate future, to try to relieve the present situation and to encourage the production of essential commodities to feed our people and to give employment to the people on the land.  There should also be long-term planning, because post-war planning is most essential at present.  Virtually, all countries are looking ahead and planning against the post-war period. It is most important that this country should also look ahead and prepare plans for the future.  Is any consideration being given to making arrangements for markets in post-war times? I am afraid that our Government is failing in its duty in regard to post-war planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various States of the Commonwealth, neutral countries and others, are all taking steps to provide for future trade and the exchange of essential commodities, but this country seems to be determined to proceed with the old discredited policy of self-sufficiency. I think the people now know&mdash;even if the Government does not &mdash;that we have to export certain commodities from this country in order that we may import the essential supplies to keep our industries going and to maintain a reasonable standard of living here.  Therefore, I think it is most important that the Government should, without any further delay, take some steps with regard to post-war planning.  I am sorry that I cannot congratulate the Minister on the Budget which he presented to the House.  I do congratulate him upon showing some appreciation of the difficulties and on speaking in a sensible manner, but he has not given <Col N="2448" /> any indication that the Government have any idea as to what they ought to do to improve the position.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete all words in lines 12, 13 and 14, and substitute the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where, before the net moneys due to the vendor in respect of the price payable under a sale order or a sale (superior interest) order have been paid to him, a State authority has sent to the company a certificate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A number of amendments here were down for the Committee Stage, and I asked the leave of the House to have them withdrawn and to bring them up on Report Stage, because I felt that they might want some dressing up. Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11 and 12 all deal with the one subject, incumbrances. It was explained here on the Committee Stage that when drawing up this Bill we did not follow exactly the lines of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, and neglected to put in this question of incumbrances.  The effect of those amendments will be, as I explained on the Committee Stage, that, before any money is paid over to any seller of property, any incumbrances or mortgages will first be cleared.  After that, any State debts will be cleared, and the remainder will go to the person selling the property.  We had some discussion on those amendments on the Committee Stage, and I think Deputies are probably clear as to the meaning of them.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>3.  In page 3, after line 29, at the end of Section 5 (1), to add the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of this sub-section the net moneys due to the vendor in respect of the price payable under a sale order or a sale (superior interest) order shall be taken to be a sum equal to the said price less&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  the amount required to satisfy incumbrances (if any), and</P>
    <P>(II)  the amount required to discharge any outgoings dischargeable by the vendor, and</P>
    <P>(III)  in case the said price was determined by arbitration under this Act and the arbitrator has directed the vendor to pay a sum towards the costs and expenses of the company in the arbitration proceedings or has directed the vendor to pay the said costs and expenses of the company as taxed by a taxing master of the High Court, the amount payable to the company under the direction.&rdquo;&mdash;(Minister for Agriculture.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 also deals with this matter.  Deputy Murphy raised the point here on Committee Stage that it would be possible for the Dairy Disposals Board, having purchased a given premises, to delay for a long time about paying over the money, that the person selling the property might need the money in the meantime, and that there should be some time limit put in.  This is putting in a limit of 30 days from the time the costs are <Col N="2450" /> taxed.  It is felt that that will be the last stage in the negotiations for sale; everything else will be cleared up, and the last thing that will happen is the taxing of costs.  Then, within 30 days, the money must be paid over.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The following amendments were agreed to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>6.  In page 5, before Section 9 (5), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(5)  Whenever the Minister proposes to make a sale Order in relation to any creamery premises and the chattels thereon, he shall not less than ten days before making the Order publish in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> notice of his intention to make such Order, and any person having any claim affecting the estate and interest of the vendor in such creamery premises or chattels by way of mortgage or otherwise, who has not later than seven days after the date of such publication furnished to the company particulars of his claim, shall be entitled to make representations to the Minister or, if the price to be paid for such creamery premises and chattels is to be determined by an arbitrator, the arbitrator in relation to the said price.&mdash; (Minister for Agriculture).</P>
    <P>7.  In page 5, line 29, to insert after the word &ldquo;Finance&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and after consideration of any representations in relation to the said price made under sub-section (5) of this section,&rdquo;.&mdash;(Minister for Agriculture).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete Section 9 (6) (b) (i), lines 33 to 37, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(i) the said price shall be determined by an arbitrator whose determination shall be final and the arbitrator shall be such person as may be agreed upon by the vendor and the company or, in default of agreement, an official arbitrator for the purposes of the Acquisition <Col N="2451" /> of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This point was also raised on the Committee Stage.  It was felt by a number of Deputies that the Minister, being interested in one side more than in the other&mdash;that is, being interested in the Dairy Disposals side rather than in the proprietors who at present hold those creameries&mdash;it was unfair that the Minister should appoint the arbitrator. I agreed that there was something in that point, and now I am providing that, if agreement is not reached between both parties, the arbitrator will be appointed under the usual procedure in cases like this under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919. Amendment No. 13 also deals with this matter.</P>

      <P>(b)  pay such person a gratuity, calculated at the rate of one-sixth of his present yearly earnings for each completed year of his employment by such creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2452" /> (2)  The expression &ldquo;suitable employment&rdquo; shall, for the purposes of the preceding sub-section, mean, in the case of a married man, employment within three miles of his usual place of residence.</P>
    <P>I have only to repeat that there are precedents for this already under different Acts.  In dealing with this matter previously, I omitted to mention the various Insurance Acts, where definite compensation was laid down for post office employees.  I hope that the Minister will reconsider his statement on the last stage of the Bill, and make provision for those displaced employees. This amendment asks that the company should provide or cause to be provided suitable employment at not less favourable terms for any displaced employee, or, if the company fails to offer suitable employment on the same terms, that they should pay the displaced employee a gratuity calculated at the rate of one-sixth of his present yearly earnings for each completed year of service.  Of course, &ldquo;suitable employment&rdquo; in the case of a married man should not be too far from his home; it should be within a distance of, say, three miles.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned on the last stage that this would mean eight or ten years' salary for an employee.  It would not mean any such thing.  Five years' salary is very little to offer to an employee with 30 years' service, who has reached the highest stage of his earnings, and who is deprived of his employment.  I am sure that, with the huge area which remains to be developed in West Cork, from Goleen to Drinagh and from Adrigole to Kealkil, there will be sufficient employment to be offered to the employees. We will have cases where there are two managers in one area, and in the case of a married man it would not suit him to go far away from his home. I think it is only right that provision should be made in those cases.  I press the Minister to make some more suitable provision&mdash;say one-sixth of the employee's present yearly earnings for each completed year of service&mdash;to be at least more generous, to be fair, as I hold that the method of assessing compensation under the 1927 Act, on <Col N="2453" /> the basis of a man's age irrespective of service, was an unfair method. Anything based on an age limit could not be fair in cases of men with many years of employment.  I think that system of assessing compensation for loss of employment was not a correct system and that a system based on years of service is the only just way in which displaced employees could be compensated.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a considerable amount of discussion on this point on the Committee Stage and I just want to put the position again as briefly as possible.  The 1927 scheme commenced by allowing compensation ranging from 13 weeks to 26 weeks of the salary or wages, as the case might be, of redundant workers in the industry at that time.  In other words, the maximum compensation anybody could get was a half year's salary. About 1934, a number of men&mdash;I think about 13 or 15 in all-made representations that they had not got any work from the time they lost their employment in 1927, 1928 or 1929.  At that time the Department of Finance agreed to give better compensation to managers and assistant managers.  It was found that these were the only men outstanding at the time because labourers and others had found employment of some kind or other.  The compensation agreed to was a year's salary for those under 50, a year and a half's salary for those between 50 and 60 and two years' salary for those over 60.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated on the Committee Stage that I thought we would succeed in having practically all the employees absorbed under the scheme now before the Dáil, and that if by any chance any managers, sub-managers or employees did not get employment, we would try to give them the most favourable compensation agreed to between 1927 and 1934.  That, in fact, would have meant for workers, other than managers and sub-managers, compensation ranging from three months' to six months' salary or wages, and for managers and sub-managers from 12 months' to two years' salary <Col N="2454" /> or wages.  Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Buckley have persisted in the attack, and I was reinforced in the meantime by what I considered to be a rather reasonable request from the Creamery Managers' Association.  That branch of the Creamery Managers' Association covering the districts of Charleville and Kilmallock, at a meeting on 16th April, passed a resolution &mdash;which was subsequently endorsed by a fuller meeting of creamery managers in Cork on the following day&mdash;requesting that compensation might be payable at the rate of one years' salary for each ten years of service, with a maximum of three years' salary by way of gratuity, if no suitable work could be found.</P>
    <P>In view of the persistence of the Deputies who moved this amendment, and in view of that resolution which I thought reasonable, I had further discussions with the Minister for Finance, and I am now prepared to agree to guarantee compensation to all redundant employees, that is, those employees who may prove to be redundant under this scheme, at the rate of one-twelfth of their yearly wages for each completed year of employment in the acquired premises.  This compensation will be paid only where the worker concerned has at least one year's service and where I am satisfied that alternative employment of an equivalent nature is not available.  The Minister for Agriculture must be the judge of whether alternative employment, if offered, is suitable or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a gratuity, so he may, if he wishes, get other work. This arrangement, in my opinion, is <Col N="2455" /> more favourable under present circumstances than what the creamery managers have requested.  The Creamery Managers' Association, it is true, asked for one-tenth.  I say that we will give one-twelfth, but the Creamery Managers' Association agreed that a limit of three years might be fixed.  If a man has 36 years' service, he would fare as well under the creamery managers' proposal as he will under mine, but if he has more than 36 years' service, he will fare better under my proposal.  I think those concerned will mainly be men with long service.  I have had letters on this subject generally from various people who are interested, but I have had letters which concern only three individuals, who have respectively 37 years', 38 years' and 46 years' service.  These three men will do better under my proposal than they would under the proposal of the Creamery Managers' Association.</P>

      <P>I got it from the secretary of the Creamery Managers' Association for the country.  He referred to a meeting of the Charleville and Kilmallock branch of the Irish Creamery Managers' Association, and said that the resolution had been endorsed by a fuller meeting of creamery managers in Cork the following day, and I take it that the meeting in Cork covered the greater part of the province.  I cannot say that definitely, but at any rate their request was for one-tenth, and I think we are meeting them fairly by the undertaking I am now giving, that where a person proves to be redundant, he will get one-twelfth of his retiring salary for each year of service.  There will be no limit of three years or anything else.  Take, for example, the person I mentioned <Col N="2456" /> with 46 years' service.  He would get almost four times his retiring yearly salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I think the number with under 36 years' service who will be redundant will be very few.  It is hard to be very definite.  I think there will not be many redundant and Deputies generally will agree that those who are redundant will likely be the older men.  I think that if you were to take the total number that would be redundant, you would find that more of them would be over 36 years' service than under.</P>

      <P>No, Sir, except that, <Col N="2458" /> on Fifth Stage, we should like the Minister to clarify the position that we were arguing on the Second Stage of the Bill as to the position of the Dairy Disposals Board.  Would the Minister give us some indication as to whether most of the creameries concerned will be handed over to the farmers' co-operative societies as soon as possible.  Take, for instance, the position of the creameries in West Cork, Limerick, Tipperary and Kerry; I am satisfied that the co-operative societies would be prepared to take them over.  Will the Minister undertake to facilitate the speedy taking over of these creameries?</P>

There is no organisation already existing for the marketing of milk there.  Will the Minister undertake to say that these areas, where no proprietary or co-operative creameries, or any other organisation, exist, will be the first to be organised, and that a market for milk will be provided as soon as possible?</P>

      <P>There are two of these creameries in County Limerick, and one in particular, about which the suppliers have a feeling that there is a danger of their being closed down.  I understand that no decision has been come to yet as to whether these creameries will be closed down or not, or whether some of them are redundant.  I raised this matter on the last occasion, but one of these creameries definitely is not redundant, and my suggestion is that that creamery should be handed over to the nearest co-operative society, as an auxiliary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this Bill passes through the House, surely the Minister will take advantage of the occasion to give the House some indication as to what the Dairy Disposals Board intends to do.  Of course, we do not know where the present Minister or his colleagues may stand as a result of the forthcoming election, but <Col N="2459" /> I understand that the Dairy Disposals Board is a semi-autonomous body, and I should like to know what is their present state of mind.  Do they regard themselves as a kind of an immortal body that will never die, or do they regard themselves as a transient body? If they are able to make up their minds on that question, and if they are going to survive, then I think that they ought to adapt themselves to the new role, but I suggest that if they are going to survive indefinitely, it would be better for the Minister, instead of introducing little Bills now and again, to remedy some crisis that has arisen in West Cork, Kerry, Tipperary or Limerick, to take steps to make solvent the whole dairying industry in those areas.  If that is the intention, I suggest that the amalgamation of small creameries is not enough, and that the elementary fact should be brought to the attention of the grassland farmers that you cannot operate a dairying industry successfully with a 200-gallon cow.  An endeavour should be made to persuade such farmers to go in for the 500- or 600-gallon cow, with a view to maintaining a proper milk yield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may have noticed a speech in to-day's papers by Father Coyne, the chairman of the I.A.O.S., in which he said that the production of butter has dwindled in this country during the last six or seven years.  Now, anybody who has been scraping butter on his bread in the last few months must be well aware of that fact, and surely the Minister must be aware of it. Surely, also, the extremely able men who constitute the Dairy Disposals Board must also be aware of that fact, and must know that it is a problem of major importance.  Are they, then, going just to shuffle along and expect doles from the Exchequer in order to patch the ship, so to speak?  I do not think that there should be any necessity for this ship to sink at all.  I think that if it were steered properly, it would go all right, but as things are at the moment we are heading for destruction. There is, however, always a group of men from West Cork, Kerry, Tipperary, Limerick, and so <Col N="2460" /> on, who are on the <i>qui vive</i> to jump on anyone who would dare to suggest that there is any reform required in the operation of the creameries of the country.  That is merely sticking their heads in the sand.  Reforms in the operation of the creameries are urgently required.  Reforms in the whole method of carrying on the dairying industry are urgently required if the dairying industry is to survive. No amount of doles from public funds will keep the dairying industry in existence if the dairying industry does not do its own work.  It is not doing its own work if it is trying to feed cattle on fields of weeds.  Everybody in this country knows that a great deal of the pasture land on which milch cattle are fed in summer in the south of Ireland is badly in need of re-seeding and rehabilitation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair thinks this is irrelevant, I am quite prepared to abandon it, but the Dairy Disposals Board is there and this is a Bill further to prop up the Dairy Disposals Board and to make it more important in the dairying industry.  I want to know what it intends to do.  Is it just going to go on &ldquo;futhering&rdquo; around, <Col N="2461" /> or is it going to do something constructive, or is it going to die?  These are questions that the Minister seems profoundly reluctant to answer.  I think the Minister should get up boldly and say he is advised that the Dairy Disposals Board proposes to survive for ever and that it has a certain programme of action of a more comprehensive nature than coming into this Dáil looking for doles and subsidies; that it means to take the steps necessary to make the dairying industry self-supporting, if possible.  If it does that, I think there is a good deal to be said for allowing it to survive for ever and giving it wider powers and a more clearly defined function.  But, if it is not going to face that enterprise, then I cordially agree with Deputy Bennett and Deputy O'Donovan, that it ought to return the creameries to the co-operative societies throughout the country and go out of existence.  There is a great deal to be said for either of those courses but nothing at all to be said for the middle course of hanging suspended, like Mahomet's coffin, between heaven and earth, all of us watching it with eyes staring to see when it is going to fall down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us make up our minds what we are going to do.  I hope what I have said will wake Deputies to the necessity of making up their minds.  I have listened with most careful attention to the Deputies from West Cork, Limerick and Tipperary and I cannot find any one of them who will get up and say boldly what he really wants: does he want the Dairy Disposals Board to take over the creamery industry of the country, or, if he does not want that, does he want the Dairy Disposals Board to go out of existence and let the co-operative societies carry on themselves?  I know quite clearly what I want but, as the Ceann Comhairle has just said, what I want belongs to the Second Stage, not to the Fifth.  I cannot get out of the Cork and Limerick Deputies what they want&mdash;and that goes for Deputies from both sides of the House.  They will not tell us what they want and until they all make up their minds what they want and effectively pursue some recognisable line of policy, I am <Col N="2462" /> telling you, as I have often told you before, and have so often been vindicated by the event, that the creamery industry will continue to slither down the hill from one degree of degrading bankruptcy to the next.  Some of the best farmers in this country are engaged in the dairying industry and their collapse is largely due to the refusal of the Deputies in this House to face the facts.  It is a shame for Deputies who profess to represent these men that they are afraid to face it.</P>

We cannot.  I have no doubt it is making plenty of profits now, but you cannot start a war every 20 years to render the Deputy and his friends in West Cork solvent.  If the Deputy's creameries are making such loads of money as he describes, why has he to come to Dáil Eireann to ask the taxpayers to help to compensate the redundant employees?  I have a shrewd suspicion that you can sing whatever tune you like&mdash;at one time of poverty &mdash;and the Government has to pay your redundant employees compensation to which they are entitled&mdash;the next minute, you have so much money you do not know what to do with it. Between the two conditions the dairying industry will collapse.  It ought not to be allowed to collapse, because it can be put on its feet.  It can be made a profitable enterprise, and can be made to contribute something very important to the whole agricultural economy of this country.  Sooner or later you have to face it.</P>

    <P>All of you think that I am repetitious in continuing to harp upon this theme.  Deputies do not like to listen to me harping upon this theme.  The facts as I set them out are none the less true, and until Deputies come to realise that and are prepared to act upon the recognition of these facts, the perennial complaint of these counties will be heard in this House. There is no reason why these farmers, <Col N="2464" /> who should be prosperous and independent men, should be continually coming to Dáil Eireann for doles and subsidies.  It is the failure of the Minister, the failure of his advisers, and very largely the failures of the Deputies who represent these counties and who support the Fianna Fáil Ministry in this House, to do their job, that has resulted in leaving the creamery industry in that position.</P>
    <P>I hope and pray that after the next general election we will have a new Government to deal with that situation but, in the meantime, I repeat my question to the Minister, whatever Government is sitting in the Front Bench, what does the Dairy Disposals Board intend to do?  Are they going to live on for ever or are they going out of existence?  If they are going to live on for ever, what do they intend to do in regard to this industry?  If they intend to go out of existence, when will they go out of existence? The people who would be operating these creameries in the absence of the Dairy Disposals Board have a right to know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bennett asked a question about what the intention was with regard to those units that would be coming into the possession of the Dairy Disposals Board under this Bill. I mentioned here before, I think, although I do not claim that full consideration has been given to the matter yet, that units like, say, Kilmallock and Ballinascarty and those units in Kerry will pass over almost directly to the existing creameries. Whether the supply passes over or the premises, I could not say, but the supply, at any rate, will pass over to the creameries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The supply is the essential thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That answers also the question put by Deputy O Briain. I am not sure whether it is the supply that is going to be passed over, or whether some of the units will be kept open.  That is a question that will have to be considered more in detail when the time comes.  On the other hand, <Col N="2465" /> there are certain units in South Cork &mdash;Skibbereen, for example&mdash;which I think the Dairy Disposals Board will have to hold for some time, because there is a need for organisation in that whole area and they could not be passed over until that organisation is completed.  I do not know how long that organisation may take.</P>
      <P>That leads me to another question that was raised by Deputy Dillon.  He asked what is the intention of the Dairy Disposals Company.  I think what Deputy Dillon means by that is the board of the Dairy Disposals Company. The board is in a rather peculiar position.  The board of an ordinary company outside would be composed of shareholders, people with considerable interests in that company, and in that way the board of an ordinary company would not only carry on the business of the company from day to day, but would be largely responsible for deciding policy.  The board of the Dairy Disposals Company is in a different position.  The members of the board are only nominal shareholders, if anything.  The Minister for Agriculture is the shareholder in that company; he owns it and appoints a board to carry on the day to day business.  Policy has always to be decided by the Minister for Agriculture and whether it is advisable for the Dairy Disposals Company to be put on a permanent basis, or whether it should be wound up with the greatest dispatch, would be entirely a matter for the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The members of the board will carry on as long as they are asked to carry on, and they are not interfered with in any way in their ordinary business activities.  What they pay for milk, how they sell their butter, and where they get their supplies&mdash;all these are matters for the board and they are not interfered with in any way; but in the matter of taking over a new area, or selling an existing property, they are not empowered to do that without getting the authority of the Minister for Agriculture, and in these cases the Minister has, in turn, to get the sanction of the Minister for Finance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of the board have really a great deal of discretion. I should say that the board has practically as much discretion as an ordinary business board outside would have, as between one annual meeting and another.  You may take it that the Minister stands more or less in the position of shareholders at a meeting in regard to policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the members of the board authorise individuals to go to an area like Kilmallock, plough up a field there and seed it with seeds suitable for pasture as a kind of demonstration of what might be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of the board have done business in the way of providing manures for their suppliers on a favourable basis, and also providing lime.  They have tried to improve the pasture in some of the poorer areas that were developed, say, in West Kerry.  On the other hand, it is laid down as one of the instructions under which they are acting that any capital expenditure must be approved by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider it expedient to undertake such enterprises as that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not see any objection to it, if it were possible to carry it out.  With regard to the Dairy Disposals Board, I think the Dáil will have an opportunity, perhaps not before the election, but possibly during the coming year, of discussing its activities. There is a Bill being prepared in order to avoid any controversy that may arise.  The Minister for Agriculture, whoever he may be, will bring that Bill before the Dáil in the coming session, because it will be necessary, and there will be an opportunity of discussing the future of the Dairy Disposals Company.  I think it should prove to be a most interesting discussion. There is no doubt that very good arguments can be put up on both sides and the Dáil may have some difficulty <Col N="2467" /> in deciding whether the Dairy Disposals Company is going to be put on a temporary basis or whether it is going to be made more or less a permanent institution.</P>
      <P>Even if the Dáil decides it is to be put on a temporary basis, it will still be necessary to carry on for some years, because I do not think it will be possible to get co-operative societies to take over some of the units.  For instance, it will hardly be fair to ask co-operative societies to carry on those units that were set up in places like West Kerry, which were obviously going to be a non-paying proposition for some time.  I should like to say that they have done better than any estimate that was made.  That does not say, of course, that they could be put entirely on a paying basis from this onwards.  The Bill will give an opportunity for the type of discussion that Deputy Dillon would like to see.</P>
      <P>As regards another point raised here on the Second Stage, dealing with the accounts, since the last stage I have had the accounts made out in what is, I think, a rather intelligible form. Copies of these accounts will be found in the Library by any Deputy interested in finding out the present financial position of the Dairy Disposals Company.</P>
      <P>With regard to the larger question, which the Ceann Comhairle thought was hardly relevant, perhaps I should say something.  The wider aspect of the creamery industry is not being neglected.  The committee set up to deal with the planning of agriculture has taken the creamery industry as its first subject&mdash;the creamery industry in general and, of course, the cattle industry will go with that.  So far as my information goes, they should be in a position to present a report in the very near future.  I think they are already drafting it.  The report will deal with the whole subject of dairying, including, I expect, relevant questions such as pasture and other questions such as were raised here by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These Bills that come in from time <Col N="2468" /> to time hardly can be referred to as merely stop-gap Bills, because some of them have rather permanent tendencies and are of far-reaching importance. For instance, the Bill referred to by Deputy Dillon was brought in here in 1932 and it did undoubtedly have a very good effect because, even though our production of creamery butter is low now, it has not gone so low in the cycle of production since 1931.  I do not know whether we can deduce from the experience of 20 years that there is a never-ending series of cycles in this business, but it is rather strange that we had almost a similar cycle ten years ago.  In other words, the creamery production was high in 1926, 1927 and 1928, and it came to its lowest point in 1931.  Then it reached a high production in 1935, 1936 and 1937 and it came to its lowest point&mdash;I hope&mdash;in 1942.  If there is anything in the theory of cycles, we may be going to face an upward tendency.  I do not think there was any other point of importance raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That point is not covered by this Bill, but I think it is only reasonable to expect that if certain of those units are being handed over to a co-operative, that co-operative will be expected to organise the areas allocated to it.</P>

      <P>They cannot be compelled to under this Bill.  There is another piece of legislation which will be coming before the Dáil within the next year or two.  I refer to the Co-operative Bill which has been in process of drafting for well over 20 years.  That Bill will deal with the question that was raised by Deputy O'Sullivan.  It is only when it goes through that a co-operative society can get a definite area, and a guarantee that no other co-operative society can interfere with it in that area.  In return for the security it gets, an obligation should be <Col N="2469" /> put upon it to develop the area properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, I think, struck the right note in the first sentence of his Budget speech when he said that the task confronting him was not an enviable one.  After listening to part of this debate I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister.  A Budget of £40,000,000 is a terrible imposition on this country, especially when we see that our buying in the first three years of the war exceeded our selling, as far as visible transactions are concerned, by over £17,000,000.  It has been stated here that the £170,000,000 or £200,000,000 that we have in foreign securities are far from being gilt-edged.  Now, if they are not that, or if we lose a substantial portion of them, how are we going to meet the difference there <Col N="2470" /> is between our buying and selling in the last three years, a difference that is put down at £17,000,000, and if, on top of that, the Minister has to borrow more?  I think he has been taken to task for not budgeting to borrow still more.  In view of all that, one can endorse the words uttered by the Minister himself, that his task is not an enviable one.  The position is that we require £40,000,000 to keep the machinery of State moving in a country where production is gradually dwindling.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGovern and Deputy Hughes dealt with the Budget largely from the agricultural standpoint.  I was speaking recently to a man in the faculty of agriculture who has a first-class theoretical knowledge of farming.  In fact, his theoretical knowledge is so good that he can give one a practical demonstration of farming.  He knows his job.  We discussed the question from this angle. It is claimed that in 1942 we had 675,000 acres of land under wheat.  The Minister for Supplies, when speaking here on his Vote on the 14th April last, in referring to wheat said: &ldquo;I think the maximum quantity that we can now expect to receive from last year's harvest is 270,000 tons out of a crop of 675,000 acres.&rdquo;  That, I should say, represents about the worst farming in Europe.  It would not be a great crop to get 270,000 tons of wheat from half that area, or even to get 270,000 tons from 270,000 acres. The Minister's statement reveals a very serious situation.  It reveals this that productivity is contracting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to criticise or blame the Government for its policy last year or the year before now that it find itself confronted with a potato shortage. I am quite satisfied that the potato shortage is, in the main, due to local productivity which, in turn, due to a shortage of fertilisers.  Neither am I going to harp very much on artificials, though I am a very strong believer in them.  But let us face the facts.  We had not artificials last year and we have not got them now.  We really had not them during the first or second year of the war.  It will be till enough later to blame whomsoever <Col N="2471" /> blameworthy.  Let us face the fact that we have not got them.  The only manure we have is farmyard manure. It does not take an expert on farming to realise that the numbers of live stock are contracting.  The area under tillage has increased, but artificial manures have disappeared.  Therefore, the limitations on our agricultural productivity are the limitations on our manure supply.  What I most blame the Government for is for failing to pick out that important point and attend to it.  I do not believe in control&mdash;I suppose I am about the hardest-controlled man in the House&mdash;if it can be avoided, but more attention should have been given to procuring all the manures possible, making all the manures possible and conserving any good substitute in order to cultivate the land.</P>
    <P>I remember reading ten or 15 years ago an address by Signor Mussolini to Italian farmers.  He said, in effect: &ldquo;We want so much more wheat but the country cannot afford to put any more land under wheat.  It is up to you to increase the yield.  Any credit or manures you want, the State will provide.  We want one more quintal per hectare this year.&rdquo;  They met the following year and he congratulated the farmers on producing not one more quintal but two.  I think the Government should aim at that.  I am, I suppose, as practical a farmer as is knocking about.  My whole problem is to get manures and that is the problem of every farmer.  On that depends whether we can carry on or not.  Attention should be given to the live-stock population and live stock should be housed in the winter so as to collect all the manure possible.  I do not think that it is a great economy to divert straw from the manuring of land to industrial purposes.  There, again, you will have to strike a balance and see which is more important.  The man on the land and the man in the town must &ldquo;work in.&rdquo;  They are complementary to each other in the times through which we are passing.</P>
    <P>It is a shocking revelation that out of 675,000 acres of wheat&mdash;if we had such an area under wheat; it would <Col N="2472" /> be casting a reflection on our statistics to doubt that we had&mdash;there should be available for bread only 270,000 tons, which represents only four barrels to the acre.  No land will pay on that basis.  The State would have to subsidise production of that kind.  If the State did so, the citizens would have to pay the subsidy.  If you feed a dog on his own tail, the tail will disappear quickly and the procedure to which I have referred would be equivalent to feeding a dog on his own tail.  I hope to have an opportunity, before the dissolution, of having a discussion on agriculture with the Minister for Agriculture and to bring out that point.  It is dangerously important. Let us take that as the key and discuss the position from that angle.  What hope is there for this country, an agricultural country, getting out of debt if its fertility and productivity are reduced to that extent?  What about the millions spent on our Agricultural Department for over 40 years? I do not want to go back on history, but I am afraid that we are now paying for our neglect of agriculture from the setting up of this State in 1922 to 1937.  The fertility of the country had been raised by the increased use of artificials during the 30 years that preceded the Treaty.  That use reached its peak just before the war 1914-18. Land was growing meadows that never was able to grow meadows before. Pastures were improved by top-dressing. I knew the banks of the Shannon well at that time and there was a constant stream of steamers on the Shannon bringing artificials from Dublin to the harbours along the river.  The Great War made artificials scarce and, before things were righted, we had rumours of war and wars begat other little wars here.  That stopped the use of the artificials.  Then we had the depression in agriculture, due to the rush back to the gold standard in 1925.  The farmers ran into debt and were not able to buy artificials.  The depression continued until 1931 when Britain went off the gold standard.  That was followed by the economic war, so that the land of this country has been starved.</P>
    <P>Here we are with the fertility of our <Col N="2473" /> country very considerably reduced as compared with the time when we were boys.  The Minister remembers the &ldquo;cross of gold&rdquo; referred to by Arthur Griffith about 30 years ago.  Ireland, he held, stood crucified by Britain's over-taxation.  If the over-taxation were arranged in sovereigns, these sovereigns would stretch from Dublin to Galway and from Antrim to Cork. On that cross of gold, Ireland stood crucified, as Arthur Griffith contended. I wonder what would Arthur say if he saw his old friend, the present Minister for Finance, introducing a Budget for £40,000,000 in a country which has since become poorer.  That is a situation that does not call for election speeches but for serious thinking.  It is a time for sitting down and grappling with the problem.  I fail to see how there is any hope of our paying our way.</P>
    <P>As to the shortage of potatoes, that is inevitable.  This flippancy of blaming this Minister or that Minister, blaming shopkeepers, blaming farmers, blaming everybody will not produce potatoes.  There is one thing which will produce them, there is one thing which will avert famine, there is one thing which will preserve our neutrality and only one thing, and that is manure to retain the fertility of the land so as to give us sufficient food. I hope the Minister for Agriculture will pluck up courage&mdash;I am afraid he will not&mdash;to come in on this Budget debate and enlighten us as to this mystery about the wheat.  If I could not grow eight to ten barrels of wheat to the statute acre I would feel that I could not carry on.  The average for the country is a little better than four barrels.  If the individual cannot carry on, how can the country as a whole carry on?  That is what we are up against.</P>
    <P>We had an increase of tillage last year and it was natural to find more corn grown, more oats, wheat and barley, because once you roll your corn crop in the spring you can shut your gate until you take in the reaper or binder or whatever tackle you have to reap it.  You may have to pull up an odd thistle here and there.  You have <Col N="2474" /> not to put in manure.  You expect the residue from the previous crop to give the corn crop.  If you have to manure land which has been manured for a previous crop in order to give a wheat crop, the rotation and the general farming are not very sound.  You cannot grow potatoes without manure, but you can make some attempt at a corn crop.  That is the reason why you have a larger area under corn crops last year and less under potatoes.  I have not got statistics to justify my saying this&mdash;I do not know that anybody has&mdash; but I am satisfied that the yield from potatoes last year, owing to the fact that there was not sufficient nourishment for the crop, was less than the year before, that the yield of the year before was less than the previous year, and that this year the yield will be less still&mdash;all for the want of manure.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy relate the question of potatoes to the Budget?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is much difficulty in relating the &ldquo;Murphys&rdquo; or anything that means food or money or taxation in this country to the Budget.  The &ldquo;gentleman who pays the rent&rdquo; is now disappearing from the country.  All these are in very close relation with the family budget and the family budgets combine to make the national Budget.  The want of feeding stuffs has diminished pig production.  I heard Deputies saying here that potatoes were fed to pigs.  I agree that they were.  But it is not an economic proposition.  I suppose if you let a pig get fat enough and feed him with potatoes and a dressing of turnips he will have to put on some meat some time, but it is not an economic proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said three years ago in this House, and I repeat it, that a wrong policy was adopted and a wrong path taken the day the Government abandoned the white loaf.  We are eating the bran and pollard that should be turned into bacon, pork and milk, which in turn would keep up our live-stock population. The manure from that increased live-stock population would nourish and fertilise our land so as to keep up <Col N="2475" /> its productivity.  That is going down and the Budget is going up.  We want a Minister for Finance strong enough to say: &ldquo;Thus far and no further&rdquo;. The country cannot bear any more taxation.  The productivity of the country is going down and we must have less taxation if we are to carry on.  The Minister in his Budget speech I think foreshadows that.</P>
    <P>My purpose in dwelling on this is to emphasise the danger of an increasing debt and less income.  The Minister must relate the taxation that he wants to collect to milk, bacon, poultry, eggs and meat.  We are producing these in diminishing quantities.  It is a popular thing to come here and tell us all that must be done.  The nation collectively must observe the same principles that have to be observed in private business.  A private business has to be worked, developed and cared for out of its own means.  After all, the nation is only a multiplicity of private efforts. The collective effort of the whole must be on the same economic and business lines.  I suggest that this country is not now on economic lines.</P>
    <P>In striking the balance the Minister should have told us something about our foreign investments.  The country must balance its trade budget.  It must sell as much as it buys, just as an individual must pay his debts in order to be solvent.  The nation that does not sell as much as it buys is not paying its debts.  That visible adverse balance must have a set-off some other way in the invisible balance.  Our invisible income was our foreign investments. Those foreign investments are not so secure now: I know quite a lot of people who had investments in Britain and they have not been getting the dividends.  Those investments were not in any Government securities but in ordinary commercial shares in business undertakings in Britain.  If those have gone down, I do not know where there is any way of recouping those people, who have lost their all.</P>
    <P>We are in a very serious position with regard to transport.  I do not know how far it would be relevant to criticise transport administration in a general discussion such as this.  If <Col N="2476" /> there have been wastage and incompetence in any Department of State, it is in the Department of Supplies.  I wish I could speak of a constituent's business as I can speak of my own.  In a country where transport is the very life of the country and where we are curtailed in the energy to promote that transport, were I in charge of the Department, I would make it an offence for any mechanically-driven vehicle to travel empty if it could get a load of any kind.  Instead of that, I have been fined £90 because my vehicles took a load on a journey where they had to go empty to bring back a load.  I wish I could dissociate entirely the personal element from that and I would be very glad to be in a position to speak on a case of that kind where a constituent was concerned other than myself.</P>
    <P>We are short of petrol and of kerosene. Lorries are going the road, but they cannot bring fuel on the journey: they must go empty to bring back an agricultural load from the other end. A man is prosecuted for taking a load of fuel, to wit, nine tons per day, into the City of Dublin.  Why, Grangegorman would not suggest such a procedure. What is the sense of it? Tractors, using kerosene, are engaged on the land.  There is a curtailment of kerosene for the national emergency, for tilling the land, yet because a man who was using kerosene for agricultural purposes could serve a fuel, purpose as well, he is prosecuted.  Is there any wonder that there is a deficient Budget?  Is there any wonder that the country is going down, when incompetency like that is allowed full run here?</P>
    <P>There is a shortage in the revenue from kerosene and petrol, which shows that there is a very considerable shortage in the supply of these fuels. Yet, are we using them to the best advantage?  I should think the Minister for Finance should have something to say on this matter.  After all, he can get none of the bouquets: no Minister for Finance gets any of the bouquets going around for the Government; he will have to bear all the bricks, especially in times like these, He should see that the Departments <Col N="2477" /> controlling vital services&mdash;like the Department of Supplies&mdash;are, at least, competent.</P>
    <P>I am nearly 30 years farming in the County Dublin.  An old farmer told me, about the time I was starting, that no County Dublin farmer ever survived&mdash;and he said: &ldquo;I have this from my father&rdquo;, so it goes back about 100 years&mdash;who did not have his carts going in and coming from Dublin loaded both ways.  The Minister for Supplies is wiser even than that old man, or than 30 years' experience has taught me.  Again, I am sorry for having to introduce the personal note. I do not want to criticise him severely, as he is not here; but I hope that, if there is a change, whoever succeeds him will be less spiteful than he was.</P>
    <P>We have another funny Department called the Forestry Division.  The extraordinary thing about it is that, if a man cuts a tree on his own land, he is liable to prosecution and to a maximum fine of £5, under the Forestry Act, for cutting that tree without a permit; but a thief can come into a man's land, cut the tree and steal the timber, and take it away, and the Forestry Division will not prosecute him.  I do not think it is in the spirit of this debate to pursue that in any further detail.</P>
    <P>We have another beauty of a Department&mdash;the Censorship.  The Censor seems to arrogate to himself power to censor everything.  When the censorship was set up, the understanding was that anything that might interfere with, compromise or offend international relations would be censored, so as not to involve this country in complications with any other country. Surely, however, the limit is reached when an advertisement is censored, when everything that goes to the papers has to be sent to the Censorship Office.  I do not know how an election can be fought in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are working the country find great difficulty in understanding Government policy in those Departments that we have to deal with.  Again I come back to supplies. No petrol is being allowed out now.</P>

      <P>I suggest, with all respect, that if the people of this country are asked to put up £45,000,000 to finance this year, they have a right to put their difficulties to the Government, and ask them to have some regard to the business of those people who have to put up that money.  The Department of Supplies gets a big chunk of the money that is being asked for in the Budget.  That Department of Supplies will have to defend itself. I think no other Department in the State will be called upon to put up as big a defence as that Department. Before the Budget is passed, and before the Department of Supplies gets its share of the money we, who represent the people, will have something to say as to what return that Department is giving for what is being asked for it.  The Department of Supplies has petrol now but will not let it be distributed.  Why?  Because the Department wants to force people to fit gas producers.  I have a gas producer fitted to a car that I wanted for business purposes, but I would not get a permit to use it.  I am producing charcoal but I will not be allowed to use it.  Other people are in the same position. The Minister for Supplies has suddenly taken it into his head to withhold petrol and to say that gas producers must be fitted.  If the Minister were in the House now I would like to ask him how many gas producers are stored up ready for fitting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that it is the problem of paying our way and preparing for the post-war conditions referred to by Deputy Byrne that should now be under consideration by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister told us that he could not think of increasing income-tax because so much would be taken from a person's income that the incentive to private enterprise would be destroyed.  Deputy Byrne also asked the Minister why he could not borrow millions of money.  I would agree to borrow millions if there was a productive outlet for money at the present time.  I do not see that outlet. As other countries are considering post-war planning it is time that we gave it some consideration.  This is a good time to borrow from the <Col N="2479" /> point of view of getting cheap money. There is plenty of money in this country but nowhere to invest it. Materials are scarce.  In fact, materials are now far more important than money.  I do not see how money could be spent to advantage at present.  If the war ended suddenly I wonder what provision is being made to deal with the promise about bringing back the exiles.  Supposing the exiles returned and that the 100,000 people who went to Great Britain also returned, what provision is being made to find employment for them?  It is time that some planning was done in that respect.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I should like him to deal with the transport problem.  During the year the amount of money provided for in the Budget will have to be found.  Is the position secure as regards fuel for harvesting?  Have we sufficient petrol and sufficient kerosene to gather the harvest and to bring home the turf?  Will there be more economy during the year than was the case last year, or is petrol that has meant so much to our national life during the emergency going to be wasted by drawing turf from the Atlantic seaboard and then allowing the lorries to return empty?  Is it not possible to set up a business committee to form a clearing house so that goods could be taken back from the city to the country and delivered there?  Alternatively, can these lorries not be used within economic distances to feed the railways and thus save petrol on long journeys? If petrol will not be available the country should know how it is proposed to provide fuel for Dublin during the coming winter.  If fuel cannot be provided for Dublin, if business is curtailed, and if there is not sufficient electric power to run industries how will the £40 million odd that this Budget deals with be paid?</P>
    <P>In my opinion this is the most serious Budget that came before the Dáil since this State was set up.  I am afraid that a sufficiently serious view has not been taken generally of the present situation. A serious view will have to be <Col N="2480" /> taken if it is found that in and around Dublin, which contains a quarter of the population of Éire, there will not be sufficient transport to bring up fuel and food.  The potato crop around Dublin would not feed the city beyond September 1st, after which long distance transport would have to be used. If that long distance transport is not available we will be up against a terribly serious situation in Dublin City and County.</P>
    <P>As a representative of County Dublin who knows a good deal about the food problem and the fuel problem, as one who put 30,000 tons of fuel into Dublin last year but who was unable to put in any this year, I can say that it will be a terribly serious job to fuel Dublin if petrol and kerosene are short and coal is not plentiful.  All the coal coming in will be required at the Pigeon House to produce electric light and energy.  The Minister finds himself charged with the job of finding the money to finance the Estimates.  They are not of his making; he is just charged with his bit of the work and I think he has done well in the straitjacket in which he finds himself.  I think, however, it is due to the House and to the country that when he comes to reply to the criticisms of his Budget he will deal with the absence of facilities that are required to work the country&mdash;the shortage of materials and the shortage of equipment with which people find themselves confronted. Above all, if he is not able to reassure the country on the question of transport, he will want to go a little bit further than saying, in effect: &ldquo;I want £40,000,000 from you and you must give it to me.  I want to finance the services.&rdquo; If the people cannot carry on their business owing to lack of transport and various other things, the Minister knows that it will be necessary to explain to them what he will substitute for petrol, coal and electricity.  There is every evidence from the speeches we have heard from Ministers, and particularly from the Minister for Supplies a fortnight or three weeks ago, that the supply position is becoming more acute.  The potato crisis has arisen in Dublin since.  Bearing in mind all these facts, the Minister will require to go a little bit further than merely demanding <Col N="2481" /> £40,000,000 and will want to tell the people how they are to get it, particularly if the services which they require to enable them to carry on their business are held up for want of supplies.  Those supplies can only be procured by Government action.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have criticised the Minister and the Government and said that certain negotiations should have taken place, that the Government should have sent over some representative to treat with the British Government about certain matters.  I might feel inclined to say that too, but I am not going to say it, because if I knew as much about these things as the Minister perhaps I would not say it. After all, the Government has certain secrets and more inner knowledge in matters of this kind than a Deputy or an ordinary citizen.  I am satisfied that the Government on that score is perhaps doing its best, but I put it to the Minister, in conclusion, that its best in the light of the doleful picture painted here a fortnight ago by the Minister for Supplies is not good enough and that the Minister will require to say something more on this occasion than merely to come along and demand a further £40,000,000 in taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two or three points that I want to raise arising out of the Minister's speech. The first refers to that part of the Minister's statement in which he referred to the growth of the Civil Service.  I think he will find very few people in the country to agree with his statement that this country is not a bureaucracy.  Possibly it is because of the amount of interference which the Government has considered necessary to make in our day-to-day lives that that situation has arisen.  He followed that statement up by saying that policies are determined by Ministers and carried out by civil servants, but even the super-men we have as Ministers in this State could not possibly deal with all the things that they now have under their control.  These things must be left, to my mind, anyway, to civil servants and we have to all intents and purposes in many spheres a <Col N="2482" /> bureaucracy.  The Minister then went on to suggest that this is a situation that is likely to continue after the war, that Government interference will not decrease with the end of hostilities and that we shall continue to be controlled and regimented as we are to-day.  I think if that is a true picture of the future it is a very sorrowful one to look forward to.  There is, I think, very little doubt that most things would be much better done by private enterprise than through Government interference. Those of us who have suffered from Government interference in recent times must have been particularly struck by the slow movement, on the whole, of Government machinery&mdash;the fact that it is so hard to get anybody to take the initiative or to make an independent decision, whereas in the ordinary commercial concern these things are dealt with naturally day by day, every hour of the day.  Decisions are taken without safeguards which, doubtless, the system of the Civil Service requires.  I think the picture certainly that the Minister has drawn of continued Government interference is one to which we cannot look forward with any equanimity, and one which we should do all that we can to prevent from developing.  The figures show the terrific increase there has been in the personnel.  Apparently a large part of that is purely temporary and presumably will go at the end of the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point in the Minister's speech to which I wish to refer is that where the Minister says that we have all a close interest in the post-war outlook of other nations with regard to the monetary and the financial situation, particularly certain schemes. Presumably he refers to the schemes which have lately been formulated independently by the British and the American Governments or, at least, by persons deputed by these Governments to deal with them.  Those schemes were very similar and it may be that something on those lines will develop to deal with the situation which will arise in due course and to prevent the emergence of the appalling conditions which existed in 1929, 1930 and 1931 throughout the whole world.  The Minister says that we are concerned with those <Col N="2483" /> schemes or with whatever development may come from those schemes, and yet when questions were put down here about three weeks ago in regard to the conferences which have been or are about to be held on those matters the reply was that we had not been invited to attend those meetings and that we were not taking any steps to be included in those discussions. Surely it is difficult to reconcile the two statements, that we are interested in the outcome of those negotiations, but that we are not bothering about trying to attend them.</P>
    <P>On the question of excess profits tax and the hope for an eventual fall in the value of stocks, the Minister said he felt that when that position arose some provision would have to be made. There is, I think, another thing which the Minister should consider&mdash;it is of a somewhat similar nature&mdash;and that is that we are all, by force of circumstances at the moment, prevented from carrying out the normal repairs to our plant and machinery.  Therefore we are debarred from making a claim for those repairs in the computation of income tax.  The need for those repairs will naturally become greater as the years go by, and by the time the war is over the plant may be in such a condition that repair is out of the question, and that replacements will have to be effected.  I do not know whether the Minister is in a position to envisage any means of dealing with cases such as that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one further item to which I want to draw attention, and, in a way, I think it is the most astounding one of all. The Minister said towards the end of his speech: &ldquo;In the sphere of agricultural output it would seem that, notwithstanding compulsory tillage and high prices, the general volume of production has not altered much.&rdquo; That seems to me to be a matter which calls for a good deal more elaboration than was given by the Minister, because, as Deputy Hughes has already mentioned this evening, <Col N="2484" /> there has been a most remarkable increase in agricultural production across the water.  I do not remember the exact figures, but I have seen them recently, and they are almost unbelievable.  That particular country is suffering from the shortage of man power from which every country at war must suffer, and it does seem to me that, at the back of that terrific increase in production, there must be something which is being done by the Ministry of Agriculture, by the farmers themselves or by the county war agricultural committees.  Surely they must be applying some knowledge which it would be worth our while to get hold of, and to apply, with any necessary modifications, to our particular circumstances, so that we too may greatly increase our agricultural production.  On the part of those of us who live in towns and cities, I suppose there is no desire to see the prices of the primary products go any higher than they are at the moment.  At the same time, I am sure all of us would like to see the primary producers, the farmer and the farm labourer, receiving a higher reward for their labours than they get at the present moment.  But those two incompatibles can presumably only be made compatible by greatly increased production.  By greatly increased production it should be possible, without any increase in price, to give a higher reward to the farmer and the farm labourer, which in its turn would obviously be of benefit to the whole country. I think this is a very serious matter, and, while it does not come directly within the province of the Minister for Finance, it may be that, in his reply, he will have some words to say as to whether it is possible that any progress on those lines can be made.  Admittedly, we have certain difficulties which do not exist in Great Britain.  For instance, in that country I suppose there is not the same shortage of artificial manures.  At the same time, we have advantages which they do not possess, and it does seem to me that, when they have been able to effect such very great increases in production, it ought to be possible to learn something from them which would enable us to do the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is again this year in the happy position that it is not necessary to balance the Budget. How long that position will remain, how long the balancing of Budgets will remain universally unfashionable, it is difficult to know, but it is certainly a happy position for the Minister.  He has no longer to try to cut the cloth according to the measure.  He can simply permit expenditure and revenue to run on parallel lines, and if they do not coincide he can always fill the gap by borrowing.  The most serious feature of this Budget is not so much the sum which is being demanded from the taxpayers of this country as the fact that there is no evidence, so far as the ordinary citizen can learn, of any real value being offered to the community for this expenditure of £46,000,000.  It has been, I think, the custom of Ministers for Finance&mdash;I think the Minister referred to it also in his Budget speech&mdash;to compare national expenditure with national income.  He stated that that was a good yard-stick with which to assess his efforts.  It is not, however, an effective or efficient yard-stick.  As we know, national income can be varied according to the manner in which national expenditure is employed. For example, if a substantial portion of the amount demanded from the taxpayers were utilised for the purpose of increasing production, the production of food or of any other essential, it would have the effect of increasing the national income.  We are told that, as compared with this country, the national income of Great Britain has greatly increased.  How has the national income of Great Britain been increased but by the expenditure of moneys by the State on production, whether it is the production of implements of war or the essentials of peace?  Therefore, comparing national expenditure with national income is no guide to the Minister or to this House in regard to national finance.  The only safe guide is the volume of production within the country and, as we all know, the position at the present time is that production has not reached the level which the nation is entitled to demand.  When we see scores and even hundreds of respectable citizens of <Col N="2486" /> this city congregated around provision stores, endeavouring to secure potatoes for their family meals, it is surely a clear indication that the finances of the State are not being properly managed. In view of the fact that the Minister has left his seat and is not taking any notice, I will not continue to speak until he has resumed.  I do not think I should be expected to speak while the Minister is not paying any attention whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, I will continue. In his statement, the Minister said that, in the case of primary products, producers must turn from subsidies, guarantees, and other adventitious aids and concentrate on increasing production and efficiency.  This raises one of the biggest issues that could be raised in this country.  If the primary producer is to be denied any aid whatever in carrying on his production, the question naturally arises as to why should secondary producers be aided by the Government, by the taxpayers, in their production. Why should a distinction be made, as is here being made, between the primary producer and the secondary producer, between the farmer and the manufacturer?</P>
      <P>If it is the settled policy of the Government here and now to leave the primary producer completely at the mercy of whatever change or changes may take place in the level of prices for agricultural and primary products generally, while protecting the manufacturer, sheltering and guarding him against all such disadvantages, surely there is nothing facing this country but a steady and continued decline in agriculture. The fact that we have not here to-day an adequate supply of bacon, butter or potatoes is a clear indication that the agricultural industry has been neglected and starved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not blaming the present Government alone for this.  I believe that the trying position in which the <Col N="2487" /> ordinary food consumers are placed by reason of the shortage of essential foodstuffs is due to the neglect of agriculture not only by the present Government but by their predecessors.  Why was the primary producer left, in 1922 and 1923, to face and bear the full effects of the complete collapse in the world prices of agricultural products? Why was he left to produce, over the ten years during which the Cosgrave Government was in office, at prices which did not enable him to carry on production and make a profit?  Why was it that when the country, tired and sick of the Cosgrave administration, determined to make a change and when the present Government came into power, they continued their policy of neglect of the primary producer?</P>
    <P>Why was it that they not only allowed the farmer to bear the full effects of the still more depressed condition of world markets but imposed upon him the additional strain of carrying through an economic war with Great Britain, and why was it that, in addition to that, they compelled the farmer, while denying him the protection to which he was entitled, to bear the full cost of protecting the industrial producers?  That is the real cause of the decline which has taken place in the economic condition of the country during the past 20 years.  It is a matter which will not be allowed to rest upon the Minister's airy assertion that the primary producer will be left to fend for himself and to produce in competition with world market prices, while bearing the expense and cost of protecting our secondary industry and also of maintaining a very expensive administration.</P>
    <P>The Minister may assert that various aids, small subsidies of various kinds, are being given to agriculture by the general taxpayer, but so long as the agricultural worker is unable to earn by his work, no matter how skilled he may be, an income which compares with the income of the industrial worker, there can be no hope whatever that any intelligent man will continue to work on the land.  During the administration of the present Government, the number of men engaged in agriculture declined by 40,000.  That <Col N="2488" /> decline is certain to continue.  If we had the men with the knowledge of agriculture who have left this country, even since the beginning of the emergency, to work on the production of war material in Great Britain, we would not have a shortage of potatoes and other essential supplies at present.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the huge expansion in agricultural production in Great Britain.  That expansion has been brought about, I admit, by the employment of methods which are not entirely within our reach.  For example, the British farmer has at his disposal almost unlimited quantities of artificial fertilisers and, in addition to that, almost unlimited quantities of tractor fuel and other equipment necessary for intensive production.  We, in this country, however, had at least something which would enable us to expand production here, and that was a surplus of skilled agricultural workers who, by their labour, if employed on the land, could have substantially increased production to the extent of making this country self-sufficient, at least so far as the essential foodstuffs, such as bread, potatoes, butter and bacon were concerned.  We know that the food situation for the coming year, which ought to be the first consideration of a Government which costs this country £46,000,000, is alarming.</P>
    <P>At present we have a shortage of potatoes.  That may be got over in the course of a few months, but it will cause a very considerable amount of suffering to the people, and particularly the people in the towns.  Undoubtedly, it will cause great hardship to the poor people in the towns and cities.  Now, that is a suffering that could have been avoided if there had been any kind of intelligent direction as to agricultural policy in this country.</P>
    <P>Surely, in an emergency such as this, a Government should be strong enough and far-seeing enough to plan an entire scheme of production for the people, and to estimate accurately the number of acres of wheat, barley, oats, and so on, that would be necessary to feed our people, and to make the necessary provision to have that acreage grown.  They have failed to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2489" /> The Minister for Agriculture stated to-day that the shortage of potatoes was due to a reduction in yield. Surely, a Government, with the responsibility of feeding our people, and realising that the yield of harvests cannot always be relied upon to be satisfactory, should have made provision to enable the necessary acreage to be made available in order to provide for human and animal needs, even allowing for a deficiency in the yield. They should have left a sufficient margin to deal with such a deficiency.</P>
    <P>Contrast that attitude with the attitude of the British Government in regard to their farmers.  Realising how important and essential it is to provide food for their people, the British Government have made available a subsidy of £10 per acre so as to ensure that the nation's food supply will be safe.  Now, that would cost a considerable amount of money, and because it would cost a considerable amount of money, I have not condemned this Budget.  I have not condemned the Budget on account of the amount of money demanded, but because of the failure of the Government to increase the production of essential foods and, thereby, to increase the national income and national wealth, which would ensure safety and security for our people.  That is the strongest condemnation that could be brought against this Budget, in my opinion.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, may say that it has never been the fashion or the custom to protect agriculture: that the agricultural producer has always been left to take his chance in a world market, and that the fact that we produce a surplus makes it difficult to protect agriculture as against the protection that is afforded to the ordinary industrial manufacturer.  The industrial manufacturer is protected by means of tariffs, quotas, or other restrictions on imports.  I quite agree that in the case of agriculture the case is not entirely the same, but why should a primary producer be victimised simply because he produces a surplus?  Why should a man who produces a surplus of food, let us say, be forced to see his family go hungry <Col N="2490" /> simply because Providence has been kind and has provided a greater supply than the home market can consume? I think that that is a question to which the Minister should direct his attention.  If it is necessary, in order to maintain the level of prices of primary products&mdash;and in this connection I am dealing, not with with the present emergency, but with the conditions that must prevail in the post-war period&mdash;if it is necessary, in order to maintain a decent level of prices that will provide a decent level of income for the producer, then I think it would be in the national interest to give such protection to the primary producer as would tend to increase the national income because, after all, the national income is the sum total of the value of the products of the country.</P>
    <P>References have been made to inefficiency in agricultural production, to the fact that agricultural production has not increased in efficiency and that the output per man and per acre is not as high as the experts would like to see it.  How could agricultural production be efficient&mdash;how could the maximum amount be obtained from the land&mdash;when the farmer, year after year, during the last 20 years, had to face the most disastrous reductions in the prices of the commodities which he produced?  I have not been in the habit of referring to personal matters in this House, but personal matters have been referred to during the course of this debate.  For instance, Deputies have referred to things which happened in connection with their own businesses.</P>
    <P>Well, I have had the experience of helping to finance and establish a co-operative creamery.  One would imagine that nothing could be more desirable in this country than the establishment of a co-operative creamery for the efficient production of dairy produce.  That was in 1929, but during that and the following year butter prices collapsed, the creamery closed, and I found that I had lost completely all the capital that I had invested in that creamery and in the provision of cows to supply the creamery.  That is typical of what has <Col N="2491" /> been happening to the farmers, year after year, over the last 20 years, but then we have Deputies like Deputy Dillon, who know nothing about agriculture, getting up here and talking about the low milk-yield of cows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy Dillon intervened in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not, Sir.  I am only saying that Deputies in this debate have referred to the low production in agriculture and the low milk-yield of our cows, and I wish to say that I attribute that entirely to the instability and insecurity which prevailed in the agricultural industry over the last 20 years.  Stability of price is the first essential by which to bring about efficiency.  It is the first essential to bring about a reduction in profiteering prices.  So long as the prices of agricultural products fluctuate, there will always be ample opportunities for the profiteer or the speculator to make excessive profits at the expense both of the producer and the consumer, but when the prices are stabilised, then the profiteer is, to a great extent, eliminated.  The industrial manufacturer, so far as the home market is concerned, has been protected, and prices have been arranged so as to cover the cost of production, and where there is a surplus for export, prices are also regulated by subsidy.  I say that agricultural producers must be protected to the same extent as the industrial producer is protected.  When the Minister says he is not going to protect the primary producer, but is going to leave him to fend for himself, he is making a statement that will be challenged in this country and, when it is submitted to the people, that policy will be condemned in the very near future, because the fundamental object of the new Agricultural Party is to ensure that the prices for primary products shall be such as to enable the agricultural producer to pay his workers a decent wage, and to leave a reasonable margin of profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred, very properly, to the growing extent to which the <Col N="2492" /> State is interfering in the life of the community.  He suggested that that is a problem to which every Deputy should direct his attention.  I quite agree.  In a planned national economy it is essential that there should be central control of our entire economic system, control of imports, and control of exports.  The amount of foodstuffs for live stock imported will depend, in the post-war period, upon the price at which we can export agricultural products.  In the ordinary course of events there would be no case for importing raw materials for agriculture unless there was a reasonable prospect of re-exporting at a profit to the community. That is one of the matters over which central control must be exercised.</P>
    <P>The question arises whether the essential control ought to be exercised by Government Departments or by producers co-operatively organised.  I believe that the people who can best control the production and marketing of our primary products are the primary producers, co-operatively organised. I think events have proved that the practice of Departmental officials interfering and attempting to control the ordinary business affairs of the community has proved itself a complete failure.  No civil servant, no matter how efficient he may be in his own particular profession, can be regarded as competent to direct the primary producer or the businessman engaged in distribution.  He has not got the training or the mental outlook necessary for such direction.  It should, therefore, be the function of whatever Government is in office to ensure that all sections&mdash;those engaged in agriculture, industry, distribution, importation and exportation&mdash;should be organised so that they can control their own particular branch of this nation's activities.  That would eliminate to a great extent the unsatisfactory and inefficient control of those activities directly by the State.  We should then have a form of decentralisation which would give the people who are primarily concerned the control in their own industry to which they are entitled.  That is, in my opinion, the only way in which we can stem the <Col N="2493" /> expansion of State interference in the life of our people.</P>
    <P>The Minister congratulated himself upon the buoyancy of the revenue and referred to the revenue obtained from what he described as &ldquo;our little weaknesses&rdquo;. The Minister referred to the fact that the revenue from cigarettes has increased enormously, that the consumption has increased.  He attributed that increase to increased smoking amongst the fair sex.  The tendency at the present time is towards increased consumption of tobacco by women.  There is also every indication of a similar trend in regard to the consumption of alcoholic liquor.  It may be that, if the standard of consumption of alcoholic liquor by women reaches that of what used to be described as the stronger sex, the difficulties of the Minister for Finance in balancing the Budget will disappear completely and that the Budget will in fact be more than balanced.  Sooner or later, Governments in this country and Ministers for Finance will have to face up to the question of whether or not the Minister for Finance should be put in the position of being a monster preying upon the weaknesses of our people, and gloating over their degradation and ruin.  If the standard of consumption of alcoholic liquor amongst women should reach the present standard of consumption amongst men, we will have reached a stage of degradation in our national life and, apart from the economic considerations I have mentioned, the future of this country will be hopeless.  Sooner or later, Ministers for Finance will have to regard questions of this kind not merely from the financial standpoint but from the moral standpoint and from the standpoint of the best interests of the race.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to learn something from the mistakes that have made themselves apparent during this emergency.  I ask him to realise that the fact that we have fallen down on our job of supporting our population, supplying them with essential food stuffs and, to a great extent, with essential supplies of clothing and fuel, is due largely to neglect of the land. The land can provide not only food, but <Col N="2494" /> to a great extent raw materials for clothing, and it can also provide an adequate supply of fuel.  If the men who were driven out of this country by Government policy during the past 20 years, and particularly during the past three years, had been allowed to remain, were given financial assistance where necessary, and were encouraged to develop and expand primary production, our people would not be called upon to suffer the privations which they are now suffering.</P>
    <P>Therefore, let the Minister take this as his yard-stick to guide him in the future in his financial policy&mdash;that is, to see how far we are increasing and expanding the production of essential materials.  It does not matter so much how expenditure compares with national income; it does not matter so much whether the rate of expenditure is increasing or diminishing, if the standard of production goes on steadily increasing and if the standard of living is thereby steadily raised.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement, when he was introducing the Budget, revealed nothing and concealed nothing of which the House and the country were not already aware. His statement may truly be regarded as just another reminder of the ghastly failure of this Government's administration. Some of the views, even the less dismal ones, expressed by the Minister, are in striking contrast to the pre-election utterances of the Government Party on other occasions.  If we compare some of the statements made by the Minister on this occasion with the catch-cries displayed on the green posters&mdash;intended, of course, for green people&mdash;with which the country was plastered in 1938, 1937, 1933 and 1932, we will get an indication of how hopelessly the Government have failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without putting any great strain on our memories, we can remember when this Government promised work or maintenance for all; when they promised that they would create such a boom of prosperity here that not only would all our unemployed be absorbed into useful and productive employment, but that it would be necessary to search the towns and <Col N="2495" /> cities of America in order to bring back Irish emigrants to participate in the employment here, and to carry out the various schemes which the Government then had in mind.  I am sure it is a matter of great disappointment that no indication was given as to the steps that are to be taken to solve the many and varied problems with which the country is now confronted.  I do not see that it is worth anybody's while to take the Minister or the Government to task for any lack of plans for the post-war period.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly the Government have shown that at no stage since they came into office, not alone during the war period, but in the piping days of peace, were they able to solve even the ordinary problems of the country. During the past 18 months we have had shortages of essential foodstuffs in Dublin and in other cities and towns throughout the country.  If any person predicted such shortages of foodstuffs three or four years ago, I do not suppose anybody would have had any hesitation in recommending that person's committal to a mental hospital. Imagine having a shortage of milk, butter, bread, and, more recently, flake meal and potatoes!  The potato shortage existed for at least a fornight before any effort was made on the part of the Government or Ministers to offer an opinion or an explanation as to the cause.</P>
    <P>It is really an amazing situation that the Minister for Supplies, who apparently was responsible for the fixing of prices in so far as foodstuffs are concerned, seems not to have any responsibility in securing an equitable distribution of those foodstuffs in a city such as Dublin.  It seems extraordinary that it is found necessary to fix the price of potatoes at a figure which is 8d. a stone in excess of what potatoes can be purchased for in England.  It is unnecessary for me to dwell on the disastrous effects of these shortages on the health of the people generally, and of children in particular.  I am quite certain that if a survey of malnutrition was made in this country it would reveal an alarming situation.  If that survey were <Col N="2496" /> made, notwithstanding any opinion expressed by our financial experts as to the impossibility at this stage of introducing children's allowances, I am sure it would reveal a situation which would form an unanswerable argument in favour of the introduction of a scheme of allowances.  The greatest asset this country has is its children, the jewels and pearls of the nation.  If we fail to protect their health and to provide them with sufficient food, clothing and comforts to enable them to grow up into healthy citizens, we are guilty of a criminal act against the nation.</P>
    <P>The time is long overdue for a reorganisation of the medical services. The Government appears to be the last body in the country that ever thinks a change is necessary.  It cannot fail to be aware that in other countries, even in countries where the most conservative opinion exists in regard to reforms and changes in services such as the medical services, they are far ahead of us.  I do not think there is any doubt that within the next few years you will see established in England a State medical service.  There must be, and the sooner it comes the better, a drastic reorganisation of the medical services here.  That reorganisation can be brought about in such a way as to preserve the integrity and self-determination of the medical profession, at the same time providing adequate services for the people under State control.  I think it well that attention should be drawn to the very undesirable position that exists in Dublin in so far as hospital accommodation for sick people is concerned.</P>

      <P>The epidemic that exists in the city is due to the failure to provide money to carry out an immunisation <Col N="2498" /> scheme on a sufficiently extended scale.  The present epidemic has now been prevalent for some months and will continue for some further period, I understand.  If the fullest use had been made of the materials that have been in the hands of the authorities here for over ten years, materials for the immunisation of the population against diphtheria, the present epidemic would not have occurred.  In other countries, in a lesser period than ten years, where immunisation schemes have been carried out on a thorough basis, the disease has been completely eradicated.  It is true that the non-carrying out of a scheme on an extended basis here is due to mere obstinacy on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in refusing to pay the very modest fees requested by the dispensary medical officers.  Clearly, this scheme can never be properly and thoroughly operated if the dispensary medical officers and the Dublin City services are not availed of, as up to the present they have not been availed of.  That is one of the principal reasons why the present epidemic has been able to reach the dimensions which it has now assumed.</P>
      <P>There are many other matters to which I might refer, such as the shortage of fuel, the dislocation of transport and others of that kind, for all of which the Government have been largely responsible.  But as I feel, like most other members of the House, that this is the last occasion upon which the onerous responsibility of introducing a Budget will rest on the shoulders of the Minister for Finance, I think I may slow down my criticism of the Government.  From my interpretation of the general tone of the speeches in this debate, I think that that idea has also influenced the different speakers who have participated in the debate.  Deputy Norton said yesterday that the Government would get their walking papers very soon.  I hope they will go out with grace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that this Budget is being discussed calmly.  It is a tame Budget, but it is the Budget we expected.  Everybody knew that the <Col N="2499" /> gap between revenue and expenditure would be bridged by borrowing and that we would have no new taxation. We have now had 20 years of national Government&mdash;ten years by each of the principal Parties.  Therefore, we have a basis for comparison.  The national position and the economic position must be considered.  The national position is sound.  But what of the economic position?  There is cause for anxiety about that.</P>
      <P>There is something really wrong in that regard.  It will be necessary for the best elements in the country to tackle that problem and tackled it must be if we are not to be economically strangled.  The Minister and many others boast of the social services. Many of these social services are excellent&mdash;old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, pensions for the blind and the proposal regarding allowances for children.  But some of our social services are lop-sided and costly.  Far too much is expended on the Civil Service for running them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time we awoke to the realisation that the agricultural community are carrying too many idle persons on their shoulders.  We are doing our best to harness our rivers so as to provide power for the country.  It is time to harness our man-power so as to produce useful results for our people. Unfortunately, we have close on 100,000 persons idle, while between 70,000 and 80,000 have gone to work in England. Here we are floundering in a state bordering on bankruptcy when all these people should be working under State control and giving useful service to the people.  It is time to harness our young man-power.  No person, male or female, should be drawing State money without earning it.  Of course, it will be said that the financial system will not permit of these things being done.  If the financial system will not permit of our tackling these problems in the right way, I think that it should be changed or modified in some way to meet the needs of a nation which is economically dying.  A warning should be sounded at present, because things are not looking well.  An <Col N="2500" /> intensive tillage policy is being carried out and, at the same time, we are in economic danger.  That tillage policy should give every idle man work, and plenty of it.  Yet, we have not been able to provide work for our idle men. We cannot pay, we are told, the amount necessary to secure the production of our foodstuffs.  There is something wrong in the financial system which permits of that state of affairs.</P>
    <P>What this country needs is national unity&mdash;union of all men of good will to solve the problem, so as to provide work for our people in the land of their birth.  We have been tinkering with the Party system for 20 years and we have failed.  I do not blame either side.  We all have failed and I think the day is coming when we must cease bickering over small things and tackle the big problem before us.  The country is yearning for the old unity and the restoration of the Irish national spirit must come.  I was at a reunion of the Old Republican Army in the Gresham Hotel recently.  It was a happy reunion and it was pleasing to see those who had previously fought against one another meet at such a social function.  We decided to do all we could for unity, with a view to putting things, economic and national, in proper order.</P>

I do not care whether it is Deputy de Valera or Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy Norton who will unite the forces, it will be for the good of the country.  There is no use in having national freedom and economic strangulation. We can barely save the country by our united efforts.  Why not do the thing in the right way? Going out of this Parliament after ten years of office by each Government, we have the national position sound and the economic position dangerous.  Let us unite to solve the economic problem <Col N="2501" /> and make things secure for our generation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel quite satisfied with the comments that have been made on the Budget statement which I had the honour to put before the House yesterday. Deputies who have been in the House will, I think, agree with me that there was really very little discussion of the Budget.  Deputies who spoke here to-day, and at least one who spoke yesterday, found so little to criticise in the Budget that they decided it was safer to let the Budget alone.  I think I am not misrepresenting the position when I say that they thought the Minister for Finance was in so strong a position and had put so convincing a case before the House that there was little to be said in the way of criticism of the Budget or the Budgetary statement.  That is how I understand the absence of the usual type of critical comment that we have been used to here on Budgetary statements on the day of the Budget and the day or days following, when the discussion was carried on.</P>
      <P>I said yesterday in my statement that one thing we can be satisfied about, and I maintain that we should be satisfied about, was that our financial position here was sound.  Despite the fact that this year we will have to borrow and in some other recent years, especially since the emergency, we have had to borrow to balance our Budget, if we compare our position with any of the States in Europe, large or small, particularly with small States like this, or if we restrict it even further and say small neutral States, we find that the Budgetary situation here is as sound and solid as it is in any of these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly have to admit as Minister for Finance that the Budget, certainly in the pre-war financial sense, has not been balanced except by borrowing. But the ratio of the borrowing to the ratio of taxation for our annual expenditure is low, relatively speaking.  I am not suggesting that I want to see the ratio increased.  I should like to <Col N="2502" /> keep the ratio as low as possible.  That would be the wise and prudent financial course for any Minister for Finance to follow.  I do maintain, and I think there is general agreement on it&mdash; nobody has said a word against it, nobody has criticised it&mdash;that the ratio of borrowing here has not been more than this country should adopt.  All Parties and Deputies are of opinion, and so far as I have been able to find out, judging by the Press and popular opinion, it is generally accepted, that it would not be wise or prudent in present circumstances to ask the taxpayers to pay the full 100 per cent. of the cost of the services we have had to adopt here&mdash;the additional and costly services&mdash;owing to the emergency which has come upon us.</P>
    <P>I referred in my statement to the cost of the Army and the auxiliary defence forces.  It is five times as heavy as it was in the last pre-war year.  That is a very considerable addition to our financial burden.  Besides that, there is about £3,000,000 of additional financial provision that we have had to make because of the emergency. There is, therefore, more than £11,000,000 additional provision required this year over the last financial year before the war period.  Deputy Norton yesterday, and other Deputies to-day suggested that, even though we have provided millions of additional money for social services, we have not provided anything like sufficient.  I think the most soft-hearted, charitably-minded Deputy&mdash;it may be Deputy Byrne who spoke to-day, or perhaps Deputy Hickey&mdash;must realise that there is a limit to what this nation can do, a limit to our resources.</P>

I think we can show, with regard to social services, that we have in some respects done better than New Zealand. I had the pleasure and privilege of meeting the Prime Minister of New Zealand when he was on a hurried visit to this country.  I met him at the aerodrome. I was anxious to talk with him on the affairs of his country and the affairs of my own.  We had not very much time, but in the course of our trip from the aerodrome and back again to the aerodrome I showed him some of our housing schemes.  He asked me for some particulars as to the number, the cost, and the type of houses which I was able to show him, and he said: &ldquo;I wish we were able to do that in New Zealand.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>One matter that was stressed yesterday by Deputy Norton and to some extent by Deputy Cosgrave, and by other speakers here to-day, was the question of our failure to solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2504" /> Certainly, we have not solved that problem, but I would like to know from Deputy Norton or from Deputy Cosgrave or from any other Deputy who criticised us, what country has solved the unemployment problem. We have not, admittedly.  We have tried and we have gone through our industrial development policy.  We were going a good distance on the road to provide decent employment at good wages for additional thousands of people year by year.  Deputy Cosgrave pointed out that, in comparison with certain years when his Government was in office, our Government had failed to do as well in the provision of employment for new persons by bringing new persons into industry.</P>
    <P>One can take certain years and figures from certain types of statistics. Deputy Cosgrave took certain years and pointed out that, during those years, 11,400 persons per year were put into employment.  If we take the whole period of office of Deputy Cosgrave's Government and a similar number of years under this Government, that would give us one set of returns and show that one side or the other had achieved certain results.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave chose to select certain years that suited his argument and I am going to select certain years that suit my argument, and I think I am entitled to do so.  I find that, at the 31st December, 1931, the number of persons insured under the National Health Insurance Act was 436,249.  At the 31st December, 1939&mdash;just after the outbreak of war and before the economic situation here was very deeply affected&mdash;the number of insured had increased to 599,592.  In the eight-year period from 1931 to 1939, there was an increase of 163,343 in the number of those placed in insurable employment.</P>

The figures I have given show that 20,000 persons per year were put into insurable employment, and that compares well with the figures that Deputy Cosgrave chose to give us for the years which he selected.

      <P>The United States also has cured unemployment.  One of the things that President Roosevelt thought he was going to do, when he came into office, was to end unemployment. You have an example there, where the President and his Government spent thousands of millions of dollars in trying to end the unemployment that occurred in the United States after the big financial collapse of 1929.</P>

      <P>There was a period of years when the President of the United States and his Government were given every power that they asked for and unlimited money was placed at their disposal, yet what was the end of that experience?  Up to the year before America entered the war, they were almost as badly off as regards employment as before they started.</P>

      <P>I would like the Labour Party to realise that, as far as I can see, there is nothing like 100 per cent. employment to be got for our <Col N="2507" /> people, unless we adopt the system that is adopted elsewhere, unless we take people by the back of the neck and put them wherever we like, to do what we like and make them do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Every day and every week, we are being asked, as members of the Government, to take more and more control of the activities of this country, to centralise everything, and we are being asked to do these things by the Labour Party&mdash;all going in the direction of totalitarianism.</P>

      <P>The only places I see, from my experience as I look around, where there is a complete cessation of unemployment are the countries I referred to; and I do not think that Deputy Hickey, Deputy Norton or Deputy Davin want that system in operation here.  You can have that system. There is unemployment in rural areas. You can end it&mdash;Deputy Norton can end it&mdash;by going down to Kildare and organising the farmers on the system adopted in Russia.  I do not think he will do that, or that that is his intention; but I do not see any other way of achieving the 100 per cent. employment that the Labour Party is looking for in this country.  There cannot be <Col N="2508" /> 100 per cent. abolition of unemployment, unless you adopt methods of that kind&mdash;coercive methods&mdash;that this country will not stand for from any Party&mdash;Labour Party, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or anyone else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not solved it.  I believe we would have done so if we had had reasonable peace in this country during our first few years, but we were up to our necks in a fight for economic existence.  I am glad to say that we got the backing we did get from the Labour Party in that fight. They stood up well to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope your colleague the Minister for Local Government will remember that and will not be telling lies in Rathmines about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Every member of the Government knows it.  I am not talking of the ports.  I am talking of the economic war.  In the economic war the Labour Party certainly did give us backing, but we did not get backing from them for other aspects of our policy.  Perhaps it would be impossible to expect it.  We got it in the economic war.  As we were in the midst of that fight for a number of years it was made difficult for us&mdash;as we had powerful opposition from the Front Opposition Benches, with all their interests in the country, helping the enemy&mdash;to solve the big problem of unemployment. That fight was only over in 1938 when, after a few months, we were launched into the middle of this emergency, which has gradually but very effectively upset our economy and stopped the development of industry which was going on here successfully. It was gradually doing the job that we always intended it should do, in trying to bring about, on a good economic and financial basis, the development of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody here knows now that in present conditions it is not possible to <Col N="2509" /> develop our industries or to build houses.  I should like to see additional houses being built for our people every year.  I should like to see the schools to which Deputy Mulcahy refers on occasions, bad schools and crowded schools, abolished and new schools built.  Many other things require to be done, such as drainage and work of that kind which would give useful employment.  It is not money that is stopping us from doing them.  Many things require to be done, but we have not the materials or the supplies at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the cost of money?  That has something to do with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It has.  I have not time to develop all the arguments that I should like to develop in reply to a number of speeches that were made to-day and yesterday, but as we will have the Finance Bill next week, please God, I may have an opportunity to do so.  This Government has shown its anxiety to stimulate employment. It has tried to do that in a reasonable, but nevertheless progressive way.  The Budget has shown the extent to which this Government is prepared to go financially in developing this country.  Complaint has been made of how the cost of government has gone up.  The cost of government has certainly gone up, generally speaking, since we came into office, but where additional taxation has been put on the people for a variety of better services, the country realises that it has got good value for the extra money.  A number of suggestions were made, not to-day or yesterday, but on other occasions, concerning a variety of things that should have been done and on which a great deal more money should be spent.  There was a motion on the Order Paper <Col N="2510" /> recently asking for the absorption into useful employment at adequate remuneration of all adult citizens capable and willing to follow useful occupations.  I tried to get an estimate made of what that would cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Dillon was vice-president of the Fine Gael Party, he advocated the provision of family allowances.  He was not the first to advocate it in this House.  I think the Deputy thinks he was.  He did not set down any figures as to what the rate was to be or the cost until he left the Fine Gael Party, and then he proposed that there should be a family allowance of 5/- weekly and a national scale after that.  I think the Deputy suggested 5/- and that would cost us £9,000,000.</P>

      <P>I will only refer to one other item.  Deputy Norton, Deputy Hickey, Deputy Keyes and Deputy Corish have a motion on the Order Paper proposing that old age pensions at the rate of 20/- per week should be granted to persons over 65 years of age, and providing further that in computing the means of applicants under the old age pensions code any net income not exceeding £2 per week shall not be taken into account. They might let us know how much it would cost.  It would cost us £8,600,000 a year.</P>
