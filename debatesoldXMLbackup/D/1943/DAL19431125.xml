      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware of the anxiety and misgiving caused to the owners of private motor lorries by the reports of his speech of October 12th, 1943, which indicated that the privately owned lorry may soon have to go the way of the privately owned car; and if he will now allay such anxiety by confirming previous official statements which stated that vehicles, the owners of which are at present in receipt of a petrol allowance, may continue to operate if fitted with producer gas plant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that the statement made by me and quoted by the Deputy, if read in the context of my speech on October 12th, could have been misunderstood by owners of lorries fitted with gas producer equipment. The context of the speech concerned the increasing gravity of the petrol position and the reference was clearly to petrol-driven vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fitting permits, allowing the fitting of gas producer plants to commercial goods vehicles, are issued by my Department in respect of vehicles which&mdash;(a) are of an unladen weight of one ton and upwards; or (b) are less than one ton unladen weight and engaged on essential services for which a petrol allowance (other than a priming allowance) is available; (c) are in a good state of repair, suitable for the <Col N="260" /> fitting of gas producer plants, and in sound mechanical condition, a certificate to this effect being furnished by a qualified motor engineer; and (d) are used for the carriage of goods.</P>
    <P>A priming allowance of two gallons of petrol per vehicle per month in respect of each commercial goods vehicle fitted with a gas producer plant is, on application, allowed to an owner of such a vehicle who is not otherwise in receipt of a petrol allowance for such vehicles.</P>
    <P>The operation of motor vehicles complying with these conditions is allowed throughout the State without restriction.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state for the years 1941, 1942, and 1943 to date (a) the number of prosecutions instituted by his Department for offences under Emergency Powers Orders; (b) the number of convictions obtained; and (c) the number and cost of inspectors employed in the administration of such Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 409 prosecutions instituted by the Department of Supplies for offences against Emergency Powers Orders in 1941, 1,299 in 1942, and 2,572 from the 1st January to the 31st October, 1943.  Convictions were obtained during these periods in 263, 1,154, and 2,177 cases respectively. There were 18 inspectors employed in the Department on the 31st December, 1941, 62 on the 31st December, 1942, and 80 on the 31st October, 1943.  The cost of these inspectors was £5,345 in 1941, £22,580 in 1942, and £36,264 from the 1st January to 31st October, 1943.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that great inconvenience is caused to farmers and others in the locality as a result of no coal being made available to Fennelly's Mill, Garrymaddock, Stradbally, County Laoighis; if he is further aware that this mill engages in <Col N="261" /> the conversion of oats into oatmeal for human consumption; and, if so, if he will grant a permit for the purchase of coal in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In replies to recent similar questions, I have indicated that, in the present difficult circumstances in regard to coal supplies, I cannot see my way to make coal available generally to commission millers for the drying of grain.  The only exception is in the case of oats intended for conversion into oatmeal for human consumption, where it is satisfactorily established that the use of turf is impracticable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The schemes carried out by the Dun Laoghaire Corporation at Monkstown Farm and Templehill were not specially undertaken for the rehousing of persons displaced by operations under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  The scheme carried out it Monkstown Farm was divided into two sections&mdash;the first section consisting <Col N="262" /> of 146 houses was composed of houses with kitchen, parlour, three bedrooms and bathroom, with a circulating hot water system.  This type of house is above the general standard of houses provided under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and no contributions to loan charges are made by the State.  The houses are let at 15/- a week.  The second scheme of houses at Monkstown Farm consists of 172 houses and the scheme at Templehill, Blackrock, of 40 houses. These houses are of the four-roomed type and are let to persons who are unable to meet the full economic rent. In these cases the contributions to loan charges are payable at a rate not exceeding 33? per cent.  The rents are 10/6 (Monkstown Farm) and 12/6 (Templehill) a week and have been fixed by the corporation having full regard to the annual State contribution.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state in respect of the houses erected at (a) Monkstown Farm, and (b) Templehill, Blackrock, by Dun Laoghaire Borough Council (1) the contractors' average price per house, (2) the average all-in cost per house, (3) the rate of interest and terms in regard to repayment at which the money required for these schemes was borrowed, and (4) the extent and nature of the modifications regarding interest and terms of repayment made subsequently concerning these loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The contractors' average price per house in respect of 331 houses built by the Dun Laoghaire Corporation at Monkstown Farm was £471, and in respect of 40 houses at Templehill was £455 per house.  The average all-in cost per house in repect of these schemes was £507 and £471 respectively.  The rates of interest at which the loans for these schemes were obtained were 4?, 4¼ and 4½ per cent., repayable over 30-35 years.  I understand that an arrangement has been made to have the rate of interest reduced in all cases to 3½ per cent., but the reduction will not take effect until 1st March next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state how many acres of arable land are there in Eire; and whether, having regard to the progress and discoveries in other countries regarding the reclamation of land, any further acreage could be won back for cultivation if similar methods were adopted for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The arable acreage has not been precisely ascertained.  I am not clear to what work in other countries the Deputy is alluding but I would refer him to the Farm Improvements Scheme which has been in operation under my Department since 1940 and to the Land Reclamation Scheme which was in operation in the congested districts from 1931.  Under both schemes considerable areas have been reclaimed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could state the arable acreage for the last year for which he has it? The schemes I refer to were across the water where, apparently, land that never has been cultivated has been, under modern methods, brought under cultivation.  Does the Minister contemplate any such thing in this country, either now or in the post-war period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no exact information about the total arable acreage in the country, because our inspectors have only visited a small proportion of the farms in this country.  The arable acreage is somewhere between 10,000,000 and 12,000,000, probably nearer to 10,000,000, as far as we can calculate it.  With regard to the scheme of reclamation or bringing land into cultivation that the Deputy has in mind on the other side, that is precisely the sort of thing we have tried to have done under the farm improvements scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which this matter was before the House, the Minister pleaded that the season had not advanced to the stage at which a final survey might be made of the position.  I suggest that that period has now passed, and he should be in a position to make a final survey. May, I remind the Minister of the urgency of this matter, and the anxiety lest there might be a repetition of what happened in the late spring and the autumn of this year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not infer from my reply that nothing is being done.  I merely say that it is not advisable to discuss details at the moment, because it might be difficult to operate the scheme if the details were known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I should like to say that this is a Bill that can more suitably be discussed section by section in Committee rather than in the normal way on Second Reading.  The Bill is directed largely towards bringing the provisions dealing with county committees of agriculture into line with what has been enacted in the Local Government Act of 1941 regarding county councils, and in the Vocational Education Act dealing with Vocational Education Committees.</P>
      <P>The first point in the Bill deals with the travelling expenses of members of county committees of agriculture.  This matter has been dealt with so far under Section 18 of the Agriculture Act of 1931.  In that section it is laid down that there will have to be a minimum attendance of at least 50 per cent. for the year in order that a member may be eligible for the payment of travelling expenses.  It is also laid down there that the expenses will be 4d. per mile by rail, or 5d. per mile otherwise, one way only.  This Bill makes a change there and it lays down that reasonable expenses may be charged, as incurred, and, of course, they can be charged both ways, both to and from the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section has been introduced in order to recoup members any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur attending meetings of the county committee, whether they travel by rail or road.  It will be necessary to bring <Col N="269" /> in an amendment to this section on the Committee Stage.  One matter that was drawn to my attention, and to the attention of the Department, since the Bill was circulated, was the attendance of members at sub-committee meetings.  That does not appear to be covered by this section, and I intend to ask the Dáil to agree to an amendment on the Committee Stage which will cover attendances at meetings of sub-committees of the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the question of benefits under the schemes that are administered by the county committees of agriculture.  At the present time no member of a county committee, or his partner, including his wife, can benefit from any scheme administered by the county committee.  No member of the county council can benefit from any such scheme.  That is not equitable because, in the first place, a member of the county council has no influence whatever on the procedure of the county committee. If a member of the county council, for instance, has a premium bull there is no reason why he should not be permitted to keep that bull and benefit from the scheme.  Members of the county council will no longer be ineligible for any schemes administered by the county committees.</P>
    <P>This section goes farther than that, because it gives the Minister for Agriculture power to make certain exceptions either in a general way or in a particular way.  I will give the House some examples of what I have in mind. Take for instance the lime scheme. That is a scheme that every farmer ought to derive some benefit from. There is no reason why a member of the county committee should not get lime like everybody else, because there is enough lime for everybody, and the fact that he is a member of the county committee does not entitle him to any special treatment from any scheme of that kind.  Therefore, I think that members of the county committee should be exempted from the provision that would prevent them from sharing in the benefits of a scheme of that kind.</P>
    <P>Deputies may wonder why we are taking power to make exemptions in <Col N="270" /> particular cases.  One case that was put to me concerned a member who had a premium bull.  He had this bull for about a year and then became a member of the county committee. If that man accepted a nomination to become a member of the county committee he would have to get rid of the bull.  I do not see any reason why a man like that should be compelled to get rid of the bull if he was a desirable person on the county committee. Therefore, I think that an exception should be made in such cases.  I do not say that, in general, we would exempt members of the county committees in regard to the benefits of the premium bull scheme.  That might be bad for the reason that there is a certain amount of competition amongst farmers to get one of these bulls. Where there is that element of competition I do not think that we could allow members of the county committee to partake in the competition. In the case, however, that I have mentioned, of the man who had already got the beast, he had the choice either of declining membership of the county committee or, if he accepted it, of giving up the bull.  Apart from that, I should say that it is intended to continue those restrictions in general as regards premium bulls or other schemes administered by the county committees as well, of course, as in the case of contracts given out by the county committees.  It would not be legal to give a member of the county committee any contract that the county committee had the giving of. I think that covers all that I have to say on Section 3.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is necessary in order to implement Section 5.  Section 5 deals with the dissolution of county committees of agriculture for neglect of duty, etc.  The present position is that a committee cannot be dissolved unless the county council is first dissolved. That is not a desirable position.  It is a very cumbersome way of dissolving a county committee of agriculture that may be guilty of neglect, of malpractices or anything else.  In doing this we are only bringing this Bill into line with two other Acts that have already been passed: the Local <Col N="271" /> Government Act of 1941, and the Vocational Education Act of 1930. This power is already there as far as the county councils and the vocational committees are concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 6 regarding returns, information, etc., is similar to Section 84 in the Local Government Act of 1941. Section 7 is somewhat of an innovation. I do not know if there is any similar provision in the Local Government Act, or in the Vocational Education Act.  We in the Department of Agriculture find it necessary from time to time to hold conferences with various inspectors.  It is sometimes very desirable at these conferences to have the county instructors present so that they can speak for their counties. In addition, they can get, first-hand, the policy of the Department concerning any particular issue, as well as instructions for the carrying out of any schemes that may be considered.  On a few occasions in the past&mdash;not very often&mdash;we found that county committees refused permission to their county instructors to attend these conferences. The object of this section is to impose on the county committees the duty of allowing their officers to attend any conferences of that kind that may be called by the Department.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is similar to a provision already laid down in the Local Government Act, 1941, and in the Vocational Education Bill.  That is to say&mdash;there is an age limit for the retirement of officers.  It gives the Minister power to make the necessary regulations for the retirement of officers when they reach a certain age.  Section 9 deals with the suspension of officers of county committees of agriculture.  That is not very different from the power already given under the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, except in this way that in addition to suspending an officer we may compel him to hand up any papers or documents that he may have in his possession.</P>

      <P>In connection with the provision fixing an age for the retirement of officers, will the Minister say if that means different ages for different officers, or if it means <Col N="272" /> fixing an age in respect of a certain officer only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that different ages can be fixed for different classes of officers, and not, of course, for individual officers.  It would be a general rule.  There might, say, be a general rule made for county instructors and a general rule for secretaries to the county committees.  Section 10 deals with the removal of officers.  This is similar to the provision&mdash;Section 25 (4) &mdash;in the Local Government Act of 1941. That is to say that, where an officer is convicted of an offence, he may be removed from office.  Otherwise, he cannot be removed unless the procedure already there is resorted to&mdash;the holding of an inquiry and so on.  The only other section&mdash;Section 11&mdash;provides that this Bill is applicable to serving officers.  In case there might be any doubt that this Bill would apply only to officers recruited by the county committees after this Bill was passed, this section makes it clear that the provision will apply to officers at present serving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Department of Agriculture was first set up in this country its object was to impart to the agricultural community here technical knowledge, to promote a better and more efficient technique in agricultural methods, to provide and administer schemes financed out of State funds designed to secure better quality, greater numbers and a larger income from our live-stock industry and, in the case of our arable land, to provide better and more prolific varieties in roots, and a better cultivation of grasses.  The medium through which those schemes were to be administered and that knowledge imparted was the county committee. It is true that much has been done by the Department and by county committees all over the country in securing substantial improvements in our methods and a better technique in our operations, but, surveying the activities of the Department and the county committees over a great many years, it is significant that our total production has remained static, and <Col N="273" /> in fact in recent years, and even prior to tho emergency, our production has fallen.</P>
      <P>It seems a strange anomaly that, during a war period when everything is favourable, we should find ourselves in that situation.  Bearing in mind the statements which have been made, the modern scientific knowledge available and the results achieved by other countries, and taking into account our climatic conditions, our soil and our resources, no one can doubt that our potential, if properly, scientifically and efficiently worked, would secure for us better results than we are getting. One of the purposes of these committees, as the Minister pointed out, is to equip farmers with definite knowledge and to administer schemes advantageous to the live-stock industry and to agricultural activity generally.  I do not think we are getting results; I do not think we have succeeded, or are succeeding, in getting up-to-date knowledge back to the agricultural community. Knowledge with regard to recent discoveries of agricultural research workers has not been properly disseminated amongst our people.</P>

      <P>The Chair does not concur.  On an amending Bill the operations of any body set up under the main Act are not open for discussion, unless its operations are affected.

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take no exception to the provision under which the Minister takes power to hold a sworn inquiry into the work not only of officers of county committees, but the work of the committee as well.  I think it is sound and desirable that if a committee is not carrying out its duties properly and efficiently, its activities should be examined by way of sworn inquiry.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to sub-section (5) of Section 5, which sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister may from time to time by Order do all such things and make all such regulations as in his opinion shall be necessary for giving full effect to any Order made by him under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have similar provisions in other <Col N="275" /> enactments and we have, in fact, such a provision in the measure we were discussing yesterday and the day before, the Children's Allowances Bill, but the scope of it is there limited by a sub-section which says that no Order may be made under the section after the expiration of one year after the date of the passing of the Act.  It is not desirable that the House should give the unlimited powers to the Minister which he seeks in this section. Whatever provisions are necessary ought to be agreed on here and enacted, and if a provision of this sort is inserted, it simply means, if the House agrees, that the Minister is given absolute power to do what he likes in relation to the administration of this Bill.</P>
    <P>One can appreciate that unforeseen difficulties may arise in the administration of a Bill, and if a provision of this sort is not inserted, a Minister might have to come to the House again to secure the necessary powers, but surely the power should not be an unlimited power.  The House should, in my opinion, make the power available for a short period in order to get certain regulations into operation, but once they are under way, the law as set out in the Act should operate, and the Minister should not continue to enjoy unlimited powers over an unlimited period.  I, personally, take exception to that sub-section for that reason.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 8, which deals with the retirement of officers, Deputy W.T. Cosgrave has asked whether it is applicable to individual officers, and whether the Minister proposes to set retirement ages for individual officers or for classes of officers. I think it most desirable that we should be informed on that point, and, in my opinion, the retirement ages should be clearly set out in a schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>On Section 3&mdash;I agree with the Minister that it is a hardship on members of county councils and county committees to be excluded from enjoying the benefits of schemes; but, on the other hand, it is a dangerous provision, too. There is a danger that because a man <Col N="276" /> is in a privileged position he may by the exercise of his vote secure preferential treatment, and while it is necessary to eliminate any hardship, when the provision comes into operation it will have to be exercised with great caution and proper supervision. In my opinion, the Minister must ensure where such powers are exercised thas he will exercise control, and in fact decide whether a particular individual is entitled to enjoy any benefits under a scheme.  But as the law stands at present a man has often to suffer loss because he is serving on a county council or county committee of agriculture, and that is not desirable. In the case of premium bulls, for instance, you may find a member of a county council, or even a county committee, who is a most desirable person for keeping such an animal, precluded from keeping such an animal.  But then, again, he is in a rather invidious position, and public opinion cannot be ignored.  While everything might appear to be above board so tar as the allocation of a particular animal, or while the application of a particular scheme to a particular member of a committee might be <i>bona fide</i>, there is a danger that public opinion might think otherwise. I suppose that is the reason why the law as it stands denies the right to a member of such a committee to enjoy the benefits of any scheme administered under the committee of which he is a member.</P>
    <P>So far as travelling expenses are concerned, I think it is right and proper that this provision should be made.  If men are prepared to give their services in the administration of local affairs and, if you are to encourage the best men to give that service, at least they are entitled to get their travelling and out-of-pocket expenses. I do not think, in fact, there is any provision for out-of-pocket expenses. Will the Minister say whether there is any such provision?  In the section relating to travelling expenses the phrase occurs &ldquo;reasonably incurred&rdquo;. Will the Minister say who is to interpret the meaning of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;? Who is to decide whether the expenses are reasonable or not?  With the exception of the points I have raised, I think the Bill will be, to a <Col N="277" /> great extent, a non-contentious measure and that it is desirable that the Minister should get the power that he is seeking in the way of holding inquiries into the working, not only of officers of county committees, but county committees themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of this House, including myself, have been at times accused of actions that might bring the democratic institutions of this State into disrepute.  I hold that Section 2 of this Bill is calculated to do that. That section deals with the payment of members.  There seems to be an idea in this country that the individual who gives his services free to the State in any capacity is to be treated with contempt. From the experience we have had in regard to expenses in connection with county councils and other local authorities, I hold it is rather a joke that the servant is entitled to better treatment than the master; that the representatives of the taxpayers have to travel third class and get third class expenses, while the servant of the taxpayers, a civil servant, gets first class expenses.  There are persons attending the county committee of agriculture in Cork, for instance, who, when the committee meets at 12.30 p.m. on Saturday, have to start at 1 o'clock on Friday in order to get to that meeting. They have no way of returning on Saturday night or on Sunday and, therefore, have to go home on Monday. It is rather a joke to see such a person starting off on his trek with third class expenses and to see an official coming in from the same district first class, as well as getting his subsistence allowance for the night in town or his three nights in town, the other poor devil having to pay the price of his bed and meals out of his own pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is anything calculated to bring the democratic institutions of this State into disrepute, it is the glorifying of the servant and the lowering of the master, and that is what Section 2 of this Bill does.  I would rather not see any expenses paid than see that degrading of the representatives of the ratepayers or the taxpayers in comparison with the paid <Col N="278" /> official of the ratepayers or the taxpayers. I think bureaucracy has gone mad in this country.  The ordinary representative of the people, be he a member of this House or a member of any local authority duly elected by the people, is entitled at least to equal treatment in regard to salary, expenses and subsistence with any official or civil servant travelling on business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made inquiries and I am told by the Minister that this is to be on the same lines as the payment of expenses to members of a county council and other local authorities, and I am judging by the experience gained under the 1941 Act of the expenses paid to county councillors and members of other local bodies. There is no subsistence allowance whatever.  As I have said, I know members of our county committee of agriculture, and valuable members of it, who have to travel in that manner. They have to leave overnight and stay the night in the city and attend their meeting on the next day.  Under this Act as it stands at present, they cannot get any subsistence allowance while there, although the official attending the same meeting, at the instance of the Department of Agriculture, gets first-class travelling expenses and subsistence allowance at the rate of 17s. 6d. a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the individual who gives his services free, gratis and for nothing to a local authority, is entitled to, at least, equal treatment with the paid official of that body or of the State. Then, to add insult to injury, we find in sub-section (5) of Section 2 that if the person happens to miscalculate the mileage that he travels, if he says he travelled 52½ miles instead of 52 miles, he &ldquo;shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £50 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year.&rdquo;  This is rather a bitter joke. In contrast with that, we find in <Col N="279" /> Section 7 that the committee of agriculture are bound to allow their official to attend functions having a bearing on their work.  I have no objection to clauses (a) or (b), in regard to permission to attend conferences with officers of the Department or to attend for interviews at the offices of the Department, but we must permit them to attend at functions which they say have a bearing on their work, and we must pay them first class travelling expenses for going there and we must pay subsistence allowance, if they care to stay all night at the function.</P>
    <P>I have seen for the number of years that I have been here, gradually, step by step, the degradation of the representatives of the people, whether they are on local authorities or higher up, and the uplifting of their servants.  I have very definite objection to any legislation that tends to develop that position.  It was bad enough when the Payment of Members Act was brought in first, and when we got 4d. a mile for coming to the meeting and could walk home if we liked.  That was under the good old system that was first framed by the civil servants for the payment of expenses of those who were the representatives of the taxpayers and the ratepayers of this country.  In addition, if one did not attend 50 per cent. of the meetings, he got nothing at all. This Bill is an improvement on that. I admit that much, but it is still a very definite step in the degrading of the elected representatives on local authorities of the people of this country.  I object to it very definitely.</P>

I think the idea of asking duly elected representatives of the people here to degrade their colleagues who are members of local authorities is worse still.</P>

It is true that the approach of the bureaucracy to the rights of the elected representatives of the people has tended during the last ten years more and more to suggest that the elected representatives of the people are merely a nuisance and that the people who really matter are the permanent civil servants of the State. You will always find that if inspectors, as are provided under Section 7, are to travel on the business of the committee, every facility is to be provided and everyone expects that they will get first class expenses there and first class expenses back.  Nobody is to question that.  But, if an elected representative of the people has to travel from his home, 30 or 40 miles, once a month, to a meeting of the committee, he is held up to public odium if he asks for the price of the vehicle which is requisite to carry him to the meeting.

      <P>Deputy Corry, thick as he is, is quite right in drawing attention to the general principle that is enshrined in the provisions of the Bill in which the elected representatives' allowances are most strictly limited, whereas Section 7 of this Bill tries to leave the widest discretion to inspectors who are permanent civil servants.  I suggest we are entitled to look through the general bulk of legislation to question ourselves as to whether that is part of a system of conduct.  I say it is.</P>

      <P>Well, in regard to this Bill, I say this is no accident in this Bill; this is merely part of a studied system whereby the rights of permanent civil servants are held sacrosanct and the claims of elected representatives of the people are regarded as an intrusion, something to be viewed with suspicion and to be held up as an unreasonable demand upon the public.  I cordially agree with the simple man who has just gone out that that kind of thing is a real menace to democracy in this country.  What can we expect of someone who is of the earth, like the Deputy, but to find the natural reaction of simple democratic people against that kind of thing?  It is a healthy manifestation that the most elementary elements of our community should feel this natural indignation at the reflections cast upon the representatives of the people and the way in which they are being habitually compared unfavourably with the civil servants who are, in fact, their employees. There is nothing derogatory in describing a civil servant as an employee of the people: it is an honour to serve the people, either voluntarily or for pay; but this continual urge to treat the civil servants of the State as a privileged class and the elected representatives&mdash;who are, after all, the chosen governors of our people&mdash;as the persons entitled to very little respect either from the Government or from the community at large is wrong, is injurious and is n tendency that ought to be checked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer, to two parts of this Bill&mdash;Section 5 and, particularly, Section 11.  Section 5 confers upon the Minister powers of dissolution similar to those enjoyed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in regard to public bodies such as county councils, and boards of health when they were in existence.  Has not a lot of water flown under the bridge since that principle was first introduced into this House?  The present Leader of the Opposition was President of the Executive Council when a measure of that kind was first introduced, for the purpose of ending, the vagaries of a number of Fianna Fáil-controlled <Col N="283" /> county councils who abnegated their duties altogether and gave themselves over exclusively to dervish-dances on political questions.  The President of the Executive Council very properly took steps to enable the services to be carried on if the county councils refused to carry out their duties and were prepared instead to dance to the tune piped by Deputy de Valera, as he then was.  When that legislation was introduced here, not to dissolve county committees of agriculture, which are comparatively insigni&mdash; ficant bodies, the roars of Deputy Ryan, as he then was, Deputy MacEntee and Deputy de Valera, and the lamentations that this represented a complete-sabotage of all democratic institutions in this country, were pathetic to listen to.  Now, gradually, each one of these very Ministers, who used to make the welkin ring with protests against this new order, are claiming for themselves the right to do for, public bodies that which they described as an outrage on Christianity when it was suggested by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government some 12 or 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Government of to-day has suddenly discovered that it is necessary to take power to dissolve county committees of agriculture.  In all the stormy periods through which we passed&mdash;and some of them were very stormy&mdash;no other Government sought that power before in regard to the county committees, which were carrying on their work.  What is the reason now?  Observe the ground upon which the body can be dissolved.  Section 5 says that the committee can be dissolved if</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Minister is satisfied, after the holding of a local inquiry under Section 24 of the Principal Act, as amended by this Act, that the duties of a committee of agriculture for a county are not being duly and effectively discharged by such committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What does &ldquo;duly and effectively discharged&rdquo; mean?  Does it mean that any county committee of agriculture which does not agree with every folly <Col N="284" /> propounded by the present Minister for Agriculture is liable to be dissolved on the grounds that it is not duly and effectively discharging its duty?  If the members of an intelligent county committee of agriculture announced that they would take neither hand, act nor part in the Pigs and Bacon Commission four years ago when they started on their operations, which ultimately resulted in the complete destruction of the pigs and bacon industry in this country, they would have been dissolved on the ground that they did not duly and effectively discharge their duties.  They would have been perfectly right and the Minister would have been entirely wrong, as the Minister now knows; but it cost about £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 to teach the Minister that he was entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>Is it the desire of this House that a body of farmers and local experts in agriculture should be dissolved, simply because they come in conflict with the views held by the Minister for Agriculture of the day?  I think it is a very dangerous doctrine and, certainly, a principle to which I will not subscribe. I have had bitter experience in the past ten years of almost every major decision of policy taken by the present Minister for Agriculture; and any committee which had resisted it to the death would have fully and effectively discharged its duties.  I have not the slightest doubt that any committee which had done that would have been dissolved under that section, if the Minister had got that power.</P>
    <P>Section 11 says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The fact that an officer is in office at the date of the passing of this Act shall not be a ground for contending that the three immediately preceding sections of this Act do not apply in relation to such officer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The three immediately preceding sections are sections enabling the Minister to suspend, to remove or to fix an age limit in respect of officers in the service of a county committee of agriculture. The reason for this section is, evidently, that similar sections to 8, 9 and 10 were inserted in some other code.  When it was sought to apply <Col N="285" /> the provisions of those similar sections to an officer whose employment had begun before that Act was passed, that officer went to the High Court and the High Court very properly said: &ldquo;If, when you were a young man, you were offered conditions of employment, which you accepted and worked on to advanced age, believing you had all the rights and privileges provided for in the original conditions of employment stipulated when you took the job, it is unreasonable that the Minister or anybody else should have the right to break his side of the contract when you, by advancing years, are no longer in a position to take appropriate action by withdrawing from your side of the contract.&rdquo;  The High Court very properly added: &ldquo;Therefore, we rule that, whatever the Minister chooses to do about incoming officers, he will not have the right to alter the conditions of employment which he promised you when you first took on the job.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the kind of things that slip through this House without anyone caring very much about them, because no one cares to envisage what they mean.  Take a man who to-day is 58 years of age: 37 years ago that fellow could have become a doctcr, a lawyer, an engineer or an agricultural instructor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a politician.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Or, as Deputy Larkin says, a politician; or he could have become anything else.  In any case, he elected to spend whatever patrimony he had on qualifying himself to become an agricultural instructor and to take a job under certain conditions, which were stipulated for at that time.  He undertook to give of his best in the years that lay ahead, and his prospective employer undertook to pay him the salary agreed upon, to give him certain pension rights, certain fixity of tenure in his job and certain rights of appeal if there were any difference between him and his employer as to the propriety of his conduct during his tenure of office.  Now that man is 58, and it is much too late for him to become a doctor, a lawyer or an engineer, though perhaps not too late to become a politician; but, in any case, <Col N="286" /> he is debarred from making a new start in life.  At that stage of the man's life, the Minister says: &ldquo;I am going to alter all the terms of the contract of employment.  You have delivered your side of the contract, you have done your job honestly and well, you have carried out all the undertakings you made when employed 37 years ago; but, now that you are no longer able to take appropriate action against me if I break my side of the contract, I am going to break it; and I am going to force you, by Act of Parliament, to take whatever conditions I prescribe for you.  So far as these three sections of the Act are concerned, I will debar you from going to the High Court to get a determination as between the Minister, and the employee, as to whether that is a just course or not, because I am inserting a section which says:</P>
      <P>The fact that an officer is in office at the date of the passing of this Act shall not be a ground for contending that the three immediately preceding sections of this Act do not apply in relation to such officer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not suppose many people will suffer from that, but I am one of those who believe, with John Donne, once Dean of St. Paul's, I think, that &ldquo;where a question of injustice arises, never ask for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.&rdquo;  If one person is made the subject of manifest injustice, although we may not feel it at this moment, every one of us is similarly injured, not only inasmuch as we have spiritual affinity with him, but in a more practical and mundane sphere, because the injustice which we permit the Executive to do that individual may some day be quoted as a precedent to justify a similar injustice in our own case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very smallness of the issue makes it difficult to awaken Dáil Eireann to its significance.  People are inclined to say this is all fuss and bother over nothing, and perhaps these provisions will never be used. All I know is that, if they are used, it will be an injustice, and it is wrong tor this House to give the Executive statutory power to wreak injustice on <Col N="287" /> the humblest creature in the land.  It is wrong tor the House to pass an Act which closes the courts to some humble citizen who may desire to have the arbitration of the independent judiciary on his claims in contract, as opposed to those of the Executive.  I strongly oppose Section 11.  I do not think it ought to be in the Bill and I hope, before our deliberations are concluded, that we will succeed in getting it deleted.</P>
    <P>I want to recall to the House the rough-and-ready words of Deputy Corry.  They contain a great deal of sense.  Do not judge the book by the cover.  Anyone seeing Deputy Corry would be inclined to ignore him.  In his own ignorant way he has a good deal of commonsense, and it is wise to listen to him on fundamental matters of this kind.  I think in his own barbarous way he has spoken the truth and I commend his simple words to the careful attention of Deputies of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two objectionable features in the Bill to which I should like to refer.  Generally speaking, I think the Bill is intended to place the members of county committees of agriculture largely in the same position as are the employees, the servants, of those committees, subject to the control of the Minister.  If that control is properly exercised, I have no objection to the general purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is certainly a most objectionable feature in Section 3&mdash;in the powers given to the Minister under that section.  Section 3 deals with the disqualification for membership of committees of agriculture.  A person shall be disqualified, either to be elected or to sit as a member of a committee of agriculture, if he infringes against certain rules and regulations, one of the rules being, if he is concerned, by himself or his partner in any bargain or contract with such committee, by which he would gain something, by which he would participate in the profit of any such contract or bargain, or any work done under the authority of the committee. <Col N="288" /> It has been recognised, since the introduction of the local government code in this country, that a member of a local authority should not be in such a position.  I think the authorities went so far as to decide that a man who owned a premium bull was disqualified from being a member of a committee because he had an interest in connection with the bull in a contract with the local authority.</P>
    <P>That prohibition is distinctly recognised in the earlier part of the section. In fact, it is set out in Article 12 of the Schedule to the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order.  Sub-section (2) of Section 3 expressly disqualifies any person who, by himself or by his partner, is in a position to make a profit out of work done under the authority of the committee, of which he is a member.  In sub-section (3) we find that wherever the Minister so likes, he can make it perfectly legal for any member of the committee, by himself or his partner, to enter into a bargain with outside persons.  I will read for the Minister the particular clause to which I object:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2) of this section, a person shall not be disqualified for being elected or chosen or being a member of a committee of agriculture (a) by reason of his having by himself or his partner received or contracted to receive any benefits or advantages offered to the public in pursuance of agricultural schemes administered by such committee if the consent of the Minister to members of committees of agriculture receiving such benefits or advantages has been given....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is a most extraordinary clause to include in a Bill of this character.  I am not suggesting&mdash;and I am sure the Minister realises that&mdash; that the Minister would exercise such powers unfairly.  But we must remember that this is permanent legislation; it is part of our permanent code, and it amounts to this, that if we had a dishonest Minister for Agriculture, he is given express power to permit irregularities <Col N="289" /> which would otherwise deprive a member of the right to sit on the committee and to indulge in these practices with outside persons.  You have the principle which has been recognised since 1898, and never objected to in this House before, the principle that a member of a committee should not be in a position to make a bargain, because it might lead to all sorts of abuses.  Why the Minister should be given the power to help that sort of thing, I do not know.  I certainly would not like to have that included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another point I would like to refer to, and I think Deputy Hughes has already referred to it.  It concerns the last sub-section of Section 5.  I should like to repeat the protest which I have made here on practically every occasion when a Bill is introduced. Just consider the way all these Bills are drafted.  I do not know whether it is deliberate or otherwise, but gradually the right of members of the House to participate in the making of legislation is being taken away.  At the end of Section 5 it is set out that the Minister may, from time to time, by Order, do all such things and make all such regulations as in his opinion shall be necessary for giving full effect to any Order made by him under this section.  The effect of that is that we are giving a blank cheque to the Minister, who will be advised by his officials to do all sorts of things of which the House has no knowledge. That is in every Bill with which we deal.  These blank cheques are given, and the development of bureaucracy is the result.  I do not think that section should be adopted in that form. The powers given to the Minister should be defined more clearly.  For example, under Section 5 the powers given to the Minister refer only to the powers which he has under that particular section.  Under sub-section (1) of Section 5 the Minister can transfer ill the powers and duties to any body, person or persons.  It is left completely blank.  There may be some very good reason for that.  If, however, that is read with the greater powers that are given below in sub-section (5), it will be found that this House is surrendering all its rights to <Col N="290" /> legislate, and is handing them over to the Minister and the Department.  I object to the framing and to the contents of Section 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Corry that the unfortunate ratepayer and taxpayer are discriminated against in all circumstances.  The officials can travel in state, but hitherto the members of the county committees of agriculture were only allowed a miserable 4d. or 5d. a mile, for travelling expenses.  I suppose the reason for the differentiation was that the travelling expenses of the officials were paid out of taxation, while the expenses of members of the county committees of agriculture came out of the rates.  It is for the House to consider whether it should not be more generous in the amounts that it is prepared to allow to meet the travelling expenses of members of the local councils. The members of county committees of agriculture discharge onerous and responsible duties, and it is essential, especially during the emergency, that they should be facilitated in attending their meetings regularly and promptly.  This Bill presumably, is intended to provide a more generous scale of travelling expenses than that hitherto allowed.  The Minister, in the course of his introductory statement, said that the expenses to be allowed would only cover rail and road locomotion. I know perfectly well from experience that, in the past, the expenses of members of the county committees of agriculture were rigorously supervised.  I wonder if the Minister, under this Bill, intends to be more generous than he has been in the past. When the Minister mentioned road and rail locomotion, presumably he meant that the members of these bodies are to travel either by bus or by rail, but cases will arise where neither bus nor rail will be available for them.  In such cases, is the Minister prepared to sanction the expenses incurred by members in hiring motor cars to enable them to travel to a meeting?</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister's attitude in regard to the <Col N="291" /> payment of expenses is more generous than it has been in the past.  With regard to Section 3, it seems to me to be very loosely drafLed because in my view sub-sections (2) and (3) are mutually contradictory.  Sub-section (2) provides that:</P>
      <P>A person shall be disqualified for being elected or chosen or being a member of a committee of agriculture if he is concerned by himself or his partner in any bargain or contract entered into with such committee or participates by himself or his partner in the profit of any such bargain or contract or of any work done under the authority of such committee.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (a) of sub-section (3) says:</P>
      <P>by reason of his having by himself or his partner received or contracted to receive any benefits or advantages offered to the public in pursuance of agricultural schemes administered by such committee...</P>
      <P>The contracts to which the Minister refers in the previous sub-section arise out of these schemes embarked upon by county committees of agriculture. I am sure the Minister will agree that in these circumstances paragraph (a) needs to be amended in many important respects.  The county committees of agriculture can only administer a certain number of schemes, and it is under the terms and conditions laid down for these schemes that the contracts are given either to members of the committee or to people outside. While the Minister in sub-section (2) of Section 3 debars anybody having a contract with a county committee of agriculture from being a member of that committee, he actually contradicts himself, according to the wording of paragraph (a) of sub-section (3) and permits such a person to be a member of the county committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree absolutely with what is laid down in paragraph (a) of sub-section (3).  I hold, and always have held, that a member of a county committee of agriculture should <Col N="292" /> not be allowed to enjoy any of the benefits arising from the schemes administered by the committees, whether these be for premium bulls or anything else.  That was the rule in the past and I think it should be continued. For instance, an individual who is a member of the committee and who might not be a satisfactory man might hold a licence for an animal as prescribed by the regulations laid down by the Department.  Another man in the area, who might be more satisfactory, will naturally hesitate to apply for any of the benefits administered by the committee so long as this other man, who may be a neighbour of his, is enjoying that benefit.  Therefore, as long as the Minister is prepared to allow members of these committees to benefit by contracts and other facilities given by the committee he is opening the way for all kinds of inefficiency, and perhaps even worse.  I think the Minster is making a mistake in abandoning the regulations which have existed hitherto, namely, that no member of a county committee of agriculture should be allowed to enjoy the-benefits of the schemes administered by the committee.  In my view, in addition to these two sections being mutually contradictory in their terms, I think that if they are put into operation they will have a retrograde effect. The Minister should revise this section completely and restore the conditions which existed hitherto.</P>
      <P>Section 5 outlines the reasons for dissolving a county committee of agriculture. Sub-section (1) provides:</P>
      <P>the Minister may by Order dissolve such Committee and, as he may think fit, either order a new appointment to be made by the council of such county ...</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) provides:</P>
      <P>whenever the Minister makes an Order under this section dissolving a committee of agriculture, he may appoint such and so many persons as he should think fit to perform the duties of such committee, and may from time to time remove all or any such persons and appoint others in their place...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There, again, I submit these two sections <Col N="293" /> are contradictory.  In the first the Minister states that he may order a county council to appoint a new committee, while in sub-section (2) he ignores the county council altogether and takes power to himself to proceed to appoint such a committee.  Surely, it is not necessary to have these two sub-sections.  The Minister should delete either one or the other.  By virtue of the fact that the county council is the only body authorised to appoint such a committee, he should allow sub-section (1) to stand, and delete sub-section (2).  I think that if the Minister studies these two subsections carefully he will agree with me that there is a need for clarification. There are other sections of the Bill which, in my opinion, are also loosely drafted, and which will need careful revision in Committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to Section 11, and I agree with every word he said. It is moat unfair that an official who has served a county committee for 20, 30 or perhaps 35 years&mdash;I have one particular official in mind&mdash;and who expected that, when he retired, he would be entitled to certain benefits conferred on him by the previous Act, should now have to incur the risk of having these benefits altered or amended by this measure.  It may not be the intention of the Minister, I admit, to change the conditions of these men's employment in any way, but nevertheless this section gives him power to do so if he so desires, and so long as that section is in the Bill, it will create uneasiness, dissatisfaction and discontent amongst the officials of county committees who regarded themselves as safe and secure under the terms of the original Act. The Minister would be well advised to delete the section.  It is unnecessary from his point of view, because the Bill is concerned only with the payment of travelling expenses to members of county committees.  It appears to me to be quite unnecessary and irrelevant to embody such a section in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more than surprised to hear Deputy Roddy suggest that members of county committees should not get at least the same concessions as they, as legislators, so to <Col N="294" /> speak, are responsible for giving to others.  It must be remembered that these committees are, or at least should be, mainly made up of farmers, who in many cases make great sacrifices in attending the meetings.  They have to leave their businesses or their homes, as it is a 24-hour job, to attend the meetings, which they can ill-afford to do, but, according to Deputy Roddy, members of these committees should not benefit by such schemes as the lime scheme.  Take Galway, which is a great county in connection with this lime scheme.  If I require lime and if there is a surplus of lime available, am I to be debarred from getting it because I happen to be member of the county committee?  I think it is outrageous to make such a suggestion.</P>
      <P>I could understand it where members of committees may have a certain pull in relation to such matters as premium bulls and so on, and I suggest to the Minister that in any case where there is competition a member of such a committee should not qualify as an applicant; but in relation to the other schemes, I think it outrageous to suggest that members of these committees should be debarred from participation in these schemes, or should not be allowed to take advantage of the facilities which they make available to the outside public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with travelling expenses, the Minister speaks about &ldquo;reasonable travelling expenses.&rdquo;  Of course, &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; can mean quite a lot.  Am I to understand that it is to be on the same basis as that of the provision in the ease of county councillors and members of other bodies? Will it be something similar to that? If that is the case, as a member of a county council and a county committee, I must voice my feelings in direct, opposition because, on the one hand, it is most extravagant and, on the other, to the honest man it is niggardly.  For instance, one is supposed to travel by the cheapest mode of conveyance.  A man who is supposed to travel by bus may find the bus filled up or he may be late for the bus.  I am not suggesting that county councillors in my county do anything wrong, but if a man has the excuse that the bus was crowded or that he was late for it, <Col N="295" /> he can hire a car, which means 1/6 a mile each way, so that if the arrangement is to be the same as that applying to county councillors, it is most extravagant.</P>
    <P>The suggestion by the Galway County Committee, which is the No. 1 committee of Ireland, according to the Minister when he was down there&mdash; perhaps he said that because he was amongst us&mdash;that there should be a flat rate of 6d. per mile, without reference to the mode of conveyance and that the point about the number of meetings be left out, should, in my view, be accepted by the Minister, because the other arrangement leads to extravagance.  The man who is honest and who goes to the meeting on a bicycle qualifies for nothing, but suppose he wants &ldquo;to work the head on it&rdquo;, so to speak, he can hire a car and get payment at the rate of 1/6 a mile to the meeting and back.  It may be said that he pays that out, but I say that very possibly he does not.  There is another way of dealing with that matter.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should seriously consider the fixing of a flat rate, which is the only way in which the matter can be settled with fairness to the individual concerned and the ratepayer.  I ask him, above all, not to consider the suggestion that members of county committees should be debarred from participating in the facilities which they afford to the public by reason of being members of the committees.  As I say, the people who attend these meetings are generally farmers, who make great sacrifices in order to do so and it would be too bad if they were to be debarred from taking advantage of these facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C.M. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the plea made by Deputy Donnellan.  I recognise that the Minister in introducing this Bill is more or less following the lines of the Local Government Act, and endeavouring to bring agricultural committees into line with other public bodies in each county.  I welcome that proposal.  It may not be fair to ask him to strike out on his own, but I <Col N="296" /> appeal to him to make an effort to put county committees on some kind of uniform basis in the matter of travelling expenses.  Under the appropriate section of the Local Government Act, which ia practically the same as the provision here, the most extraordinary anomalies of every kind arise.  I do not think there is a county in Ireland where you will not find a big difference. Deputies who are members of the General Council of County Councils are aware that that body took up this question and circularised every county, and I doubt if there were two counties in which payment was made on the same basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan is quite right in saying that this system leaves the way open for some extraordinary things. The section in the Local Government Act was inserted with the idea of increasing the amount allowed for travelling.  Under the previous Act, we were allowed only 4d. or 5d. per mile one way.  The feeling was that that was quite unfair, and that it should be increased, but in many cases it happens&mdash;it happened in my own case&mdash;that the provision is interpreted in such a way as to give the person concerned less than he got under the other Act.  As I say, it happened in my own case, and I think Deputy Larkin knows something about it.  I might mention that, living in Wicklow, I live too near the meetings and so get practically nothing.  For this particular committee I had to travel to Dublin, and I found that under this Act I got a lot less than under the previous one.  When transport became practically impossible, when we could not get on trains or buses, I found that, by taking a car to Bray, and getting a bus there, I could charge the committee what I liked.  That shows that the system is all wrong.  Whether 3d. or 4d. a mile is given, everybody should get the same thing.  The present system is not of benefit to anybody. Probably the Minister thinks he is justified in giving the same privileges or rights as we have in the county council.  He ought to give a flat rate, and if he does, I think he will do a good day's work for all public bodies and everybody concerned.  It is <Col N="297" /> humiliating to many men on public bodies, who have travelled to these meetings for many years without getting any expenses, that when the Legislature decides they are entitled to some expenses, they should have to be fighting over 1d. or 2d., as they have to do to-day.</P>
    <P>With reference to the other sections in the Bill, so far as I am concerned, I have not the slightest objection to them.  I have had a lot of experience, as I have been chairman of the county committee of agriculture without a break since 1920, and I think there is nothing in these sections to which any honest man could object.  I see no objection to the Minister, after an inquiry has been held, dissolving a committee if that is recommended.  I do not think that there is anything in this Bill that will interfere with what any official is doing.  I welcome the Bill, and I hope it will become law.  I would appeal to the Minister to change the section I have referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Byrne, I resent very strongly Section 5 of this Bill.  He could see no harm in putting power into the hands of the Minister to dissolve a committee after an inquiry.  There are two or three things added at the end which would appear to justify the section, namely, when a committee ignores a decision of a court or refuses to have its accounts audited.  I do not think that such a thing would happen on any public body composed of sensible men. We must remember that the committee of agriculture is constituted by the county council who put on it the members they think best qualified to sit on it, with power to add people outside whom they think would be an addition to the committee.  In the opinion of the council it is the best committee they could form.  I can see no justification for putting into the hands of the Minister the powers proposed here.  There is ample room for diversity of opinion as to the best agricultural methods and the best way of doing one thing or another and, if the Minister makes an Order which they find cannot be carried out in their locality, why should-they be suspended or done away with?  I am strongly opposed to giving <Col N="298" /> a power of that kind.  I feel strongly that local representatives should always be allowed to express themselves on any matter without having the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads.  I object entirely to that section.</P>
      <P>With the other sections of the Bill I am not seriously concerned.  Travelling expenses I do not think are seriously considered by the majority of those who attend these committees.  I think, however, that nobody is better able to fix the rates than the officials who have ample information as to the travelling expenses, provided a fixed rate per mile is laid down.  It has been stated by some Deputies that members of a committee of agriculture cannot avail of some schemes.  Possibly there are some schemes that would lend themselves to preferential treatment.  But, in connection with utility schemes, such as the lime scheme, I think the fact that a man is a member of a committee should not debar him from taking advantage of these schemes.  I think that any man who is a member of a local authority should not be asked to make personal sacrifices, provided it does not compromise principle.  I can see no principle involved in a member of a committee availing himself of the lime scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, my principal objection is to Section 5.  I do not want the Minister to get mandatory powers such as are proposed.  I feel that the two additions to the section, namely, refusing to obey the order of a court or refusing lo have accounts audited, are things that can never arise.  No sensible body of men will refuse to have their books audited or be so foolish as to disobey the order of a court.  I feel that these things are tacked on in order to justify the placing in the Minister's hands of the power of dissolving a committee. We all know that there may be a difference of view in regard to agriculture between civil servants or the Department and the practical operators down the country.  I do not want to subscribe to any section which would limit men who are in actual touch with the difficulties of agriculture on which so much depends.  I do not want to see them debarred from expressing freely <Col N="299" /> any opinions they may hold and from acting as independently as they like, irrespective of the Minister or the Department.  I object to that section strenuously and I ask the Minihter to reconsider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a feeling that this Bill is rather futile, inasmuch as we are on the eve of a reform in the matter of representation for agriculture. We have a Vocational Commission considering the question of vocational representation and we hope to have their report shortly and that, as a result, vocational councils will be set up and a new system of representation provided for agriculture.  For that reason I feel that it is futile to be passing this kind of amending legislation and tinkering with the existing system. We can never get the best form of local committee of agriculture until we get a committee directly elected by the people engaged in the industry, namely, farmers and farm workers.</P>
      <P>However, since this Bill has been introduced, I should like to say that the most important and perhaps the most undesirable section of the Bill is that which gives the bureaucrats of the Department of Agriculture power to dissolve, at will, locally appointed committees. I say locally appointed committees advisedly, because, although they are not directly elected, they are appointed by the county councils.  Even at present, they are very close to local opinion, inasmuch as they are appointed by the locally elected representatives on each council.  It is a wholly undesirable thing that these locally appointed committees should not be free and independent of bureaucratic control.  It is undesirable that they should have over their heads the big stick of officialism which has the power to come down on them at any moment and wipe them out of existence if they express their opinions too freely on any subject or show they have some little initiative of their own or some will-power to assert their own views and carry out their own lines of policy in agricultural matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be clearly recognised that agriculture is not an industry and it is <Col N="300" /> not a science.  It has been described as a way of life.  The bureaucrats, plutocrats and politicians have made it a way of death in this country.  Everything connected with agriculture has to do with life or death.  It is not something which can be worked out and designed to the last detail on paper by officials hitting in offices in Dublin.  It is, I think, something about which people in direct contact with the soil and deriving their living directly from the agricultural industry can always have views which are worth considering and ideas which are capable of being put into operation and giving good results, even though they do not always tally with the ideas of the officials in the Department of Agriculture.  It is for that reason that, I submit, the greatest possible measure of freedom should be given to these local bodies.  That freedom is sought to be destroyed by this section of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is also the position under sub-seotion (2) of Section 5:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister makes an Order under this section dissolving a committee of agriculture, he may appoint such and so many persons as he shall think fit to perform the duties of such committee, and may from time to time remove all or any such persons and appoint others in their place, and may fix the tenure of office, duties and remuneration (if any) of all such persons.</P>
    <P>These are very wide powers.  The county councils at present appoint the committees of agriculture.  If the committees of agriculture are unsatisfactory, I think the body that appoints should be the body to dissolve them and appoint a new committee, that is, if we are to have any logic or reason in local affairs.  Here we have the Minister taking power to appoint officials, who are paid out of money provided by the local ratepayers, to appoint them for any particular term of office, to pay them any particular remuneration and to put them in a position in which they can discharge all the duties of these local committees. I think that is going altogether too far.  It makes this Bill something more than a mere amending Bill.  It <Col N="301" /> introduces a new feature into this particular branch of local administration, which is wholly undesirable.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough to have officials running the county councils but I think it is worse still that they should replace a committee such as this which, even at the moment, is largely advisory in its capacity, inasmuch as it is mainly designed to bring to the aid of officialdom the views of the local people engaged in the agricultural industry. There does not seem to be any reason why permanently appointed officials should replace such bodies.  They could not discharge the functions performed by such committees inasmuch as they would not be engaged in the industry. Even if they were engaged in the industry, even if the Minister were to appoint farmers, the mere fact that he did appoint them and has power to give them remuneration&mdash;which is not specified&mdash;makes them officials and, therefore, undesirable, from the point of view of representing to the Department the views of the people engaged in the agricultural industry.  That, I think, is a very objectionable section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Donnellan that, as far as benefits of a general nature are concerned, such as lime schemes, and others which are applicable to all people engaged in agriculture, in connection with which privilege of favouritism cannot be exercised, it is only right and proper that members of these committees should continue to receive them and that there should not be any restriction placed upon them. On the other hand, any privilege or any contract in which favouritism might be exercised should be placed far beyond the reach of any member of a committee of agriculture.</P>
    <P>As far as travelling expenses are concerned, I think there should not be any discrimination between the travelling expenses allowed to officials of the Department of Agriculture and to members of the committees.  It is altogether wrong that members of the committees should be placed in an inferior position.  In this matter we should direct our attention very earnestly towards securing the maximum economy.  Officials and members <Col N="302" /> of the committees of agriculture should be encouraged to travel by the cheapest possible means.  It has been pointed out that under the provisions of this Bill and under the provisions of other legislation in regard to county councils, there is an inducement to members to avail of expensive modes of transport.  Of course, they must provide some plausible excuse for so doing but I do not think it is desirable that encouragement should be given to people to travel by the more expensive means.  I think it would be more equitable to provide a reasonable flat rate per mile for all members of these committees.  If a member is frugal and thrifty and, by cycling a long distance; is able to attend a committee meeting more cheaply than is provided for in the flat rate, I do not think he should be discouraged from doing so.  It is wrong to encourage extravagance in the matter of travelling and in the matter of expenses generally.  That principle should apply rigidly, not only to members of the committees and other local bodies, but also to officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in speaking to the Second Reading of this Bill, stated&mdash;if I took him up correctly&mdash;that there is no principle involved. On the contrary, as an examination of the Bill would show, in relation to the latter part of it, there is a negation of a very important principle dealing with the rights of existing officers.  This invasion, as one might call it, of the democratic rights of the committees, which has keen dealt with by many speakers here in regard to the first part of the Bill, is extended by a further attack on the rights of the officers under the committees. The sections that deal with this matter would require careful attention, and I do not think they should pass without challenge by the House. Section 8 provides that:</P>
      <P>The Minister may declare any specified age to be the age limit for all offices or for such offices as belong to a specified class, description or grade, or for one or more specified offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious from that that the Minister may, if he so wills, decide not only the upper age limit&mdash;which is the point <Col N="303" /> to which most people direct their attention&mdash;but also the lower age limit for any office.  While the Minister's reply to Deputy Cosgrave was not very clear, I think it is clear in sub-section (1) that he may declare an age for one specified officer; not only for a class and not only for a grade, but, if he wishes, the limits for a specified officer. In other words, if the Minister specifies that the secretary of a county council must be not less than 35, for instance, and not more than 65 years of age, then, on the making of an Order by the Minister, such secretary, if he is not within those limits, must forthwith vacate the office.  This gives the Minister extremely wide powers, wider, I think, than has ever been envisaged by a Bill before.</P>
    <P>I may recall that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health tried to obtain such powers in a previous Bill in regard to dispensary doctors, when he tried to make 65 the age limit for retiring.  Everyone recalls that, on that occasion, there was such a volume of protest, and the resistance of the medical profession was so overwhelming that the Minister was compelled to abandon his attempt to fix or regulate the age limit for those officers of the medical profession.  We find now that the Minister for Agriculture is seeking the same powers.  No doubt, the House will agree that there should be some regulation in regard to the retiring age; but it should not be put in such a broad fashion as in Section 8 (1).</P>
    <P>The Minister should be called upon to specify the age.  He might make it, for instance, not less than 65.  Then, if there are cases of hardship arising out of his fixing that age, when the determination of a pension would come up for consideration, the Minister should have power under this section to give added years to the officer so affected, in order to give him conditions which would enable him to enjoy the maximum pension under this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the following section there is a further enlargement of the Minister's powers, greater than those which have been held hitherto.  They are on the <Col N="304" /> same pattern as we find in the Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill, to which the Minister himself referred. Here we have the right of the Minister to suspend any officer if, in his opinion, there is reason to believe that the holder has failed to perform the duties required or certain other conditions.  I submit that the wording of this, too, is extremely vague.  Anyone can believe anything; the Minister can believe, if he so likes, that the earth is flat and there is no one to stop him, though it may be contrary to fact, to science, and to proved truth.  He can say that he has reason to believe it, but in regard to the rights of an officer there should be some more definite restriction on his opinions and his beliefs, when they can have such a detrimental effect on the life of an officer who has taken up this service.  Not only is that so, but once armed with that opinion and that belief, the Minister may suspend and then he may terminate the suspension whenever he so pleases. There is no time limit there for suspension; evidently, it may carry on indefinitely, at the sweet will of the Minister, and thus impose great hardship on the officer so affected.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the further portion of that section which relates to the remuneration of the man who is suspended. The man may not be put on trial but, as long as his suspension continues under sub-section (4), his remuneration is forthwith suspended.  At the end of the suspension, it may be wholly or partly forfeited or it may be paid to him or otherwise disposed of as the Minister shall direct.  I submit that there is no natural justice there. There should be powers in this Bill to recompense the officer for any injustice that has been caused to him by that suspension.  Even though he has borne the ignominy of being suspended, even though he has gone through a trial at his own expense in defending himself, it may be that he is declared innocent, completely innocent, of all the charges that were brought against him.  Even though those charges were brought in good faith or even though they were trumped up&mdash;it is immaterial &mdash;he has had the ignominy of being suspended and has had the material loss of his remuneration during that <Col N="305" /> time.  He finds then that, under this Bill, the Minister will see that his remuneration is remitted to borne charity or given back to him in part or disposed of in any fashion the Minister so directs.</P>
    <P>There should be, in this or some following section, a safeguard for the officer&mdash;that, where he is declared innocent of any charge which has caused his suspension he will, as a right, without any direction whatever from the Minister, be recouped for the loss of his remuneration during that period. Furthermore, I think the House would agree generally that as he may be put to a good deal of expense in arranging his defence, there should be some provision here for recouping him the cost of his trial or the part cost of the inquiry which has been held to examine the charges brought against him.</P>
    <P>The final point which deals with this matter has been dealt with already&mdash; very eloquently, I think&mdash;by Deputy Dillon, and very little remains to be said upon it.  The fact that the existing officers are brought, willy nilly, under this Bill is not by any stretch of the imagination an act of natural justice.  It is a breach of contract and a breach of faith on the part of this Legislature to do any such thing.  I have not heard any argument, and I do not think any argument can be put up, as to why the existing officers in this service should not be exempt from the provisions which are now brought in, which are so detrimental to the officers.  It is obvious to everyone that officers who have been a considerable time in the service of the committee have always considered that they had some fixity of tenure and that their conditions of appointment were fixed when they signed them on one side and the other party to the contract, the committee, signed them on the other side.  They believed this was a contract between them and that it would be upheld in any court of law.  The effect of Section 11, however, is to override that contract and break it, leaving the officer completely at the mercy of the Minister and his Department, through the exercise of the rights conferred on him under this Bill in the preceding sections.  That portion of the Bill <Col N="306" /> should receive very strict examination and scrutiny from the House, and the Minister, I am sure, if he understands the full implication of it, will exercise his discretion and drop this portion of the Bill.  I am sure the effect of it will be to cause a great deal of dissatisfaction among the existing officials.  They may say that it is quite correct for new officers coming into the service who understand these onerous conditions in regard to suspension and the fixing of the age limit.  &ldquo;If they enter the service with their eyes open, then it is quite correct that these sections should apply to them, but&rdquo; existing officials may say: &ldquo;We who came into the service long before this was even foreshadowed, and who had no knowledge that it was coming on, should be exempt from these provisions.&rdquo; I think the Minister would do well, and would receive the plaudits of the House, if he erases Section 11 and allows more harmonious co-operation in the future between the officers and the committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>My view on this Bill is that the Minister should give the same privileges to members of county committees of agriculture as are given to county councillors.  I believe no member of a county committee should be a contractor, or have any privileges other than those allowed to a county councillor, except with respect to one item, and that is lime.  This may not affect other counties as much as it does County Mayo.  There you have areas where it is almost impossible to get lime.  The regulations with regard to supplying lime are different from those affecting other articles that would come under the heading of a contract. I believe lime is one of the things that should be allowed.  I feel that this will be more or less a temporary thing&mdash; lime is only a temporary substitute for artificial manure, and it is the only substitute that can be procured at the moment.  For that reason I think lime should be allowed as a privilege in the case of members of county committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards travelling expenses, they are allowed to every county councillor, and it is the county council that selects county committees.  When they are <Col N="307" /> forming those county committees, they generally select farmers.  Some of these farmers have to travel long distances to meetings and it would not be fair to expect them to travel at their own expense.  They should be allowed full travelling expenses, in view of the important work they have to discharge. Car expenses are usually allowed on the basis of whatever is the local charge by the supplier of the car.  He has to furnish a receipt and the secretary of the county council, in the ordinary way, refunds the amount to the person who pays in the first instance. I think that system should be observed in the case of county committees.</P>
    <P>In our county we try to group members for a particular car.  A car might be going in a certain direction and the driver could collect three members and bring them to the meeting.  Members of county committees are trying to arrange that in different counties.  I know it is done in my county.  The result is that the expenses reach, roughly, only 6d. per mile.  The members of those committees should be allowed full expenses and they may be able to arrange a reduction of expenses by means of the grouping system under which, in some cases, four members could use the one car.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that Deputies are correct in stating that members of county committees of agriculture are not entitled to avail of the lime scheme.  I imagine that they are, and I think the Minister will bear me out.  Deputy Roddy seemed to he under the impression that this measure would be detrimental to the interests of the ratepayers.  I am sure, when the Minister introduced this measure, it was his intention to assist the ratepayers; that is the object of the Bill.  This question, of course, is not a new one.  In the days of the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration they were forced to take steps to get a better service for the community, and this measure is more or less a development of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is anything in <Col N="308" /> this measure to which the members of county committees will object.  I think it will be a consolation to them and that it will also be a great consolation to meritorious officials.  I have some experience of the operations of county committees, and of their difficulties in trying to control their officials.  From time to time, if officials do anything wrong, or get into trouble, they are inclined to get support from amongst the members of the committee, and very often it is difficult for the committee to get a majority in order to check the official, chastise him, or even to have him suspended.  Consequently, there are really good committees in the country suffering from that great disability, and all that is happening here is that the Minister will back up the committees in order to get better services for the community.  It is not true to say that the intention is to do something detrimental to the ratepayers. From time to time such measures as this will have to be introduced. There is no intention, I am sure, on the part of the Minister or the Government Party, to become dictatorial or to take any privileges or rights from the members of these bodies.  The real intention is to help them to give a better service to the community.</P>
    <P>So far as the age limit is concerned, we have had experience of other measures, and there should be some discretion as to the age limit.  As regards committees of agriculture, I believe this step is essential for the good conduct of those bodies.  Section 5 has been complained of.  I wonder is there anything in that section to which any of us, if we had responsibility, would take objection?  I think every one of us would, in such circumstances, do what is set out under the section.  I believe it would be obligatory on us to do it and, consequently, I can see nothing wrong in the section.  It is good for the officials to know that that power is there and that it can be exercised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that it is <Col N="309" /> good for all to know it.  The committee know exactly where they stand and what they can do.  These county committees of agriculture are very important bodies and are carrying out very important duties at the present time.  It is only right that the Minister should support them in any disciplinary measures that they take. That really is what this amending Bill means.  It is certainly giving more power to the Minister, but no one believes that he is going to abuse those powers.  As far as the affairs of the committees are concerned, this means centralisation from the educational point of view.</P>
      <P>Speaking generally, I think that, to some extent, we are suffering from centralisation, certainly as far as the educational side is concerned.  From that point of view there might be something in this that might be detrimental. The officials in the Department of Agriculture, living perhaps for some years under rather comfortable conditions, are inclined to get out of touch with the realities of life in the rural areas.  In that way they might be inclined to examine the default of a local official from the wrong angle. They might perhaps have something of the penny tram atmosphere about them, and to that extent centralisation of this side of the Department's activities might not be a good thing. It might possibly be a good thing if, occasionally, there was a transfer of some of those unruly officials to the Department of Agriculture, and of some of the officials in the Department down to the rural areas in order that they might gain a little local experience.</P>
      <P>I do not see anything in this amending Bill to object to.  We have long passed the time when the payment of expenses to the members of these committees should have been rectified.  I am not in a position to say what would be the most suitable sum to fix.  We have not had what could bo called an adequate discussion of this, but if 6d. a mile, for a bicycle, each way were allowed, it might be regarded as being more or less satisfactory in present conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one point <Col N="310" /> that I propose to raise.  It may be regarded as a committee point, and perhaps the Minister would look into it between now and the Committee Stage.  The point arises on Section 9. It seems to me that in this section the Minister is, for the first time, taking wider powers than he has at present. In so far as the Minister is taking power to deal with difficult, irresponsible or indisciplinary officials, or with a person guilty of misdemeanour, nobody would quarrel.  I certainly do not want to justify an unsatisfactory official, or conduct which could not be justified either in the public or municipal services.  Section 9 provides that a person may be suspended for failure, misconduct or unfitness to perform his duties.  Provision is also made for the holding of an inquiry into the alleged offence.  Power is given to remove the suspension of the official concerned. Under sub-section (4) of the section, it is provided that where the suspension has been terminated the official's salary may be wholly or partly forfeited, or it may be paid to him or otherwise disposed of as the Minister shall direct.  It may well happen that a person's conduct is such as not to justify the payment of his salary for the whole period of his suspension.  It may be that his conduct is such that, in all reason, he ought to be compelled to make some sacrifice for his misdemeanour, but I suggest to the Minister that it is indefensible to withhold the salary of a person who has been vindicated as a result of an inquiry. While the Minister is taking power to withhold the official's salary wholly or partly, he is not nearly so specific in his desire that the man should be paid if he has been vindicated by the inquiry. I can hardly imagine that the Minister would desire to withhold salary in the case of a person who has been vindicated as a result of an inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this section is rather tightly drawn.  Perhaps between now and the Committee Stage the Minister would consider the introduction of an amendment which would make it perfectly clear that, where a person has been vindicated as a result of an inquiry, he ought to get his salary for the period of his suspension.  That is <Col N="311" /> natural justice, and natural justice should not be overridden by the powers given to the Minister in this section. If the Minister should find any difficulty in getting a formula to do what I suggest, I hope that he will take steps to indicate, by means of a statement in the Dáil which will be recorded in the Official Debates, that it is the intention of the Minister and of the Department to pay the salary of an official where he has been vindicated as a result of an inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the amount of expenses to be paid to the members of these committees who travel to the meetings by rail or road, I do not think it would be unreasonable to allow whatever may be the prevailing rates.  In my County of Mayo, they are 1/6 per mile each way.  I think that, no matter what distance a member has to travel, he should be reimbursed for his vouched travelling expenses.  There is a radius of five miles laid down in the Bill, so that if a member does not travel that distance he cannot claim any expenses.  In the County Mayo, the chairman of the committee lives nearly four miles from Castlebar, where the committee meetings are held.  He is an old man, partially disabled, and in order to attend a meeting he has to engage a car.  Therefore, I think that this five miles limit should be abolished by the Minister, and that provision should be made to pay vouched travelling expenses, irrespective of the distance travelled.  If that limit is not abolished, it will create hardship in a great many cases, and I have mentioned one.  It is essential for that man to engage a car to take him to Castlebar.  I hope the Minister will see that that is done.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the provision in Section 3 as regards contracts held by members of the committee.  All contracts are subject to the sanction of a Minister.  If the lowest tender in some particular case is not accepted, the Minister and his Department will be very keen to investigate the reasons for that, and see that individuals who should not get contracts will not get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> Over a number of years, I have seen a number of people who were members of public bodies in County Mayo severely restricted in that, being members of subsidiary bodies of the county council, they were precluded from tendering for various contracts.  I think that was unfair, because a large number of those who go to the public bodies do so chiefly because of success in their own callings.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a number of successful contractors who were on public bodies in County Mayo, and also the late editor of the <i>Connacht Telegraph</i>, a newspaper circulating in County Mayo, as well as other people, who were precluded from legitimately tendering for business that might be available.  That was unfair, and in view of the fact that these contracts see subject to Departmental approval, I do not think there is any danger. The provisions of former legislation were designed for an old era, in which there was not that tightening up or control by the central authority which we now have.  I do not think there is any reason for the safeguards contained in Section 3 and, as a matter of fact, I think they are a genuine hindrance on business people and others who may go into public life.</P>
    <P>Under Section 10, the Minister takes power to remove from office any official on conviction of an offence which, in the opinion of the Minister, renders him unfit for office.  I think the particular offences could, and should, be denned in the Bill.  I do not for a moment suggest that the Minister may exercise the power conferred on him by that section in a harsh or unfair way, but we may not always have the present Minister for Agriculture with us, and I think the particular offences in respect of which a conviction would render an official unfit to hold office should be set out.  I think it is unwise to allow legislation to pass through the House in such a vague form.  The House should know and should have a say in regard to the offences in respect of which an official might be removed and it should not be left to the discretion of any Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister <Col N="313" /> should agree to the suggestion made by Deputy Moran regarding the five miles' limit for travelling expenses and should amend the Bill in that respect. I agree that people who live within five miles of the place where the meetings are held should be, in the ordinary course, entitled to travelling expenses, the same as the man who may live 10 or 30 miles away, because, as Deputy Moran pointed out, he may have to hire a car and be under very heavy expense in getting to some of the meetings, especially at present when travel is so difficult.  I suggest that the Minister should amend the section in that respect.</P>
      <P>So far as I can read Section 2, it is similar to the section in the Local Government Act, 1939, which allows more or less a discretion to county councils in the matter of the fixing of reasonable travelling expenses.  I believe that in most counties the arrangement is working satisfactorily.  It is a matter for the council, with the sanction of the Minister, to fix what are considered reasonable travelling expenses, and I think most councils have done so, and have had no trouble whatever in the matter.  Objection has been taken by a number of Deputies to Section 5.  I can see nothing in that section to which any member of a committee of agriculture who undertakes the responsibility of that post could object.  There is nothing in the section which is not in the Local Government Act, 1939, and there is not one sub-section of it which could be objected to in any way.  No person who undertakes the responsibility of the office of member of a committee of agriculture could have any possible objection to it. If he is not prepared to carry out the duties of his office in a responsible way, he should either resign or be removed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connolly raised a great objection with regard to the age limit and the right of the Minister to retire officials at a certain age.  It is a new line for Deputy Connolly and his Party to object to men being retired at a certain age.</P>

      <P>I am not objecting to the payment of a pension at all, but, under the law as it stands, if an official is able to sit in his post until the age of 100, he can do so.  I believe that some of them would like to remain there until they reach that age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>His point went much further.  It was that the Minister should have no power at any stage to retire a man because he came in under certain conditions and could retire when he pleased.  I do not think Deputy Norton will subscribe to that principle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>That was the principle which he wanted the House to agree to in his objection to the provisions of this section.  The general provisions of this Bill will be welcomed by committees of agriculture, and I do not think that anyone who has any experience of working as a member of such a committee will have any objection to a single section.  Many of its provisions are long overdue, and they merely bring these committees and their officials into line with local government officials, members of county councils and urban councils.  I see no hardship in them and I know of no grievance which any member of a local authority has had up to now, provided he was carrying out his duties in a reasonable and responsible manner.  I hope the House will pass the Bill without any objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. W.T. Cosgrave Mr. W.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill appears to me to be divided into two compartments: one in which the Minister proposes to pay certain travelling expenses to members of committees of agriculture and provides for the disqualification or qualification, as the <Col N="315" /> case may be, of members, and the other in which he takes power to hold an inquiry into the conduct of committees of agriculture and to impose penalties if satisfied, as a result of that inquiry, or for some other reasons which are set out, penalties should be imposed.  In my opinion, we have gone beyond the stage at which that is the method of dealing with recalcitrant local authorities.  So long as that power is there, it appears to me that there is likely to be a local objection to the exercise of authority by the central executive, and if, by reason of the experience which the Minister has gained with regard to committees of agriculture and other bodies over which he exercises any supervision, or local authorities generally, he decides that their exercise of their functions does not give satisfaction, a better system would be to get some other method of electing them.  But spread out the responsibility locally as far as possible.  I would experiment from month to month and from year to year in order to ensure that the burden of responsibility in connection with the administration of local affairs or State affairs should rest on the shoulders of a larger number of people through the country.</P>
      <P>The proposal to take power to hold an inquiry into the administration of a county committee of agriculture is a new step.  The Minister is taking power to do that and, if he is satisfied that the result of the inquiry justifies it, he may dissolve the committee.  He goes further than that.  He specifies a number of things which will justify the committee being dissolved by Order, and they are: wilfully neglecting to comply with a lawful Order, direction, or regulation of the Minister; failing to comply with any judgment, order or decree of a court; refusing to allow its accounts to be audited.  Now the courts are functioning and there is no earthly reason, if a committee of agriculture will not comply with the law, why the Minister, or an official of his Department, should not bring them into court and get them dealt with there and let them make their case there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> We have the other question of the holding of an inquiry.  That system had to be introduced at a certain period when there were the embers of a rebellion in the country.  That matter had to be dealt with and it was dealt with.  But that period is gone by.  Now the idea ought to be to seek co-operation and not use the strong hand.  Is it likely that a committee of agriculture will disobey an order of a court?  I hardly think that is likely. Even if members of a committee of agriculture disobey an order of a court, are they not in contempt and is there not a penalty?  It may be that a chance majority of members, of a committee of agriculture may precipitate a situation such as that.  They should not, by reason of that chance majority, be responsible for having that committee of agriculture put out of action.</P>
    <P>Apart from these considerations altogether, the Minister proposes, in the event of the dissolution of a committee of agriculture, to appoint other persons at a certain remuneration, if necessary.  To my mind, that is undesirable and reactionary.  If the Minister abolishes a committee of agriculture, why not appoint the county manager to do the work?  Do not add to the expense.  Do not leave it open to members of that committee to be able to say: &ldquo;We accepted no remuneration for our services.  Now somebody has been appointed at a salary to do the work which we did for nothing&rdquo;.  I disagree altogether with that method of dealing with local authorities that are in conflict either with a Department or a Minister in present circumstances.  There is no evidence that there is a rebellion. There is no evidence that there is sabotage.  It may be that very strong-minded members of a committee may hold very strong views regarding certain matters.  I would not blame them for that, having regard to the events of the last ten or 11 years in connection with agriculture generally.  I think the use of the power suggested is unwise at the present time. Whether we like it or not, there is a long history in this country of objection to central government, whatever sort it may be, and the sooner our <Col N="317" /> energies are directed towards ensuring respect and consideration for central government the better it will be.</P>
    <P>As regards travelling expenses, I think it would be better to have a flat rate rather than having different scales.  I would not be disposed to say that, if a man misses his bus he should be entitled to hire a car.  That would be very expensive and these are days in which we must limit the expenditure, not only of persons in authority, but of those who are not in authority, if we are to survive.</P>
    <P>The third part of this Bill deals with officials.  The Minister said that the powers he is seeking are similar to those in the Local Government Act and in the Vocational Education Act.  They are not contained in the Vocational Education Act.  The Minister for Education is seeking them, and seeking them in much the same form as the Minister for Agriculture is seeking them.  There was a contract made with the officials of committees of agriculture many years ago, when the Act first came into operation.  It does not appear to me to be just that one party to that contract should seek to break it without the consent of the other party. I concede that any person beyond the age at which he can give useful service should not be retained in the service. But it does not follow that he should be thrown on the scrap heap.  He should be compensated in the form that is usual in these cases where, say, a local authority is abolished or an office is abolished.</P>
    <P>In the case of new appointments, the Minister should make such a provision that one can foresee what is likely to occur in the future.  If one of these officials reaches the age of 65, say, it was not the rule up to this that he should retire.  Many persons at that age are capable of giving many years of useful service to a local authority or the State, as the case may be.  In some cases they are not.  In some cases they do not retain at 65, or even some years prior to that, the full power of their faculties.  The State and local authorities are entitled to get the best service.  We are conceding to the Minister the right to fix an age, but not without advertence to the fact that a person in employment entered the service <Col N="318" /> without any provision being made as to retirement at a certain age.  Consequently, if he has to retire at a certain age, some special provision should be made for him.</P>
    <P>I think the officials would he reasonable with regard to that.  I do not think that they would go so far as to claim a pension of two-thirds of their salary.  So far as I have been able to discover, they would be prepared to accept an individual year for every five years of service.  It is conceded that the Minister should fix an age, but not from day to day.  It should be fixed in respect of certain officers of a certain age and there should be a flat rate applicable to each office or grade. There is a proposal now, which was not there before, giving the Minister authority to inquire into the conduct, efficiency and some other qualification, of an official.  The Minister had not got that power up to this.  It is quite true that the Minister for Local Government had it in connection with a local authority, but it was not provided under the Vocational Acts.  It is being sought under a Bill we have before us this evening.  What would be regarded, perhaps, as a necessary and essential qualification to-day might not have been so regarded, say, a decade or two ago or three decades ago.  Therefore, again, if the Minister or the committee of agriculture find that the qualifications of a particular official are not up to the standard now required, it does not follow that they are justified in throwing out of office a person who had sufficient qualifications at the time of his appointment and was exercising them to the best of his ability over his period of office.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of this Bill is practically on all terms with Section 11 of the Local Officers and Employees Act, 1926, but, remember, that even that at its time was an imposition, a slight change from what had previously been in operation.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 10, it sometimes happens that on appeal a convicted person is found not guilty and discharged. I think, as the section is drawn, the first conviction would disqualify. The Minister could not reinstate under this Bill as it stands.  I <Col N="319" /> do not think that was his intention. If that is not the intention, it would require to be somewhat differently phrased.  There have been cases&mdash;they are not many&mdash;in which, on appeal, convictions have not been upheld and the person has been discharged without a stain on his character.  I think I read in the papers yesterday morning of such a case.  I am quite sure that it is not the intention to discharge from the service a person who is subsequently found not guilty of an offence with which he bad been charged.</P>
    <P>Generally, I would say with regard to this measure that, as regards the first part of it, which provides for the holding of an inquiry and dissolving a committee, it is out of date, that we should depart from that as soon as possible, that, if the method of getting committees of agriculture has been found to be unsatisfactory, some other system ought to be adopted to ensure that the county committee of agriculture in each county would be so selected that it would do its work in the interests of the agricultural industry; that, in the second place, an alteration of the terms of appointment of officers, if that should result, should be done with justice to the present holders.  The fact that it is necessary to do justice to them should not prevent the Minister, in those cases where more efficient or better qualified persons are required for the public service, from having such better qualified and more efficient persons appointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as I said in the beginning, is largely an amending Bill and therefore, although there are several different matters of detail, there is no big principle, as it were, running through the Bill.  I am afraid I will have to deal with it in that way again in regard to the points that have been raised.  First of all, with regard to the payment of members, the wording there i &ldquo;reasonable expenses&rdquo;. That will be interpreted in the first place by the chief executive officer who is the clerk to the committee.  He will, I hope, get some direction of general principle laid down by the <Col N="320" /> Department for his guidance, but, largely speaking, the chief executive officer will see that only reasonable expenses are put up.  Deputy Donnellan and some other Deputies mentioned a flat rate, but I do not think it would be fair.  If you have a member of a committee living beside a railway station and if there is a suitable train to a meeting and a suitable train home, he has to pay, even travelling first class, something like twopence a mile.  For the person living in an out of the way place, where there is neither bus nor train, and who, perhaps, has to hire a motor car for at least part of the journey, the expenses will be very different.  On the whole, I think &ldquo;reasonable expenses&rdquo; is the better system.  I know personally of county committees, where, as Deputy Browne pointed out, three or four members try to join in the hire of a motor car.  I think that on the whole, members of county committees of agriculture are anxious to keep expenses as reasonable as possible.  I think, therefore, the wording of the Bill should be allowed to stand, until we see how it will work out.  The system is operated more or less on the same lines for county councillors and it is better to let it stand for these bodies too.</P>
      <P>Another point raised was that we should not have this five-mile limit. That also is in the Local Government Act.  In these matters of expenses and so on, I have followed the wording of the Local Government Act because I took it that it was the major legislation on this particular point and that the Dáil had fully discussed the principles that were laid down in that Act and that, therefore, if we followed a similar arrangement here, it would meet with the approval of the Dáil, which had already approved the other arrangement.  I do not think it would be wise to depart from this five-mile limit because I think any person living within five miles of a principal town in a county would have some means of locomotion of his own for getting into that town and it is hardly right that we should allow expenses to be charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is entirely wrong to give the impression, <Col N="321" /> as some Deputies did, that officers of the local authority or any other officials of my Department are getting preferential treatment in the matter of travelling expenses.  It is the other way round, as a matter of fact, because, whereas we lay it down here that reasonable expenses will be allowed to members of the local committee, and that will be determined largely, at any rate&mdash;unless my Department comes to the conclusion that something very monstrous is being done&mdash;by the officer of the committee, we lay it down that the travelling expenses of the officials will still be controlled by the Minister direct and under regulations laid down by the Minister, the object of that being, of course, that we do not want the chief executive officer to be making regulations for his own travelling expenses. It is all right for him to look after the members and to see that reasonable expenses are charged, and so on, but it is not fair to that officer, if he is an honest man, to have him looking after or making regulations for his own travelling expenses.  If he is a dishonest man, of course, it cannot be allowed. On that account, the Minister makes regulations covering the travelling expenses of the officers.  There is no use in making the point that these Bills are the result of bureaucracy, in laying down better conditions for the officials than for the members of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In the section with regard to the disqualification of a person from being a member of a committee, I do not know if the point has been fully understood, or if I was misunderstood. What I said in introducing the Bill was that we were sticking to the old arrangement to a great extent but departing from the old arrangement to some extent.  As the law stands, no member of a county committee can benefit from any scheme of that committee. Where the committee laid down a scheme for premium bulls or poultry stations, or even for lime, members of the county committee could not benefit.  As pointed out by some members here, the section, as drafted, appears to be rather contradictory, <Col N="322" /> but that is not so.  Sub-section (2) still lays down that members will be disqualified if they partake of any of these schemes, but sub-section (3) gives the Minister power to make exceptions&mdash;that is what it amounts to.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Bill, I mentioned that I had in mind the lime scheme.  I am not sure if I would go as far as suggested by one Deputy and exempt contractors for lime; but what I had in mind were the recipients of the lime, that farmers who are members of the county committee should not be disqualified from membership of the committee by reason of their getting lime under the scheme.  I pointed out the difference, which was stressed by many speakers&mdash;that is, where there was enough, for everybody and no preference could be given, there could be no objection to allowing any member of the committee to benefit.  In regard to lime, for instance, there is lime for every farmer who applies.  I do not know whether I can say that absolutely or not, but that is our aim, at any rate, under this scheme.  That is very different from the example of the premium bulls.  If there is a premium bull to be placed in a certain area, several farmers in the area may like to get him and it would not be wise to allow a member of the committee to have the bull as, even though he might be the best man or the best applicant, it would be very hard to get the farmers who were turned down to believe that the bull was given to him on that account and not because he was a member of the committee.  Generally speaking, I think the distinction could be that, where there is no competition for a certain benefit under the committee, we would exempt the members from disqualification if they partook of the benefit, but where there is competition no exemption, as a general rule, would be made.</P>
    <P>Section 5 was next dealt with&mdash;the dissolution of a county committee. There are varying views on that. Deputy Cosgrave says he thinks the time is gone when that is the best way to deal with these committees which are not doing their duty in the proper way.  I do not know; perhaps the <Col N="323" /> Deputy is right.  I do not think anybody in this House looks on the dissolution of a public body as a thing to be desired, but it has been brought into legislation here as the only way out of a difficulty that may arise if the committee is not, doing its duty or if, as laid down here, they have disobeyed the court or refuse to have their accounts audited.  There were objections to this clause from what I may call a theoretical point of view. Members who are imbued with the idea of liberalism are objecting to this particular type of legislation.  That is all right, but I do not think any Deputy here really believes that any Minister for Agriculture will start off dissolving committees for no very good reason. Every Deputy knows very well that is not true.  Some Deputies paid me the compliment of saying I would not, if I were here, as I was a reasonable man. I do not think this Dáil will choose an unreasonable person&mdash;so unreasonable as to dissolve county committees through a mere whim.  That is not going to happen.  Deputies know very well, even though they may talk to the contrary, tnat a committee which expresses its disagreement with the policy of a particular Minister will not be dissolved because of that.  What is laid down here is that the committee must be failing to carry out the duties properly; and that offence would have to be rather grave before any Minister Would think of dissolving it.  I do not think that the anxiety expressed by some Deputies was really as genuine as they led us to believe.</P>
    <P>After that, the main matter raised was regarding the officers of the committees. I think we are all agreed&mdash; Deputy Norton, Deputy Cosgrave, and others who spoke&mdash;on one point, that the first thing we must keep in mind is to have our committees administered in a competent way.  Nothing must stand between us and that object.  If a man is too old to carry out his duties properly, we must get rid of him; if a man has been convicted by a court of a serious offence, we should get rid of him.  If a report comes to the committee, and they think therte is something in it, and if it is a serious charge, they may suspend a man pending <Col N="324" /> an investigation; or if a report comes to the Minister that there is serious charge against the man, the Minister may suspend him pending an investigation.</P>
    <P>If, after the case has been investigated, the man is found innocent, there is no doubt whatever that he will be fully reinstated and receive whatever salary might have been due to him it he had not been suspended at all.  I agree with Deputy Norton: I do not think there is any amendment necessary. It is better not to be tied by too close a definition in things like that.  The clause says that the Minister may restore in full what a man would have earned if he had not been suspended or he may deduct part or the whole of the salary that would be payable to him in that time.  I think every Deputy will agree that, if our committees are to carry on in a proper way and with efficiency, somebody should have the power to deal with those officials who are not doing their work properly.</P>
    <P>There may be something in the point raised by some Deputies, that a man comes into the service on a certain understanding.  Strictly speaking, however, the understanding he comes in on is that he must carry out his duties efficiently or, otherwise, he may be dismissed. To that extent we are not making any difference whatever as regards any understanding he may have had when he came into the service of the local authority.  He must have known, when he entered the service, that he would not be allowed to stay there when he was a very old man, not fit to carry on his duties; that he would not be allowed to stay if there was a serious charge preferred against him, or if he was convicted of a serious charge in the courts.  I do not think any official could claim that he was badly treated if these sections were brought into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will look at the sub-section he will see that among the reasons that may be assigned for getting rid of an official are, that he has failed satisfactorily to perform his duties, that he has misconducted <Col N="325" /> himself, or is otherwise unfit to hold his office.  Suppose you make it a condition of his service that the official must transact all his business through the medium of Irish, at a time when he has reached 55 years of age, do you think it legitimate that you should get rid of him, seeing that that was not made a condition of his service when he was entering?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But, if you put in a new condition, such as having to transact the business through the medium of Irish, when he is, let us say, 55 years of age, do you think it would be legitimate to dispense with his services if he is unable to transact his business in Irish?  It is perfectly fair to do that in respect of incoming officers, but if you take a man of middle age, and impose a condition about transacting business in Irish, when there was no question of it when he was appointed 30 years ago, would it be fair to apply that to him, and eliminate him on that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that for 20 years this question of Irish has been coming up with regard to officials, and he knows the general trend of our regulations.  The test of Irish has not been so rigorously applied to officials, either locally or centrally.  As the Deputy knows, many men were appointed by local authorities on the condition that they would learn Irish within two years, and that was not enforced.  If there is any fault to be found as regards local officials and Irish, the leniency has been on the side of the employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputies are unduly anxious on this point.  No matter what Act of Parliament is brought in, a Deputy can say &ldquo;Under this section you could do so-and-so&rdquo;, but it is most unreasonable to assume that it would be done.  I think Deputies should rather assume that there will be reason in all these things and <Col N="326" /> that nothing will be done that might be regarded as unfair in any way to the officials.  As regards the enforcement of any of these things, the only one that may be considered is the age limit.  The other points about suspension and dismissal for misconduct do not arise.  If the enforcement of the age limit appeared to be unfair, I think the matter could be considered.  In the case of a person who is 64 years now, and who may not have made any provision for the future, thinking perhaps that he might be in office for a number of years, if we did make a sudden provision for retirement, in all probability the person so near the age limit would get a year or two to look around before he would be asked to leave the service.  Suppose it were brought up in that way, there should be some consideration given to the pension that that person would go out on; he should get a more generous pension than he otherwise would.</P>

      <P>Considering the number, there are very few dismissed.  Reference was made by Deputy Hughes to Section 5.  I think if Deputy Hughes reads that section carefully he will see there is not very much out of the way because an Order will be made under the section.  The Minister will simply have power to make necessary arrangements to implement any Order he may issue under that section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Order must be under this section.  I think it was Deputy Cosgrave who raised the point, in laying down these age limits, to deal, where it is possible, with individuals. I think it is plain that what is mentioned in the section is offices, not officers.  That makes it quite obvious that if the Minister makes a regulation, it deals with an office, the office of the agricultural instructor, the office of the horticultural instructor, or the office of the poultry instructress, and not any particular individual.  It is not contemplated that we will say the secretary of a particular county must retire at a certain age; it must be a general matter.</P>

      <P>No, but the Local Government Act dealt with committees as well as county councils.  It was thought that the Minister for Agriculture should deal with county committees, and the Minister for Education with vocational education committees.  We were a long time coming along with our Bills.  If we had all come at the same time, possibly there would not be this trouble, and the same thing would be done in all the Acts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry complained about Section 2 (5).  He said that if a member says he travels so many miles he will probably be put in jail. Probably he will not, but if we find a member of a county committee is making false returns with respect to his travelling expenses, then I think he deserves to be dealt with.  If he deliberately makes false returns in order to get money, I do not think anyone could object if he were dealt with. As I said before, this is more a Bill for the Committee Stage.  I believe it can be dealt with more satisfactorily in Committee.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to have an understanding of the fundamental objection I have to Section II. I cannot put down an amendment suggesting that those people should get compensation.  Will the Minister consider, between now and the Committee Stage, redrafting that section so that it will mean that, if an officer who is already in the service is prejudiced in his tenure of office by some new condition made under Sections 8, 9 or 10, he will be allowed to retire with full pension or with something of that kind, which would give him some monetary compensation for any disadvantage which the new regulations would make in his position, and which he could not conceivably have anticipated at the time that he first entered into his contract of service with the public authority?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy in principle, but I do not know that I could go as far as he suggests.  There is a difficulty.  There is certainly some defect in the pension position of officers under the county committees of agriculture.  I am not sure whether it <Col N="329" /> applies&mdash;I presume it does&mdash;to officers under the county councils and under the vocational education committees. We are having the matter looked into, and I ask the Deputy not to raise it at the moment.  I could explain it more fully to him if I met him privately, but there is a rather awkward case that we have in mind.  I do not know if we would be in a position to deal with it in this Bill.</P>

When that Act was going through the Dáil, this question of a subsistence allowance was not raised at all.  I do not know whether the Dáil would wish to have it brought in now.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Perhaps I should begin by pointing out the very narrow content of this Bill.  It is not a general Housing Act.  It applies only to a section of our housing activities.  It deals solely with housing grants which are payable to private persons in rural areas and to public utility societies in both urban and rural areas in respect of houses built or reconstructed under the Housing Acts.  Its primary purpose is to extend the time within which grants may be given.  Section 2 of the Bill is the operative section in that regard.  It defers for another two years, that is until the first day of April, 1945, certain of the dates prescribed as the qualifying dates for the system of grants established under Section 5 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.  The dates in question are, firstly, the date before which new houses erected in rural areas by private persons or public utility societies must have been completed in order to qualify for one or other of the grants enumerated in Section 5 of the Principal Act under paragraphs (c), (d), (e) (f) and (g); secondly, it proposes to extend the corresponding date as applied under paragraph (h) of the same section to grants for the reconstruction of existing houses by small farmers and agricultural labourers; thirdly, it proposes to extend the date allowed for the completion of houses built by public utility societies in urban areas for letting; and, fourthly, it proposes to extend the date before which houses that are intended to be sold or leased to a philanthropic society, so that such society may put them in a proper condition to be let to the working classes, must have been acquired by the local authority concerned.  All this is dealt <Col N="332" /> with by sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of the section merely repeals the corresponding sub-section in the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1943. Sub-section (3) provides that the power to make grants under the provisions I have mentioned will be preserved a continuous from 1st April last.  The power to make grants under the Act of 1942 lapsed in April last, and the sole urgency behind this Bill is to ensure that there will be no hold-up-in payment of grants.  Deputy Dillon, a Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, will know how concerned the Comptroller and Auditor General is to ensure that the legislative provisions which regulate public expenditure are meticulously complied with by the Departments.</P>
      <P>We are anxious to make certain payments; we are desirous not to hold up any housing or reconstruction which might be carried out under this measure; and accordingly we are anxious to get the measure law by the earliest possible date.  In fact, if it had not been for the general election and the subsequent dislocation of the ordinary routine of the parliamentary year, this Bill would have been introduced into the Legislature immediately after the passage of the Budget and would have been law some weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already stated that the primary purpose of the measure is to extend the time within which certain houses may qualify for grants.  We have taken the opportunity offered by the introduction of this Bill to make two minor amendments in the Principal Acts.  One of these has been introduced at the instance of the Committee of Public Accounts.  That committee in its report for the year 1939-40, which was presented on 20th May, 1941, expressed the view that the term &ldquo;reconstruction&rdquo;, as used in the Housing Acts, 1932 to 1940, should be statutorily defined.  Section 3 of this measure is introduced in deference to that view.  This section defines the term &ldquo;reconstruction&rdquo; as meaning the carrying out of any structural alterations to a house, including the extension or enlargement thereof, or the carrying out of any other works in <Col N="333" /> relation to a house which, in the opinion of the Minister, are reasonably necessary for rendering the house more suitable for human habitation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that will not result in a man getting three grants in respect of the one house, as happened on a classic occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister ever hear of the case of the man who built two houses side by side, one of them without a kitchen and who then knocked a hole between the two houses?  Under Section 3, he will get three grants for doing that&mdash;for the erection of two houses and for reconstruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If our purpose is to improve the housing of the people, and particularly in this case, the small farmer and labourer, we cannot define the term &ldquo;reconstruction&rdquo; too narrowly, and if instances such as the Deputy has mentioned have occurred&mdash;I do not know whether they have occurred; they have not occurred during my term of office&mdash;I am sure it must have been as a result of inadvertence or because there was some very good reason for permitting them to occur.  One thing is certain: they have not been of general occurrence.  The Deputy, who is Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, knows that these grants are subject to very searching scrutiny, and, accordingly, I think it may be taken that, if this definition were, in the view of the Comptroller and Auditor General, being abused, we should certainly hear of it.  The House would have an opportunity of hearing it in the Auditor's report on the Appropriation Accounts and the Committee of Public Accounts would have an opportunity of examining the whole transaction and reporting to the House in regard to it.  However, I should like to say, with some relevance to Deputy Dillon's interruption, that, in general, grants for reconstruction are given for re-roofing, the building of an additional <Col N="334" /> room, the enlarging of existing windows, and other necessary alterations. As I said, in view of the general desire to improve the homes of the people, if we are to make this measure beneficial, I do not think we can define &ldquo;reconstruction&rdquo; in very narrow or rigid terms.  If we do, the whole purpose of the Act will be defeated.</P>
      <P>Sections 4 and 5 relate to the position of public utility societies who desire to undertake building operations for the purpose of re-housing people who have been cleared from slum clearance areas.  Under the existing law, the maximum assistance which a public utility society, erecting houses or flats for letting, may obtain is £100 per house from the State, plus a grant of £50 from the local authority.  This grant is payable, irrespective of whether the dwellings have been erected for normal housing or slum clearance purposes. Sections 4 and 6 are designed to encourage such societies to undertake housing schemes specifically for the re-housing of persons displaced from slum clearance areas.  The provisions of these sections are designed to equate the position of the public utility society which undertakes schemes for the re-housing of persons displaced from clearance areas or unfit houses to that of a public authority which carries through such schemes at first hand.  Under the new provisions, public utility societies will be given assistance commensurate with that which a local authority would receive from the State for doing similar work. This assistance will be given under Section 4 by the local authority, in the first instance, but, under Section 5, the local authority concerned will be recouped by the Minister, that is, by the State, for the assistance given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of the recoupment will be governed by the rules set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  These rules provide that the maximum recoupment to be made in respect of any rehousing scheme shall not exceed the value of the assistance that could be given under the Principal Act to a local authority, if that authority had carried out the scheme directly.  The assistance may be in one or more of several forms.  It may be afforded by loan or <Col N="335" /> by a contribution to the annual loan charges, or it may be given by capital grant, or a grant or lease of land, or by the execution of building or development works.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is consequential upon Sections 4 and 5, and is merely designed to ensure that houses or flats provided by public utility societies, with assistance under Sections 4 and 5 of the Bill, will not be entitled to a remission of rates under the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Act, 1940, as amended; that is to say, that the section is merely put in to ensure that public utility societies will not be entitled to demand assistance under two separate Acts in respect of the one undertaking.  Sections 7, 8 and 9 are the usual clauses dealing with regulations, expenses, and the Short Title.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister described this Bill as being drawn in rather narrow terms.  If I read the Bill correctly, I think that is almost too generous a description.  I think the Minister would agree that this really only applies to the Gaeltacht and people making alterations to houses in rural areas.  I think I am right in saying that the provisions of this Bill do not apply to Dublin City or County.  I assume by the Minister's silence that that is correct, and I am wondering if this is the Government's contribution to the post-war housing problem.</P>

      <P>On a couple of occasions since I came into this House I drew the Minister's attention to the inadequacy of the grants under the 1932 Act so far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned.  I am disappointed, to say the least of it, that when he had a glorious opportunity of putting things right, he did not avail of it on this occasion.  Perhaps, Sir, I am sailing close to the wind.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as it has relation to the 1932 Act, which it is proposed to amend, I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the anomalous position that arises in connection with these grants.  Having regard to the cost of building in 1932 and the <Col N="337" /> cost of it to-day, the Dublin Corporation is under a very serious disability in connection with the maximum grant, so far as the contribution to capital debt charge is concerned, namely, the maximum grant of £500 for flats and £450 for cottages.  I draw the Minister's attention to that particular point, which affects other borough areas as well, and I hope he will take the opportunity of rectifying a matter which calls for rectification. It may be that, so far as the Minister and his Department are concerned, they have not the last word in the matter.  Perhaps if their own private views on the subject were known, they would like to fall into line with the desires of public bodies, such as the Dublin Corporation. But they have another body to contend with, namely, the Department of Finance.  In that respect, perhaps, all I can do at this stage is to try to induce the Minister to use his persuasive powers with that Department to bring about a position that we very much desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the main point of this Bill is concerned, namely, the question of public utility societies, I welcome the section which gives the Minister certain powers, provided, of course, that the operations of the public utility societies fulfil the conditions laid down in that Section 4.  I have in mind one particular utility society in Dublin which fulfils the requirements of that section in every way and I think the Minister is aware of its activities.  I refer to the Charlemont Public Utility Society which, in 1940, set out to build a number of flats in an area which, in the ordinary course, would have to be attended to by the Dublin Corporation. That society actually succeeded in getting 13 flats up. These flats, I understand, cost £8,400, and the only contributions towards that, so far as the Government and public bodies are concerned, were £100 from the State and £50 from the Dublin Corporation.  The society was forced to go to public-spirited citizens for a sum of about £6,000 and, in addition, had to get a loan of about £3,000 from the Local Loans Fund.  At present the society has plans for about 37 flats in hand, and it is proposed to <Col N="338" /> go on with the extension of that scheme as early as possible, on the understanding that it will benefit under this particular section.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister, having regard to the character of that society, which is purely philanthropic and making no profits whatever, and which is prepared to vest the flats in the Dublin Corporation, subject only to supervision so far as the tenants are concerned, to give that society the consideration to which it is entitled as from the time it started operations and by making 1940 the operative date of that particular section.  The operative date is not specified in the section. Having regard to the character of the society and the good work it is doing, I ask the Minister to include the period from 1940 within the scope of the section.</P>
    <P>The only other question which arises, so far as I am concerned, is the question of reconstruction.  I am glad the Minister has included a section dealing with that, as I presume it will cover the operations of the Dublin Corporation so far as our reconditioning and reconstruction schemes in Gardiner Street and Blessington Street are concerned.  I should like to have it made clear by the Minister that these schemes, as from the start of their operations, will come under this particular Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise merely to support Deputy Martin O'Sullivan's appeal to the Minister for Local Government in relation to Section 4, particularly in connection with the Charlemont Public Utility Society.  Deputy O'Sullivan has explained the good work that has been done by this particular society.  None of the officials are paid.  They are all honorary officials and they have done work that the Dublin Corporation should have themselves done.  I would appeal to the Minister to make this section retrospective. I think we should at all times encourage the spirit which has been displayed by the Charlemont Public Utility Society.  If those who are at present criticising the Housing Bill and minimising the work that has been done by the Dublin Corporation in relation to slum clearance, were to band themselves into public utility <Col N="339" /> societies and do as good work as this particular society has done, they would be very usefully employed.  That would be much more useful than their destructive criticism.  I ask the Minister to make this section retrospective so that the Charlemont Public Utility Society can go ahead with the rest of the work that they have planned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was at particular pains to point out to the House at the beginning that this Bill was narrow in its ambit.  I did that because I thought that perhaps some of the new Deputies in the House might not realise that and might not know the bases upon which it is usual to deal with these matters, but I did not anticipate indeed that Deputy Dockrell would not be aware of the situation. In 1932, the Government passed a comprehensive Housing Act, which was designed to deal with a great number of problems.  It was not anticipated that the Act would be the last word in the matter of housing, but it was agreed that its provisions would continue to operate until such time as it was possible to have a general review of the housing situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, the Minister for Finance of the day had to insist that, as he did not know what the future was going to bring, and did not know how much the Act was going to cost, in relation to the system of grants which were to be given under the Act, certain temporal limitations would have to be prescribed by legislation.  It was hoped that the National Housing <Col N="340" /> Board which was set up under the Act, would be in a position, in the interval between the passing of the measure and the date prescribed in it before which houses must be completed to qualify for grants, to make this comprehensive survey.  When the Act was passed, however, and came into operation, it was found that there was such a large number of other problems to which the board had to give its attention that it was not possible to make the comprehensive survey that had been anticipated.  Accordingly, it was decided that, rather than let the provisions of the Act providing for grants lapse by the effluxion of time, we should continue to extend these dates from time to time, as it became necessary, pending the inquiry which had been contemplated from the very beginning.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the position became such that it was clear that one inquiry could not deal with the problem as a whole, and, accordingly, it was decided to investigate one section of the problem, the one which seemed to be easiest to deal with, although it was at the same time, perhaps, the most urgent and the largest, that is, the problem of housing for the people as it exists in Dublin to-day.  A committee was set up to investigate that problem.  Unfortunately, it was set up only in the beginning of 1939, and it was not able to get really under way prior to the outbreak of the war.  In consequence of that, and the conditions which were created here, and the special problems which had to be tackled, many of the members of the Housing Commission had to devote their attention to other pressing and urgent duties, and the commission has not been able to make the report which was intended.</P>
    <P>What in this situation were we to do?  We had either to let, as I say, the system of grants lapse, or we had to continue them from time to time by introducing amending legislation, dealing with that one point, because it was quite clear that no Minister for Finance would permit the principal provisions of this Act to be hacked about and amended in a piece-meal way.  The 1932 Act was, as I have said, a comprehensive housing code, and could <Col N="341" /> only be dealt with comprehensively. In order, however, to ease the situation, the Minister, at the instance of myself and my Department, has agreed to allow these dates to be extended, and to allow the present provisions of the Housing Act which relate to the building of houses in the rural areas by private individuals, and, in urban and rural areas, by public utility societies, to continue to operate.</P>
    <P>That is the main purpose of the Bill. We have also secured his consent to making two minor amendments in the Act.  One is to meet the wishes of the Public Accounts Committee, as I have explained, and the other is to give public utility societies who propose to erect dwellings for the rehousing of people who have been displaced from slum areas or from houses unfit for human occupation, the same facilities as are given to a municipal authority doing the same work.</P>
    <P>It must be made quite clear that we cannot propose to deal with this big problem in a piecemeal way.  The main lines upon which the Government is prepared to deal with this problem have been laid down in the Housing Act of 1932.  The provision of assistance, by grants to those who are endeavouring to tackle this problem of providing decent homes for the people, is the most generous I know of.  I do not think there is any other State, whether it be in the Antipodes or in Europe or across the Atlantic, which makes the same generous provision for the housing of the people as we have done in the Housing Act of 1932.  I think that is a proof that we have not approached this problem in a niggling or penurious fashion, but are prepared to deal with it in a manner commensurate with the hardship and suffering which lack of housing inflicts on the unfortunate people.  Therefore I have very little patience, indeed, with criticism such as that which came from Deputy Dockrell.  The Deputy knows &mdash;better than any other Deputy in this House, perhaps&mdash;the difficulties under which we are labouring with regard to housing for the people of Dublin.  He is familiar with the building trade, and knows all the difficulties that arise. <Col N="342" /> Yet, instead of getting up here and generously appreciating what we have been doing and what the Corporation has been doing in this matter, he says that the Government has been doing nothing for housing since 1939.  I would not have minded that sort of criticism from a Deputy not as well informed as Deputy Dockrell in regard to the realities of the situation, but I do not think it is helpful criticism when it comes from a Deputy who ought to know better.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has mentioned the amount of the grants.  I have already explained that, in the present circumstances, it is not possible for us to consider any alteration in the amount of the grants.  This matter will arise for regular examination and consideration as soon as anything like normal conditions have been restored, but there is no point in asking the Legislature, with all the other pressing matters awaiting attention, to turn round now and tear up the Housing Act of 1932 and bring in a whole new system of State assistance for public authorities who are carrying out housing schemes, at a time when we do not know what the needs of the future will be.  The question of what further assistance is to be given by the State to local authorities carrying out housing projects must necessarily await two things&mdash;first of all, the reception and consideration of the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Housing Conditions in Dublin and, secondly, the restoration of conditions here to something like normal.  We cannot propose to legislate for the future when there are so many uncertain factors in the situation.  Accordingly, the local authorities will have to carry on as best they can, just as the Government has to carry on as best it can.</P>
    <P>We would like to speed up all the good work that has been done since 1932 and 1933.  We had hoped that, at any rate, when we came to leave office, one monument we would leave behind us would have been a solution of the housing problem.  We have not been able to do that, but we are trying to carry on, with a full realisation of the difficulties.  Although I am sympathetic to the outlook of Deputy Martin O'Sullivan and members of the Corporation <Col N="343" /> and of public authorities in general, in matters of this kind, I cannot hold out at this stage any hope that there will be an increase in the scale of financial assistance at present being given to the local authorities.  I am sorry that that is so, but I am afraid we have to put it out of our minds until the future becomes brighter.</P>
    <P>I would like very much to be in a position to accede to the pleas of Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy McCann on behalf of the Charlemont Public Utility Society. I may say I have been greatly struck by the work which this society has succeeded in doing.  It was my appreciation of the value of that work, when my attention was drawn to it, that moved me to approach the Minister for Finance to permit us to encourage public utility societies to undertake works of this kind.  I know that the Minister for Finance was very sympathetic in the matter, but he was up against what is really a fundamental principle&mdash;it was not possible for him to allow people to carry out works on one basis and then ask the State to give them public moneys which those who had undertaken the works did not envisage when they embarked upon them.</P>
    <P>I would like very much if we could make this grant retrospective, but I have to appreciate the position of my colleague in the matter and I am sorry to say I do not think there would be any chance that this proposal, which would set up a precedent which might have undesirable consequences, would be accepted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley asked me whether one could get a reconstruction grant for a thatched house.  There is no reason I know of why a thatched house would be debarred, and I can assure the Deputy that it would be quite eligible.</P>

      <P>Tairgim: Go léighfear an Bille an dara huair.  Tá dhá rud le déanamh <Col N="345" /> sa mBille seo: an chéad rud aea sin an dlí a bhaineas le coinníollacha seirbhíse oifigeach de chuid na gcoistí gairm-oideachais a chur ar aon dul leis an dlí a hachtuíodh san Acht Rialtais Áitiúil, 1941, agus sé an dara rud atá le déanamh socrú a dhéanamh i gcóir tuilleadh airgid a chur ar fáil do choistí gairm-oideachais óir tá barr-phoinnte an teacht-isteach a thig leo fháil faoi'n Acht Oideachais Ghairme Beatha, 1930, bainte amach ag cuid mhaith aca anois.  Baintear feidhm as an mBille seo, freisin, le roinnt mionleasú a dhéanamh ar an bPríomh-Acht.</P>
      <P>Nuair a bhíthcas ag cur an Achta Rialtais Áitiúil, 1941, le chéile, ní raibh sé cómhgarach coistí gairm-oideachais a áireamh ar na húdaráis áitiúla a mbaineann an tAcht leo, toisc nár bhain ach forálacha áirthe san Acht sin le hoifigeacha de chuid na gcoistí gairm-oideachais.  Is le teoranna aoise le haghaidh oifige, le oifigeacha a chur ar fionnraoi agus a chur as oifig ag an Aire a bhaineas na forálacha sin.  Tá na forálacha sin á gcur isteach sa mBille seo anois i nAltanna a sé, a seacht agus a hocht agus tá siad ar aon dul leis na forálacha a bhaineas leis an gcás san Acht Rialtais Áitiúil, 1941, ag Altanna fiche trí, fiche seacht agus fiche a cúig.  Ina theannta sin, tá beartuithe go mbainfidh na forálacha seo feasta le gach oifigeach de chuid na gcoistí gairm-oideachais is cuma iad a bheith i seilbh oifige le linn rithte don Acht nó gan a bheith.  Déanann Alt a 9 den Bhille socrú dá réir sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rinne an tAcht Rialtais Áitiúil, 1941, athghairm ar chodacha áirithe den <i>Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order</i>, 1898, codacha a bhaineas le dí-cháiliú ar bheith mar bhaill de chóluchtaí puiblí agus a cuireadh i mbaint le baill de chuid na gCoistí Gairm-Oideachais faoi Alt 4 don Acht Oideachais Ghairme Beatha (Leasú), 1936.  Dí-cháiliú a thárlas i ngeall ar bhaint a bheith ag ball le connradh idir é féin agus cólucht puiblí atá i gceist ins na codacha a hathghairmeadh ach ní bhaineann an dí-cháiliú sin feasta le baill de na comhairlí contae agus le baill d'údaráis áitiúla eile, mar is ag na bainisteóirí contae atá an chomhacht faoi láthair le <Col N="346" /> connraithe dhéanamh.  Chó fada is bhaineas le baill na gcoistí gairm-oideachais baincann na forálacha a hathghairmeadh leis an gcás fós, agus ní mór, dá bhrí sin, iad a achú arís i dtreo go leanfaidh siad i bhfeidhm i gcás na mball sin.  Déantar sco in Alt 2 den Bhille agus san am chéanna athghairmtear Alt 4 den Acht Oideachais Ghairme Beatha (Leasú), 1936.</P>
    <P>Tá an méid a bhaineas le cúrsaí airgid le fáil in Alt 4 agus in Alt 5. Nuair a ritheadh an tAcht Oideachais Ghairme Beatha sa bliain 1930, bhí súil againn go leathnódh scéimeanna na gcoistí gairm-oideachais do réir a chéile go ceann deich mblian no dhá bhlian déag.  Dá réir sin rinneadh socrú faoi'n Acht i dtreo go mbeadh an scála ioncuim ionmhéaduithe do réir feoirlinge (¼d.) no leathphingne (½d.) sa bpunt ar luach ion-rátuithe an limistéir ach gan dul thar 4d. sa bpunt i limistéirí contae ná 6d. sa bpunt i gcontae-bhuirgí agus ins na bailecheanntair sceidealta.  D'fhéadfadh coiste contae barr-phoinnte a ioncuim a shroisint sa mbliain a thosuigh an chéad lá d'Aibreán, 1940, agus i gcás coiste chontae-bhuirge no bhailecheanntair sceidealta ní sroisfí an barr-phoinnte go dtí an chéad lá d'Aibreán, 1942.  Ceapadh dá mbreathnuíodh na coistí rómpa go stuama go mbeadh barr a bhfás déanta aca faoi'n am sin.  Shrois ceithre coistí as na 27 coistí conndae barr-phoinnte a n-ioncuim sa mbliain 1940, agus as an aon cheann déag de choistí bailecheanntair shrois ceithre cinn aca a mbarr-phoinnte féin sa mbliain 1942. I láthair na huaire, tá barr-phoinnte an ráta sroiste ag cúig coistí déag ar fad ach níl barr-phoinnté a bhfás bainte amach aca fós agus níl rómpa anois ach teacht-isteach atá seasta agus caiteachas bliantúil atá ag dul i méid.</P>
    <P>Ní i ngeall ar lochtaí ar fhorálacha an Phríomh-Achta a thárla sé seo. Leis an bhfírinne a rádh d'éirigh go han-mhaith leis an Acht agus tá ag éirghe go han-mhaith leis fós, cé gur seirbhís beagnach úr-nua a bhí le cur ar bun faoi.  Chuir an tAcht ar chumas choistí ghairm-oideachais oideachas a bhí ag teastáil go géar ina gcuid <Col N="347" /> ceanntracha a chur ar fáil.  Tóigeadh céad agus ceithre cinn déag de scoltacha nua gan bacadh leis an méid leathnú agus feabhas a cuireadh ar shean-scoltacha.  Ina theannta sin ceapadh trí chéad oide lán-ama sa mbreis agus dá chéad oide páirt-ama &mdash;oidí a bhfuair cuid mhaith aca oiliúnt speisialta faoi'n Roinn Oideachais. Leagadh an scéim oibre sco amach go cúramach do réir an méid airgid a bhéadh ar fáil ag gach coiste faoi leith agus, go dtí gur thuit ualach áirithe ortha nach raibh súil leis, níor braitheadh nach mbéadh an socrú a rinneadh sa bPríomh-Acht sáthach maith.  Ní raibh súil, cuir i gcás, leis an méadú a tháinig ar an mbonus costais bheatha a d'árduigh ón uimhir 55 ins na blianta 1933-35&mdash;am ar ceapadh roinnt mhaith oidí nua i dtosach&mdash;go dtí 85, an áit ar horduíodh dó stop i mí Iúil, 1940. Ina theannta sin, o thosnuigh an cogadh, chuir an méadú mór a tháinig ar ábhar teine, ar sholas, ar abhair do na ranganna agus ar choinneál suas na scol isteach go mór ar scéimeanna airgid na gcoistí gairm-oideachais, agus rinne an bonus éigeandála a híocadh o Mhí Eanair, 1941, breis ceataighe dhóibh.</P>
    <P>Gan bacadh chor ar bith leis na deacrachtaí ó thaobh airgid a bhíos le réiteach ag coistí áirithe, ní ceart a dhearmad nach féidir leathnú ar bith, dá fheabhas dá mbeadh sé, a chur i gcion mara mbídh cúl beag airgid ag coistí gairm-oideachais le tarraingt air.  Mar shompla ar an gceatuighe sin d'oil an Roinn roinnt timthirí le bheith ina n-oidí Gaedhilge le goirid le cuidiú le gluaiseacht na teangan faoi scéimeanna gairm-oideachais, ach cé go raibh fonn ar choistí áirithe na hoidí sin a fhostú ní raibh ar a gcumas sin a dhéanamh cheal airgid.  Thárla an deacracht chéanna le goirid freisin i gcás daoine eile a cheapadh&mdash;oidí tuaith-eolaidheachta agus múinteóirí adhmadóireachta.</P>
    <P>Tá socrú á dhéanamh, dá bhrí sin, faoi Alt 4 den Bhille an ráta is aoirde a árdú 1d., sa bpunt i ngach cás, sé sin le rá, o 4d. go dtí 5d. i gcás limistéirí gairm-oideachais contac, agus ó 6d. go dtí 7d. i gcás na gcontac-bhuirgí agus <Col N="348" /> na mbaile-cheanntar sceidealta.  Tá súil agam go gcuirfidh an méadú seo ar an ráta áitiúil, in éineacht leis an deontas áirithe atá iníoctha ag an Stát leo faoi Alt 53 den Phríomh-Acht, ar chumas na gcoistí gairm-oideachais sin a bhfuil cruadhóg airgid ortha a gcuid fadhbanna a réiteach, agus go leigfidh sin do scéimeanna gairm-oideachais i gcoitinne fás iomlán a dhéanamh do réir mar beifear réidh dóibh.</P>

    <P>(2)  Deontaisí breise a háirmhítear do réir an méadú a bheas ag an ráta le haghaidh gairm-oideachais ar mhéid ráta de 3d. sa bpunt i gcontae-bhuirgí agus i mbaile-cheanntair, agus ar mhéid ráta de 2d. i gContae Chorcaighe agus ar mhéid ráta de 1¾d. i ngach ceanntar eile.</P>
    <P>Tá beagán thar trí punt ar fad de dheontaisí á dtabhairt ag an Stát in aghaidh gach dhá phunt atá á chur ar fáil ag na húdaráis áitiúla iad féin.</P>
    <P>Tá socrú déanta i gCuid V den Phríomh-Acht le oideachas leanúna a dhéanamh oibliogáideach no, mar adeirtear de ghnáth, aois fágáilte na scoile a árdú o cheithre bliana déag go dtí sé bliana déag.  Tá foráil sa gcuid sin den Acht freisin a thugas údarás do choistí gairm-oideachais na costaisí a bheas ortha ag cur Cuid V den Acht in éifeacht a íoc as a gcuid cistí féin. Nuair a cuirtear Cuid V den Acht in éifeacht i gceanntar ar bith, ní mór do choiste gairm-oideachais an cheanntair sin cúrsaí oibliogáideacha a dtabharfar 180 uair a' chluig de theagasc ionnta a chur ar fáil, sin no cúrsaí saordhálacha a dtabharfar 180 uair a' chluig ar a laighead de theagasc ionnta.  Níor cuireadh Cuid V in éifeacht fós ach i dhá gceanntar&mdash; Cathair Chorcaighe agus Cathair Luimnigh.  Sa dá chathair seo, tá sé de oibliogáid ar dhaoine óga idir 14 bliana agus 16 bliana d'aois nach mbíonn ag freastal ar scoil nó rang ar bith eile freastal a dhéanamh ar <Col N="349" /> chúrsaí speisialta teagaisc a mhaireas cúig uaire a' chluig sa ló lá amháin sa tseachtain ar feadh 36 seachtain sa mbliain.  Cúrsaí seadh iad seo a thugas na coistí gairm-oideachais sa dá cheanntar seo de bhreis ar na cúrsaí lán-ama saordhálacha bhíos ann de ló agus de bhreis ar na cúrsaí saordhálacha a tugtar um thráthnóna.</P>
    <P>Sa Meán Fhómhair, 1938, a tosuíodh na cúrsaí oibliogáideacha i gCathair Chorcaighe, mar gur ceapadh gurb í sin an áit do b'feiliúnaighe le triail a bhaint as an scéim.  D'eirigh go han-mhaith leis, agus i nDeire Fómhair, 1942, cuireadh i bhfeidhm i gCathair Luimnigh é.  Ó thárla cistí an dá Choiste seo bheith ar fad faoi iadh le haghaidh a gcuid cúrsaí saordhálacha, ní fhéadfadh siad Cuid V den Acht a chur i bhfeidhm mara mbeadh gur híocadh leo as an bPrímh-Chiste deontaisí speisialta breise den mhéid a ghlan costaisí na gcúrsaí oibliogáideacha. Cé nach é an cás céanna é ag gach coiste gairm-oideachais, beidh sé soiléar go leor ón méid atá ráite agam cheana, maidir le hAlt 4 den Bhille seo i dtaobh go leor de na coistí gairm-oideachais agus a gcúrsaí airgid, go gcaithfear an t-airgead a mbeidh gádh leis a chur ar fáil do na coistí gairm-oideachais má táthar le Cuid V den Phríomh-Acht a chur in éifeacht go generálta.  Tá beartuithe seo a dhéanamh le hAlt 5 den Bhille seo.  Tá socrú déanta san alt sin le go bhféadfaidh an tAire Oideachais i gceanntar ar bith a mbeadh Cuid V den Acht i bhfeidhm ann a ordú don údarás áitiúil rátúcháin pé suim is leor leis a íoc leis an gcoiste má bhíonn sé sásta nach leor chuige sin na cistí atá ag an gcoiste gairm-oideachais cheana. Ní féidir leis an suim bhreise seo a dhul thar 2d. sa bpunt ar an luacháil ionrátuithe ins na ceithre contaebhuirgí agus i nDún Laoghaire, agus, i gcás gach ceanntar eile, ní féidir leis dul thar 1d. sa bpunt.</P>

      <P>This Bill bears some relation in its terms to the Bill which deals with county committees of agriculture.  It is practically the same so far as officials are concerned, but it is a more attractive effort than the other Bill so far as the financial provisions embodied in it are concerned. The other portion of it which deals with disqualification is much the same as the provision in the other Bill.  The only point I have not been able to follow is in connection with subsection (3) which sets out the powers of the Minister under Section 37 relating to a deficiency in the supply of continuation education and so on.  The Minister did not give us any information as to what is implied by this addition to Section 37 of the original Act.  The section sets out that the Minister may specify particular subjects. That is my interpretation of the section, but the Minister gave us no information as to what those subjects were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no particular subject in question at the moment. There seems to be a doubt, and while, under the Principal Act, the Minister has power to require a vocational education committee to make such provision for the supply of continuation or technical education in its area as it thinks necessary, it is not quite clear from the wording of the section that he has power to impose upon a committee the obligation of teaching a particular subject.  It is to cover that position, lest there might be any difficulties with regard to particular subjects, that this section is brought in.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say if it is being relieved by the financial provisions of this measure?  However, he can answer that in his reply.  So far as Section 2 is concerned, I do not enter any objection, but I think a little amplification of the Minister's statement with regard to Section 3 is desirable.  We should first like to know whether there has been co-operation by vocational committees with the Ministry in connection with the administration of the Act. Continuation or technical education has been referred to in many places throughout the country during the last few years, and I think the House should learn from the Minister whether he is satisfied with the progress of that part of the work of vocational committees generally.  So far as Section 4, and, I suppose, Section 5, are concerned, we have to accept the altered circumstances of the last few years and the possibility that the original estimate of the cost was not up to the mark.  I feel sure that vocational committees through the country would expend any extra moneys which they are entitled to levy to the advantage of the students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come then to the final portion of the Bill, which, on its face, appears to be almost the principal purpose of the introduction of the Bill, apart from the normal necessity by reason of the emergency for having Section 4 in the Bill.  What I have to say on this measure is on all fours with what I said on the Bill dealing with county committees.  No matter what changes have taken place in the law regarding State servants or servants of local authorities, it does not, on its face, appear to be right that one party only to a contract of service should alter its terms, without consultation or some measure of agreement with the persons affected.  Nobody in the House or outside it with any sense will stand for retaining in office a person who is unfitted for that office, but the question <Col N="353" /> of unfitness is capable of variation. It may be unfitness, so far as the person's qualifications are concerned or so far as his suitability for the particular duty he is performing is concerned.  The State and the children are entitled to get the most proficient teachers available, and it is the duty of the State and of the vocational committee to determine the employment of any person not up to that standard, but it is not right that an official or teacher, who was efficient at the time of his appointment and who is now found not to be so, should be deprived of statutory rights which he had prior to the adoption of this higher standard. I think the approach of the Ministry to this question ought to be on the basis of what I have said.</P>
    <P>Two or three variations may occur in connection with this matter.  First of all, a teacher may have been appointed at an advanced age, say, 50 years of age.  He brought to the school an experience ranging over 30 years.  Perhaps he took up the appointment at a smaller salary than he was earning outside.  Perhaps the attraction that the appointment had for him was that he had a chance of serving for 20 years and then getting a pension. In determining the matter, we have to take into account the claims of a person in that position.  Merely drawing a line now and saying that no teacher will be employed above a certain age, does not appear to me to be fair to the teachers.  That is the first point.</P>
    <P>The second point is that if a line be so drawn, the Minister should undertake that this will be done at the end of the school term and not, let us say, after the first week of the term or in the middle of the term, thus putting the committee to the trouble of getting a substitute, because it is undesirable to change a teacher during the course of the term.  Therefore, it ought to be done at the end of the term, even though it might mean an additional year of service for the official concerned. The third point is that, in the case of some of these officials, my information is that they applied for and got leave of absence to improve their qualifications and, having done that, they either took service again <Col N="354" /> with the committee with whom they had been serving or were employed by another vocational committee.  In a case of that sort, I think that, whatever service was rendered to the vocational committee from the commencement, ought to count, even if it were broken by a temporary absence of that sort.</P>
    <P>The fourth point I would put is that, in the case of those officials of advanced years whose superannuation would be negligible by reason of the age at which they entered the service, the Minister should give an undertaking that there will be an addition made to the number of years of service.  I am not putting that by way of asking for a concession.  I am putting it, in the first place, on the ground of fair play.  Under the legislation in operation in this country before we commenced to manage our own affairs, the usual superannuation allowance given on the abolition of an office was two-thirds of the salary.  I am not even making a case that that should be given.  I am making the case that some years should be added to the service, say, one year for every three years or every five years of service.</P>
    <P>The last point is that the Minister now takes upon himself authority to suspend an officer of a vocational committee. By an officer I mean a teacher or any other official employed by the committee.  I put it to the Minister that he ought to take power to get the vocational committee to suspend the officer.  Then he ought to hold his inquiry and, having received the report in connection with that inquiry, he should transmit the decision to the committee and then let the determination of the service of the person concerned rest with the committee.  A complaint with regard to an official, I suggest, should be dealt with in the same way.  I have experience of one case where, through a series of mishaps extending over a whole succession of Departments, an official of this State was on the point of being dismissed, although really no strong case was made for his dismissal.  It was a consolation to me that the responsible officer in my Department, having reviewed the matter, found that there was no case against that man.  I want <Col N="355" /> to ensure that we shall have a safeguard against anything like that happening. Again, there are occasions when a central authority, with the best will in the world, acting on the inforination at their disposal, may take certain action against an official.  If the matter were dealt with by the local committee in charge it might happen that an explanation, which possibly would not find its way to the Minister, would be given.  In that way the interruption in the service of the person concerned and the disturbance which is occasioned by an inquiry, and so on, would be avoided.</P>
    <P>These are the principal points I wish to put in connection with this matter. I am not authorised to speak on behalf of any officials in the vocational education service.  I have discussed it with people in order to see if it would be possible to make this measure appear less of a penal measure.  I put the matter shortly in this form.  We will not deny to the Minister the right to ensure that the officials or the teachers in these schools are of the highest possible standard, and possess the highest qualifications.  We do say, however, that we have no right to do anything which would savour of hardship or unfairness in dealing with these officials or teachers who, during the period this system has been in operation, have rendered good service to the State and have done their best, according to their ability, to carry out the wishes of those in authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no general principle involved in the discussion of this Bill.  There is, however, as has been pointed out by Deputy Cosgrave, a close similarity to powers taken by the Minister for Agriculture in the Bill which has been given a Second Reading to-day.  We may say in regard to this Bill what has been said in regard to that measure, that there is an invasion of the democratic rights of these committees and of the officers who function under them.  We, in this House, I think, have to act as a barrier between the rights of these officials and any infringement of those rights, no matter how well intentioned that <Col N="356" /> infringement may be on the part of the Ministry.  The Minister for Agriculture in this invasion formed a bridgehead to the north of the citadel.  Now, the Minister for Education proposes to form another bridgehead to the south and, between them, they are going to fan out&mdash;to use modern parlance&mdash;and take away many of the hard-won rights of officers in these two similar and closely related services.</P>
      <P>We might be asked to look upon this Bill in a liberal manner, not to take everything that is in it in its narrowest sense but, in order to safeguard these rights, we must, I submit, view everything in the narrowest possible sense, even though we might give the greatest possible measure of goodwill to the Minister in his implementation of the Bill.  I think, with Deputy Cosgrave, that everyone who knows the service, who has been connected with it either as a member of a committee &mdash;as many Deputies have been&mdash;or actually working in the service, will agree that it is the aim, ambition and hope of the officers that the standard of efficiency should be the highest possible, not only for national reasons, not only for reasons of their obligations to the citizens, but from the very narrow professional reason that, by maintaining high standards in their profession, they elevate that profession and give it a standing it would not have were it in any way considered to be inefficient or unworthy of the task that devolves upon it.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason that the officers who are concerned under this Bill are very disquieted by its provisions.  They may be wrong&mdash;the Minister may satisfy their minds by his declaration in this House; he may give us an entirely different interpretation of the Bill from that which the cold words would convey&mdash;but their view of the matter is that there is a deliberate attempt in the Bill to destroy the security of tenure which has been enjoyed by the officers of this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To our surprise, we see that the Minister puts as the first part of his purpose in this Bill the bringing into line of the conditions of service of the <Col N="357" /> officers of the vocational education committees and those that already obtain under the Local Government Act, 1941, and only second the making of provision for additional financial assistance.  One would imagine by the way the Bill is drafted, the precedence and priority given to the financial provisions, that these would take first place in his consideration of the Bill. However, whether they are first or second, the provisions regarding these officers require very close scrutiny and earnest examination by this House.  I do not think it can be passed over in the manner indicated by the Minister's remarks, that it was not found convenient at the time of the drafting of the Local Government Act, 1941, to include the vocational education committees among the local authorities to which the Act applies, and that the present is found to be a propitious time to do it.  Even were that correct, even were the statements in regard to the sections in that Local Government Act, and their relation to the sections of this Act, correct&mdash;although I think we would have to reserve judgment on that matter until we have had a closer examination&mdash;yet, that should not prevent us from refusing, if that is within our power, further sanction to these discriminations against officers.  The Minister for Agriculture, in introducing his amending Bill, used much the same phraseology, but the actual provisions inserted in his Bill are not at all as far-reaching and not at all as onerous as those which we find in this Bill, as I will proceed to show as we go along.</P>
    <P>This Bill consists of four parts.  I am not going to deal with all of them.  I assume that there are other Deputies who have a better right to deal with the questions relating to the committees and the questions relating to finance.  As far as I can judge, the four parts of the Bill are: first, the question of the qualification, or disqualification, of members of the vocational education committees; second, the requisition to supply education in particular subjects&mdash;with that we are in general agreement; third, the contributions by the rating authorities towards normal schemes, such as obtain at present, and towards an extension of what has come to be termed compulsory continuation <Col N="358" /> education.  The fourth, and the last part with which I am primarily concerned, is that which relates to the conditions of officers under these vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Section 3 gives a more explicit definition of the powers already taken by the Minister in Section 37 of the Principal Act.  That has been covered by Deputy Cosgrave by way of question and answer.  I take it to mean that the Minister can compel a committee to provide instruction in some particular subjects, if the original section in the Principal Act is right, this further definition of the Minister's powers would, I consider, also be right.  The point might be made, however, even in regard to this, that there should be some form of understanding between the committee and the Department in reference to any extra subject.  I can visualise quite well that there are committees which might not, under certain circumstances, be prepared to carry out instruction in certain subjects which would be necessary from an economic and industrial point of view in their own locality, and that the Department might be better advised than the local committee as to what would be required by the citizens generally in that area in the way of vocational education.  The Minister should have the right, therefore, I think, to make provision for carrying out such instruction as is necessary but there should be some form of round table conference.  There probably will be, but it does not appear to be mentioned in the Act.  There should be some method of obtaining expression of views from the committee and whatever difficulties the committee has in the matter or whatever point of view it has in regard to a particular subject of instruction should be thoroughly considered by the Department before there is an attempt to compel them to adopt any subject for instruction.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 are the financial sections.  To put them in brief&mdash;they have been dealt with fully by the Minister&mdash;they increase the maximum rate by a penny in the pound, that is, from sixpence to sevenpence in the county borough and urban districts, and fourpence <Col N="359" /> to fivepence in the counties. There is a well-considered case for that, which has been given by the Minister and we need not dilate upon it.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that, if the scheme of vocational education is to coutinue, is to form a part of our national life and is to develop, the funds at present available are insufficient and an increase is necessary.  Owing to the fall in the purchasing power of money&mdash;the pound to-day, we are told by the economist, is worth only 12/3&mdash;there is a very good reason for improving the finances of the scheme.  The scheme has expanded since the Act of 1930 and there are now 114 new schools in addition to those which were carried out under the old scheme.  Under that new development, there are about 300 additional full-time teachers and about 200 part-time teachers.  All that would put an extra strain on the finances of the scheme, and the Minister is quite right in taking additional power to stabilise the finances of the committees.</P>
    <P>We must also look to post-war development and the tremendous extension of technical education, particularly in view of changes in our economy and industry and a better appreciation by the mass of the people of the value of technical education.  I believe the work already done and the changing circumstances, will make vocational education after the emergency more highly prized by the average citizen and that it will be of greater value to the State.  Section 5 gives the Minister power in areas where the compulsory scheme&mdash;Part V of the Principal Act&mdash;is in operation or fixed to come into operation, to compel the levy of a rate above the maximum allowed by the previous section. This, too, has been extensively dealt with by the Minister and very little extra requires to be said.  It should be noted that the extra penny required is optional where compulsory continuation education is not in operation. There is no guarantee, however, that the Minister will give any equivalent grant from State funds, but he may do so.  Under Section 53 of the Principal Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" />&ldquo;the Minister may, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, make grants to vocational education committees in aid of expenditure under annual schemes in accordance with regulations made by the Minister with the approval of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and he shall take into consideration certain things when doing so.</P>
    <P>You, Sir, in your capacity of private Deputy, made, on the second Reading of the Principal Act, in 1930, a special plea for a grant of £1 per £1 by the State.  I think I am right in saying &ldquo;you&rdquo; in this connection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>You made an eloquent plea for an equivalent grant by the State, a grant of £1 for every £1 put up by the local authority.  We have not yet achieved that, even after the passage of all these years.  There should be power to enable the Minister to provide for the development of technical education and the Minister should try to persuade the Minister for Finance to make such provision.  With the expansion of the vocational education scheme, this additional financial provision will be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we are on finance, I would refer briefly to the amount paid for vocational education.  In some quarters, and particularly in one newspaper, there appears to be great apprehension in regard to this matter.  It has been stated that excessive sums have been paid out and that there has been lavish expenditure.  I submit that, out of the total of £5,000,000 spent on education, only £370,000 is given direct from the State to vocational education, which is, roughly, 7½ per cent.  The rates themselves provide at present only £207,000, which is not a large sum and which is not large enough.  The same people who criticise the lavish expenditure on vocational education call, at the same time, for a higher technological standard in this country.  Those two views are, I think, incompatible.  I say this in order to support whatever measures are being <Col N="361" /> taken under this Bill for extra finance for the scheme.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that this branch provides all the post primary education, except, of course, the secondary education, which caters, as we know, for the respectable professions, more or less.  The children of the masses of the people go to the vocational schools, which are looked upon, quite rightly, as the poor man's university.  As such, they are credited by the people with doing very necessary work and are worthy of every support from the State.</P>
    <P>If you want to consider the question of cost, technical education is probably the cheapest form of education that we have in this State. Primary education costs, per pupil, £9 18s. 8d.; secondary education costs, per pupil, £13 17s. 4d., and post-primary education, which is really vocational education, because the other sections of it are insignificant, costs only £8 13s. 11d.  As well as carrying on the normal educational programme, these schools, in these sections, deal with art and science and there are lectures for the adult population, which is a very good contribution to national work and has proved to be of exceptional importance in a time of emergency.  For instance, during the food emergency that we had in this country, it is stated in the report of the Department of Education that 120,000 people attended lectures given by domestic economy instructresses in relation to the proper preparation of emergency food.  That was a national service, and a service of that description well deserves increased financial support.  Secondary education receives as much as technical education can get from the State and tha rates combined&mdash; roughly £500,000.  It is not that we want to have less spent on secondary education, but to show that we are not people who are, so far as education goes, wallowing in the lap of luxury, or that there is any lavish expenditure of State funds on technical education.</P>
    <P>Now we come to Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9.  These affect the rights of the officers and, from their nature, there is no other course open to me but to look for amendments of these sections.  I <Col N="362" /> regard them as an attempt at an extension of arbitrary authority which should not pass a democratic Legislature like this without severe scrutiny. I am taking the narrow view, and I am taking it purposely and deliberately. If we were to take the more liberal view, perhaps we would not give such emphasis to the sections; we might let them pass; but, once having passed here under whatever pretext, they become statutory principles, and it will be found extremely difficult in the future to remove them.</P>
    <P>Section 6 relates to the authority of the Minister to fix a retiring age.  In fact, if you read it as it appears in the Bill, he can fix the lower as well as the upper age limits.  Most officers, of course, are looking at the upper age limit but, taking a narrow view, the Minister can fix a lower limit; he can fix an age and a person may not enter the service until he has attained that age.  The main concern, of course, of existing officers, is the retiring age, the upper limit, and that requires to be dealt with in even a more extensive manner, perhaps, than that which we gave on the Agriculture (Amendment) Bill lately before us.  I may point out that up in this an officer had the option to retire at 65, but he could not be compelled to do so unless he was in a state of ill-health or incapable of carrying on his duties.  He could retire if he had 25 years' service, but he could not be compelled to do so if he was fit to carry on.  That means that hitherto there has been no specified retiring age in the service.  Now it appears that one will be fixed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Retirement up to the present was governed by Section 44, sub-sections (1) and (2) of the Local Government Act of 1925.  It might be well to remind the House of the provisions of those sub-sections.  Section 44 (1) sets out that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A local body shall with the consent of the Minister grant to a pensionable officer in their employment who either (a) has attained the age of 65 years and has at least 25 years' service: or (b) becomes incapable of discharging the duties of his office <Col N="363" /> with efficiency by reason of permanent infirmity of mind or, body or of old age and has not less than ten years' service upon his resigning or otherwise ceasing to hold his office, an annual allowance for his life not greater than two-thirds of his yearly salary and emoluments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) sets out that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A local body shall with the consent of the Minister grant to a pensionable officer in their employment who has at least ten years' service and (a) who is removed from office for a cause other than misconduct or incapacity or (b) whose office is abolished or (c) whose position has in the opinion of the Minister been materially altered to his detriment owing to changes in the conditions of his employment made without reasonable cause and who resigns his office with the consent of the Minister, an annual allowance for his life not greater than two-thirds of his yearly salary and emoluments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These were the conditions which every officer understood would apply to him on entering the service, Now it appears that by an Act of this Legislature, long after he has entered the service, these conditions will be materially altered.</P>
    <P>There are other points to be considered on Section 6.  Up to recently all vocational education officers joined the service after the age of 25 years. This is not a service which the youngest men join.  The officers are mature when they come into the service, and that was especially so in the early years of the technical instruction scheme, when the Department had no training facilities or courses, and officers on appointment were required to have had previous business and educational experience.  These men are all affected by this measure.  You must take into account, too, that the date of the adoption of the Agricultural and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act, 1899, does not permit any officer a full 40 years' service.  If appointed after the age of 25 years, as most were, none of them would have 40 years' service around 65 years which, I assume, is <Col N="364" /> the age that will be fixed by the Minister. There are few graduates at the University who finish before 25 years and many of them have to wait several years for an appointment.  Even after appointment, if they are lucky enough to secure that from a local committee, they have to spend several years on probation, and rightly&mdash;that is one of the conditions of service&mdash;until they are appointed as permanent whole-time officers and become pensionable.</P>
    <P>The passing of the 1899 Act did not mean that the technical instruction schools arose immediately.  Several years elapsed before most of the schemes came into effect.  We have reviewed the situation and found that 1905 and 1907 were the years when most early appointments were made.  Those officers are a long time in the service and they are coming near the retiring age.  The Dáil will see how the actual dates affect this question of retirement and pensions.</P>
    <P>There is another point in reference to these officers: that a condition inherent in their appointment and implied in the provisions of the superannuation clauses of the Local Government Act was that they were to continue in employment until rendered unfit by permanent infirmity, incapacity or such like cause.  We have no objection, and I think few in this House would have any objection, to the fixing of a retiral age.  It was suggested, I believe, by another Deputy that the remarks made on the Agriculture (Amendment) Bill in reference to the same thing meant that we left the door wide open, and that officers could continue on in service until they were 80 or 90 years of age.  That is, of course, absolutely impossible. We have no objection to the fixing of a retiral age, but there must be certain qualifications in regard to that.  We must take into consideration, as I have pointed out, the efficiency of the teacher, his private rights, the work that he has put into vocational education, and the lifetime that he has spent in the service of the State.  If there is to be a retiral age fixed, there should be with it some provision for an arrangement to let officers be credited with added years to bring their service up to 40, or as near 40 as would be <Col N="365" /> deemed equitable in the circumstances of each individual officer.</P>
    <P>This question of added years is nothing new.  We refer to that again, but in fixing the pension, if we do not give the teacher these added years, if we do not allow the officer to be credited with 40 or as near as possible to 40 years, we adverse1y affect him in this way: that until recently, unlike the Civil Service, there were no salary scales in the vocational education schemes, and in many cases years elapsed between the receipts of increments of salary.  Again, in the early stages of the vocational education schemes, the officers were underpaid. Scales were non-existent, and, later on, when they did come into force, they could not be said to remunerate the officers for what they had already suffered in regard to small salaries. Therefore, in the case of pensions granted to officers who have less than the 40 years' service, who have roughly, say, 30 years or something less than that, the officers will be very adversely affected.</P>
    <P>The training and the practical experience required before appointment as a teacher in a vocational education school or the special qualifications required in connection with some particular post, such as the head of a department, a headmaster or a chief executive officer, implied that on appointment the officer was so matured that it would be impossible for him, on the completion of 40 years' service, to be 65 years of age, if we take that as the likely retiring age.  The Department of Local Government has given evidence of the fact that it recognises this state of affairs.  In Circular No. G.15477/25 the Department states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For positions requiring highly technical qualifications it is realised that it may not be possible to secure the services of suitably experienced officers at ages sufficiently youthful to enable them to qualify eventually for the full two-thirds superannuation. In such cases, where the services have been satisfactorily carried out, reasonable additional years might be added to the actual numbers served for the purpose of calculating pensions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> and they suggested, as a maximum, one-third.  I think that this circular which was explanatory of the 1925 Act, showed that the Department approved of this principle of added years when an officer joined the service late in life, or joined because he could not have attained that position without business experience.  In view of the facts that I have adduced I think the House will agree that vocational teachers should either be allowed to continue their service until they reach the forty years' service necessary for a full pension, or if they are retired earlier under this Bill that this principle of added years should be adopted&mdash;that years should be added to their service to enable them to receive the full pension.</P>
    <P>I may say that it is quite obvious to those who know the facts that officers in the vocational education services are not anxious to retire while they are still vigorous and can carry out their duties efficiently, and can be of service to the State.  It is not merely a case of hanging on in order to obtain a pension. They feel that they have a function in life and desire to continue that function as long as it is possible.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is also, if you examine it, a violation of Section 99 of the Principal Act.  I think it would be a deplorable act on the part of this or of any other Legislature to give solemn statutory protection to public servants in one Act&mdash;the Act of 1930&mdash;and then after a lapse of years, and with the development of the Act and when these officers' proved worth is admitted by the Minister, to treat the protection given as scrap paper.  I think the very least, the Minister might do is to exclude existing officers from the provisions of this Bill.  The spirit of the original Act should permeate this amending Bill, and there should be, I think, no amendment by implication. I think that the Minister, if he is not prepared to go to that extent in this Bill, might give some undertaking or some guarantee to the existing officers that they will not be adversely affected by this measure, and that the newcomers, if they like to take service under these conditions, will be free to do so.  It is a contract between them and the Minister, and they should <Col N="367" /> stand or fall by it, but existing officers, officers who are already in the service and who came in under different conditions, should not now be brought within this legislation and adversely affected by it.  They should in all honour be excluded from it.</P>
    <P>I said that this Bill was a violation of Section 99 of the Principal Act, and I think I had better quote the particular sub-sections to show exactly what I mean.  Under sub-sections (2) and (3) of that Act of 1930, there was given a statutory guarantee that the conditions of service and the remuneration of officers of vocational education committees taken over under the Vocational Education Act would not be altered to their detriment.  Sub-section (2) sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every officer transferred by this section shall, subject to the provisions of this section, perform in the service of the vocational education committee to which he is so transferred the like duties as he performed in the service from which he is so transferred.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) sets out:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every officer transferred by this section shall not, in the service of the vocational education committee to which he is so transferred, receive less remuneration or, subject to the provisions of this section, be subject to less beneficial condition of service than the remuneration to which he was entitled and the conditions of service to which he was subject in the service from which he is so transferred.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These were sub-sections which safeguarded the rights of these transferred officers, and obviously the spirit of these sub-sections should continue down through this amending Bill. Further, if the Act were to be worked in a proper spirit, the Minister should also he given power in reference to specified appointments, not only in regard to the ordinary officers but particularly with regard to chief executive officers, head masters and those in very responsible positions, to extend the age or to add years for pension purposes.  There is, as I said, no <Col N="368" /> great desire in the part of these higher executive officers to leave the service. Many of them at present have reached the age of 60 and 62 years, and they are considered by the Department to be still in the full vigour of life and capable of carrying out their duties and functions with the greatest efficiency. Why then should these men be compulsorily retired by any such section?  Many of them, if they were to get the full benefit of their pension, would have to continue much later in life than 65 years and the Minister, I think, should take the power or should modify the sections in the Bill to enable him to grant that benefit.</P>
    <P>Finally, many of the existing officers were recruited and, for all I know, future officers may be recruited, from other branches of the educational service and, for that reason, I think that for superannuation purposes this previous service should be recognised.  In particular, I specify service given under the Commissioners of National Education in Ireland, the Commissioners of Intermediate Education, the primary and secondary branches, the Gaelic League, and even service under the former Congested Districts Board. Officers were taken from all these different spheres and asked to man the vocational education schools.  They were ask to take on this new form of instruction and to develop it.  Their efforts met with success, and I think they should be duly credited with their previous service.  I think we have made a good case for an amendment of that Section 6 and even for the withdrawal of it.  If we cannot get that we might get from the Minister some undertaking or some statement with regard to these existing officers.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is also a violation of the existing rights of officers guaranteed by that Section 99 of the 1930 Act.  It follows the usual pattern which we have examined in the Agriculture (Amendment) Bill.  The section gives power to either a vocational education committee or the Minister to suspend an officer summarily, if there is, in the opinion of such committee or of the Minister, reason to believe that the officer has done something deserving of disciplinary action.  As I said with <Col N="369" /> regard to the Minister for Agriculture &mdash;and the same applies to the Minister for Education&mdash;the phraseology is too loose.  The Minister may have reason to believe anything he likes&mdash;no one can prevent it.  Every one of us can believe anything he wishes and particularly in the sphere of human relations, it is quite easy to believe things which afterwards turn out to have no foundation whatever. Despite that, on the mere belief of the Minister or of the committee, an officer may be suspended.</P>
    <P>Some safeguard should be inserted calling for greater grounds for belief or retarding the movement which results in the suspension of an officer and causes him grave detriment.  An officer may be suspended with the approval of the Minister, but, under sub-section (2), the Minister has power to terminate such suspension when he so wishes, and every such suspension, it states, shall continue until so terminated. If one reads that correctly, the meaning of it is that suspension may be indefinite.  There is no conclusion to be reached, if the Minister does not so wish.  This, of course, is taking a narrow view of the situation, but it is set out in the Bill.  There is nothing to fix a time limit and surely in ordinary justice to the officer there should be some time limit.  No investigation or inquiry could conceivably last indefinitely.  There should be a time limit to prevent the proceedings being drawn out to an unwarranted length, particularly in view of the sections which deal with the remuneration of an officer during suspension.  It follows from the section that, during suspension, an officer, even though not even accused, even though he has not come under inquiry&mdash;there may be no inquiry&mdash;gets no pay whatever.</P>
    <P>His remuneration is suspended with his suspension.  If, after his case has been inquired into, we assume the best, and say he is reinstated, the Minister still has the power to keep his pay, either in whole or in part, or devote it to whatever object he desires or dispose of it as he so wills.  That, I think, is an extremely loose method of dealing with the matter.  One would <Col N="370" /> imagine that there should certainly be some method of recompensing the officer for all he suffered during an unjust suspension.  If the inquiry finds that there was no ground for his suspension, that the whole proceedings were misconceived and taken incorrectly, if he is declared not guilty and, if the movers in the matter, whether the committee or the Minister, are shown to be at fault, even though that fault may have been by no means without justification so far as they can see, yet the person concerned has suffered all through that period from the ignominy of being under suspension and from the loss of his remuneration. If he is not guilty, I say there should be put explicitly in the Bill some section to make it mandatory that he should receive his full remuneration for that time.  It should not be at the discretion of the Minister.  He should not only receive it in full, but there should be some method of recompensing him for the costs that he might incur in defending his case.</P>
    <P>In the 1930 Act, Section 27, there was a slightly different provision.  The Minister could not remove the officer under that Act without having first held a local inquiry, the procedure for which is described at length by Section 105 of the Act.  We need not go into that.  But the holding of an inquiry in itself would not absolve the Minister from having regard to the necessary rights under Section 44 of the Local Government Act.  If the officer were dismissed following such an inquiry, his remedy would be to take his case into the courts, and that is the last resort of the citizen.  In this Bill, however, we find, as I read it, that the Minister is given judicial power.  He is given power to determine these things and, so far as I can see, under this Bill the aggrieved officer could not go into the courts, could not contest the case.  If he has gone through the correct procedure as laid down by the Bill there does not, appear to me to be any further relief for the officer.</P>
    <P>In this sub-section (1) (a) the question of unfitness comes in.  I think I have dealt fully with the view of the officers as a whole on the question of unfitness.  But, is it not rather loosely <Col N="371" /> phrased in the Bill?  Should there not be some further qualification&mdash;that the statutory grounds for the removal of the holder of an office under Section (8) would be the unfitness of such a holder for such an office?  Should there not be some definition of this unfitness?&mdash;educational unfitness, may be. The Minister should have this made more definite in the Bill.  As it stands, unfitness might include any number of things.  It might include the political opinions of the officer.  It might include individual idiosyncrasies.  To put it in the most extravagant way, it might include such things as his views upon matters which might not affect education at all.  He might be quite fit so far as the educational standard was concerned, but, in regard to other standards, he might be considered unfit. Should there not be then in this Section 1 (a) some closer definition of what unfitness means?</P>
    <P>In sub-section (2) there is mention of a local inquiry, but there is no provision in the Bill as to how this is to be constituted.  We do not know whether there will be the right to call witnesses, whether those witnesses are to be examined on oath, or what is to be the power or judicial function of this inquiry.  It mentions &ldquo;any local inquiry&rdquo;.  What does &ldquo;any&rdquo; mean? Who is to hold it?  Is it to be held by an inspector or by the committee, or by the two combined, or is it to be held by some local court?  Finally, is it to have the same meaning as in the Principal Act?  If it is to have the same meaning as in the Principal Act, it should be so stated and there might be no objection to it.</P>
    <P>But the worst sub-section of all is sub-section (3).  The Minister's opinion is the only test here.  It would appear from this sub-section that the Minister has power of dismissal without an inquiry, merely because he is of opinion that the officer should be dismissed. Surely that is a contravention of the Principal Act.  If we are to have democratic rights in this State&mdash;and I am perfectly sure we are all democratically-minded; we are not a totalitarian State&mdash;every accused should have the right of defending <Col N="372" /> himself against an accusation and every citizen the right to be considered innocent until he is proved guilty. That right appears to be taken away from the officer under this sub-section (3).</P>
    <P>But there is even worse here.  Perhaps I had better read it in order to be quite clear on it, because I have read it several times and it seems to me so extraordinary that I do not believe there is any relation whatever to any other Act previously passed here or we would have heard about it.  I would be surprised if any Dáil passed any Local Government Act in the same terms as this sub-section, which states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the Minister is of opinion that any of the statutory grounds for removal from office exists as regards the holder of an office, the Minister may send by post to such holder at the principal office of the vocational education committee under which such holder holds such office a notice in writing stating the said opinion, and if the Minister, after the expiration of seven days from the sending of such notice and after consideration of the representation (if any) made to him by such holder, remains of the said opinion, he may by Order remove such holder from, such office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister never contemplated taking this power.  I doubt very much whether the Minister would ever exercise this power.  It is so unjust, it is so outrageous that a Minister, or anyone else, should send by post to an accused party notice of his dismissal and that seven days after the sending of such notice the Minister may remove him from office.  Mark well the word &ldquo;sending.&rdquo;  It is not seven days or one day after the receipt.  The Minister only requires under this law to prove that he sent the notice; it does not require him to prove that it was ever received by the aggrieved party.  That short space of time, seven days after the sending of the notice, is given for the aggrieved party to make his representations, if any, but there is no provision in this Bill whatsoever to ensure that the officer has <Col N="373" /> received the notice and has been able to consider the opinion of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Surely the members of the House, who have had a great deal more experience than I, never passed a sub-section of any Bill which gave a Minister such arbitrary power as that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much surprised to know it, and I do not think my opinion of the House that did it is in any way enhanced by that knowledge.  Surely it is beyond all understanding that the sending of the notice should be the operative part of this sub-section, not the receipt of the notice.  Surely Deputies were not carrying out their duties and functions as members of a democratic body when they allowed that to pass.  In sub-section (4), again, the opinion of the Minister on the offence for which a person has been convicted is the sole test for dismissal.  The punishment inflicted by a court which might try such a case would be nothing compared with the penalty of dismissal put in the hands of a Minister.  As I said before in regard to a previous section, I think this section gives the Minister judicial power, and gives him power beyond that of any court to inflict a penalty.</P>
      <P>Section 9&mdash;this is the section that I think is of the gravest concern to the officers&mdash;states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The fact that an officer is in office at the date of the passing of this Act shall not be a ground for contending that Sections 6, 7 and 8 of this Act do not apply to him.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That matter has been dealt with very elaborately, I think, on the Second Reading of the Agriculture (Amendment) Bill.  It is a glaring example of the evil effects of retrospective legislation. If that is extended, in regard to any set of officers, there is no security of tenure whatever.  No officer can be assured after he signs conditions of appointment, that an Act of this Legislature is not going to rob him of all the benefits under those conditions of appointment.  It would be eminently reasonable if the very <Col N="374" /> reverse had been laid down in this Bill, that existing officers are not to come under the provisions of Sections 6, 7 and 8 of this Bill.  To bring them under those sections means that every guarantee that was given to them under the Acts which I have already quoted, every idea of security, every hope of advancement in their profession that they had under the Act of 1930, are now filched from them.  In the minds of the officers, there is no possible justification for this.  Newcomers to the service would understand quite well that the Minister has powers of dismissal and of suspension in regard to them and their salaries which did not obtain hitherto in the service, but the older officers, who have been in the service since 1905, and officers who have joined the service even more recently&mdash;the 300 officers in regard to whom the Minister quite rightly boasted of the work they did in extending the service&mdash;are very adversely affected by this section of the Bill.  There is a spirit of disquiet, a spirit of uncertainty, growing up in the service as a result of the Bill, particularly of that Section 9, which the Minister would do well to eliminate as soon as possible, if he wishes the service&mdash;as he does&mdash;to continue to operate efficiently and harmoniously.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is prepared to take this section out of the Bill, or whether he is prepared to amend it, but if not, I think he should give some indication that there will be a liberal interpretation of it; that he should in some way or other that may appear to him the best way give an assurance to these officers that there will be no punitive measures taken under these sections, that this is a mere legal formality, perhaps, that is necessary by reason of legal enactments but that, as far as he is concerned as a Minister, he has no intention of using the powers that are conferred on him by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at length upon the things that are in the Bill which I do not like to see there, which I would prefer to see taken out of the Bill, but, as this is an amending Bill, it gives occasion for one to indicate also what <Col N="375" /> one would like to see in the Bill that the Minister has not thought fit to put into it.</P>
