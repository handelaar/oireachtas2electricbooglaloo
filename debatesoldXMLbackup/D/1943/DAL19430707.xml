      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Steel, Limited, was established as a public company without State financial assistance in any form.  In 1941 a receiver was appointed to administer the affairs of the company by the trustees for the original debenture holders, namely, the Munter and Leinster Bank, Limited.  I had no connection with this appointment. The receiver was Mr. Vincent Crowley of Messrs. Kennedy, Crowley and Company.  When it had become clear that the efforts of the receiver to dispose of the business of the company were unlikely to be successful, I intervened for the purpose of effecting an arrangement for the reconstitution of the company.  In accordance with this arrangement I have given a guarantee in regard to the payment of interest and the repayment of principal of a loan of £200,000 under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1939. The full amount of this guaranteed loan has been made available to the company by its bankers but no State funds have been provided.  The administration of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts under which the guarantee was given is carried on in my Department.</P>
      <P>The names of the present chairman and directors of the company are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Vincent Crowley, chairman; Joseph Gannon, Cornelius Murphy, Aodhagain O'Rahilly, Harald Osterberg.</P>
      <P>I have not heard of any contemplated change in the composition of the board and no such change can be made under the provisions of the agreement relating to the guarantee for the loan, without my prior approval.  The present auditors of the company are Messrs. Purtill and Company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Looney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the members of the Cork Corporation unanimously recommended to the City Manager that in computing family income for rent purposes the recent wage bonus should not be considered as it was granted to meet the increased cost of living; if so, if he will favourably consider intervening, if necessary by legislation, so that the view of the Cork Borough Council in this matter may prevail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.  I have been informed that a committee of the Cork Corporation recently recommended that any emergency bonus or increase of wages not exceeding 8/- per week be ignored in fixing differential rents payable by tenants of corporation houses and that this recommendation was unanimously adopted by the corporation on the 28th ultimo.  It is understood that the basis of fixing differential rents will be modified accordingly so as to give effect to the recommendation but a proposal to that effect has not yet reached my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when these people applied to the tribunal for a bonus, no question of increased rent was taken into consideration by the tribunal; that a grave wrong has been inflicted on people who are actually poverty-stricken?  I would like that steps would be taken urgently in the matter, so as to avoid any further friction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="229" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy has quite grasped the meaning of the reply.  The reply in short is this: That it has been decided by the corporation that the 8/- bonus should be ignored in fixing the differential rents. I understand the manager is accepting that position, and will in due course submit a recommendation to that effect to the Department.  If so, it will be sanctioned.  The delay, I understand, has arisen because other matters have been raised by the tenants in relation to this matter, and they are all under consideration by the same committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say from what fund the tickets were provided to send Dublin children to industrial schools in Cork and Galway, and whether or not the same fund is available to return them to their mothers when they get summer holidays? What is the difference between providing tickets to send them down and providing tickets to send them home?  I would press for a reply.  The Minister cannot merely look at us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will tell us whether or not he proposes to take any steps to relieve a situation wherein a poor child is given a few weeks' holiday out of an industrial school to go home to his parents and cannot come because he has no money to pay his railway fare.  Surely the Minister will say, if there is not a fund, that he will take steps to provide a <Col N="230" /> fund, or give some evidence of sympathy with that situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the following men, Seán Mac Cumhaill, a native of County Donegal; John G. O'Doherty, a native of Northern Ireland, and Terence McLoughlin, of County Roscommon, who are detained at No. 1 Internment Camp, Curragh Camp, under Emergency Powers (No. 20) Order, 1940. have been on hunger strike since 24th May, 1943.  On the 23rd May, these three men, and five others who have since gone off hunger strike, addressed <Col N="231" /> a joint letter to the Government stating that they had decided to hunger strike for unconditional release.  The detention of these men is considered necessary in the interests of the public safety.  The Government cannot allow any persons whose actions when at liberty are a menace to the public safety to regain their liberty by hunger striking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the manifest injustice of detaining prisoners without charge or trial, does the Minister not realise that a national tragedy will be enacted if any of these men die and, in the interest of internal peace and quietude in this country which must be the paramount consideration for this Assembly, will the Minister take steps to release these three men and thereby avert what will be a national tragedy if any of these men lose their lives in the course of their protest against their incarceration without charge or trial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to admit that there is any manifest injustice in having these men interned without trial.  I would point out to the Deputy that for three years people have been interned without trial and no voice was raised here.  If that was considered to be a manifest injustice, surely we would have heard about it before now.  Their internment was rendered necessary in the public interest and for the public safety.  If they are prepared to behave as ordinary citizens and satisfy me that they are prepared to do so, then they will be released, but not on any other conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was unjust to detain men without charge or trial up to 1932 and if it was justifiable to release them when the Fianna Fáil Government came into office in 1932, surely there are equally strong reasons for releasing these men to-day, particularly as some of them are on the point of death and their death may cause a situation in this country which every sensible citizen wants to avoid?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When did Deputy <Col N="232" /> Norton come to the conclusion that it was unjust to detain these people, seeing that they are at least three years detained, and he never raised the matter here before, at least not to my knowledge?</P>

Administration is discussed on Estimates.  The Votes for Departments are not itemised in the Vote on Account.  As the Estimates for certain Departments were dealt with and moneys appropriated before the dissolution, no money is now required and, consequently, the policy and expenditure of those Departments do not arise for discussion.  Those Votes are the groups coming under Education, Industry and Commerce, Supplies and Justice, and some minor Votes.  Legislation passed or pending may not be discussed.</P>

      <P>Of the Votes to which I referred, in the case of three of them a motion to refer back was moved for the express purpose of discussing policy.  Policy was discussed and does not arise now.  There cannot be a duplication.  If no money is required, the subject does not arise.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> Is dócha gur cuimhin leis na Teachtaí a bhí ina gcomhaltaí den Dáil deireannach gur chuir an Vóta i gCúntas don bhliain airgeadais seo a ritheadh i Mí na Márta so caithte dóthain airgid ar fáil chun na Seirbhísí Puiblí do choimeád ar siúl go dtí tímpeall an lá deireannach den mhí seo, tráth bhéadh mion-scrúdú na Meastachán críochnuithe againn de ghnáth. Ní dhearna an Dáil deireannach ach naoi geinn ar fhichid de na Meastacháin do rith, ámhthach, agus ní foláir anois, thárla gur ar éigin a fhéadfaí deighleáil láithreach leis na ceithre Meastacháin is dachad atá fágtha, ní foláir Vóta eile i gCúntas do rith, mara bhfuiltear chun na seirbhísí lena mbaineann na Meastacháin sin do leigint in éag ag deire na míosa.</P>
    <P>Sé an méid atá ag teastáil ná ocht milliún go leith púnt, go garbh, agus tá sé curtha le chéile mar atá leagtha amach ar Chlár na hOibre agus ar an bPáipéar Bán a cuireadh timcheall chuig na Teachtaí.  Meastar gur leor an tsuim sin do mhíosa Lúnasa, Meán Fómhair, Deire Fómhair, agus na Samhna, agus tá súil agam go mbeidh breithiúnas déanta againn ar na Meastacháin go léir sar a mbeidh an tréimhse sin istigh.  Go generálta, sí an tsuim a hiarrtar do gach Vóta ar leith ná timpeall trian den Mheastachán iomlán glan in aghaidh na bliana; i gcásanna áirithe níorbh fhéidir claoidhe leis an riail sin, ámhthach.</P>
    <P>Sé an méid iomlán glan atá ag teastáil i mbliana do na Seirbhísí Soláthair ná £40,978,579, agus dhá Mheastachán Fhoirlíontacha gur glacadh leo tar éis foillsithe Imleabhar na Meastachán d'áireamh.  Is méadú de £546,751 no 1? per cent. é seo ar an soláthar iomlán de £40,431,828 a deineadh don bhliain seo caithte.  Foluíonn an tsuim dheireannach sin, ar ndóigh, na Meastacháin Fhoirlíontacha agus Bhreise do ritheadh i gcaitheamh na bliana.  Bé an chéad soláthar glan don bhliain seo caithte ná £39,112,301 agus, i gcomórtas leis an fhigiúr sin, tá soláthar 1943-44 imithe in áirde £1,866,278 no 4¾ per cent.</P>
    <P>Den tsoláthar a hiarrtar i geóir na bliana so, tugadh £14,419,294 cheana chun crícheanna na naoi Meastachán <Col N="242" /> ar fiehid go bhfuil glactha leo ag an Dáil.  Cuireadh £8,952,595 den fhuighleach de £26,559,285 ar fáil sa chéad Vóta i gCúntas.</P>
    <P>Deputies who were members of the last Dáil will recall that the Vote on Account for the current financial year, which was passed in March last, provided sufficient moneys to enable the various public services to be carried on up to approximately the 31st of this month, by which time the detailed consideration of the Estimates would normally have been completed.  Only 29 of the current Estimates were passed by the last Dáil, however, and, as it would hardly be feasible to dispose of the remaining 44 Estimates immediately, it is necessary to pass a further Vote on Account if the services to which those Estimates relate are not to be brought to a standstill at the end of this month.</P>
    <P>The amount required is approximately eight and a half million pounds, and is made up as indicated on the Order Paper, and on the White Paper which has been circulated to Deputies. This provision will, it is calculated, be sufficient for the months of August, September, October, and November, by which time I hope we shall have completed our consideration of the remaining Estimates.  The sum required for each particular Vote is in general about one-third of the total net Estimate for the year; in some cases, however, a departure from that proportion is necessary.</P>
    <P>The total net sum required for the supply services for the current financial year, including the total of two Supplementary Estimates passed since the volume of Estimates was published, is £40,978,579, representing an increase of £546,751 or 1? per cent. on the net provision of £40,431,828 for last year.  The latter sum includes, of course, all Supplementary and Additional Estimates passed during the year.  The original net provision for last year was £39,112,301, and, as compared with that figure, the 1943-44 provision is up by £1,866,278 or 4¾ per cent.</P>
    <P>Of the sum required for this year, £14,419,294 is in respect of the 29 Estimates already passed.  £8,952,595 of <Col N="243" /> the remaining £26,559,285 was provided in the first Vote on Account.</P>
    <P>Deputies who sat in the last Dáil have already had an opportunity of studying the Estimates for the current year.  For the information of new Deputies I may say that the increase over the original Estimate for 1942-43 is due mainly to a substantial increase in the amounts needed for certain social and emergency services.  The payment of emergency bonus to State servants will cost approximately £656,000 and the improved rates and enlarged scope of unemployment assistance and food allowances £240,000. There is also an increase of £120,000 in the provision for old age pensions due to an anticipated increase in our septuagenarian population.  An additional £200,000 (making a total of £700,000) is being provided to subsidise the price of agricultural produce, and the maintaining of a special register of agricultural and turf workers in order that labour may be available for the saving of turf and the harvest is estimated to cost £104,000.</P>
    <P>The subsidy on the price of turf will cost £650,000, and we are spending this year £634,000 to enable fertilisers to be supplied to farmers at reasonable rates.  These new items alone account for approximately £2,610,000 and it will be apparent that, had they not been rendered necessary by the events of the past year, there would have been a reduction of about £750,000 over the whole supply services, notwithstanding the substantial rise in the cost of materials reflected through many of the normal services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Vote be reduced by £1,000.  The only inference that can be deduced from the result of the election is that the people, notwithstanding the stampeding and terrorist tactics of Fianna Fáil, have expressed their dissatisfaction with Party Government and with the manner in which national affairs have been handled.  We opposed the nomination of Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach and we opposed the Ministry nominated and assigned by him.  We are satisfied that the people would have approved the procedure adopted by this Party, <Col N="244" /> since the Taoiseach gave no indication of respect for the people's wishes by making a substantial change in his Ministry.  Far from taking cognisance or the people's wishes, he refused to reshuffle his Ministry and, in replying to the debate, he said he was not prepared to deviate the slightest hair's breadth from the policy he had pursued. We feel that the low standard of production which now obtains in some of our main branches of agriculture is due to inattention and neglect by the Government and their failure to apply modern methods to the industry. A policy of drift and despair has been permitted to continue since the inception of the emergency and we think that the present position is due to the incapacity and incompetence of the Minister in charge of agriculture. If this situation is permitted to continue, it is bound, inevitably, to precipitate a crisis in the immediate postwar period.</P>
      <P>We feel that, owing to the gravity of the circumstances, it is our duty and the duty of the Parliament&mdash;the supreme authority&mdash;to criticise the alarming decline in our production, and expose the failure of the Government to adopt modern methods and modern technique.  We deem it our duty to call attention to the failure of the Government to maintain, as far as possible, our own people in productive occupation, their failure to rehabilitate and fortify our primary industry, and to utilise to the full the export opportunities which we believe exist, so as to guard against the danger of economic collapse and be in a position to take maximum advantage of the export market in the immediate postwar period before European reconstruction commences and keen international competition is revived.  We feel that it is our duty to use every means in our power to compel the Fianna Fáil Party, who have accepted responsibility for Government, as a single Party, to drop their cant, humbug and deception and face up to the realities of our position in a more constructive and business-like way, so as to bring hope and courage to our people.</P>

    <P>I listened to the Taoiseach when replying to the debate last week.  He <Col N="245" /> assured the House that he was not reared in exotic fashion, that he had experience of agriculture, that he tackled the jennet and the ass, rode a horse, tumbled the rake, milked a cow and cleaned out the cowsheds.  I was amused by his reference to those matters, because lie tried to convey the impression to the House that a man with such experience was sufficiently versed in agriculture to speak of it in an authoritative way.  So far from that being the case, I want the Taoiseach to realise that modern agriculture, particularly in other countries; is highly specialised, and that new technique and new scientific methods are being employed.  In this country we have lagged far behind other countries in production, because of our failure to adopt modern methods.  The Taoiseach challenged the statement by Deputy Davin regarding the value of our production over a period of years.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that production has fallen.  Take the case of butter over a period of years immediately before 1929.  The House will remember that the world was in a trough of depression in that year.  If you take a couple of years prior to that, you will find that, in 1927, our exports of butter amounted to 586,485 cwts., while, in 1938, they had fallen to 326,604 cwts.</P>

      <P>They were 381,028 cwts.  Our percentage of the total imports of butter into Great Britain was 10 in 1927, and 3.4 in 1937.  New Zealand's percentage in 1927 was 21.5, and in 1937 that had gone up to 31.8.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is very anxious to concentrate on that period when we were in the throes of economic depression.  The percentage was lower then, but it certainly was not as low as it is at the present time. Even assuming that the Taoiseach is right, and that our production did not fall over that ten year period he <Col N="246" /> singled out&mdash;1929&mdash;39&mdash;is he satisfied, and is this House satisfied, that our production should remain static at a time when competitor-countries in the market in which we were selling had, by the adoption of new technique and more scientific methods, enormously expanded their production?  The Taoiseach seemed to me last week to be quite satisfied with that position. It is an extraordinary state of affairs that from 1939 onwards, there was a steep fall in production in some of our principal branches of agriculture.  It is accepted that food producing countries &mdash;and we are almost exclusively engaged in food production&mdash;enjoy a high measure of prosperity during a war period, because the greatest munition of war is food.  Our country lay along one of the biggest belligerents, a country which had not enough food to maintain itself, and a country that had to try to maintain its food lines and keep the sea lanes open against the greatest blocade in history.  We made no effort to utilise the opportunity offered to us or to organise our resources so as to expand our production and supply that market.</P>
      <P>It is true that our cattle population remained more or less on a level over the period referred to by the Taoiseach but the milk used for industrial purposes&mdash;that is to say, mainly in creameries&mdash;had fallen from 197,000,000 gallons to 188,000,000 gallons.  Pigs had fallen from 1,450,000 to 878,000.  Ordinary fowl fell from 9,000,000 to 6,946,000.  Our production in eggs fell from 10,492,000 great hundreds to 7,156,000 great hundreds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a very substantial expansion in wheat production&mdash;from 221,000 cwts. to 5,573,000 cwts.  Oats fell from 2,521,000 cwts. in 1929-30 to 2,281,000 cwts in 1941-42, barley fell from 1,313,000 cwts to 1,247,000 cwts.  I am now reading from the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> of June, 1943, Table II, Index Numbers of Volume of agricultural output (Base, 1929-30=100).  Our live stock and live-stock products fell from 95.9 in 1939-40 to 85.4 in 1941-42.  Bacon fell from 93.2 per cent. on the basis of cwts in 1938 to 90.0 per cent. in 1939.  It was 99.7 per cent. in 1940 and 81.4 per cent. in 1941.  In the September quarter, <Col N="247" /> 1942, the equivalent annual average was 19.8 per cent.  On the basis of 100 per cent., in 1936, our butter, cheese, condensed milk, and margarine production in 1938 was 93.4 per cent.; in 1939, 89.4; in 1940, 83.4; in 1941, 84.0 per cent.  For the September quarter, 1942, the equivalent annual average was 85.3 and for the December quarter 74.1.  That all indicates that there has been a fall in our production over that period.</P>
    <P>At the annual meeting of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, the president, Rev. E.J. Coyne, S.J., stated that the milk supply for 1942 was probably less in 1941 by anything from 10,000.000 to 15,000,000 gallons, and that in regard to creamery butter there was an enormous drop in production, from 837,879 cwts. in 1936 to 611,201 cwts. in 1942.  All these figures indicate a substantial fall in production here.  It is true that value appears to have been maintained but the increase arose, particularly, since the outbreak of war, and is, in fact, due to the rise in prices and to scarcity. Shortages were so acute that price ceilings had to be fixed by the Minister for Supplies.  Comparing the production of competitor countries and the technique and methods employed during that period in New Zealand, in the Scandinavian countries, and even in Great Britain, since the commencement of the emergency, I think the Taoiseach has nothing to be proud of, and nothing to boast about.  I do not think it can be suggested that our people are indifferent or that they are too lazy to work the land.</P>
    <P>I definitely charge the Government, and the Minister for Agriculture in particular, with failure to do their job, by not introducing into our methods the technique that has resulted from the pioneer work of great agricultural scientists in other countries.  No effort has been made to do that here.  In my opinion the mentality of the Government is indicated by the reference that was made to this matter by the Taoiseach on the last occasion the House met, when he talked about his knowledge of agriculture, as if that qualified any man to speak about <Col N="248" /> modern agriculture.  The most that the Government have done is simply to plan for to-morrow's breakfast.  There has been no long-term plan, and no vision or foresight with reference to agriculture.  We should realise that we must have exports in the form of cattle, bacon, eggs, butter, poultry, and mutton, of which we were exporting large quantities ten years ago, the aggregate value of which was something like £13,000,000.  These exports have completely disappeared and consequently our purchasing power has been reduced.  I am sure Deputies realise it as an elementary principle that the foundation of our whole economic structure depends upon being able to import such essential requirements as coal, iron, steel, raw materials, machinery, transport vehicles, electrical equipment and many other things which we cannot produce, if we are to maintain a decent standard of living.  These can only be bought by exports and with foreign exchange.  If our exchange disappeared the whole structure here would collapse, and our position would be amongst the worst in Europe.  In that respect it is interesting to note that the Minister for Agriculture, when speaking in Cork a few months ago, expressed the view that there was no future for the dairying industry or pig industry.  His colleague the Minister for Local Government when speaking about the same time at University College, and later when opening a housing scheme in Kildare, envisaged a post-war situation in which our exports of livestock would completely disappear. Anybody who hopes for any decent conditions here must view with horror and alarm a situation of that kind developing.</P>
    <P>We recognise this fact, and I think it cannot be questioned, that in the last resort, our prosperity and our whole future depends on how we utilise the 12,000,000 acres of irable land we possess.  It seems an extraordinary situation that in a country like this, bearing in mind our geographical position and the advantages we have as a result of it, with a population of less than 3,000,000 souls we should have any difficulty whatever in producing the food required to feed our <Col N="249" /> people.  Economists compute that an acre of land, reasonably will used in a modern manner, will maintain a human being.  On that basis, even allowing for a considerable margin of error, we should be well able to maintain in our people on 5,000,000 acres and we should have the production of 7,000,000 acres for export purposes.</P>
    <P>We are not getting anything like that result at all.  I might say in that regard, in passing, that so far as the 12,000,000 acres of arable land are concerned, no attempt has been made by the Government to classify them.  We do not know how much is first grade, or second grade, or third grade.  That classification has been carried out in almost all the other countries I mentioned&mdash;in the Scandinavian countries, in New Zealand, and in Great Britain itself.  One of the biggest things that have been tackled in this respect by other countries is the expansion of production by the application of scientific methods to the utilisation of the soil.  Fertility, where fertility can be conserved and improved, is the best guarantee of our prosperity.</P>
    <P>If science can bring to the aid of the farmer new techniques and methods for the utilisation of the soil to step up its fertility to higher production, then great advantages would accrue to the nation as a whole.  That has been done in a great many countries by a new technique with which I propose to deal later.  No effort has, in fact, been made here to face that problem. We are all following the old happy-go-lucky methods.  We are leaving it to the farmer himself, to a very great extent, to use his own land in his own way in a sort of rule of thumb fashion. No real effort is being made to bring science to his aid.</P>
    <P>Take the wheat scheme, about which the Government has boasted so much. We have 580,000 acres under wheat this year.  Taking the yield of six barrels to the acre, it is a low yield.  I suggest that eight and a half to nine barrels per acre in our circumstances would not by any means be an impossibility. On that low yield of six barrels to the acre for 580,000 acres, we should have 3,500,000 barrels of wheat.  The consumption of flour in this country, allowing one sack per year to each individual, <Col N="250" /> is 3,000,000 sacks.  We have less than 3,000,000 people.  Our consumption should be under 3,000,000 sacks; we are extracting, at present, 100 per cent.  Allowing for shrinkage and drying in the mills in preparing the grist, that odd half a million barrels should cover our requirements, so that from 580,000 acres we should have produced our total needs.  It is true that we would need something over and above for seed purposes, but from that 580,000 acres, with good tillage methods, we should have produced approximately our requirements.</P>
    <P>What is the result?  The national quota was fixed last harvest at 70 per cent. on the basis of the acreage under wheat.  In my opinion it is a conservative figure.  Two months ago that had to be adjusted to 50 per cent., and on the 23rd June last, it had to be reduced eventually to 47½ per cent. Therefore the official quota for milling purposes is 47½ per cent., and the balance has to be imported. There is the result of the Fianna Fáil wheat scheme.  Ships were on the high seas intended to carry home cargoes of raw sugar.  They had to be diverted to bring cargoes of wheat&mdash;at least three of them&mdash;and the situation to-day in regard to supplies of wheat is dependent to a large extent upon imports. I am not condemning wheat-growing. What we have condemned is the system of wheat-ranching, regardless of fertility, ruining the land, the most precious asset we have.  Every practical farmer in this House knows the result of it, and knows that there has been a decline in production.</P>
    <P>On many farms production has reached margin levels of diminishing returns, and a situation often where there have been little or no returns. The result of that policy has been reflected in the production figures, the milling quota of 47½ per cent.  Failure has occurred mainly in the districts where production should have been greatest, because, since the war, the greatest difficulty in wheat production has been experienced by tillage farmers, who rely to a large extent on artificial manures, and who had not those reserves of fertility possessed by the grazing districts.  Through stress of circumstances due to the war <Col N="251" /> situation, nations like Great Britain and other countries decided to call on that reserve of fertility built up in grass counties, and I suggest that where the reserves of fertility were greatest, we would have got considerably better results.  No effort was made, however, to properly utilise those reserves of fertility.  The Government introduced a Compulsory Tillage.  Order, and sat back, feeling that its duty was done.</P>
    <P>We heard from the Taoiseach that we cannot get the farmers to produce more butter.  That is the Government's excuse.  The same thing applies to wheat-growing.  No effort was made to provide technical knowledge where there was no tradition of tillage.  No effort was made to provide credit.  No effort was made to provide modern equipment.  No effort was made by means of barter agreements to exchange animal and animal products for commodities which we required here such as essential equipment in the expansion of production and the extension of tillage operations.</P>
    <P>As a tillage farmer, I saw myself where production was seriously affected, not because of any lack of attention on the part of the farmer, but because he had not the knowledge or experience necessary to increase it. The Government made no effort to provide him with the knowledge or experience required&mdash;none whatever.  In a great many counties, the result was that the farmer grew more weeds and dirt than cereals.  Take the case of dairying.  My particular friend, the Minister for Finance, boasted about the largesse that the Government are providing for the dairying industry.  In his Budget speech, and in his reply to the debate on the Budget, he said we were providing out of the taxpayer's pocket no less than £700,000 for dairying. Notwithstanding that, there is a further decline in the dairying industry, as if the provision of more and more subsidies made the situation worse.</P>
    <P>Subsidies, it appears, are the only solution that the Government can provide <Col N="252" /> for the dairying problem&mdash;the collection of more and more of the taxpayer's money to hand over to the farmer. Notwithstanding that, there was a definite decline in dairying production, and no one would attempt to question the sincerity of the statement of the president of the I.A.O.S. when he dealt with the falling-off in production. Take the case of New Zealand. Her exports to Great Britain in 1927 were 1,252,475 cwts.  Ten years later the figure had increased to 2,950,000 cwts., more than double in ten years, while over that period ours has been declining, and has now disappeared. Surely, one is entitled to ask what is wrong with the dairying industry in this country when you compare our average production of 400 gallons with their production of 800 gallons?  There seems to be something extraordinarily wrong there.</P>
    <P>If you examine, for instance, New Zealand's milk production graph, you will find that it is almost a straight-line production all the year round; it is not a seasonal production.  But when you examine our milk production you find that it is seasonal, and that our production is 14 times as high in the summer period as it is in the lowest period of the winter.  It is true that they have not a winter problem in New Zealand, but other countries have got over that difficulty.  Finland has solved to a great extent the problem of winter feeding by the A.I.V. process, I always associate the great expansion in dairying production in New Zealand with the visit that was made there about ten or 12 years ago by Sir George Stapleton.  He introduced new ideas with regard to grass production, and the result is that they look upon grass there as a crop, a cultivated crop, and they have adopted a completely new technique and a completely new outlook in regard to grass and its utilisation, not only for the feeding of animals, but in connection with increasing the fertility of the soil. because the basis of all production, whether from the point of view of proteins or humus for soil, is grass.  Yet. no effort was made by the Minister for Agriculture here to adopt these <Col N="253" /> principles or to make use of the researches of many great scientists in other countries.  We are still plodding along in the happy-go-lucky method.</P>
    <P>I think that these principles should have been applied long before this to the dairying industry.  There is no use in blaming the individual farmer.  The reorganisation of the dairying industry will require a far greater effort than any individual effort on the part of the farmer.  The responsibility rests with the Government, and the failure of the dairying industry here is due to the failure of the Government, and of the Minister for Agriculture in particular, to face up to their responsibilities and to realise that the condition of that industry for many years past has been an unhealthy one.  The only way in which the Minister has faced up to his responsibility in that respect is by collecting, out of the taxpayers' pockets, more taxes, more largesse, more subsidy.  I am not condemning the subsidy when the industry needed it, but a subsidy helps to crystallise the <i>status quo</i> and to destroy the possibility of any other effort being made to maintain the industry. Side by side with that subsidy, some real effort should be made by the Government and by the responsible Minister to examine the problem and to remove whatever defects there may be in that organisation.</P>
    <P>Take the case of our cows.  What is wrong there?  I suggest that a biological examination should have been made into this whole problem of trying to get our production stepped up.  If that had been done I am sure that, at all events, you would have got some results.  The Live-stock Breeding Act was passed some years ago which secured a general improvement in our live stock.  That served its purpose, but I suggest that at the present time, and even long before this, we should have realised that in its application to the dairying industry it is not perhaps to the best advantage of that industry. You cannot judge a bull simply on confirmation, you must have some reference to milk records.  The single dairy shorthorn has a record on the dam side, but bred from beef on the sire <Col N="254" /> side, that animal will almost inevitably revert back to beef in its progeny. Those are the things that should have been considered and examined long ago.  I do not think it is too late to do so, and that is one of the reasons that we felt all along that a monopoly of the brains in this House does not rest with the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have had ocular demonstration of their failure to look ahead, to sec for themselves the decay that was going on, and to keep our people abreast of the times.  The work of reconstruction and building up will become all the greater as the years pass by, and in those circumstances we felt that we should at least pool the resources of all the brains in this House.  Even the proposal of the Labour Party to set up an economic council, thus referring the matter back to the arm-chair economists, is not enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, and that is the only suggestion the Labour Party have for dealing with this problem.  I have great respect for economists and scientists, but I think that side by side and in co-operation with their technical knowledge you will have to have the knowledge and experience of practical men who know something about the subject, who live by that industry and who have made good in it.  I believe that with their knowledge, experience and ability it would be well worth while to bring such men into the service of the State in order to improve the particular industry in which they are interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stressed on more than one occasion in this House that, so far as my knowledge, ability and foresight serve me.  I see opening up for this country, if we make use of the opportunity, a great future for the dairying industry.  The greatest problem that Great Britain has experienced since <Col N="255" /> the outbreak of this war has been the production of milk for her people. Even before the war, the average consumption of milk was below a half-pint per individual&mdash;far below what was required for the safety of the health of the community.  Even in the years before the war they had, through their public health authorities, what is known as a milk drive&mdash;to provide more milk and to have more consumed. The idea of the drive was to provide more milk for the poorer classes.  If you examine the proposals of the Beveridge scheme, I suggest that, in effect, it simply means guaranteed minimum standards for the low wage earners.  That means switching from cereal consumption, consumption of bread only, to a higher dietary&mdash;the consumption of milk, butter, eggs, meat, and so on.  That means more dairying&mdash;and this is the only country where they can get the basic stock for dairy purposes.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Agriculture would read the articles that have been published by well-known authorities on this matter in Great Britain, he would find, that, time and time again, it has been clearly admitted that our stock is superior to their own, and that, in so far as the provision of milk is con cerned, they have looked to this country during this time of difficulty for basic stock.  No effort has been made to make use of that situation.  I think that in the future there will be a greater and greater demand for basic stock, and in face of that we are still subsidising the breeding of the Aberdeen Angus and Hereford, ignoring our basic stock to a great extent, and allowing our people to cross and recross the basic stock here.  It may be all right to have one cross so far as the Aberdeen Angus is concerned; it produces a very fine store beast.  But when you cross a second and a third time&mdash; every farmer in this House knows that that has been the practice&mdash;what do you produce?  From the dairy point of view, it is a scandalous state of affairs to permit that situation to continue.</P>
    <P>There ought to be a definite future for our live-stock industry.  The only way we can ensure that and discover <Col N="256" /> the measure of the requirements of Great Britain is by direct negotiations between the Government here and the responsible Ministry at the other side. There has been no effort to make any contact between the Ministers of this Government and the Ministry at the other side.  The practice has been to put a civil servant on the telephone at this end for the purpose of getting in contact with his opposite at the other side, and the result has been failure. No effort Has been made to lay the foundations before it is too late.  If the British farmers start breeding their own dairy stock, they will continue to do so.  If we avail of the opportunity now to provide them with stock, they will continue to take our stock.  Why has not something been done about it? Is it because, notwithstanding the experience of the present emergency, Fianna Fáil still believes in a policy of self-sufficiency?  Why is this House not utilised in the proper way?  Are decisions to be made by civil servants inside.  Government Buildings?  I do not want to be disrespectful in any way to the civil servants of this country, but I do suggest that this Parliament ought to be utilised to a far greater extent by whatever Administration is in office.</P>
    <P>Again, I might point out with regard to the live-stock industry here in this country that in several other agricultural countries&mdash;in some of the Scandinavian countries and in Great Britain since the war&mdash;provision has been made for State veterinary services. It is a well-known fact that the greatest curse of our live-stock industry here is disease&mdash;abortion, sterility and mastitis.  These diseases have raged up and down the country, and no effort has been made to attack that problem with vigour and determination.  If we turn up the Book of Estimates we will see the small sum of money that is being devoted to veterinary scientific research, or in fact to any research. The amount spent in that respect is negligible, while vast sums have been to a great extent wasted in other directions.  Here again one would expect that the lead given by other countries and the success achieved there would convince the responsible <Col N="257" /> Minister here that some effort should be made to provide State veterinary services, so that we could reduce to a minimum mortality amongst calves and the loss of valuable milking herds. But apparently we are quite satisfied to allow that state of affairs to continue. Then the agricultural community is blamed; they are not making the effort; the Government lias done this and has done that, but the people will not respond.</P>
    <P>What is the position with regard to the pig industry?  Even within the last six weeks, to my personal knowledge, individual farmers had to take back pigs from the market because the local factory quota was filled.  Is not that a fantastic situation during a period of acute scarcity of bacon in a country which at one time exported about £5,000,000 worth of live pigs and bacon?  Now we are able to provide only about 50 per cent. of our own requirements.  In face of that situation we still have in operation factory quotas and restrictions which compel farmers to bring their pigs back from the market simply because the local factory quota has been filled. Is that the way to stimulate production? Is that the way to encourage farmers to go in for more pigs?  We have suggested here over and over again that the only way to do it is to protect the consumer and give a free market to the farmer.  I do not think there is the slightest danger of cutthroat competition between the different factories.  In any case, they got their whack out of it before; the Government permitted them to do it. If there is a period of scarcity now, the producer is at least entitled to free competition between the factories. Protect the consumer by all means, and leave us a free market after that.  I know we will be told that the scarcity of bacon is due to the fact that we cannot import any raw materials for the production of bacon here.  That is true, but when we examine the figures which I have already quoted to the House we have to consider, first of all, the ignominious failure to get any decent result from the 580,000 acres we have under wheat.  Any ordinary farmer down the country, put in the <Col N="258" /> same position as the Minister for Agriculture, would have got better results, because he would have known how to go about it.  Side by side with that, there is the reduction in our production of oats and barley, the basic food for the production of animals and animal products.  What effort has been made by the Department to examine alternative foods?  The journal of the Ministry of Agriculture in England refers to the fact that a series of experiments was carried out in Northern Ireland to discover what is the maximum quantity of oats which can with safety be fed to pigs.  After that series of experiments there, it was discovered that pigs could be profitably fed on oats up to 80 per cent. of their total meal.  The British journal goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where direct comparisons were made with barley meal, it was found that the amount of starch equivalent required to produce 1-lb. of live-weight gain on rations containing percentages of ground oats rising to 80 per cent. was practically the same as that required on rations containing the same percentages of barley meal.  In none of the experiments did the high levels of ground oats have any serious effects on the health of the pigs.  A few pigs were affected by pneumonia and a few others made poor gains for reasons apparently unconnected with feeding.  The only case of serious digestive disturbance occurred when a pig died on a ration including 40 per cent. of crushed oats.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Many other animals showed great progress with the 80 per cent. mixture. The gain in live weight was 1 Ib. per 4 Ibs. of oats fed.  That was an extraordinarily high result.  The journal goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The quality of the carcasses was investigated by the Chemical Research Division.  It was found that high percentages of oats had some tendency to produce a softened and slightly thinner layer of back fat. However, the quality of the fat and of the carcasses in general was satisfactory, provided that the pigs had <Col N="259" /> been fattened rapidly&mdash;i.e., had put on 1¼ Ib. or so per head daily.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What effort has been made by the Minister and by the big organisation that is behind his Department to help farmers in our present circumstances? What benefits have we got from the huge sums of money which this House has provided, as against the advantages which agriculturists in competitor countries have got from a similar provision?</P>
    <P>No effort has been made to provide marketing boards here, although they have been found very useful and advantageous in other countries.  In that connection I should like to mention that the marketing board for the pig industry in Northern Ireland has made a deal with the railway companies under which a pig can be carried over the whole system at a flat rate, almost a nominal rate, of 7d. or 8d. per head.  A similar arrangement applies in the distribution of raw materials for agriculture, such as artificial manures.  They are carried at a flat rate over the whole system.  The marketing board approaches the railway company and says: &ldquo;We want to distribute so many hundred thousand tons over the whole of your system. What is the aggregate cost of that?&rdquo; The result of an arrangement such as that is that a man in County Kerry will get his phosphates at the same cost as the man in County Dublin, and it will be a very low rate.  That is some of the work that has resulted from the operations of marketing boards.  No effort has been made here by the Government to set up such boards to try to get a fine cut in transport charges for raw materials and for the products of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Take again the case of eggs.  Eggs are worth approximately 1/8 a dozen here, and many people in the Border counties cannot understand why eggs in Northern Ireland should be fetching as high as 3/1 per dozen.  Of course, it will be suggested by the Minister that the production of eggs is subsidised in Northern Ireland.  It is not subsidised, but consumption is subsidised. Great Britain is subsidising <Col N="260" /> food consumption to the tune of 140 millions per year.  They are in a desperate way for eggs.  They have not sufficient eggs even for institutions such as hospitals.  Here we are, at a time when all competition from the Scandinavian countries has disappeared from the British market and we have made no effort to avail of this opportunity.  Great Britain has tried to import eggs from America without success.  In an interview given to the <i>Sunday Times</i> by Lord Woolton, he makes special reference to the fact that they were not able to import eggs from America because of the effect of long transportation on the condition and quality of the egg.  He expressed in that interview the view that the provision of eggs for their people was one of the biggest problems confronting them.  I suppose we shall be told that they made no effort to stimulate production here, because we are only getting 1/8 a dozen.  I think they are justified in that because our supplies are so negligible.  Has any effort been made to make a bargain along these lines: &ldquo;What is the price going to be if we guarantee to increase production by 25 or 50 per cent. in any particular year and step it up from that?&rdquo; No effort has been made in that direction, and, naturally, while we can give them only a negligible amount, they are not prepared to give us increased prices. I think that they would be prepared to stimulate our production if we made any effort to supply them in reasonable quantities, and if we were able to enter into an agreement on a basis that would ensure greater supplies for that market.</P>
    <P>I return, as I said I would, to the question of the fertility of the land. Nothing whatever has been done in that regard.  No efforts have been made to avail of the results of years of research in Great Britain by Sir George Stapleton at Aberystwith, and by other scientists in other countries, notably in Finland and in the Tennessee Valley in America.  There are thousands of acres of our land which are completely decalcified and while they are in that condition, we cannot grow legumes.  In the four beet areas we have farmers trying to grow beet <Col N="261" /> on soil that is highly acid, on soil from which they cannot get satisfactory results, soil which is suffering from various diseases such as blackleg.  The laboratories have not been used to correct these conditions.  The farmer is handicapped by ignorance of the condition of his soil and he cannot get the best results from it.  I shall give you an example of that.  We give a lime subsidy of only £71,000 a year.  That, I suggest, is the smallest provision that could be made and it is entirely inadequate to correct the high state of decalcification that exists in the soil of this country.  There is no information, good, bad or indifferent, in the Minister's Department as to the extent to which soil acidity obtains in the different counties and it is quite on the cards that some farmers in this country are applying lime to alkaline soils.  The result of that is to make the land barren.  Even the lime provided here is too costly and expensive for the farmer.  In Northern Ireland, in New Zealand, and other countries, lime is provided and graded into different qualities.  You have ground limestone graded into fine lime and coarse lime.  To get an immediate reaction from the soil over the earlier years, fine lime is applied and for reaction over a period of years the coarser qualities are used.  That is provided at a nominal charge.  Farmers are encouraged to use more ground limestone to correct whatever acidity is present and to make good any deficiency in calcium in the soil.</P>
    <P>We must remember, apart from these considerations, that we have been mining the surface of the soil, that we are a stock-raising country and that it requires a considerable quantity of minerals, of lime, calcium, phosphates and potash, to build up the bone of these young animals that we are exporting to Great Britain.  No attempt has been made to make good the loss caused by that mining effect.  The deficiency ought to have been, and could have been made good, years ago by encouraging our people to use more and more phosphates.  Instead of that a tax was imposed on phosphates coming into the country in order to give a monopoly of the market in these <Col N="262" /> phosphates to a small ring in this country.  Our farmers were handicapped by reason of the fact that they were not able to buy phosphates as cheaply as their competitors in other countries and although, owing to climatic conditions, we get hotter results than most countries, we were relatively the lowest users of artificials of any country in the world.  The Taoiseach, who claims to be an authority on agriculture, and the Minister for Agriculture, who has been 11 years in charge of that Department and who ought to have done something along these lines, have ignored these fundamental considerations.  They cannot be ignored if we are going to build up a sound agricultural economy in this country.  As regards scientific research, I might again point out that no provision has been made here to provide our research department with the work that has occupied the Aberystwith Station, for the purpose of improving the quality of our grasses generally.</P>
    <P>The farmer-Deputies must know as well as I do that there are thousands, in fact, millions, of acres of land in this country infested with Yorkshire fog, agostos, bent, daisies, cat's ear, brom and other weeds, and that the percentage of nutritious grasses of high feeding value is very, very small.  No effort, as I said before, has been made to classify our grass lands.  To say that so many million acres are first-class grass land that need not be touched, is not enough so long as we have a number of acres that either could be rejuvenated by direct reseeding or by a course of rotation going down to proper grasses, and, side by side with that, seeing that the soil is in a fit state to produce the right type of grass&mdash;above all to produce legumes.  It is absolutely essential that we should have clovers intermingled with our grasses because it is realised that these clovers have the quality of taking the nitrogen from the air and fixing it in the soil.  That is the cheapest of all forms of nitrogen. There are thousands and millions of acres of land in this country that are in such a highly acid condition that the farmer is unable to get clovers to grow on it.  Many farmers do not know the <Col N="263" /> reason for that, and no effort is being made to instruct them in that respect. No effort has been made to establish a grass-breeding station here.  Those countries that have adopted the new technique, a technique that has completely revolutionised agriculture in other countries, have started off by establishing grass-breeding stations. We have been importing grass seeds from other countries that are not indigenous grasses at all, and that are not suitable to our conditions.  The Minister has told us that we have perennial grass grown here.  That is mostly of the stem variety.  It is simply a hay variety, and is not suitable for grazing purposes.  They have bred several varieties of grasses in those grass-breeding stations, suitable for different purposes.  For instance, they have the leaf variety for grazing. No attempt is being made to adapt these methods to our circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not want to weary the House unduly in dealing with these matters We have now a new Parliament&mdash;new blood if you like&mdash;in which we have a number of men who, at all events, profess to be interested in agriculture. We should make every effort to compel those who have taken on the responsibility of looking after agriculture to face up to their responsibilities, and to ensure that we do not slip behind.  We are definitely going to be behind if we allow the present position to continue. What is our position likely to be in the post-war period?  If war has the effect of doing tremendous destruction, it has also this effect: that it quickens the means of production and the power to invent.  It is having precisely that effect in Great Britain.  The result has been that British agriculture is far more efficient to-day than ever it was before.  If we believe in producing so as to have a surplus of agricultural commodities to sell in the British market, remember we will have to sell in competition with that efficiency.  If we do not adopt the methods, the means and the organisation, and the modern equipment that will enable us to ensure that efficiency, then we will be simply left out of the picture.  Higher efficiency means cheaper production.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> Unless we adopt the technique which will enable us to reduce our cost of production, we will not be able to compete, and therefore we will simply fade out.</P>
    <P>The muddling and the incompetent methods that have characterised the agricultural policy of Fianna Fáil, will not be good enough for the future.  We on this side of the House have no confidence whatever in the present Minister for Agriculture.  That, as I said before, is the reason why we divided against the Ministry nominated by the Taoiseach the last day.  We felt that the Taoiseach would hearken to the warning given to his Party in the ballot boxes, and that he would attempt to put in charge of our primary industry some other man who would introduce new ideas, and who would face up to his responsibilities in a more courageous way than the present Minister. He simply sits like a glorified civil servant in his office signing documents, a thing that any civil servant could do.  That is not enough.  He ought to be down amongst the people. He ought to be contacting the people who are engaged in agriculture, particularly those who he must know are in a position to advise him.  He ought to contact the people who have grievances and troubles, and make himself conversant with those things. He should listen to the suggestions made to him, and see how far those suggestions can be implemented.  It appears to me to be a strange situation that, in a live-stock producing country such as ours, the Minister for Agriculture who has been in that office for 11 years has not once, I suppose, in all that time put his foot in the Dublin cattle market.  That is not an indication of his interest in our agricultural community.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to say those things, but I feel that it is our responsibility that they should be said if we are to avert the danger of an economic collapse in the country.  The drift is there.  It is definitely and surely downhill, and it will inevitably result in an economic crisis.  It would be a sorry day, indeed, for our generation if we had to admit to the world that we had failed in our responsibilities.  I suggest <Col N="265" /> to the House that this is a time for serious stocktaking.  If Fianna Fáil have failed to realise and appreciate the gravity of our position it should be magnanimous enough, in this hour of crisis, to appeal for co-operation to form a national Government.  For the moment we have to accept the other position, but wo must watch carefully, we must criticise and make suggestions in the national interest.  That has been the job of this Party for a long time.  Very many more errors would have been made by the Ministry opposite but for the fact that this Party have tried to keep them on the rails, and to make them pursue a line that, at all events, was as near as possible to the best interests of the people. I hope it is not yet too late to appeal to the Government, and to the Minister for Agriculture in particular.  He has a very responsible position at the present time, and he ought to face up to that responsibility with more vigour, courage, determination and foresight.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Hughes has left Deputies in no doubt about his opinion that there was a good deal of muddling on this side of the House as far as agriculture is concerned.  He repeated that fairly often.  I would like any Deputy who has taken notes of his speech to say whether Deputy Hughes has proved there has been muddling or incompetence.  He talked about scientific progress, and said that we had failed to avail of the material that was available to us in other countries.  He stressed, in particular, the opinion of a man of very high repute, Sir George Stapleton.  I think I read the last book that was written by Sir George Stapleton, a book in which the writer deplored the very small progress that had been made in British farming.  He certainly did not give the picture of British farming that Deputy Hughes gave to the House to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted here before from the <i>New Zealand Journal of Agriculture.</i> The progress that was made there did not appear to be very much <Col N="266" /> either.  To Deputy Hughes, far away cows have very long horns.  We always hear what grand things are going on in New Zealand, Great Britain, Denmark and other places and we are always in a very poor way here.  I advise those farmers who have not been long in this Dáil not to be too upset by Deputy Hughes' gloomy outline of the situation because every year he prophesies that we shall be &ldquo;broke&rdquo; or bankrupt next year, but so far it has not come off.  In fact, he takes such pleasure in talking about bankruptcy, one would imagine that he is most disappointed that it has not come off already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked Deputy Hughes only one question.  God knows it was hard enough to stick it, but I did, and he might listen to me now.  I am sure that other members of the Dáil agree with me on that.  With regard to scientific progress, Sir George Stapledon in his book came down to three things which he urged should be done for British agriculture.  I do not know if Deputy Hughes has read the book. Probably he has read only some references to it in some farming magazine, but the three things were, first, that the farmer in England should get possession of his land, should become the owner of his land.  That has been done here already, so that on that point Sir George Stapledon was crying out to the great and enlightened British Government, according to Deputy Hughes, for something which they will not do, but which has been done for years past here.  Secondly, he urged that there should be a scheme of reclamation and drainage.  He said that it was a first essential&mdash;something which we have here already, but which he cannot get the British Government to adopt.  He also asked for liming, and Deputy Hughes, of course, makes little of our lime scheme.  It may not be sufficient, but still we have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second big point in Sir George Stapledon's programme, however, is reclamation and drainage, together with liming, and we have done it here <Col N="267" /> already.  His third point was that they should produce and distribute proper grasses, which he points out in his book has not been adopted in England except in a very small way.  We have listened to a long speech from Deputy Hughes, gathered from where I do not know&mdash;from some of the British farming journals&mdash;telling what he regards as the uninformed members of the agricultural community in this House what he has learned about what they are doing in England and what we are not doing here.  We find that the fact is that we have adopted here already a great part of the programme recommended by Sir George Stapledon and that it has not been adopted in the least in Great Britain.  That is Deputy Hughes' great scientific programme. Soil testing, I admit, is something which must come.  I have said that in the Dáil already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>How long will we have to wait for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In these times of scientific progress&mdash;and I agree very much with scientific progress&mdash;soil testing is something which must come, but so far as the highest scientific opinion goes, if Deputy Hughes has been reading these scientific magazines&mdash;I do not know whether or not he has, but if he has, he has not got a proper grasp of it &mdash;he will find that so far it has all come to this, that the only real test is the test on the field, by the application of a particular manure on land and finding out whether it is required or not. Laboratory testing is perhaps some use, but it is not nearly as important as the other, and that is the line we have been taking here.  We have recommended committees of agriculture to try the field test.  The important point is that we are in line with good scientific progress, but of course we are not in line with Deputy Hughes' idea of what scientific progress should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes quoted a lot of figures, and I have some figures here which I should like to give to the Dáil. They agree with Deputy Hughes in some respects, but I do not propose to <Col N="268" /> pin all my reliance on exports.  I propose to pin my reliance on what is produced.  If we are consuming more here at home than under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, and if our people are better fed, it is all to the good, but we may not then have so much to export.  He talked about the yield of wheat and in that connection a certain figure should have been explained. It should perhaps have been explained to the public&mdash;and I do not blame Deputy Hughes for this&mdash;that the national percentage was reduced more with a view to getting over internal difficulties of administration than from the angle that not as much wheat was produced as was expected.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, we got in just as much wheat as was anticipated, but we found it more convenient to let some mills mill more of the homegrown wheat and a number of mills mill more of the foreign wheat coming in.  The percentage in the case of the mills milling a good proportion of foreign wheat would be low, and the Order was made so that they would not commit any offence.  I have not got the exact figure of the amount of wheat received by the mills last year, but I should be delighted to give it on some future occasion.</P>
    <P>We hear the expression from Deputy Hughes very often that the Minister was afraid to face up to his responsibility, and so on.  I was anxious that Deputy Hughes should elaborate that point to some extent, because there were certain things suggested by Deputy Hughes which I should very much like the Fine Gael Party either to endorse or to reject.</P>
    <P>I admit that I am in a difficulty about the Live-Stock Breeding Act.  Some people say to me: &ldquo;Do not subsidise Herefords and Polled Angus cattle any longer; go in completely for Shorthorn cattle and let us have a good milking breed,&rdquo; while others say: &ldquo;If you do that, you will destroy the store trade in this country and the store trade is a very valuable asset.&rdquo;  Is Deputy Hughes going to attack me for giving subsidies to the other breeds, like Polled Angus, Aberdeen-Angus and Hereford breeds, and if I decide&mdash;<Col N="269" /> I do not say that I propose to do it&mdash; that all these subsidies are to be cut out and that we are going to rely entirely on the Shorthorn breed, can I be sure that nobody on the Fine Gael Benches will say that I am doing wrong, because my experience of the Fine Gael Party is that they are all freelances?  They can attack me for what I am doing, but if I do the opposite, some of them will attack me also.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Fagan will agree that we should go in entirely for a milking breed of cattle. that we should ignore completely the beef qualities of certain breeds, that we should, if you like, make up our minds definitely that we ought to pay no further attention to the store cattle business, but should turn over completely to milk-yielding cattle and let stores look after themselves.  We will not, of course, have as good stores in that event.  Deputy Hughes has spoken evidently as the chosen member of the Fine Gael Party, but I do not know if he is talking Fine Gael policy, especially on that point.  It is a point which I think might be discussed, if not in the Dáil, by Parties in another way, with a view to seeing whether something should be done in that respect; but we will not get very far by Deputy Hughes making a sort of sniping attack on me, for subsidising, as he calls it, the Aberdeen Angus and Hereford breeds, unless he has made up his mind, and the Fine Gael Party have made up their minds, too, that we should depart entirely from these beef breeds and turn over to the milking breeds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes did another thing.  He brought in some British journal to tell us what they had been doing in Great Britain and Northern Ireland with regard to feeding oats to pigs.  I do not know whether Deputy Hughes has a good memory or not, but surely, if he has been taking an interest in questions of that kind, he must have known that there were very elaborate experiments carried out here eight, nine, and ten years ago on the feeding of homegrown grain to pigs.  All the results were good.  I do not know whether they agree exactly with the results obtained in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but at any rate, I have sufficient confidence in the people who carried out the experiments here&mdash; namely, the county instructors in the various counties, and professors who are in charge of the particular subjects in the Albert College.  They gave the results of the experiments as to how far you could go in feeding homegrown grain to pigs.  I think I remember in 1935 and 1936 quoting the figures to the Fine Gael Party, and proving from these figures that pigs could be fattened in this country without importing any grain and without importing any feeding stuffs, and the members of that Party would not believe me.  They would not believe it at all. They did not mind who made the experiments, whether they were county instructors or professors of agriculture. Whoever they were, they could not believe that the pig could be fattened in this country without imported maize or imported feeding stuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is quite different when an English Department of Agriculture or a Northern Ireland Department of <Col N="271" /> Agriculture carries out experiments. When Deputy Hughes reads the results of the experiments in one of these English journals he comes along and tells us about a great discovery&mdash;that pigs could be fattened on home&mdash;grown grain &mdash;a thing we had proved eight or nine years ago.  At least, we had proved it to the ordinary people of this country but not to the satisfaction of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The result is you have no pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the result.  I will tell you what that is the result of later, I hope.  Another thing that Deputy Hughes told us about is that in other countries they have marketing boards and he said they were very very useful.  As an instance of the use to which a marketing board could be put, he referred to the Bacon Marketing Board in the North of Ireland which was able to arrange flat rates of transport for pigs, and so on.  We have a marketing board here for pigs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to that too.  That was one of the things they did early in their time.  They got a flat rate for pigs, but it was not appreciated at all, not nearly so much appreciated here as Deputy Hughes would lead us to believe the thing is appreciated in Northern Ireland because, of course, one is done by a marketing board outside the State, whereas the other is done by a marketing board that we set up, and, therefore, cannot be very much good in Deputy Hughes' view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes went on to talk about eggs.  He wants to know if we have ever made any attempt to negotiate with the British Government with a view to inducing the British Government to give us a bigger price if we could give them more eggs.  That is exactly what we have been trying to get the British Government to do because we put it to the British Government that we cannot get higher production on present prices.  They say to us: &ldquo;When you give us more eggs, <Col N="272" /> we will consider a higher price&rdquo;, but we say: &ldquo;We cannot get the people to produce more eggs until you give the higher price.  Therefore, give the higher price and see what will happen. If you do not succeed in getting more eggs within, say, 12 months, then you will be able to say to us that we were wrong in thinking you would get more eggs.&rdquo;  That has not succeeded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So now, pull devil, pull baker, and there are no eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say no eggs, it is not so bad as all that.  Deputy Hughes was talking about figures.  I happened to be looking at some figures since the last debate here because one thing that has perhaps encouraged me to go back to figures was a remark by Deputy Fagan.  He talked about the aims of the last Government being one more sow, one more cow, one more acre under the plough.  It struck me that it would be well to examine that position and see what exactly was the result of the Fine Gael policy on these particular issues.  There is one thing about agricultural production in this country, that is, that over the last 20 years the volume of output has remained almost constant.  It has varied somewhat.  Taking 100 as the basis of the output in 1929-30, we find that the highest it reached in any year was 103.1, in 1936-37, but it never went lower than 95.2, which was in 1937-38; and, in 1939-40, the year the war commenced, which created different conditions and which period in my opinion should be taken separately, the output was 100.3.  So that, as far as volume of output goes, there was no great change in the last 20 years, since a native Government was set up.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I will have to deal with the calves too, if the Deputy puts me to it.  I was talking about the agricultural price index.  In 1922, when Deputy Cosgrave and his <Col N="276" /> Government took over control of this country, the price index was 160 and when they handed over to us it was 110.  As I said, it went down to the lowest point in 1935-36 and it came back to 110 in 1938.  Unfortunately the Statistics Department, for some reason, are basing the price index for the war years on a different basis.  On that basis, in 1941 it was 162.3.  Now in 1942, on the new basis, it appears it would be 20 points higher.</P>

I do not care what years the Deputy takes, I think he will find what I am saying is right. I think that there was a constant volume of production all the time; that there was a falling price from 1922 practically to 1935 or 1936, when it began to come up again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the policy was to have another cow, and if they failed even to have as many cows the year they went out as the year they came in, surely they failed in their policy.  If they failed to have as many acres under the plough, instead of the other acres they were to have, they failed in that too.  They did succeed in having more sows in 1931, but there were fewer cows and fewer acres under the plough.</P>

      <P>In 1922, the total number of cattle was 4,375,000 and, in 1931, 4,029,000, so that there were 350,000 fewer than in 1922.  Therefore there was no evidence anywhere of the policy being successful which the last Government pursued, namely, to have another cow and another acre under the plough.  They did succeed in bringing in the other sow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be as well to come to that, too.  At any rate, in 1939, before the war commenced, we did succeed in getting some of the cows back that were lost during the Cumann na nGaedheal time.  We did succeed in getting back some of the tillage.  In fact, we did succeed in getting more acres under the plough than were lost in the Cumann na nGaedheal time, and we did succeed in getting some of the cattle back that were lost during that time.  If the total numbers of cattle, with the number of cows and heifers-in-calf, and so on, were followed up, you will find that even in 1942, although they had been going down from 1939 to 1942, they were still as good as they were in 1931.  Of course, there is proof of that, because we did produce more creamery butter in 1942 than in 1931.</P>

      <P>The next point raised was with regard to the consumption of agricultural produce and, from the same <i>Trade Journal</i>&mdash;it is given in one <i>Trade Journal</i>, anyway&mdash;it would appear that the percentage consumed on farms has remained pretty constant from 1936-37 to 1940-41.  It has never been lower than 32.6 and it has never been higher than 35, and that was in 1940-41.  That represents the percentage of the value of the agricultural output consumed on the farms by people working on the farms.  The percentage consumed by other people has gone up from 17.9 in 1926-27 and in 1940-41 it was 33.6.  It was practically twice as large&mdash;the amount of the produce of the land consumed by people other than agriculturists, taking a period of 13 or 14 years.</P>

      <P>The next point I want to deal with is the point raised by Deputy Hughes with regard to the yield of wheat.  I do not know if everybody here is as familiar with the wheat question as some of us who have been here for the last 16 or 17 years.  I do not want to weary the two Parties who have been discussing the wheat question all that time by going over the <Col N="280" /> whole thing again, but if any of the new Deputies would like to get the background of the wheat question, they should get the report of the Economic Committee of 1928.  They will see there the reasons given by the Ministers of the last Administration why we should not grow wheat in this country.  They will see there also that wheat growing was advocated by the Ministers of the present Government who were then in opposition.  The only point of interest so far as that is concerned is that in the concluding portions of the majority report, which was signed by three Ministers of the last Government, it was stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If we were cut off not only from Great Britain but from the rest of the world, though we would find ourselves immediately short of certain foods, such as wheat, tea, and sugar &mdash;to take a few examples&mdash;nevertheless, apart from seasonal variations in supplies, we would still have an enormous surplus of cattle, sheep, poultry, butter, eggs, oats, and about 30 to 40 per cent. more pigs and bacon than we required.  People would find it necessary to do without certain articles of food to which they had become accustomed, but, so far from there being starvation, there would be a surplus of these important foodstuffs, and, if it were thought desirable, there could be a very considerable quantity of wheat produced within the country after one year.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the great policy-outlined in that report.  It was visualised that if ever there was a curtailment or a cutting-off of shipping between this and other countries&mdash;if we cannot get what we want now it amounts to the same thing&mdash;our embarrassment would be to get rid of things, but not to take things in.  We have found that that is not the case; we have found that our embarrassment is due to the things we want to get in, and not due to the things we want to get rid of.  I do not know if the Fine Gael Party would endorse that report now, in view of their experiences in <Col N="281" /> this war.  The Party certainly would not endorse the view that we could grow all the wheat we require inside a year or so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy is not so simple as to want me to explain to a body of sensible men &ldquo;why not&rdquo;? Deputy Hughes said we had not given expert assistance to the people in counties where they did not know how to grow wheat.  We had something like 20,000 acres or 30,000 acres of wheat at one time.  That would not provide enough seed to meet half the country's requirements, even if you put all that wheat into seed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows very well that if we had not been growing wheat in larger quantities here we would not have had sufficient to provide us with bread during the war years.  He knows well that if we had not grown wheat for some years we could not have managed as we did. Wheat growing is a very slow process. It is difficult to get people to grow wheat, or to engage in any other farming operation for that matter.  If we had not such a large quantity of wheat grown in the years immediately preceding the war we would not be able to have the 580,000 acres that we have at the moment.  We would not have had enough wheat in the country to meet seed and other requirements and <Col N="282" /> we would have been short of bread.  I know the type of alibi that can be put up by Deputy Dillon and by others. Deputy Dillon is the Deputy who said that wheat growing was all &ldquo;codology&rdquo; and he would not be found dead in a field of wheat. Naturally, he must give some good reason now why he made that statement at one time.  One reason that I heard him give was that now he has land fit to grow wheat, while others, having grown wheat on it for some years, have not such suitable land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite Deputies to read the majority report of the Economic Committee and observe the reasons why the Irish people should not grow wheat.  In that report we were told of the unsuitable weather conditions and the unsuitable condition of the soil; we were told the crows would interfere with the crop and that the wheat growing areas would be choked with weeds. Does Deputy Dillon want to persuade the members of Clann na Talmhan, who are new to this House, that we have a different climate and a different type of soil, now that the war is on, or that the crows will not come down and interfere with the wheat?  That is the type of logic you have coming from Deputy Dillon and from the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon says that those who did not grow wheat so far have very good land now, land on which a good crop can be produced.  There are exceptions to every rule.  The farmers in the tillage counties who grew wheat in the past are, I suggest, getting better yields now than the farmers who did not formerly grow wheat.  I say that is the general rule, and I do not care what may be quoted by way of exception to that rule.  Every Deputy here who has knowledge of farming knows that is true, that the tillage farmers who grew wheat in the past are getting better yields.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All our wheat does not go to the mills.  It is calculated&mdash;and that is all that it is possible to do&mdash;that the yield of between 60,000 and 100,000 acres is used by farmers themselves. Then a fair amount of wheat is used. for seed.  In all, these factors would account for 150,000 acres or more.  It is contended that the yields are very much lower as a result of what Deputy Hughes referred to as &ldquo;wheat ranching&rdquo;.  I looked up the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for the years 1930-31, and 1939-40, to see if there was any great change in the yields of these crops as a result of the &ldquo;wheat ranching&rdquo; of which Deputy Hughes speaks.  Any Deputy who looks up the <i>Abstract</i> will see that there has been no great change.  The yield would be slightly lower&mdash;about three-quarters of a cwt. lower for 1939-40 than for 1930-31.  The yield of oats and barley would be higher than it was in 1930-31.  There is no foundation, so far as figures go, for the allegation that we have destroyed the fertility of the land by growing wheat in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not, but Deputy Hughes is going a long way now.  All he accuses us of now is not improving the fertility of the soil.  A couple of years ago, he would have said that we had ruined the land.  He is coming round both on that point and on the point of bankruptcy.  I pass on to the question of butter.  As I said already, we have the general statement made by Fine Gael and other Deputies, that it is a scandalous thing in an agricultural country that we cannot feed our own people, that whereas we were able to export butter in 1930 and 1931, we have not now enough for ourselves.  But we have to consider the situation as it is.  The export of butter is not the test because, if we were to export butter, as would appear now to have been done <Col N="284" /> in 1929, 1930 and 1931, which should properly be reserved for our own people, we would be doing a wrong thing.  We are not exporting butter now, although the production of creamery butter during the past three years&mdash;1940, 1941 and 1942&mdash;was somewhat higher than it was in the last year of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. Although the production was lower in 1931, we exported in that year 264,000 cwts of creamery butter and we imported 30,000 cwts.  That left a net export of 234,000 cwts.  It would appear, therefore, as if our people had about 240,000 cwts. of butter less for consumption than they had in 1942. The evidence, therefore, goes to show that we are now consuming our own butter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was asked to refer to the pig industry.  I should like Deputies to cast their minds back a few years and consider the factors that necessitated regulation as regards the marketing of pigs.  The necessity arose about 1933 or 1934, when the British Government passed an Act which made it imperative on any country sending bacon to Great Britain to send it through one agency and on a quota basis.  Those were the two points we had to keep in mind.  We had to send it in a regulated way through an agency, and we had to send only a certain quantity per year. That necessitated regulation on this side.  A tribunal was set up, the personnel of which had already been examining the bacon industry when the question of putting a tariff on bacon was being considered.  That tribunal was called the Pig Industries Tribunal, and it considered this whole question, and made recommendations as to how it should be dealt with.  As a result of these recommendations, a Bill was drafted.  I brought that Bill before the Dáil, and there was general agreement as to its provisions.  It was one of the Bills&mdash;one of the very few&mdash;for which a special committee was set up to consider any amendments that might be necessary, and there was no such thing as any Party cleavage on the provisions of the measure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon might be able to make these allegations, but can he produce the evidence?  I challenged him before to give us some evidence on that, but he did not.  Perhaps he will do it on this occasion.  It was generally agreed that the legislation should go through, and that a board should be set up to regulate the pig industry, and now, of course, in the typical Fine Gael fashion, including Deputy Dillon, they wash their <Col N="286" /> hands of the whole thing.  For everything that goes wrong, the Government is to blame, but if there is any good provision in a Bill, it is to the credit of the Opposition only.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;reasons can be given why that board ought to be changed. I found that the type of board envisaged in the beginning was entirely unworkable, whatever else might be done.  At any rate, that is as far as the regulations go.  Of course, this Dáil is quite entitled to enforce any changes it might think desirable in that legislation, or in these regulations, and short of enforcing these views, we will be glad to get constructive suggestions. But when an attempt is being made&mdash;and I do not say it is being made here to-day, although it certainly <Col N="287" /> has been made in the past&mdash;to claim that that is responsible for the low number of pigs in the country, we are going on, I think, to what is ridiculous.</P>
      <P>After all, what is the use of talking? The number of pigs has gone down to half of what it was in 1939 and 1930, or, if you like, half of what it was in 1940, because it happens that the number of pigs was higher in 1940 than in 1939.  But it has gone down to half because we have not got the feeding. Will any Deputy state to me that I am not right in that?  Will any Deputy say that there is feeding for pigs if we had the pigs to give it to, or if people were satisfied to feed pigs under the present way of working?  We know that the feeding for pigs is not there.  Deputy Hughes did make a sort of suggestion that we could consider the position and produce the feeding, but that appears to me to carry the implication that we could till more land.  I am very much in favour of tillage, and if I thought that there was a strong volume of opinion in this House that we should put up the percentage for tillage, well, I certainly would advise the Government strongly to adopt it.  But I am quite sure that we will not get that strong volume of opinion here, that we should increase the percentage of tillage, because it appears that we have gone nearly as high as we are likely to succeed in going.</P>
      <P>Next year, the percentage will be 33?, including first crop meadow, not exceeding a fourth of that total.  I think that if we tried to go higher, it would be difficult to enforce the Order. We may have to go higher.  Circumstances may be different in two or three years' time.  If the war were to go on for five years more, we would want to be careful&mdash;we are not getting any artificial manures&mdash;that we will have the land to produce the crops Unless, as I say, there are Deputies who are prepared to say that there is feeding in this country that could be given to pigs, or who are prepared to say we could produce more feeding for pigs, I do not think there is any use in going into the question of the small number of pigs in the country.  It cannot be helped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> We are in a very different position to-day from that of the last war. Someone said that we were able to produce pigs in the last war.  We were, I know, but we were in a different, position. In the last war, it must be remembered that there was a good deal of wheat and flour, as well as other classes of feeding stuffs, coming into this country.  For instance, in 1916, when the war was on for three years, 10,000,000 cwts. of maize were imported. In the next year, 1917, which corresponds to this one so far as the present war is concerned, about 7,000,000 cwts. of maize were imported, as well as bran and pollard, linseed cake and linseed meal and quite a large quantity of wheat and flour, so that we had in the last war good supplies of wheat from which we got offals.  As well as that, we had a lot of maize, a good lot of offals apart from the wheat, and a good lot of linseed meal and other things.  In fact, if any Deputy will look back over those figures and examine them for himself he will find that there were enough feeding stuffs to feed up to a million pigs in the year.  We have not that now, and what is more, although we have as much tillage as we had during the last war, we are now growing 575,000 acres of wheat.  There was much less than 200,000 acres of wheat in the last war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Less than what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Less than 200,000 acres. If we were only growing the same amount, obviously we would have 300,000 acres of oats and barley for pigs.  To-day we have less oats and barley, no offals from the mills and no imported feeding stuffs, and if any Deputy will examine these figures, he will see that the difference would be sufficient to feed a million pigs in the year.  There is no use, therefore, in comparing the position here during the last war and the position to-day.</P>

      <P>Wait now.  That is as far as pigs offered for sale by farmers are concerned.  Any farmer who goes to the factory must have his pigs taken from him.  Where pigs are brought to the market it is a different thing. There were markets in parts of the country where that had occurred on some occasions.  There were no buyers on some occasions.  The Deputy knows that that may occur, no matter what regulations you make.  It occurs with other animals as well as with pigs that there are no buyers.  Wherever the Pigs Marketing Board found that that was likely to occur, they have authorised agents to consign all pigs to a factory, but, even in spite of that, individual cases may occur.</P>

      <P>The buyers were there, and they bought the pigs at 88/- a cwt., and surely they must have some place to sell them to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point, too.  The regulations made compel factories to pay a certain price, but they do not compel the middle man to pay it, because it is impossible to provide for weighing facilities wherever a bargain is made.  Therefore, it had to be left out.  If the Deputy would tell me of some practical way under which every farmer must get a fixed price for his pig, I shall be delighted.  Deputy Fagan knows that we had the same trouble in regard to cattle.  You cannot have a scales on every farmer's place, and, therefore, you must allow buying by hand in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point that was raised was in regard to potatoes.  Figures were given here recently, I think, to the effect that, as a matter of fact, the production of potatoes in this country in 1931, the last year of the Fine Gael Government, was 1,932,000 tons, and that in 1942&mdash;that is, the crop of which we have just finished the consumption &mdash;the production was 3,120,000 tons.  So that the production of potatoes in 1942 was very much higher than in previous years, but we all know that there was a very much bigger call on potatoes last year and the year before than in previous years.  We ourselves know that men with pigs had to feed potatoes to them&mdash;pigs that otherwise might have been put on the market&mdash;because they had nothing else to give them.  The same applies in regard to cattle.  For that reason, the potatoes did not go as far as we should like them to go, and there was a shortage. The shortage, however, was of comparatively short duration and was confined practically to the City of Dublin.  I think that these are things that it would be impossible for any authority to avoid, whether by regulations or otherwise.  I remember that during the last war, shortages of potatoes occurred frequently.  I remember going into hotels here in Dublin during the last war, on more than one occasion, and potatoes could not be got for lunch.  You got rice or <Col N="291" /> something else because there were no potatoes to be had.  Nobody, however, seemed to find fault with the British Government at that time for the shortage of potatoes.  I suppose we were more lenient in connection with the difficulties that the British Government had to face at that time than we are with the difficulties of our own Government now.  At any rate, there was no complaint at that time.  I do not think that I have anything else to talk about.  Sir, as I think I have dealt with any point that was raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has now heard from the Minister for Agriculture an account of his stewardship, and I wonder is the House edified?  I gather from the Minister for Agriculture that he has thrown up his hands in the air, admits that the situation is extremely unsatisfactory, and asks how can he be blamed for it.  I think that the Minister himself now realises that the whole country believes that the administration of his Department has been a disaster.  The facts are there: that we have reached the astonishing position in an agricultural country, in which we have neither bacon, butter nor eggs, and in which we are eating black bread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the Minister read out here from the report published in 1928, a statement by very distinguished men.  I think that he himself will agree with me on that.  They were no tyros, and, having gone into all the resources of this country, they foresaw that there would be a large surplus of bacon, butter and eggs, and foodstuffs of that kind.  I think that most rational people would have shared that view.  I doubt if any person in Europe could foresee that in Ireland, of all countries in the world, we would at this stage be confronted with a shortage of bacon, butter and eggs.  The Minister was constrained to prove here the other day that that was not his responsibility, and that at least we have bread; and in the process of developing that argument he seeks to justify his policy of &ldquo;grow more wheat&rdquo; pre-war, and to decry most of us who had the wisdom and foresight to condemn that policy unreservedly in the years before the <Col N="292" /> war.  I want to repeat explicitly now that the &ldquo;grow more wheat&rdquo; policy in this country before the war was a disaster for our people then, and that it is a disaster for our people now.  The shortages that we are at present experiencing in this country are in some measure attributable to the wheat policy pursued in this country before the war.</P>
    <P>Now, it is sought to make capital cut of the fact that in 1935, I think, I said that I would sooner be dead than grow wheat on my land at that time.  I wanted to call to the minds of Deputies of this House the situation that then obtained in this country.  You had in this country then, as an integral part of the &ldquo;grow more wheat&rdquo; policy, the operations of a flour-milling ring, headed by the firm of Rank &amp; Son.  At that time, Joseph Rank &amp; Son were bringing into Limerick cargoes of foreign wheat, leaving half the cargo at Limerick and proceeding with the other half to Liverpool. They milled that wheat in Limerick and compelled the agricultural labourer of this country, who had a wage of 24/- a week, to pay 36/- a sack for the flour milled from it.  They milled the same identical wheat in Liverpool, sold it to the people of Great Britain for 19/- a sack, and put the excess profit of 17/- per sack into their own pockets.  I say, as I have frequently said in public before, and as I repeat now, that during nine years of Fianna Fáil administration in this country the flour milling racket in this country was allowed to rob our people, and mainly the poor, of £2,000,000 per annum, which they put into their own pockets.</P>
    <P>I well remember standing behind my own counter and selling to an agricultural labourer, earning 24/- a week at the time, a bag of flour for 36/-, which he had to pay for in instalments, and as I collected those instalments from him I realised that the last eight instalments were going simply to swell the excess profits of the Rank milling combine, to pay the fantastic dividends that were paid on the inflated share capital of the Dock Milling Company.  Those last eight instalments from that worker were stolen from him by the milling racket <Col N="293" /> in this country, just as certainly as if they had broken down his back door and stolen the money from the pockets of his clothes beside his bed; and I say that one of the most dastardly crimes against the poor of this country was the permit that was given to that racket by the Fianna Fáil Government to rob the poor, and the Fianna Fáil Government has never dared to deny those facts.  We are told now that because it is expedient to grow wheat here during the middle of a war, it was obviously expedient, therefore, to grow it in times of peace.  During the siege of Derry the people were glad to eat rats when they could get nothing else; but would it be contended that, because they had to eat rats during the siege, they should also eat rats during the piping times of peace?  Was it good policy for people to eat rats in 1850 because they had to eat them in a time of starvation? Is it good policy to-day to suggest that we should do, in the piping times of peace in this country, what we have to do when we are being blockaded and in a state of what amounts to siege?  Nobody but a fool would run this country in times of peace on a basis which is expedient in times of war.  Do Ministers of that Government believe that it is expedient, to maintain in times of war all the tariffs and quotas that they believed it was expedient to maintain in times of peace?  Are they at this moment removing all the tariffs and quotas that they themselves put on in times of peace?  If it is consistent to be protectionist in times of peace and free trade in times of war, what inconsistency is there in believing that it may be expedient to grow wheat in times of war, and in times of peace to grow the crops which can be more profitably produced on our land?  I say, and I repeat, that before and after this war it was and will be suicidal folly to use the land of this country for growing inferior wheat at an exorbitant price, when we can purchase far superior wheat at an economic price and import it here, using the exports that we can profitably produce here to pay for it.</P>
    <P>Let me make a case in point.  In <Col N="294" /> times of peace, take a farmer with an acre of land.  If you went to him with two samples of wheat and said: &ldquo;The sample of wheat in my left hand, when sown on your land, will produce four barrels of wheat to your acre; the sample of wheat in my right hand, when sown on your land, will produce ten barrels of wheat to your acre,&rdquo; what sample of wheat would the farmer choose to sow?  Surely he would choose the sample in your right hand, and thus get ten barrels of wheat from his acre of land instead of being content with four barrels?  Is it not exactly the same thing to go to a farmer in times of peace and say to him: &ldquo;If you grow wheat upon your land you may hope to get 6½ barrels of wheat off your acre of land, but, if you grow barley or oats or roots on that same acre of land, feed it to livestock and sell the livestock, you will then be able to buy, with the proceeds of what you sell off that acre of land, ten barrels of wheat, a suit of clothes and a pair of boots as well?  Is it sane for the farmer to be content with four miserable barrels or six miserable barrels of wheat off his acre when, by growing other crops, converting the produce into livestock, selling the livestock and using the money thereby secured to purchase wheat, he would be able to get twice as much wheat and a pair of boots and a suit of clothes into the bargain?  Is it sane economics to ask the people of this country to content themselves with six barrels of wheat off that acre, when in fact they could get far more by using their land to the best advantage?</P>

      <P>No sane man in this country or in any other country contends that we can produce wheat on our land in competition with Canada, <Col N="295" /> Australia and the Plate.  It is perfectly true that, if we choose to pay an excessive price for wheat, we could make wheat pay the man who sows it here, but, in open competition with the rest of the world, we can produce on our land agricultural produce superior in quality to any agricultural produce in the world, we can sell it in the markets of the world, and, with the proceeds of that sale, we can get from our land 150 per cent. more wealth than if we were employing the land in growing wheat.  Now, that is in times of peace.  But, when you are confronted with the situation which is produced as a result of universal war, it may become expedient to grow upon the land a crop you would not contemplate growing under the ordinary economic conditions that obtain in times of peace.  In those circumstances, if we must have wheat and have nowhere else to get it, I think the sensible thing to do is to grow it on our own land, but, having made up our minds that that is a necessary thing to do, we should do it firmly and resolutely, and not in the half-hearted kind of way which contorts and destroys our whole agricultural economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister laments that we have not the wherewithal to produce pigs and so forth.  &ldquo;Why have we not enough barley?&rdquo;, he asks.  I repeat the question, and I will supply the answer.  Why is it that the farmer who grows barley in Ireland has to sell it at 35/- a barrel, while the farmer who grows barley in Great Britain gets 70/- a barrel for it?  Do Deputies know that?  Do Deputies know that at this moment the price fixed by the British Government for barley in Great Britain is 70/- a barrel?  For the barrel of barley grown in Ireland, the price fixed by the Government here is 35/-.  Messrs.  Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co., at the present moment pay 70/- a barrel for barley in Great Britain.  Messrs.  Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co., were perfectly willing to pay 70/- a barrel for barley in Ireland.  Who stopped them?  Was it their customers?  Was it their shareholders?  Was it their board of directors?  It was not.  It was <Col N="296" /> Deputy Dr. Ryan.  He stepped in and said: &ldquo;No, you will not pay 70/- a barrel.  We will not let you pay more than 35/- a barrel.&rdquo;  Why?  Because, he said, if the farmers get more than 35/- a barrel for barley they will stop growing wheat at 50/- a barrel; because barley at 40/- a barrel would pay them better than wheat at 50/- a barrel; and, because we want to keep up the fiction that wheat is a popular crop which everybody wants to grow if they are given a chance, we will not allow the farmers of this country to get an economic price for their other cereal crops in order to force them to grow wheat if they want to get a profit.</P>
    <P>Do Deputies in this House realise what the law is relating to oats?  If a farmer in this country produces oats on his land, he must sell it at 14/8 a cwt.  But if he finds that he sold a bit too much, and wants to get a couple of cwts. back from the dealer, the dealer can charge him 25/- a cwt. for it.  The man has produced the oats himself, and has been constrained to sell it at 14/8 a cwt., and if he takes a penny more he has broken the law, but when he goes to buy back a cwt. of it from the man to whom he sold it he can be charged 25/-.  Why?  Because the Government contends that, if you allow the farmer to get more than 14/8 a cwt. for oats, oats will become a more attractive crop to grow than wheat at 50/-, and you will not get the requisite quantity of wheat. At this stage of the situation, I do not believe it is profitable to be wrangling about who was right or who was wrong before the war.  I am perfectly certain that I was right and that Fianna Fáil was wrong, but, if we are committed to a certain line of policy, the concern of us all ought to be&mdash;once the stage of discussion and argument is over&mdash;to make that line of policy as successful as we can.  We are committed to get wheat out of our own land.  I say that the proper thing to do is to require every farmer in the wheat-growing counties to grow a certain percentage of his land in wheat.  If they complain that that is going to result in a certain loss, I would say to them: &ldquo;Very well; sow more oats and barley.  Sell it in a <Col N="297" /> free market.  If you can get 70/- or 80/- a barrel for barley, more power to your elbow.  If you can get an increased price for oats, more power to your elbow.  Make up in the profit on your oats and barley, and the live stock you can produce out of those crops, whatever loss you take on the wheat, and accept the responsibility of producing on your land for the period of this crisis a certain proportion of wheat, which we will perhaps be constrained to admit is not going to yield you much profit, but it is your contribution to helping to get the nation through this emergency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have heard the Minister for Agriculture saying that there are certain types of land in this country on which it would be a crime to sow wheat. Very well; no irretrievable harm would be done if wheat were sown on that land, under a compulsory scheme, for one year.  An appeals board for each county could be set up, and, after a man had done his duty, he could lodge an appeal with the appeals board, and if, on examination, he proved that he had no land which could be profitably placed under wheat, he could be exempted from the general Order.  But farms in this country of over 30 acres&mdash;I do not think a compulsory wheat Order should apply to farms of less than 30 acres&mdash;on which there is not some piece which would grow some kind of a crop of wheat are few and far between. It would be infinitely more advantageous to our agricultural community if they were allowed to get the full price for everything else they produced, and were compelled to sow a certain percentage of their land under wheat at 50/- a barrel, than to have the price of everything they produce slashed and cut down in order to make wheat at 50/- a barrel more attractive than any other crop they can produce. The net result of that line of policy is that there is not enough feeding stuffs for pigs; that there is not enough feeding stuffs for fowl; that there is no oatmeal; that there is not enough feeding stuffs for any of the things that we ordinarily produced, and the farmers are going back to subsistence farming.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy in this House, Farmer, <Col N="298" /> Labour, and everybody else, knows that for the past three months you could not get a stone of oatmeal in this country?  Why?  Because the farmers would not sell their oats to oatmeal millers at 14/8 and the oatmeal millers were not allowed to pay any more than 14/8.  The Minister may rejoice that he has kept the price of oatmeal so low, but what is the use of that if you cannot get a stone of oatmeal anywhere in the country?  What is going to happen, I believe, is that a considerable number of farmers will be driven into the position in which they will not produce any food at all for general consumption.  They will produce sufficient only for their own needs because no man will engage in production if he is not allowed a reasonable profit on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture expressed astonishment at the disappearance of pigs.  I never met a man with a shorter memory than the Minister for Agriculture.  Does the Minister remember the time when the bacon ring really got under way in this country?  Does not every Deputy remember the time when you had reared a pig to a certain point and brought him to the factory hoping to get top grade?  When you reached the factory you were told that they could not take the pig as he was just 2 Ibs. under weight.  You were told to take him home and bring him again in a fortnight's time.  You travelled, perhaps, seven miles home with the pig, and you brought him back again in a fortnight.  Then you were told that the pig was now 7 lbs. over weight, and for that reason you would have to accept 20/- per cwt. less.  You said: &ldquo;Very well then, I will take 14 Ibs. of that bacon.  It must be at least 6d. per Ib. less than top price, since you will not allow me the full price for my pig.&rdquo;  Then you were told by the factory: &ldquo;Oh, no; you will pay the same price for the bacon, no matter what pig it is taken from.  We are cutting you 20/- per cwt. in the price of your pig, but that does not mean that the bacon will cost you any less.&rdquo;  Does the Taoiseach not remember those days?  Does the Taoiseach not realise &mdash;&mdash;</P>

Very few farmers sold their pigs direct to the factory in Ireland until the Pigs and Bacon Board was set up.  They were sold at dead pork markets in Northern Ireland and at liye pig markets in Southern Ireland, but nobody ever brought his pig to a factory, except within a very restricted area, until the board was set up.  That business was something which was initiated by the Pigs and Bacon Board.  It was under their dispensation and the rules that they laid down, under the grading they stipulated, that this peculiar outrage was perpetrated on those who produced pigs.  I know thousands of farmers in County Monaghan on whom that was done two or three times.  That is what brought a speedy end to pig production in Ireland.</P>

That was done consistently and deliberately.  I remember coming into this House and saying: &ldquo;If you allow this racket to go on, two things are going to happen. The proprietors and shareholders of the bacon factories will make gigantic profits and the people will get out of pigs.&rdquo;  I pointed to my own personal experience.  I put £300 into a bacon factory and I was able to show the Taoiseach where I got £900 for my £300 at the end of 12 months.  There were other fellows who put £10,000 into the factory and were able to get £30,000 at the end of 12 months.</P>

      <P>Sometimes I get a little impatient of arguing with the Minister for Agriculture because he is clearly incompetent. I do not think it is any use arguing with him.  I think I might as well argue with a feather pillow; you can make no impression on him.  I think I am bound to say he is a lazy man, that confronted with difficulties he runs away.  He simply throws his hands in the air and says &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; I feel sometimes that we are getting nowhere when we argue with the Minister for Agriculture, on the assumption that he is going to remain here.  That is why I felt so deeply when the question arose as to whether he should be removed from that office because I do not think that, so long as he is there we shall make any progress.  He is a thoroughly incompetent Minister.  No doubt he is a well-intentioned and kindly man but he does not know his job.  He has been 10 years in office and if he is there for another 40 years longer he will know even less than he does now.  I look with greater interest to the post-war period than to the acute difficulties with which we find ourselves confronted at present.  I believe that we are in such an infernal mess now that nothing but the grace of God will get us out of it.  I have no hopes of any effective reform coming from the Fianna Fáil Party in respect to the crisis with which we are confronted at present.  The grace of God and our own exertions will get us through the next few years, but we shall get no help from Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thinking of the time post-war. Do Deputies ever ask themselves, what plans we should be making now to meet the post-war period?  Fianna Fáil has intoxicated itself with the absurdity of economic self-sufficiency. The Taoiseach has intoxicated himself with that absurdity, too.  He believes, with the Minister for the Coordination of Defensive Measures, that if all the ships in the world were sunk <Col N="302" /> and we here were like Robinson Crusoe we would be very much better off.  I differ with him fundamentally in that view.  I am convinced that in the post-war period our people will still want tea and will prefer it to light beer, no matter how much the Taoiseach may advocate up and down the country the consumption of light beer. I believe that our people will want a drop of oil for their lamps.  Possibly, the Taoiseach has in mind the melting of fat and the use of Egyptian lamps. I believe that our people will stick to the old paraffin lamp and will want a drop of oil for it.  I believe that we will still use lorries and motor cars, and for these we will want petrol.  I believe that the vast bulk of our people will continue to use bicycles and for these they will want rubber tyres.  I believe that the vast bulk of our people will prefer cotton shirts to hair shirts, and, accordingly, we will have to import cotton.  We cannot grow cotton in Ireland I do not think that even the Minister for Agriculture would undertake its production.  If we do not grow it in Ireland, then we will have to get it outside the country. There are many other commodities that we do not produce and that we must get from elsewhere.  If we have to get them from outside, then we will have to pay for them.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask Deputies to consider the question: what are we going to pay for these things with?  So far as I know we have no fund from which to pay for them except the fund created by the export of our agricultural surplus.  Other countries, like South Africa, may have gold and diamonds which they can dig up and dispose of to purchase the things they must get from abroad.  England has coal, iron and shipping to provide her with exchange to purchase from outside the things that she needs.  The United States of America have oil and different natural resources which can be exploited to purchase from outside countries the things she needs.  This country is not in that position and has nothing except her 12,000,000 acres of arable land.  If we are not able to get an exportable surplus of agricultural produce which can be produced <Col N="303" /> at a profit by the men who live on the land, then we cannot import the necessaries to which I have referred. Our people, therefore, will have to get along without them, and they will be reduced to the lowest standard of living of any nation in Europe.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that ultimately every section in our community, whether people live in the towns or villages or in the country, depends on the land. Every civil servant, every transport worker, every shop assistant, every shopkeeper and every wage earner in this country ultimately derives his income from the land, and if the land does not produce it there is no other fund from which he can hope to get it. Everything that we import must be paid for by the money realised on the sale of our agricultural surplus.  We cannot get an agricultural surplus off our 12,000,000 acres of arable land unless the farmers living on the land are in a position to earn a profit in producing it.  What is the farmer's profit?  It is the difference between his cost of production and the price that he gets for his finished product.  Do Deputies realise that in many cases £10 can be a better price for a pig than £22?  Most men, I am sure, would say that they would much prefer the £22 to the £10, but if they were prudent men they would say that they would like to know the circumstances surrounding the two transactions.  If it costs £7 to produce a pig that you got £10 for, leaving you a profit of £3, and if you get £22 for a pig that it cost you £24 to produce, thereby losing £2 on its production, in those circumstances the £10 pig is the better transaction.  We have got to sell our agricultural surplus in the British market, because we have nowhere else in the world to sell it. The Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party went stamping around the world for three years looking for alternative markets.  As Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, I heard of the crate of hens that went to Amsterdam and of the butter that went to Berlin. There were some other things that I cannot recall.  I think there was something about a consignment of butter to Paris.  In fact, it went somewhere else, but, finally, it was <Col N="304" /> sold in London for axle grease.  At the time, the smell from it was so bad that no one could get near enough to it to ascertain what exactly it was.  Then we had the eggs that were sent to Spain and that were to be paid for with oranges.  We are still waiting for the payment.</P>
    <P>That bitter experience taught the Taoiseach what some of us already knew, that the British market is the only one in which we can sell our exportable agricultural surplus.  If we are to have an agricultural surplus post-war, in order to be able to buy the things that we do not produce ourselves, then it must be produced at a profit.  There is no use in pretending that we can control the price that we are going to get for this exportable surplus.  If we cannot raise prices in the British market, how can we hope to increase the farmer's profit?  I will tell you.  If, as I have said, the farmer's profit is the difference between his costs of production and the price that he gets for his finished product, and if we cannot raise the price that he gets for his agricultural produce in the British market, can we not bring down his costs of production? If we can do that, does it not produce the same result?</P>
    <P>How can we do it?  By taking the taxes and restrictions off the raw materials of the agricultural industry. If we do not want our farmers to buy in the cheapest market in which they can buy the raw materials of their industry, then we cannot expect them to sell their finished products in one of the cheapest markets in the world. The British market is the most competitive market in the world for Irish produce.  The farmers of this country have to meet there every exporter in the world, and have to take the prices that rule there as a result of that competition. At present our farmers have to bear all the taxes and restrictions that have been put upon their industry by Fianna Fáil.  I stand for the removal of all taxes and restrictions from feeding stuffs, farm implements, agricultural machinery and artificial manures.  The taxes that we have in operation should come off yellow meal, buckets, spades, shovels, <Col N="305" /> agricultural machinery, artificial manures, and everything that a farmer uses in producing the finished product which he has to export.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter which we can consider on its merits. The farmer must get a profit on what he produces.  If he does not get a profit on his agricultural surplus, then we must do without tea, oil, petrol, rubber and shirts, unless Deputy Alien is prepared to wear the Taoiseach's hair shirt.  I certainly am not.  If I cannot get an imported shirt, I will wear no shirt at all.  Unless the farmer can get a profit on his agricultural surplus, that will be the inescapable fact.  Deputies may like or dislike it, but that is the fact.  If the Taoiseach could have sold our agricultural surplus in Persia or Samarkand in 1932 or 1933, it would have been a glorious day.  The Tánaiste was then going around the country whipping John Bull.  The idea of feeding the poor man was anathema to them.  They would have preferred to sell to the Shah of Persia or the Nyzam of Hyderabad.  But since then they have discovered that it is much more profitable to sell our stuff to John Bull. We may or may not like that situation. Unless we are fools we will face it, and, facing it, we will take the measures requisite to secure that we will make the best profit we can in the only market we have for our agricultural surplus.  There is no use in pretending that we can control prices there.  We cannot.  Therefore we must take from the farmer's back as much as we can of his costs of production. We can do that by removing all taxes and restrictions from the raw materials of his industry which he has to import.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers of this country have suffered themselves to be robbed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Any manufacturer who wanted to start up here in any line of business was entitled to demand concessions, trade loan facilities and exemptions from import taxes.  When Salts (Saltaire), a firm from the midlands of England, wanted to get their raw material&mdash;machinery&mdash; to start a worsted factory they got it in free of <Col N="306" /> duty with the greatest possible pleasure.  I would remind the House that every small farm in this country is an industry.  Any two dozen farms in any county in Ireland employ more men and will always employ more men than Salts (Saltaire) have ever employed or will employ in this country.</P>
    <P>But do they get any facility in securing their raw material?  None at all. They have to pay tax on a bucket to two gentlemen down in the back streets in Dublin.  If they want to buy a rake, spade or a shovel, a tax has to be paid to somebody else.  If they want to buy a mowing machine, a plough, a rake or a tedder, a constituent of Deputy Allen's comes into the field and demands that he shall get his pound of flesh in the taxes that have been levied on agricultural machinery.  If they want to buy artificial manure, the manure ring in Dublin must be consulted and must get their pint of blood out of the farmer before he is allowed to buy a bag of super.  If he wants to buy a bag of maize meal, he is held up as a kind of public enemy, as the awful man who wants to bring Indian meal into Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to bring Indian meal into Ireland.  I want to bring into Ireland the cheapest and best Indian meal we can buy anywhere in the world, and if anybody sets up a mill in Ireland and mills Indian meal at a price cheaper than that at which I can buy it anywhere else, more power to his elbow&mdash; I will buy it from him&mdash;but if it is contended that in order to gratify the Indian meal millers, the shovel and grape makers, the fork makers, the mowing machine makers, the rake makers, the manure makers and everybody else who wants to line his pockets at the expense of the people of the country, the agricultural industry must be sacrificed to all these people and is to contribute something to the excess profits of all these gentlemen who are growing bloated behind the tariff walls erected here for the last ten years, the industry will collapse, as it is collapsing.</P>
    <P>If it does collapse, bear this in mind; they will have this gloomy satisfaction, that the day the agricultural surplus ceases to be exported from this country <Col N="307" /> there will be no found from which to buy the steel and iron that constitute the raw materials of the factories which produce agricultural machinery; there will be no money to buy the phosphate rock from North Africa which constitutes the raw material of the artificial manure industry; there will be no money to pay for the jute which makes the bag into which artificial manure is put by the manure ring; there will be no money to supply any of these gentlemen with the excess profits they have enjoyed at the expense of the agricultural community in the past.</P>
    <P>What astonishes me is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who will no doubt intervene in the debate, will grow livid with rage at any adverse comment on the industrial elements of our community.  To reflect upon them is an outrage, a betrayal and a sabotage of our national effort.  They must be facilitated in every possible way, but if the unfortunate farming community come forward and ask for nothing more than this, that the Government should get out of their light and let them do their job without interference from anybody, they are told it is nonsense, that they must be content to pay whatever prices the manufacturers operating behind tariffs and quotas choose to ask and that, if they do not pay these prices, they can damn well do without the things they have to buy.  Signs on it, we are where we are at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what Fianna Fáil believes.  Fianna Fáil believes in its heart that the rearing of pigs is a dirty job.  The Tánaiste says it leaves dung on your hands and mouth, and they really believe that any sensible man would be much happier not rearing them.  It is a dirty job, and, if you can get £480 a year, who the hell would rear pigs?  The average Fianna Fáil Deputy thinks that farming is a contemptible, low occupation and that only wage slaves engage in it, and that <Col N="308" /> really the farmer who is best off is the farmer who is getting through by some wangle, doing as little work as he can and getting as much profit as he can knock out of the land by honest or dishonest methods.  The bulk of the people do not agree with Deputy Kennedy. The bulk of the people are born of parents who were members of the Land League and who wanted to own their own holdings in order to get a decent living out of them without being beholden to landlords or politicians.  They wanted to be free men and not to be dependent on doles and concessions from the Fianna Fáil Party or anybody else.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy forgets that. The Deputy's instinct is to assume that every farmer in the country who has been driven to the desperate straits of having to depend on doles, pensions and subsidies of one kind or another ought to be happy and grateful to the Government who supplies them.  Most decent farmers are humiliated by the thought that, their fathers having shaken off the shackles of the landlord, they are obliged to draw on the shackles of Fianna Fáil in order to be given a chance to live.  Sensible people want to restore to the farmers the independence born of prosperity which was won for them and which has been taken from them by the folly of Fianna Fáil.  I do not think we can content ourselves with simply removing the levies and taxes put on the raw materials of the agricultural industry by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I think we must go further.  We must derate agricultural land as it has been derated in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, because if our farmers have to compete with the British farmer and the Northern Ireland farmer in the British market, they ought to be put on an equal footing with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that another most urgently necessary reform is to put an end to the system whereby new buildings on a farmer's holding should be made the subject of revaluation for the purpose of increasing the rates.  I well remember my father telling me that <Col N="309" /> one of the great nightmares of the tenant farmers of the 70's was that they dare not repair their houses because the moment they did so, the landlord came down and increased the rent.  The situation at present is exactly the same, if you substitute &ldquo;rate collector&rdquo; for &ldquo;landlord.&rdquo;  If you venture to build a new pigsty, or turn what was a lean-to into a decent, well-ventilated building for cattle, the rate collector comes in and there is a revaluation and you discover that the rateable valuation has gone up by £2 or £3 which may represent an annual rent of anything from 10/- to 30/- per year.  No landlord would have dared to ask for more and in face of these demands by landlords, we fought the land war, in order to get a fair rent and to prevent these activities.  I feel that just as great an evil is growing, and it is a comment amongst those who understand Irish agriculture that one of its characteristics is a deficiency of farm buildings on very small holdings. One of the reasons is that people are afraid to build them because it means an increase in valuation, which means an additional annual rent.</P>
    <P>I think we have to go beyond that. It is true our farmers in many places are not getting out of their land the maximum return they should get, and I therefore want to see a system of agricultural education developed which will enable the boys coming out of the schools to go on their fathers' lands with at least some elementary education in agriculture.  Accordingly, I suggest to those who are responsible that every elementary school should, in the last year, when a boy is 13 years of age and in sixth book, offer him the alternative, with his parent's consent, of leaving the primary school and going to a technical school to spend two years, up to the age of 15, learning elementary agriculture under a system of compulsory attendance.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, I have always believed, and still believe, that we should establish throughout this country demonstration farms.  I do not mean experimental farms.  There is all the difference in the world between an experimental and a demonstration farm.  The experimental farm is one on <Col N="310" /> which you primarily intend to lose money.  You try out every experiment, and perhaps, out of every 100, 85 will fail.  You winnow out the 15 worth following up.  On such a farm you are bound to lose money.  It is meant for that purpose&mdash;to be an experimental place.  But when you have winnowed out the 15 successful plans, I want a demonstration farm where, under practical conditions, we can see these successful theories put into operation.  We have to bear in mind in that connection that the system of farming suitable to County Meath may be highly unsuitable to County Mayo.  What I want to see is the farmers of Mayo having demonstrated before them the most efficient methods of husbandry suitable to the conditions obtaining in County Mayo.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture here, I believe, is a very fine Department of Agriculture, in so far as personnel is concerned.  We have some of the finest men in the whole world in the Irish Department of Agriculture.  Some of the higher officials of that Department would take their place beside agricultural experts in any country in the world.  I am convinced that, given a free hand, those men can make a great contribution to the agricultural economy of this country, but I want to ensure that any advice they have to give us will be demonstrated to us as practical propositions before people are required to undertake expense on their own holdings in the attempt to put their proposals into operation.  If all these schemes that the Department believe could profitably be employed upon the land of Ireland are valid, what conceivable objection can there be to demonstrating them?  They ought to make money.  Demonstration farms should be self-supporting.  If a farm of 25 acres is sufficient for a farmer, his wife and family of four children. surely it ought to be adequate for one inspector.  Let the inspector who is prepared to tell the farmers how to run their farms, come down and take the kind of farm that the people he is instructing have to live on and demonstrate to the people on that farm that he can make more out of it than they can.  That is the acid test.  If he cannot make more out of 25 acres than the <Col N="311" /> local farmers can, let him go home to Dublin and think again, but if he can come down and demonstrate to the local farmers a better method of using a 25-acre holding than is at present being employed by the farmers, I venture to say that he will be a very welcome person and the more demonstration he does the more welcome he will be.</P>
    <P>It is that post-war situation I am thinking of.  I do not think the Taoiseach can charge me with having spent the time I have taken up in this House in making nothing but an unconstructive and malignant attack upon the Minister for Agriculture.  I do not think I have wasted much time in talking about the poor Minister for Agriculture. I do not think he is worth talking about.  I have tried to indicate quite clearly what I believe is the only hope of agriculture post-war.  That is what really matters.</P>
    <P>I have tried to demonstrate to this House&mdash;and I think it is time the Labour Party looked to it&mdash;that unless agriculture is saved our people are going to have a lower standard of living than any community in Europe because we are one of the poorest countries in the world in the matter of natural resources, and the inevitable result of that poverty would be that vast masses of our people would emigrate.  We would become a nation of old men and children, because everybody who is capable of hard work and enterprise is going to fly this country if he finds there is no place in it where he can earn a decent livelihood.  If agriculture perishes, every other element in our community perishes.</P>
    <P>Post-war, God knows, we are going to have problems enough.  If we have a prosperous agriculture I believe we will be able to survive.  If we have not, we will all sink together.  I have no place to go to out of this country. Everything I have got is in this country.  I cannot shift and I have no desire to sink.  I want to keep afloat, and my interest in this business is in no sense philanthropic.  I am here.  I cannot get out.  I would not be happy out, and if the country is going down I have to go down with it. I am perfectly certain the country need <Col N="312" /> not go down.  I do not believe we will ever be rich in this country&mdash;we have not the wherewithal to make our people rich&mdash;but we could be comfortable. If the land of this country were used with common prudence there is in these 12,000,000 acres sufficient to give every person in this country a modest standard of comfort.  If we get that, that is all we want, but unless we are prepared to turn our backs most definitely on the Fianna Fáil theories in relation to agricultural economics, sink we certainly shall.  It is possible to do that, and I am not without hope that we will do it, but it may be necessary to change the Government before we do it.</P>
    <P>I see here in the ranks of the Farmers' Group a body of men who claim to be intimately associated with the agricultural industry.  I shall watch with interest the result of a year or two of their experience of Fianna Fáil. I sympathise with them in their hope that, by persuasion, remonstrance and argument, they can get the Government to do better in the future than they have done in the past.  My bitter experience has taught me that there is no hope whatever along those lines, because they are thoroughly incompetent on the Fianna Fáil Benches. There is no use in arguing with them. You can never get them to do what is right.  However, I suppose I had to learn that bitter lesson by experience when I came into this House.  I hope and believe the members of the Farmers' Group will learn it too, and I look forward to a situation post-war in which they and the rest of us will cooperate, not only with those who live on the land but with every section of the community.</P>
    <P>There is one last word I want to say. The Taoiseach, on Friday morning, was in one of his familiar moods until Deputy Larkin let a roar at him.  He was in the mood when the lock of hair was shaken down and he was whacking the desk&mdash;a mood with which we are all familiar.  In that mood he was wagging his head and threatening us all with a general election on the ground that it was impossible for him to carry on by a logical, consistent line of policy, if he had not a clear majority.  He has, of course, in  <Col N="313" /> back of his head some devious political purpose for that declaration.  God knows what it is.  Nobody else but the Taoiseach knows, but be sure of this, it is a shrewd purpose.  It was stated by design for some purpose that nobody but the Taoiseach fully understands, and we will not see the purpose of it maybe for 18 months.  But, it is right at this stage&mdash;because a great many peopJe in the country will be misled by that declaration&mdash;to point out this fact.  Outside this House many people may think that a Government with 68 persons supporting them and 71 against them was in a permanent danger and in a position of grave instability and insecurity.  That is all &ldquo;cod&rdquo; and, of course, the hardened political war-horse, the Taoiseach, knows that better than anybody in this House.  If you have 68 disciplined lapdogs like the Fianna Fáil Party sitting behind you, you cannot be defeated by 71 Rapparees such as are sitting on the Opposition Benches.  The 71 are scattered over four groups between which no particular love is lost, and the number of occasions when they will all walk into the Lobby together are few and far between.</P>
    <P>If they could not get into the Lobby together on the subject of the Taoiseach's election, they will never get into it for anything else.  Nothing could be more obviously wrong than that.  If you could not rally them all for that purpose, you will never rally them.  If the Minister for Agriculture was able to get unscathed through 71, no more scandalous proposition than Dr. Ryan will ever be produced by the Fianna Fáil Government in the next five years.  So, therefore, if the Taoiseach wants to carry on for five years, he is as safe as any political Government in a democratic assembly in the world could be.  It may be that for some political trick he does not want to carry on, but it is right that the people should know, when he comes to them with tears starting up in his eyes, protesting his reluctance to have another election and the fact that it was made inevitable for him because he had not a sufficient majority in Dáil Eireann, that that will be all cod.  It will be just a political trick, designed to cover up his own desire to have an <Col N="314" /> election in order to serve some political purpose he has in view.</P>
    <P>Personally, I hope there will not be an election now.  I hope there will not be any election until after the emergency, because I believe to launch our country into another general election would be an act of criminal irresponsibility. He might do it to-morrow morning, if he thought it would suit his political ends.</P>

      <P>The threatening kind of speech delivered by the Taoiseach in the House on Friday last appears to me to have frightened the life out of the leader and, perhaps, all the members of the Clann na Talmhan Party. I presume that is the real reason why they refused to vote on the last day and why, to-day, they have so far refused even to speak.  The Taoiseach, when speaking at the conclusion of the debate on Friday last, indicated clearly that he was very much disappointed with the decision of the people at the last general election.  He indicated that if he were elected as Head of the Government, he would carry on, but he did not say how.  He went further and he said: &ldquo;The Government will not deviate in the slightest <Col N="316" /> from its own programme,&rdquo; and proceeded to tell those of us who knew differently that he actually put a policy and a programme to the people in the last general election.  I read the speeches delivered by the Taoiseach everywhere he spoke throughout the country in that campaign, and I failed to find in any of the Press records any indication of any policy or programme either for the immediate future or for the post-war period.  It is quite true that the Taoiseach said&mdash;and his Ministers emphasised it more than he did&mdash;that he was the only living politician capable of maintaining the national policy of neutrality.  Having failed to get the majority of the people to agree with him in that view, he is quite right in saying that he is sadly disappointed with the decision.  But it is incorrect to state that the Taoiseach is the only living politician who can maintain the national policy of neutrality.  That is proved by the fact that we are still neutral, notwithstanding the fact that the Taoiseach did not get the majority he asked for.  He said he would carry on.  I think we are entitled to ask him here and now how he intends to carry on, or on what policy he proposes to spend the £8,000,000 odd which he is asking the House now to vote for him.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;The Government will not deviate in the slightest from its own programme&rdquo;. That appears to me to be the day-to-day programme which the Fianna Fáil Government have been carrying out since the 1938 general election and particularly since the emergency arose.  Is the policy and the programme of the Taoiseach and his Ministers in the immediate future to try to solve the problem of unemployment by providing passports for ablebodied citizens who would be better employed at home on work which is waiting to be done?  Is that the only way in which the Government proposes to solve the problem of unemployment? The Taoiseach said that the only place where co-operation can be secured is in this House.  If the Taoiseach wants the friendly co-operation of the members on these benches, the least we are entitled to, as representing 200,000 odd electors of this State, is to know the plan and the programme for which he <Col N="317" /> requires the co-operation of the members of this section of the House as well as the members of every other section.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in reply to the discussion the other day, challenged in a very definite way figures which I gave here in this House and which I had previously given outside this House.  I said that the policy of the Minister for Agriculture had been a dismal failure, and I proceeded to give figures dealing with the reduction in the value of agricultural production, the reduction in the value of the food consumed by our own citizens, the decline in the population of rural Ireland, and the total number of people who left this country with Government passports since the emergency period because the Fianna Fáil Party had not carried out their promise to provide work for those people. When I gave certain figures to prove my argument was correct in connection with the agricultural production, the Taoiseach resented that.  I stated, and I repeat now, that within a certain period, for which Government statistics are available, the value of agricultural production declined by £15,000,000.  In dealing with that statement, the Taoiseach, as reported in column 207 of Volume 91 of the Official Reports said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Deputy said that agricultural production, had decreased in value by £15,000,000 and that the value of food consumed at home had gone down by £8,500,000.  Neither of those statements has the slightest basis in truth&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then he went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let the Deputy give us the source from which we can obtain these figures.  It is easier, of course, to make these statements in crossroad fashion and fool people who will not follow them any further.  In this House a member will not get away with that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he went on to say further:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where are the £15,000,000 that Deputy Davin talks about?  I should like him to find them for me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will find them for him.  As a matter <Col N="318" /> of fact, I thank the Minister for Agriculture for coming into this House to-day and helping me to find some of the figures which the Taoiseach was so anxiously looking for.  Table 59 of the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for the year 1932 deals with the disposal of agricultural output for the year 1929-30.  The Minister for Agriculture quoted from that document to-day.  He would not give the page or the reference, but he said he was quoting from the Statistical Abstract for that year.  He gave figures slightly different from the ones which I have totalled up.  In that Table 59 of the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for the year 1932 the total agricultural production is given as £64,865,000.  In Table 68 of the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for the year 1939 particulars are given for the year 1937-38.  The total value of agricultural production for that period was £49,662,000.  The Taoiseach is a better mathematician than I am.  Will he give me the actual figure showing the difference between the total value of the agricultural production for the two years I have referred to?  I think he will find that it is in or about £15,000,000.</P>

Table 68 of the Statistical Abstract for the year 1939, showing the disposal of agricultural output for the years 1937-38, gives a figure of £49,662,000.

The Minister for Agriculture to-day obligingly quoted from, I think, the same documents, but when I asked him to give the table and page, he was unable to <Col N="320" /> do so.  As the Taoiseach and, indeed, every Deputy knows, the Minister for Agriculture has later figures at his disposal than any member of the House; he has the latest available figures and I have not got them.  In any case, I have given figures relating to two years, 1929-30 and 1937-38, and they will prove that my information was founded on fact.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the policy and the dismal failure of the Minister for Agriculture, for the information of the Taoiseach I shall quote figures relating to the acreage of land under tillage.  In 1921 the total acreage of land under tillage was 1,799,775.  In the year 1936 the total acreage of land under tillage was 1,608,119.  In 1939 the total acreage of land under tillage was 1,479,709.  Do those figures go to prove that any progress is being made towards the achievement of the policy of self-sufficiency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The first figure I quoted related to 1921, the second to 1936, four years after Fianna Fáil came into office, and the last figure related to 1939, seven years after the Fianna Fáil Government took over control. Those figures indicate a reduction in the acreage of land under tillage of over 200,000 acres.  That does not indicate progress in the achievement of complete self-sufficiency.  Perhaps it would be no harm to quote, for the information of the Taoiseach, the acreage of land under tillage in 1851.  The total acreage under tillage then was 3,488,867.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>For the whole country, I presume.  Let the Taoiseach compare the figure for 1939 with the 1851 figure and relate that to the attempt to attain <Col N="321" /> complete self-sufficiency.  The main reason I intervened in the debate is to ask what is the programme for which the Government require something over £8,000,000.  Do they propose to carry on the same policy as was carried on previous to the general election?</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon seems to think that the only way to save this country from chaos and bankruptcy, and the only way to provide the farming community with a decent return for their labour and the use of their land, is to have greater agricultural production and to increase our exports.  Does the Taoiseach accept that it is the duty of the Government of a Christian State to feed, clothe and house their own citizens before they make any attempt to provide food for the citizens of another State?  Deputy Dillon takes the opposite point of view.  We say the only way the country can be saved from chaos and bankruptcy is to build up a better home market and provide the food, clothing and shelter to which the people are entitled under the Christian Constitution about which the Taoiseach said so much during the election.  How can the home market be built upon the basis of the Fianna Fáil policy, as we understand it, a policy which ignores the fact that we have 100,000 ablebodied citizens unable to get work here, unable to get decent wages to maintain themselves and their dependents; a policy which from day to day means the issue of further passports to our citizens who are looking for work in a foreign country because they cannot get the work they were promised at home.</P>
      <P>Is it the policy of this Government in the immediate future, or in the post-war period, to build up the home market in such a way that it will be able to replace the market which we may lose at the end of the war?  If, at the end of the war, we lose the market we have had for so many years, the market which took all our surplus agricultural produce, what is the policy of the Government to deal with a situation of that kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach admitted that there is plenty of work to be done in this country&mdash;afforestation, land reclamation, <Col N="322" /> a national drainage scheme, the modernisation of our transport system, the making of roads and the provision of thousands of houses that are so much needed by our people.  What is the reason for the failure of the Government to face up to such works? Why do they not provide work for our people at home instead of giving them passports to enable them to work in another country under war conditions?</P>
    <P>The dairying industry was referred to by some speakers, but particularly by the Minister for Agriculture.  I do not pretend to know as much about the dairying industry as some Deputies who carry on farming and who sit on the Fianna Fáil and the Fine Gael Benches&mdash;certainly, not as much as the Minister for Agriculture knows, or ought to know, by reason of the fact that he has held that position for so long a period. Is it not true that the dairying industry is facing collapse, due to the fact that the dairy farmers are not getting an economic price for the milk which they are supplying to the creameries?  Is it the intention of the Government to maintain that industry by providing a subsidy sufficiently high to enable the farmers to sell their milk profitably to the co-operative creameries?  I have been discussing this matter with experts associated with the I.A.O.S. and I am informed that it would not pay dairy farmers to supply milk to the co-operative creameries at anything less than 1/- a gallon.  I have argued here that if a subsidy is deemed proper for the purpose of propping up any type of industry, that subsidy should be sufficiently high to enable those who are engaged in the industry to carry it on with some profit to themselves and to those who are dependent upon it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>We were criticised by the Taoiseach in the speech which he delivered on Friday, and in speeches which he delivered during the recent election campaign, for riding two horses.  He suggested that it was quite inconsistent for us to demand increased taxation for the purpose of increasing social services and, at the same time, to vote against the raising of taxation for other classes of social services. Money is provided in this Vote for unemployment assistance, unemployment insurance, benefit and such services. We contend that, while there is work waiting to be done, there is no necessity to impose taxation for the purpose of maintaining people in idleness.  That is why we have voted on certain occasions in the past against Government policy in that respect.  It is quite true that we have consistently and constantly demanded an improvement in the social services, such as increased pensions for the aged, the blind and the infirm, and we shall continue to make these demands.  I want to know from the Minister who will be replying to this discussion whether it is the intention of the Government to increase the present miserable <Col N="325" /> pittances provided by way of old age pensions, blind pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions.  Nobody in this House will stand up and say&mdash;the Minister for Industry and Commerce will not do so&mdash;that the present miserable allowances provided by way of widows' and orphans' pensions, old age pensions and blind pensions, are sufficiently high to enable those people to purchase essential commodities.</P>

      <P>I am reliably informed that you said that in Portlaoighise.  I will, however, say that, so far as I know, the Minister conducted his election campaign on clean, straightforward lines.  But it was very unfair for him, when he was in my constituency, to say that I was one of those advocating the policy of what is known as the Monetary Reform Association. However, he did not deceive the people by making those statements and I suppose he is entitled to interpret our policy in any way he likes, especially when he is out on a vote-catching mission.  What I want to know is: is it the intention of the Government in the immediate future to make any provision for increased pensions for the old, the blind and the infirm?  It is the feeling of the Fianna Fáil Party, as well as of other sections in this House, that these miserable pittances should be increased.  When the Minister stands up, he will, of course, ask: Where is the money to <Col N="326" /> come from?  That question is only asked when members of the Opposition suggest that the allowances I have mentioned or allowances for the unemployed should be increased.  The question is never asked when additional millions are sought for the purpose of increasing the Defence Services of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other matters arising out of statements made during the debate on Thursday and Friday last to which I desire to refer.  I said in this House, and I repeat the statement, that this Ministry has, generally speaking, been using the machinery of the State and the taxpayers' money for the purpose of promoting Party interests.  Anybody who wants to get evidence in support of that statement has only to listen in to the reports of the proceedings of this House that are conveyed to the people over Radio Eireann every night on which this House is in session.  Whenever a report of the proceedings in this House is broadcast, for instance, when the Minister for Supplies or No-Supplies, or Minister for Industry and Commerce replies to a question, it states that he said so-and-so, but the name of the Deputy who asked the question is, of course, kept from the public to whom information is being conveyed, presumably in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also know perfectly well for a long time that the censorship has been used for the purpose of suppressing the truth in regard to purely internal matters.  Everybody agreed when the emergency arose that censorship was <Col N="327" /> required to maintain the policy of neutrality in order to keep out of the newspapers certain things dealing with purely external affairs, but it is undesirable, is bad policy and is unfair of the Government to use the censorship to prevent the people getting information on what is of purely internal concern.  There was another case of the use or, if you like, misuse by Party machinery of taxpayers' money to promote Party interests particularly during the last six months.  Cars are given Ministers at the expense of the taxpayers, and to my knowledge they have been using these cars for purely Party organising purposes and to promote Party interests.</P>
    <P>Cars are given to Ministers at the expense of the people for the carrying on of their work; not for the promotion of Party interests or for looking after the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party organisation.  I know of Ministers who went outside their own constituencies during the past six months &mdash;long before the general election campaign commenced&mdash;who picked up Deputies in these cars and carried them over constituencies on work of a Party nature.  I want an assurance from the Minister for Supplies, when he intervenes in this discussion, that cars given Ministers for State purposes will not be used in the future as they were used in the recent past.  I know owners of commercial lorries operating in my constituency who have been unable to get petrol with which to transport essential commodities from one part of the country to another.  I think it is a shame&mdash;a damn shame&mdash; that Ministers and others should be using cars given them for State purposes to promote Party interests and, in some cases, to my knowledge to carry themselves and their families, after their day's work, to social functions.  Can I have an assurance from the Minister for Supplies, who is also Minister for Industry and Commerce, that these cars will not be used by Ministers except for State purposes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Cars are given to Ministers <Col N="328" /> to facilitate their protection. That is the primary reason, and clearly that protection is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a car was used for a Party purpose.  I think when Ministers are engaged on work of a purely Party nature State cars should not be used by them.  In prewar days the cost of cars provided for Ministerial purposes came to about £700 per year.  The cost has been considerably increased.  In any case, I think I am entitled, when we are voting money belonging to the taxpayers, to request that in future the activities of Ministers in this respect should be under closer supervision than was the case in the past, by the Minister for Supplies; that petrol will be strictly rationed, and that it will be made known to Ministers concerned that it is to be used only for State purposes.  I was questioned by the Taoiseach recently when I suggested that some highly paid civil servants had been using their position for the purpose of promoting the interests of the Government, particularly in connection with the recent election campaign. I suggested that a high official in the Department of the Taoiseach had been acting in that respect.</P>
      <P>I travelled over a good portion of the country during the recent election campaign and I was questioned three or four times concerning the type of articles written for the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I assert here and now that some of the scurrilous articles published in the <i>Irish Press</i> during the past month or five weeks were written by a highly-paid official who works in the Taoiseach's Department, who is known as the man who is at the head of the Information Bureau.  I am forced to put my statement in clearer terms as the general statement I made when L spoke on Friday last was challenged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is a highly-paid civil servant responsible for some of the leading articles&mdash;misleading articles&mdash;published in the <i>Irish Press</i> during the <Col N="329" /> last four or five weeks?  If the <i>Irish Press</i> wants articles let them get qualified journalists to write them and pay them decent salaries.  I think it is entirely wrong that a highly-placed civil servant, who is paid by the taxpayers out of money that we are going to vote in this House, should be engaged in that capacity.  I read a circular that was sent out during the recent general election warning poorly-paid post office workers that they were not to take part in election activities. If lowly-paid post office workers should not take part in such activities surely it is wrong that the head of the Information Bureau should be allowed to write scurrilous articles in the <i>Irish Press</i> dealing with the elections.</P>

May I tell the Minister for Industry and Commerce that when he stood on a platform at Portlaoighise he had sitting behind him a servant of the same undertaking?  It was all right to sit behind the Minister for Industry and Commerce but if an official of the same undertaking sat on my platform the same evening I daresay he would be suspended.</P>

      <P>There is one other matter I wish to refer to.  I want to join with a number of other Deputies who, during recent times in this House and during the past year, strongly urged the Dáil to impress on the Minister for Defence in particular the necessity for providing allowances for soldiers when they get married.  This question has been raised in another place without very much effect, but we are entitled to have it discussed here.  I think it is altogether wrong&mdash;and I know of cases where it has happened&mdash;that when a soldier member of the Defence Forces of this State gets married, his wife should be left, as some of their wives have been left, as a charge on the local ratepayers. It is nothing to be proud of that in certain Command areas large numbers of serving soldiers who married with the permission of their commanding officers have had no provision made for their wives and other dependents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, in the last speech he made in the House before the last Dáil dissolved, stated, perhaps unconsciously, that every serving soldier is entitled to a marriage allowance.  Surely, the Minister for Finance who is writing out the cheques for these payments should know that that is not so.  Under the existing regulations, a serving soldier who gets married must be in the Army for two years before his wife can receive her marriage allowance.  I think that if a soldier is allowed to get married or gets married, his wife should receive the usual marriage allowance immediately, rather than, as I know it has happened, have to depend on friends or relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are cases where they get married without the consent of their commanding officers.  The regulation provides that if the soldier has two years' service, or if be has shorter service, subject to the consent <Col N="331" /> of his commanding officer, his wife is entitled to get the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the case that when a serving soldier gets married, his wife should get the usual marriage allowance, and it is a disgrace that the present state of affairs should be allowed to continue.  I believe that there are only a few hundred soldiers concerned, and I think the necessary provision should be made immediately to have their wives given the allowance rather than that they should be a charge on the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister for Agriculture is here for another point which I wish to raise.  It is the opinion of a large number of farmers, and generally speaking in the rural constituencies, that there will be considerable difficulty during the coming harvest in getting the necessary labour to look after the harvesting work.  I would like the Minister for Agriculture, who is the most important man in this matter, to recommend to the Minister for Defence that serving soldiers who have come from the land&mdash;sons of small farmers or agricultural labourers &mdash;should be given either definite or indefinite leave to enable the harvest to be brought in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of cases where the sons of small farmers have applied under the pressure of their fathers and family friends, but I am merely mentioning the matter, and I am agreeable to leaving it in the hands of the Minister for Agriculture, because I know that he must realise the necessity of providing the necessary number of agricultural labourers if the harvest is to be saved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave the matter at that.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture will have a chat with the Minister for Defence to meet the reasonable wishes of those making application for leave, either for an indefinite or a fixed period.  I would also suggest to the Minister for Agriculture, and particularly to the Minister for Defence, that Army manoeuvres should not be carried out during the harvest period. I think it is altogether wrong, as happened last year, that Army manoeuvres should be going on in parts of the country while the harvest is being brought in, if there is no great national necessity from the military point of view.  I suggest that they be carried out either early or at a later period of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that from the Minister for Agriculture. Other members of this Party will be speaking before this debate concludes, and I do not want to take up the time of the House.  I am glad the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has come in to hear my closing remarks.  I would like him to justify the interference and delay on the part of his Department in dealing with recommendations that have come to the Department of Local Government from county managers, in connection with increased rates of wages for road workers and other employees of local authorities.  I know of a number of cases&mdash;they are limited in number because I do not interfere outside my constituency, as I have enough to do in my own&mdash;where county managers, with the unanimous approval of county councils, sent up recommendations for miserable increases in rates of wages to the Minister for Local Government, and he held them up for a period of three months, and in some cases, after he considered, or was supposed to have considered them, he cut down the amounts unanimously recommended by the local authority and agreed to by the county manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of a case where one recommendation <Col N="333" /> was sent up for an increased rate of wages for a man in charge of a waterworks and sewerage scheme.  It was delayed for six months in the Minister's Department, and at the end of six months, presumably in order to balance the Budget, he cut down the recommendation of 5/- to the miserable sum of 3/- a week.  The Minister may have more time to spare for looking after the work of the Department in the future than in the immediate past, and I hope that when he gets the electioneering dirt off his feet, and cleans up the dirt that is apparently sticking to certain parts of his Department, he will remove the causes of the delay taking place in connection with ordinary administrative matters that should be dealt with in a reasonable period.  Is there any Deputy who would get, up and say that the Minister for Local Government is worth £1,700 a year if he were to admit that an application for an increase in the rate of wages for a single worker had to be kept for six months and then cut down to the miserable sum of 3/-?  I would like to get the opportunity of cutting the salary of a Minister who was responsible for such a policy, but, unfortunately, while he has all those yes-men lined up behind him, he will get his £1,700 whether he earns it or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>We of the Clann na Talmhan have listened with great interest to the debate on agriculture, and I assure you that the praise from one side, the dispraise from the other, or the advice we have been given has not taken the slightest effect so far as <Col N="334" /> we are concerned, because you people on either side of the House must realise that it is on account of the fact that the rural community, the agricultural community, have been dissatisfied with you both for the past 20 years that they have sent 14 Deputies of the Clann into Dáil Eireann.  One very important matter was a statement made by An Taoiseach when he turned here to the Clann na Talmhan Benches and said: &ldquo;It is from you people that we expect the advice&mdash;you are the people we expect to produce the food.&rdquo;  Of course, that is all right so far as it goes.</P>
      <P>We fully realise that the people on the land, and on the land alone, are those who produce the food.  But, remember, it is the way the land of Ireland has been dealt with for the past 20 years by the present and past Governments that is responsible for the food position in our country to-day. Had the land of Ireland been placed in the hands of our people, our children who are forced to emigrate to England, and an economic price paid to us for our labour, you would have plenty of food in this country to-day.  That cannot be denied, and here on the floor of the Dáil I, coming from rural Ireland, state that the day you were compelled to pass a compulsory Tillage Order, that was the day of your greatest admission of guilt, because the tenant farmers of Ireland, the people who are the chief producers, never required compulsion, and it was never necessary so far as they were concerned, to compel them to till the land and produce the food.  Of course, we listened to the advice of Deputy Dillon and also to the statement of the Minister for Agriculture.  As far as we are concerned, we will work here in a straight line for the people of rural Ireland. We do not forget the election that has just passed.  We do not forget the statements made by Deputy MacEntee about Donnellan, the Communist&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Herr von Donnellan, and so on.  Still, we do not wish to go back.  Neither do we forget the statements from the Fine Gael Benches, which were to the following effect: &ldquo;Do what you like, vote for <Col N="335" /> any Party you like, but do not vote for the Clann na Talmhan candidates.&rdquo;  I assure you, however, that as far as we are concerned none of those statements, or any statements made here, will change us from the one course that we are going to pursue, and that is to fight for rural Ireland and its people.</P>
      <P>They tell us about the flight from the land.  There is no such thing as the flight from the land.  There is flight for the want of land, the flight of our rural population because they are not placed on the land.  That is the flight that exists, and while you have a system in operation here, as you have had for the past 20 years, which is sending the life's blood of our country away, sending our children away and compelling them to leave, this nation of ours is dying, and dying fast.  We have 12,000,000 acres of arable land in this country.  According to the statistics, the return from that arable land, is, roughly, £5 per acre&mdash;lower than the return from any arable land in any other country in Europe.  Why not try to do something to raise that by, say, even £2 per acre?  If you could raise the income on that land by even £2 per acre, that would give an income of £24,000,000, which would be in the hands of the producers, the farmers and the workers, and every other class in this country would benefit by the increased circulation of that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the educational system is all wrong so far as agriculture is concerned. We are told that agriculture is the most important industry in this country.  What really happens, however? At the age of 14 the child comes home from school to carry on according to the same methods that his father and grandfather carried on before him.  That is not advancing.  You must face the facts.  You must set up secondary schools or colleges in this country which will so train the child that, when he leaves school at the age of 14, he will know his job, and the same applies to the children of the workers.  The children of the farmers and of the workers should be trained in these schools in such a way that they will know their jobs, so that the <Col N="336" /> farmer's child, when he comes back to the farm in the course of two years will be a fully qualified person for his job.  For instance, take the case of other professions, such as lawyers, doctors, and so on.  They have to spend years and years in higher courses of education in order to qualify them for jobs which, we are told, are not as important as our job is.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have been listening here to statements made in the year 1943, and you have people going back to 1938, 1932 and 1922, and telling us about the rights that were done and the wrongs that were done, but any statements that you may make here now will not make any righter the-rights or any wronger the wrongs: the rights were rights and the wrongs were wrongs.  Coming from rural Ireland with my people here, I appeal to all of you on both sides of the House not to be looking back, but to be looking forward, with a view to seeing what we can do for 1944, 1945, 1946, 1956 or 1966.  Adopt that attitude, and do not be raising up old sores or old bitternesses.  It is to do away with that kind of thing that we have come here.  Do not be looking back.</P>
    <P>Take drainage, for instance.  After 20 years of native government here, there are 4,000,000 acres of land under water.  Had any of you on either side of the House had the interests of this country at heart, the first great scheme that would have been carried out would be a national drainage scheme in connection with 4,000,000 acres of the land of this country.  If that land were only producing food to-day, there would be no shortage of bacon, of potatoes, of butter, and so on, and our children would not be driven away to seek their livelihood abroad.  If those millions of acres had been restored to cultivation, we could be exporting those commodities to-day instead of being in the position of not having enough of them for ourselves.  Of course, we unfortunately live amongst all this political trash that goes on-What happens is that whispering campaigns are being carried out.  If one were to take the statements in the daily Press, after the last meeting of Dáil Eireann, one would imagine that <Col N="337" /> Clann na Talmhan had sold out to Fianna Fáil, and that because I had a meeting with the Taoiseach I had handed over something to the Fianna Fáil Party, but, thank God, I had witnesses. As a matter of fact, Fianna Fáil Deputies went out and said that we were afraid to vote since that happened. That is not the case.  Where the interests of rural Ireland are concerned, or where agriculture is concerned, our people in this House will vote and fight in defence of those interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the Vote on Account from an entirely different angle from that of agriculture, and it is in relation to the question of local government.  In this respect, however, it might be appropriate to refer to the fact that a number of Deputies in this House are associated with local bodies now operating under the County Management Act.  I think it will be remembered that at the time when the Act was under discussion in this House reference was made to what was operating in Dublin as a sample of what might, perhaps, be operated with success throughout the country.  In so far as my experience relates to Dublin, I think it as well that the House should know how, precisely, the City Management Act, as it applied to us since 1930, did operate.  Thanks to the tact and ability, amounting almost to genius, of the late Gerald Sherlock, it was possible to initiate a system in the Dublin Corporation which gave to the members the semblance of authority, arousing interest so far as their work was concerned, but it was necessary for him to go outside the terms of the Act by setting up a number of committees, such as the Housing Committee, the General Purposes Committee, and so on.  He was quite frank about what he was doing at the time.  I distinctly remember his saying: &ldquo;You are representatives of the people.  You are sent in here to do certain work.  Unless I give you that work to do, obviously you will not remain here.&rdquo;  May I say to Deputies who arc associated with this new regime so far as the county is concerned, that perhaps they will now find in operation a very different <Col N="338" /> system from that which operated under the old county council.  I think there is evidence of that system just at the moment.  In my considered opinion, there is no Act more calculated to paralyse local government than that particular Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I instance a particular case which recently came under my notice. For over twelve years, I have watched the operation of that very fine committee, the Grangegorman Mental Hospital Committee.  During the last 12 or 13 years, the Grangegorman Mental Hospital, under the benevolent guidance of that excellent committee, has improved both from the medical point of view and from, if you like, the social conditions point of view so far as the patients are concerned.  Recently, under the County Management Act, that committee&mdash;the same in number, by the way&mdash;was brought into the hospital again, but now it has no agenda, as it had in the old days.  The Act has gone so far as to enable the manager, even on the request of the committee, to refuse to give an account of the decisions taken by him during the previous month.  I think an unanimous vote was recorded against that procedure.  The answer given was that the orders of the manager were laid on the table for inspection by the members.  Obviously, the proceedings of any meeting would be over before it would be possible for any member to raise any point in which he was interested.  Notwithstanding the unanimous desire of the committee, that procedure remains in operation, and the committee are left without any formal indication of what the manager had done in the previous month.  As a result, the attendance at the meetings is dwindling, the interest of the members is diminishing, and the committee is now reduced to the status of a visiting committee.  I am afraid that what has happened in the case of that committee will happen all over the country.  Men of independence, men capable of giving the public service to which we have grown accustomed in this country will feel that there is no further use for them, and we will have the whole system of local government centralised in a form which is positively dangerous.  I suggest to the Minister <Col N="339" /> that, while there is yet time, he should review the position, even from a Party point of view.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as indicating that everything is just as we would desire it in regard to the Dublin Corporation.  It is nothing of the kind.  As I say, there is a semblance of interest there because of the manner in which the foundations were laid under the 1930 Act, but in order to preserve the interest of the members it was absolutely essential that they should be met with symapthy and consideration by the Department of Local Government.  I am sorry to say that, in recent years, the necessary contact and sympathy have been entirely absent.  From time to time, matters have arisen which might have been very helpfully pushed along if it had been possible to establish the contact which I should like to see in operation. In the absence of that contact, a policy of despair seems to have been adopted. I cannot vouch for how long the present members of the Dublin Corporation will continue along those lines, unless, as a result of this debate, there is evidence of a complete change so far as local government is concerned.</P>
    <P>The problem of housing is the biggest problem that the City of Dublin has to face.  At the moment we are in need of 15,000 dwellings.  I suggest that the housing problem is a national one, and it has been dealt with in piecemeal fashion.  The question of finance is a fundamental one so far as housing is concerned, and I have no hesitation in saying that, in regard to finance, the policy under which the housing problem of the Dublin Corporation has been carried out was an insane one.  Here again, may I say that we have looked in vain to the Department of Local Government for the necessary guidance and sympathy.  We are forced to go into the market with our own stocks at 4 per cent. and 5 per cent., obviously causing hardship to the taxpayer and the ratepayer, and with serious consequences to the tenants themselves in regard to rent.  I know that on previous occasions my colleague, Deputy Corish, has raised an aspect <Col N="340" /> of the housing question which vitally affects the whole country, and for which apparently no remedy has been found.  The Minister for Local Government is fully aware of the conditions-on which housing finance is operated under the 1932 Act, that is on the basis of 66? per cent. for loans for slum clearance and 33? per cent. for normal clearance.  Frankly, I could never see why such a tremendous distinction should be made between slum clearance and normal clearance, because to my mind the dividing line is very slender indeed.  The grave defect of that Act is that the maximum amount on which the grant will be payable in the case of a flat is £500, and, in the case of a cottage, £450.  To-day, those flats are costing the Dublin Corporation an average of £750 for a three-room flat and £650 for a 4-roomed cottage.  Obviously, the corporation is called upon to bear the difference between the maximum subsidy of £500 in the one case and £450 in the other, and the ratepayers are suffering heavily.</P>
    <P>Sometimes, the contention is advanced by members of the Government that in fact they have provided the finance necessary for the solution of the housing problem.  I suggest that that is not correct.  This year, so far as our rates are concerned, we are contributing £214,000, the equivalent of roughly 2/1 in the £, while the State contribution is £157,000, a difference against the Corporation of £57,000.  In cities on the other side, where they have a housing programme similar to ours, the comparable figure is much less than 1/- in the £.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that there is need for examination so far as our housing programme is concerned, and that that difference in so far as the subsidy is concerned should not be allowed to operate against local bodies, particularly the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Recently, because of conditions in the building industry in this city, the Housing Committee of the Corporation found it necessary to turn to a new angle, so far as the solution of the housing difficulty was concerned.  They have entered upon a campaign of reconstruction and conversion as can be seen by anybody, particularly in the Gardiner Street area, where roughly 30 of <Col N="341" /> the larger houses have been taken over, in some cases reconstructed and in others converted, to make suitable dwellings for our people.  So far, our operations in this respect are costing the Corporation something like £75,000. We have found it necessary to seek a loan in respect of that expenditure. Since this scheme of reconstruction is entirely new, so far as the Corporation is concerned, I would be interested to know if the Minister is prepared to credit the Corporation with the subsidy in this new sphere on the lines of the existing scheme of flats or the scheme that was in operation up to the time we took over in Gardiner Street.  It is important from the point of view of the Corporation that they should have definite information on that point because they are encouraged by the success of their schemes to go head and a big programme is envisaged in the Newfoundland Street area and other areas of that character so long as the emergency lasts.  So much as far as the housing problem is concerned.</P>
    <P>May I point to another incident as indicating the complete lack of sympathy of the Department with the activities of the Corporation?  The Department of Local Government is the most important Department of Government, in my opinion, in the whole State.  It is more closely associated with the activities and life of the people than any other Department.  It should be a hive of industry.  In that connection may I say that the impression is widespread, so far as the Corporation is concerned, that the dead hand of officialdom weighs heavily on that Department. I refer now to an incident which originated so far back as 18 months ago in connection with blind pensions.  The Corporation, unanimously be it said, decided that this most defenceless section of the community, numbering about 1,000, should, if at all possible, have some addition made to the weekly allowance made, one section from the Corporation and the other from the Government.  After an examination by a committee drawn from all Parties in the Chamber, it was unanimously decided that a sum of £4,000 should be conceded to the blind population of this city.  That was 18 <Col N="342" /> months ago.  From previous experience it was decided that on this particular occasion we would not ask for an equivalent grant from the Government. The Blind Persons Act, as you are aware, fixes the contribution 50-50, but as a result of previous experience we decided that we should not ask the Government for any contribution on this occasion; we asked only that we might have the necessary permission to disburse that £4,000 amongst these 1,000 people.  Actually the recipients would get sums ranging from about 1/10 to 3/- per week.  That request was sent on to the Department, and finally, after a considerable delay the decision of the Minister appears to have been that if his consent were given to the proposal it would impinge on the means test regulations, and that because of that technical difficulty the amount which was included in the estimate of the Corporation should not be passed on to the blind pensioners.</P>
    <P>I suggest to you, Sir, that it is the very negation of Christian law if an objection of that kind is allowed to stand in the way.  If it is possible in the year 1943 to pass emergency laws, right, left and centre, on any matter affecting the life of the country, surely here was a case, having regard to the difficult times and the types of case involved, in which the Minister should have devised ways and means to give effect to the unanimous desire of the corporation.  The money is still there for the blind pensioners, but the decision of the Minister stands. Actually we made an endeavour to get in contact with the Minister and to put to him the point of view that I am now putting before the House, but up to this stage, I am sorry to say, the decision still stands.  I hope that even now, seeing that the corporation is still in a position to pay this money and is anxious to pay it, the Minister will find the necessary means to permit it to do so.</P>
    <P>Another matter affecting people in the city is the question of relief schemes.  Personally I do not like the designation &ldquo;relief schemes&rdquo;.  I think it is an abominable designation and carries its own condemnation.  It might be styled a &ldquo;scheme of public <Col N="343" /> works&rdquo;.  We do not like to stigmatise people engaged on those schemes as if they were working under a form of charity.  The corporation had a very old-standing rule under which at particular times of the year, when due to stress of circumstances, it was necessary to supplement their ordinary activities, they took on a number of workers outside their own staffs.  For all these schemes they provided a six-day week at full trade union wages. These schemes continued up to about three or four years ago, when our friends on the other side introduced what are known as rotational relief schemes.  Obviously, rotational relief is not a solution of the unemployment problem.  Deputies have already touched on the question of unemployment, and it will be dealt with by other Deputies later on, I am informed.  I am particularly concerned that, here in Dublin, any schemes of that character will give us the right to employ men on the basis of the arrangement in existence prior to the introduction of rotational schemes, in other words, that men should be employed on the basis of a full six-day week.</P>
    <P>This is the first occasion on which I have addressed the House and I felt that any remarks I should have to make should concern the city here, particularly so far as the Minister for Local Government is concerned.  I should like from him an assurance that so far as the provision of fuel is concerned, he has made arrangements to preclude anything in the nature of hardship in the coming winter.  The arrangements made last winter were of such a character, particularly in the early stages, that definitely serious hardship would have ensued if it were not for a merciful Providence.  In the corporation we decided to set up a number of fuel depôts but through some extraordinary zeal, the Minister and his Department decided that the corporation should not have responsibility for the fuel depôts and they immediately transferred the matter to the Commissioners of the Board of Assistance.  Even after the transference of these depôts to the commissioners, <Col N="344" /> we found a defect in so far as people in outlying housing areas such as Larkhill and Whitehall on one side and Crumlin on the other side, were concerned.  A number of people were not being served from the fuel depôts set up by the Minister, people who were in a position to pay for their fuel but who were unable to get it in the quantities and at the price they desired.  We asked the Department at that time to be allowed to set up in our housing areas a number of fuel depôts to cater for that particular class of people.  I hope the time is not yet too late, and that he will take a note of it now to give us the necessary permission.</P>
    <P>So far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned, I, say again that it is a voluntary body.  The members give their time and services without fee or reward and are prepared to continue along that line, while on the other hand the Minister and his staff&mdash;I recognise what the position of the Minister is&mdash;in the Custom House are the servants of the people.  I hope that at this stage they will recognise that they are the servants of the people. Having said so much, I want to say, on behalf of the Dublin Corporation, that in the matter of these works schemes and on the housing question which is our main problem, the corporation will be prepared at all times to give that measure of co-operation to a Minister or to a Ministry which is prepared to recognise the difficulties on the other side.</P>

      <P>The field of debate is rather limited in this discussion. For practical purposes, it is confined to three Departments: the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and the Department of Agriculture.  I do not wish to make any remarks in regard to the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  I do, however, wish to address a few remarks to the House with reference to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Agriculture.  I recently charged the Taoiseach with an inability to plan on a large scale for <Col N="345" /> the welfare of this country.  I pointed out that, in my judgment at any rate, the main defect and failing of the Fianna Fáil Party was not so much their failure in administration, many as were their failures in that respect, as the want at the head of that Department of a man of foresight, a man of vision who could see what was coming and could wisely plan to meet it.  I was challenged by the Taoiseach that we on this side of the House were merely wise after the event.  The Taoiseach, speaking no doubt from memory, entirely misquoted a speech which I had made in this House with reference to the establishment here of a mercantile marine.  In that speech I urged that a mercantile marine should be established, and that the granaries of this country, not merely the granaries but all the warehouses in the country, should have been filled at the outbreak of war.  The Taoiseach denied that I had made any such speech.  With the permission of the Chair, I shall read the passage from the speech which I made here on the 15th November, 1939. It is reported in volume 77 of the Official Debates, Col. 1390.  I said there:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Again and again, in the course of this debate, as always happens, the Fianna Fáil speakers made appeals to this side of the House to say what we would do in these circumstances and in those circumstances. They are always appealing to the various Parties that make up the Opposition in this House to do the work that they ought to do themselves and to supply them with the necessary ideas.  The Finance Minister tells us that he has to put on these extra taxes because revenue is falling owing to the falling-off of imports. Has he thought of any possible way in which the falling-off of imports and of the revenue derived from them can be checked?  As well as applying a palliative to the country's finances, cannot he go to the root of the evil and see if he cannot bring up imports to their old level? We have a country with an immense seaboard and we have no mercantile marine.  At present, thousands of tons of shipping must be lying idle. The bringing of goods to England is <Col N="346" /> dangerous.  English trade with foreign countries has been considerably reduced.  The export trade of countries like Holland, Belgium and Norway has been reduced.  Surely, now is the time when a government thinking of what could be done in the present conditions might reasonably consider the establishment of a carrying trade and the institution at the public expense of a mercantile marine.  There must be thousands of tons of shipping lying up in various harbours.  Have the Government ever thought of that?  Have they made a single effort to see at what price they could purchase ships?  Have they ever considered the feasibility of importing what is necessary for the people of this country in ships owned by themselves?  Have they ever considered that it possibly might pay to build up a mercantile marine, not for the time of war merely but for future time?  We are borrowing millions of pounds&mdash;£8,000,000, I think, is the figure the Minister for Finance gave &mdash;and that is not for productive work; that is £8,000,000 spent within this year, I understand, £8,000,000 that will not produce a single ½d. Would it not be very wise to consider if one could not also float a loan for the purchase of a mercantile marine which will be in itself a paying proposition.&rdquo;</P>

The actual carrying out of the details no doubt would be a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but the conceiving of the idea and saying that the idea should be carried out is, I submit, what the country looks for in the Leader of the House, the Taoiseach. May I pass now through a gradual transition from the Taoiseach to the Ministry of Agriculture.  I pass through it in this way: the Taoiseach put himself forward as an agricultural expert.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not pursue it further, but shall return to <Col N="349" /> the thread of my argument.  The Taoiseach dealt, or attempted to deal, with my argument that his wheat policy, far from helping the agricultural position at present, was detrimental to it, my argument being the contention, which was put much more forcibly and with more figures than I could bring by a man who knows that particular area far better than I can know it, Deputy Hughes, that the yield of wheat in the principal, wheat-growing areas had been lessened, owing to the policy which had reduced productivity by exhausting the soil of the principal wheat-growing areas of the country.  It was quite impossible, said the Taoiseach, unless that wheat policy had been pursued for the present area to be put under wheat. In other words, compulsory tillage could not have been applied to this country unless there had been the Fianna Fáil policy of subsidising wheat.  I find, however, that in the year 1916, there were 945,000 odd acres of land under corn crops, and, in the year 1918, there were 1,456,000 acres. In other words, in two years, there was an increase of 500,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In wheat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>In corn crops generally, and surely even the Taoiseach knows that the test is not the area of ground you have under wheat, but the area you have under corn.  If you have your land and if you have your machinery, it is exactly the same thing whether you are going to sow wheat or oats or barley.  There was a rise, when compulsory tillage was introduced, of 500,000 acres from 1916 to 1918.  I find that in 1940, there were 1,100,000 acres and in 1941, when compulsory tillage was enforced, there were 1,443,000 acres&mdash;for practical purposes, the same area under corn in 1941, as in 1918, and, before 1916, there had been no Fianna Fáil policy of subsidising corn.  I venture to think that if the produce of the land could be compared, the one with the other, it would be found that the crops and the yields in those days were better, because we have it from the Minister for Finance that the increased acreage last year did not yield an increase in agricultural produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> The Minister for Agriculture took, to my mind, a very disheartening attitude, because he took the attitude that everything which it is conceivable to do for agriculture has already been done.  He took up Sir George Stapleton's last book, which he seemed rather proud to have read.  It is not very much to have read Sir George Stapleton's last book, admirable as it is.  It is in the Pelican series, and is quite a small book, which can be purchased for 7d., and is very well worth the money. It has undoubtedly got agricultural theory brought up to date, and is a synopsis of Sir George Stapleton's other works.  The Minister says that everything Sir George Stapleton has suggested has already been done in this country.  The three things which according to him Sir George Stapleton said were necessary for England were, first, that all farmers should own their own land&mdash;and he said that has taken place here; secondly, the drainage, reclamation and liming of land which was very much behind-hand in England.  But it must have astonished the House when the Minister said that drainage, reclamation, and liming of land were as admirable in this country at the present moment as they could be in any country.  Surely nobody could accept that proposition.  Apart from the Barrow drainage and a few smaller drains, the drainage of the country has not been attempted.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture ought to know that there has been a report from the Drainage Board.  He ought to know that it will cost this State many millions of pounds to tackle the question of drainage.  I forget the actual figure.  I do not know that land has been reclaimed anywhere except a few odd acres here and there.  As far as the liming of land is concerned, it is very much behind-hand in this country. I do not think there is even ground limestone to be got anywhere.  I know some years ago when we were in office. I had worked out a little scheme for the establishing of a crushed limestone industry in Ballinrobe, County Mayo, where there happened to be electric power available.  The Gaeltacht Services took it up.  However, before it was put in operation the Government of which I was a member went out of <Col N="351" /> office, and, of course, as the plan came from me it had to be pigeon-holed, and has remained pigeon-holed ever since, and nothing of that nature has been done.  As far as I know, there is nowhere&mdash;certainly nowhere in Connaught that I have heard&mdash;in which crushed limestone is available at the present moment, although the modern experts are all of the opinion that crushed limestone is more useful than burnt lime for the reclamation of land.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that proper grasses was the third thing that Sir George Stapleton urged.  That is correct; but do we use the very best grasses in this country?  According to the Minister, we do.  That is very doubtful.  The mixtures which are used in this country are not at all in accordance with Sir George Stapleton's theories.  I do not say that Sir George Stapleton's theories are necessarily suited to Ireland.  I do not think they are.  I would not like to try a pure cocksfoot lea, as Stapletpn urges, and I would certainly think that, so far as the West of Ireland is concerned, one of the most useful and early of all grasses is meadow foxtail and it is an indigenous grass.  One sees it in every headland, and yet it is a grass which he considers should not be used at all. Stapleton bases his theories very largely upon Elliott's principles of the Clifton Park system of farming.  I tried that system of farming.  I laid down some acres of land some 25 or more years ago, under the Clifton Park mixture, and I found it admirable.  The results were very excellent, although I did make myself rather a laughingstock before my neighbours, who could not understand the putting of chicory in land and the sowing of weeds, but certainly it paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked us&mdash;and it is here I think the Minister showed his entire failure as a Minister for Agriculture&mdash;how would we administer the Live-Stock Breeding Act.  Would we give a certain subsidy to Aberdeen Angus, to Herefords, to Shorthorns or to Dairy Shorthorns?  Of course, that is a question that nobody could or should attempt to answer.  For certain parts of the country you must have one <Col N="352" /> breed of cattle.  For other parts of the country you must have another breed of cattle, and if you specialise in any one breed of cattle you are making precisely the same blunder that the Minister for Agriculture has been making from the time he became Minister for Agriculture, that is, assuming that there is one agricultural policy and one only to be pursued all over this country, whereas in fact, the agricultural policy to be pursued in different parts of the country must vary.</P>
    <P>There is a very playful old gentleman in Greek history, you may remember, who had a bed and when visitors came to him the visitors all had to fit the bed.  If they were too short for the bed, their legs were pulled out until they were the same length as the bed and if their legs were longer than the bed their legs were cut off.  They were all of them to be a complete fit.  That Procrustean bed is just precisely the sort of bed into which the Minister for Agriculture has for years been endeavouring to fit Irish agriculture.  He starts a policy which is based upon corn-growing as a cash crop.  That should be, according to him, all over Ireland, the real basis of agriculture.  He forgets that corn-growing as a cash crop can be the basis of agriculture in certain parts of this country but cannot be a basis in the major portion of this country. Attacks have been made upon us because we are supposed to have attacked wheat schemes.  We did not attack a wheat scheme as being put into force in those parts of the country where a wheat scheme could be worked successfully and would pay. What we did attack was an endeavour to kill the live-stock industry and to substitute for it all over this country wheat and oats as a cash crop and the main basis of agriculture, whereas in the major portion of this country, and certainly in the parts of the country which I know well, live stock must be the basis of a successful agricultural industry and corn-growing as a cash crop must take a very subsidiary place.</P>
    <P>We have had from the Minister for Agriculture or any other Minister who is concerned in this debate, an Estimate for whose Department is contained in this Vote on Account, no <Col N="353" /> views at all.  As far as we can gather, there has been no thinking, no planning for the future.  Surely now is the time in which planning for the future should be carried out.  We know that we will have to have immense public works if we are to support the number of people who will come back to this country.  Now is the time in which the planning should be done. Are you going to reclaim any land? Now is the time in which there should be a survey and to decide what particular areas of land are to be reclaimed. The hostility to the Shannon Scheme has now, I think, been got over, even in Government Benches.  I do not think it is likely that it will ever be described as a white elephant again. If there is going to be a further development of water power in this country, surely now is the time in which a survey should be made.  There are obvious places, such as, I suppose a further development of the Liffey scheme, and the River Erne.  But how many sources of water power are there in various parts of the Irish hills which have not been investigated and which no effort, so far as I know, has been made to investigate?  There are two in my own constituency&mdash;the headwaters of the Aille and the Furness Falls coming out from Furness Lough in North Mayo.  There are various other potential sources of electric power in this country, but no effort is being made, so far as we know at any rate, to survey the country and discover where they are and which of them can be profitably utilised.</P>
    <P>So far as we know, not a single plan is being formed in the Government Departments.  Now is the time for planning.  Unless planning is done now, you will have to go back to the wretched old policy of living from hand-to-mouth.  Think now, think in advance, be ready if the crisis comes and you have to start large-scale schemes of public works.  Whether they are one year away or two years away, the plans ought to be under consideration now.  They should not be left until the last minute.  We have not even heard of a committee on planning or anything else of that nature. We have not had the slightest suggestion that any plans are under consideration <Col N="354" /> by the Government.  I do not suppose they ever will be.  For that reason I think the Government are entirely lacking in imagination and lacking in energy.

      <P>I should like to intervene in this debate for a few moments to put before you the views of my Party and, more especially, the views of my constituents, the farmers of County Roscommon.  The Minister for Agriculture touched on the question of the creameries and the price of milk. That is a very interesting matter for us in Roscommon.  We hold that the price of 7d. per gallon paid last year for milk was very detrimental to the production of butter.  A deputation of dairy farmers waited on the Minister for Agriculture, I understand, 12 months ago and asked for an increase of 2d. per gallon, but that increase was refused.  Finally, when the season's milk had been sent to the creameries and the butter was in cold storage, a levy of 3d. per lb. was put on butter and an increase of 2d. per gallon was given for milk, bringing the fixed price to 9d. per gallon.  We hold that 9d. is not an economic price considering that milk is sold retail in the smallest villages at practically 2/- per gallon.  The highest price you can put on the skimmed milk returned from the creameries is 1d., which, with the price of 9d. per gallon for this year, would mean 10d. per gallon as compared with that price of 2/-.  I do not know exactly what the price is in the city.  If the Government want to treat the agricultural community fairly, I suggest that the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="355" /> should increase the price of milk supplied to the creameries to at least 1/- per gallon.</P>
      <P>The question of drainage is an important one for farmers in my county and, I think, for farmers in the West of Ireland generally.  Last August I asked the county manager in Roscommon to get the deputy surveyors to make a survey of small farms, from five to seven acres, in the county, where the crops had been flooded.  In one townland alone twenty farmers living on five acres of land had at least one acre of meadow swept completely into the adjoining river in the month of August during the heavy floods.  In addition to that their potato and oat crops were injured.  The Government should take serious notice of this matter and, if they cannot put the national drainage scheme into operation within any reasonable time, they should devise some scheme to deal with cases like that, which may be small matters in their eyes, but are very important for the small farmers trying to make a living on five, seven and ten acres of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that my constituents are very interested in and are very disappointed with is the Pigs Marketing Board.  Personally, I am not in a position to say whether that board should be abolished, but if it is not abolished, I say that the matter wants looking into.  The Government would be well advised to look into it and consult the farming community and others interested in it and see if there could not be some change made.  I should like to give an instance of what we consider very unfair treatment.  Deputy Dillon referred to another factory, but I should like to give facts with regard to a factory in my own district.  Within the last twelve months small farmers have taken pigs to the factory and the factory refused to take them.  They had to take these pigs back home and keep them for a fortnight or three weeks and, when they brought them back to the factory, they were overweight with the result that they were paid a lower price for them.  Recently, when pigs and bacon were very scarce and it was almost impossible to get a pound of <Col N="356" /> bacon in the shops, farmers congregated on the streets to buy pigs as they were going into the factory.  I understand that the Gárda insisted on the pigs being brought to the factory, although local buyers, farmers or others who wanted to buy pigs to make bacon were prepared to give £1 or 30/- a pig more than would be paid in the factory.  That led to abuses later on as I understand that some factory owners, to put it in plain language, resorted to back-hand methods by paying the regular price, plus a bonus which was given on the quiet.  I think these things go to show that it is very necessary that the whole question should be gone into.  I have been informed by a number of farmers in my district that, if it was a profitable proposition to rear pigs, no doubt people would rear them.  In my area there are small farmers who always reared pigs; they look upon it as a means of paying the rent and rates.  Indeed, it was one of the few little industries upon which they had to depend for a livelihood.  They feel rather keenly about this matter.</P>
    <P>So far as the attitude of the farmers in the West of Ireland towards doing their share in the matter of food production is concerned, I am aware that some two years ago a meeting was called in Roscommon to discuss the necessity of increased food production.  It was called at the instigation of the administrator of our parish.  Numbers of small farmers were there, men who were quite prepared to grow their share of wheat, if it was possible for them to undertake the task.  They declared that they were quite prepared to grow wheat if they could get the seed on credit terms.  They were informed at that meeting that there was no possibility of securing such terms, that they would have to put down the cash. They went further and suggested that if they got the seed wheat on loan they were prepared to pay for it in November; that they would either give back a similar amount of wheat or pay cash for the wheat they obtained.</P>
    <P>That was pretty late in the Spring, but there was some effort made later <Col N="357" /> on by the county committee to meet those people.  Further efforts were made this year by the county committee in Roscommon to extend credit facilities to meet the requirements of small farmers.  I think the lesson to be learned from that is that suitable provision for such farmers as need assistance should be made in advance.</P>
    <P>The farmers were appealed to by the Church and the State to help save the nation by producing more food.  A very representative memorial was drafted and it was signed by the Bishops of Achonry and Elphin, by the clergy of Roscommon and by at least 900 ratepayers.  A special meeting of the Roscommon County Council was summoned to discuss the matter of food production.  Strange to say, when we went there we were practically turned away; at least, we were told by an ex-Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party that he could allow only ten minutes for discussion of the matter.  I must say I cannot exonerate the other Party either, as an ex-Deputy of the Fine Gael Party was present and neither he nor any other member of his Party raised a voice in protest.</P>

      <P>So far as the Minister for Agriculture is concerned, I would be very sorry to disparage him in any way.  I have met him in interviews and I must say he received us very courteously; but, as to his position as a Minister for Agriculture, I feel bound to express the opinion of my constituents. So far as the farmers of County Roscommon are concerned, to be quite candid and honest about it and to put it very mildly, they do not consider him the best man for the job.  That is giving a very honest opinion.  On the shoulders of Deputy de Valera has fallen the responsibility of the position of An Taoiseach.  I should like to inform the Taoiseach, knowing the feeling <Col N="358" /> of the farmers of the country, that they expect a big change of front so far as the agricultural industry is concerned. I have no hesitation in telling the Taoiseach and the members of the House that, should the Minister for Agriculture not show an entire change of front towards rural Ireland, grave dissatisfaction is bound to arise.  The farming community will hold the Taoiseach responsible.</P>
      <P>I can state emphatically that we of Clann na Talmhan are an independent Party.  We intend to remain so.  I may say that we are unpurchased and unpurchaseable. We are prepared to support any measure put forward by the Government for the welfare of the country.  Any measure calculated to be detrimental to the interests of the agricultural community wilI be relentlessly opposed by us with all the resources at our command.</P>

      <P>Last week we had a debate lasting almost two days on the subject of the Department of Agriculture. Judging by the manoeuvring in this debate, Deputies seem anxious to centre around the same subject.  We heard the budding Minister for Agriculture, the alternative Minister for Agriculture, a few minutes ago speaking from the opposite benches.  He dealt with the system that has brought his Party to its present position&mdash; seven Parties with a membership of 32.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney showed the attitude of that Party.  He was too lazy even to prepare a speech and he went back to the speech he made in 1939.  He told us all about the mercantile marine that he thought of some four months after the war started.  He forgot to tell us about the other famous speech in which he qualified for the position of Minister for Agriculture. In that speech he stated that all the wheat, petrol, oil and cotton that this country required could be brought in by ships owned by United States firms with a perfect degree of safety. That was what he told us three months after the war started.  That is the manner in which he would produce food for our people during an emergency and that, apparently, qualifies him to be a budding Minister for Agriculture, to take the place of Deputy <Col N="359" /> Ryan, who has been so much abused here.  We have had a great deal of statistical matter quoted.  In my early days in this House, a Minister stated that there were three forms of untruth &mdash;lies, damned lies and statistics.  I do not know to which of the three classes the quotations of the past few days belonged, but I do know that the agricultural labourer was being paid a wage of from 7/- to 9/- a week from 1930 to 1932.  The minimum wage to-day is 36/-.</P>
      <P>I maintain that the farmer is better able to pay that minimum wage of 36/- a week to-day than he was able to pay the wage of 7/- a week in the period of the Cumann na nGaedheal Govern&mdash; ment.  I do not say that 36/- a week is enough.  It is a sad commentary on our principal industry, which is agriculture, that the men working in it should be the worst paid employees in the State.  I think that steps must be taken to improve the position of agriculture all out.  Although the agricultural community are four times better off than they were under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, still, their position as the principal producers of the nation entitles them to a far better position than they occupy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we examine the actions of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party from 1932 right along, we shall see the manner in which they endeavoured to prevent the farmer from getting anything at all. When the Stabilisation of Prices Bill was brought in here to provide 4d. a gallon to the farmers for milk at the creamery, Deputies on the opposite benches went into the lobby against it. They did not consider that the farmers were entitled to 4d. a gallon for their milk.  I admit that there were a few honourable exceptions.  Deputy Bennett and a few other Deputies from dairying constituencies dare not commit the crime which Deputy Mulcahy and others desired they should commit on that occasion.  The people who committed those crimes against agriculture now come along to criticise the Minister and talk of the lack of foresight of the Taoiseach.  The Deputy who spoke about the lack of foresight of the Taoiseach was the <Col N="360" /> Deputy who, three months after this war commenced, suggested bringing in our bread from America in ships owned by U.S.A. firms.</P>
    <P>What right has Fine Gael to attack any Minister for Agriculture?  What right have they to talk about lack of foresight?  From 1932 to 1939, they tried, by every kind of contemptible campaign that could be waged, to prevent the agricultural community from producing wheat for the people. By what right does Deputy Dillon speak of the production of bacon? Deputy Dillon knows that, for the past 3½ years, the production of bacon was absolutely dependent upon the grain grown here, and he stated in this House that our rotten Irish barley could not feed anything.  That was a public statement made in this House and, then, Deputy Dillon gets up to criticise the position in regard to bacon.  I remember quoting here, for the information of members of the Dáil, statements made by gentlemen whom I might describe as the three chief apostles in my county of the doctrine to which I have been referring. One of them was the late Mr. Cussen, who was then Secretary of the Farmers' Union.  Here is a statement made by Mr. Cussen about the Pigs Marketing Board:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It may be taken for granted that, if the Pigs Marketing Board were not functioning at present, the price of pigs would be several shillings lower per cwt., and farmers would suffer a cumulative loss of several thousands of pounds in the period from 1st October to 1st November.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one statement made regarding a board which has been publicly attacked.  There is another gentleman in my county with whose name Deputies on the opposite benches should be familiar&mdash;Mr. Dring.  He made a public statement in connection with the feeding of Irish barley to Irish pigs.  He went so far as to cross to Britain, where there was no admixture and where he considered he would have no trouble in fattening his pigs.  He tried out the fattening of pigs on Indian meal there, and he landed back in this country after 12 months and started off producing <Col N="361" /> pigs here again.  These are two of the chief apostles in my county.  I refer to them to show that any proposal by the Government in connection with control will find enemies.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Donnellan that we should endeavour to see if we can improve things quietly here without this eternal bickering between one Party and another.  We are all here as representatives of the people.  It is our duty to draw attention to things that are wrong and have them set right.  I consider that it is wrong for the Minister for Agriculture to control the price of malting barley.  That should end. Malting barley is being purchased by an industrial firm who sell the product of that barley in competition with stout produced from barley bought at double the price.  Whatever is to be got out of it, the farmer should get his &ldquo;whack&rdquo; and he can get that without injury to anybody.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This evening I addressed a question to the Minister for Justice calling attention to the fact that certain men, uncharged and untried prisoners, were on hunger strike for a long period and were in a critical condition, and I asked the Minister if it would not be a good thing to issue an order for their immediate release.  I did not submit that question in any Party spirit.  It was grounded on national and humanitarian grounds, and the plea which I am making to the Minister now is not a plea inspired in any way by considerations of Party advantage or Party position.  My plea now, as well as the question earlier, is based on humanitarian considerations, and I hope the Minister will understand the purpose I have in raising the matter. The position confronting the country to-day is that there are three men on hunger strike at the Curragh Camp for a period of 44 days.  If any Deputies were to miss their meals for a few days they would understand what effect <Col N="362" /> the ravages of want of food were going to have on their physique; but when we reflect on the physical and mental torture which these three men must have endured during the past 44 days, we get some picture of their physical and mental condition lying in an internment camp at the Curragh Camp.  It is easy to imagine that men who have abstained from food for 44 days would be physically weak in body and seriously anguished in mind.  That is the position of these three prisoners who are in the internment camp at present.</P>
      <P>My fear&mdash;and it is a fear that is shared by many people who have no sympathy with the protest that these men are making&mdash;is that their death, if death should, unfortunately, occur, will constitute a national tragedy so far as this country is concerned.  We have a past which unfortunately has been marked and characterised by unpleasant incidents of this character, incidents which have not made life easier, and which have not made the attainment of the national objective easier.  These are incidents which every member of this House desires to avoid at any time, and which every Deputy should especially desire to avoid at a time of crisis such as that through which we are now passing.  If, because of the protest which these men are making, the death of any one of them should occur, and if these three men resolve to fast until they are released, or to bring about their death, then it seems to me that the inevitable consequence of their death will be increased Party bitterness and disunity, at a time when the nation should avoid all bitterness and should try to obviate all causes of disunity.  In my view unity and stability are two of the greatest factors which will make for the safety of this nation in the crisis, and I think the Legislature, and the Government in particular, have placed upon them a moral obligation, in fact a national obligation, to ensure that nothing is allowed to happen which would tend to disturb unity or to imperil the stability which each and every Minister must realise is so essential to our national preservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the House to understand that the three men who are <Col N="363" /> making this protest against detention have not been charged with any offence. They have not been tried on any charge, still these untried and uncharged men feel so bitterly about the-position in which they have been placed that, for the past 44 days they have undergone the pain and torture which abstention from food for that long period eventually brings upon even the most physically perfect. Whatever one may say or may think of the method of protest which they have chosen, I think most people will understand the motives which provoked them to resort to this method of protest.</P>
    <P>These men feel that they have not been charged; they know that they have not been tried, yet, they find their liberty taken away for as long a period as two years.  Apparently no effort is being made to, arraign them on any charge, or to bring them before any judge and jury, or even before the auxiliary courts that were established for the purpose of trying what might be described as &ldquo;political offences.&rdquo; The defence which the Minister made to-day for not releasing these prisoners is that at liberty they would constitute a danger to the State.  On reflection it is hard to believe that the Minister really believes that.  Here are three men who have undergone the torture of 44 days' hunger strike.  To imagine that these three men, after that prolonged period of hunger strike, would constitute a danger to this State is asking the House and the country to accept something which neither the House nor the country will believe. After being on hunger strike for that prolonged period these men are to-day emaciated physically, their minds wrung with anguish and torture, and to imagine that if released to-night or to-morrow they would constitute any danger to this State is asking people to believe something which their imagination is not capable of comprehending.</P>
    <P>It should be obvious to each and every one of us that men who have undergone the long ordeal of 44 days' hunger strike will be invalids for a long period.  One might say that a <Col N="364" /> hunger strike of that duration is well calculated to make them invalids for the rest of their lives, whether these lives be long or short, having regard to the ordeal they have undertaken and are undergoing.  I do not believe the release of these physically-ruined men would constitute any danger to the State.  If the State believes&mdash;I cannot understand why the State will not believe it&mdash;that men so physically impaired and so mentally worried would not constitute a danger to the State, then I cannot understand why the State insists on detaining them.  No matter what crime a prisoner may be guilty of, no matter what crime even a convicted prisoner may be guilty of, there is a moral and legal responsibility on the Government to take every possible step to safeguard the life of that convicted prisoner while he is in their custody.  If any prisoner convicted of the most heinous crime were to attempt while in the charge of the Government to take his own life, there is a moral and legal obligation on the Government to restrain him in every possible way from doing so.</P>
    <P>The lives of these men are in the hands of the Government to-night. They are in the hands of the Government so long as they are in the custody of the Government, and I think the Government, having recognised that fact, ought not to allow this protest to continue longer lest by its continuance the lives of these people would be endangered and national unity and national stability impaired.</P>
    <P>I want to put this consideration to the Minister for Justice and the Govment. On the one side you have a powerful Executive with an army, a police force and a judiciary, with all the authority that comes to you from being a Government, and on the other side you have three helpless, physically emaciated persons, lying in a well-protected internment camp on the Curragh to-night.  I suggest to the Government that it ought not to pit its strength against the strength and resolve and mental determination of these three men.  The Government ought to recognise in this case that its real strength is in the showing of <Col N="365" /> elemency and the exercise of humanity towards these three prisoners.  It will ill serve the Government and national unity and national stability if the Government must embark upon a campaign of trying its strength against these three helpless men.  I beg of the Government not to pursue a course of that kind, and to recognise that these are uncharged and untried men, that they have undergone the physical torture of 44 days' hunger strike, and recognising that fact and not wanting to endanger national unity that the Government will say they are now prepared to release these untried and uncharged men, firstly, because they are invalids; secondly, because they have committed no known offence with which they can be charged; and thirdly, because their release would not constitute any danger to the existence of this State.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister again, and I say it in no Party spirit but with a feeling of desire to avoid strife and bitterness here, that if the deaths of these men take place, a national tragedy will have been enacted.  Little will have been done either to preserve the authority or majesty of this State if these three men are allowed to die, and while there is yet time&mdash;I understand their condition to-night is indeed serious&mdash;I hope that the Government, on reconsideration, will reflect on the situation and take steps immediately to order their release.  If the Government do that it will not be a sign of weakness&mdash;it will be a sign of two things: firstly, that the Government is not willing to allow uncharged and untried Irishmen to die on hunger strike in an Irish internment camp, and, secondly, that the Government have given an earnest of their desire to preserve national unity by avoiding courses which might in some way impair the continued existence of that unity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could take into consideration the anxiety which prevails among relatives through the absence of any public information and the rumours that naturally follow that?  Anxiety has been felt that a greater number of internees were involved in this hunger strike, <Col N="366" /> and consequently in danger of their health and lives.  Would the Minister consider it advisable to withdraw the censorship so as to make known to the public more frequently any trouble that arises and the extent to which it exists?  Personally, I can see very well the Minister's view.  The Government must have authority, but the internment of men without trial is obnoxious to most of the public.  It occurred to me while Deputy Norton was speaking that it might be possible for the Minister, where a person is under suspicion, to bring him before the court.  If he refused to recognise the court, some punishment by way of imprisonment should be applied rather than internment without charge.  That, in itself, is obnoxious to the public.  I merely make that suggestion.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to say very much on this subject as I think Deputy Norton has fully dealt with it. Just a few moments ago I received a telegram from Donegal and it read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Donegal Republicans thank you most sincerely for your kind intervention on behalf of the internees and the hunger strikers, and earnestly pray your efforts may be successful. St. Malachi, Primate and Archbishop of Armagh, and the Papal Legate went on hunger strike against Turlogh More O'Connor, High King, to secure the release of noblemen who had been under Malachi's protection apd had been imprisoned by the High King's authority.&mdash;See &lsquo;Life of Saint Malachi&rsquo; by Father Luddy, page 76.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am honestly of the opinion, like Deputy Norton and Deputy Maguire, that it is a disgrace to see those men untried and uncharged being this very night faced with death, and I would not like to be the Minister or the Government that would live on and carry on with the blood of those men on their hands.  I will make one request as a new member and I hope I will soften the Minister's conscience.  I will ask him in the Name of God, for Ireland's sake, and for the sake of the relatives of those men to kindly free them. Surely to goodness the State is not afraid of three men?  What sort of Government <Col N="367" /> is it at all?  Surely three men on hunger strike are not going to upset the whole procedure of the State? Seven women are in Mountjoy without any charge or crime in the wide world. Maire O'Sullivan from the South Dublin area is there since August, 1940, and there was never any charge made against her.  The others are: Eileen O'Kelly, since February, 1942; Mollie and Pat Gallagher since September, 1942; Maggie O'Halloran (Kerry) since October, 1942; Maggie Doyle since November, 1942, and Patricia Kelly since March, 1943.  Surely, the Minister and the Government are not afraid of those women?</P>

      <P>It is a fundamental principle of justice in most democratic countries that a man is innocent of crime until he is found guilty in accordance with law, and it is a principle of Christianity that the person of individual citizens must be respected. Three men against whom no charge has been proved, in fact against whom no charge has been made, are at present on hunger strike in the Curragh Camp as a protest against what they consider is their unjust detention.  All of these men are in grave danger of immediate death&mdash;in fact it is doubtful whether one of them, McLoughlin, is alive even while I am speaking.  Two of the three men, McCool and O'Doherty, are from the Six Counties.  The only reason for O'Doherty's detention here is that he escaped from the custody of the Government in Stormont.  The other, <Col N="368" /> McCool, after serving a sentence of five years in the Crumlin Road Jail, in Belfast, was arrested immediately after he crossed the Border on his release.</P>
      <P>How can the Government reconcile their treatment of these two Northern nationalists with their protestations of desire to end Partition?  How are the interests of the Irish people served by the Government allowing these men to die?  In the interest of national unity, the calamity of their deaths should be avoided so that feeling in the country be not further embittered.  If all the complicated powers of Government administration and of the censored Press, are to be used to the bitter end against these three men, will the result not be that confidence in the integrity of the administration will be undermined? Will the people not be entitled to say, and rightly say, that the personal spites and bitternesses of the individuals who are sitting in the Government Front Bench are more important to them than the interests of justice and national unity?</P>

      <P>It appears to be the position now that certain Deputies are objecting to the right of internment, and seem to think that we must bring all these people to trial or let them out.  I understood that the last Dáil was perfectly satisfied that it was absolutely necessary to intern these people during this period of emergency through which we are going.  It will be remembered that, about the beginning of June, 1940, about 400 people were interned, and if the House did not agree to that, certainly no objection was made to it in the House itself.  The whole matter was to be dealt with in a private way and, if there was any objection to the internment of certain people, it could be dealt with in another place.  There was agreement, however, that in the critical position in which we found ourselves, we should have the right to intern certain people who might be a menace to public order.  At any rate, that was the position that we had to face, and it is still the position, and will remain so as long as war is raging all around us.  If it is going to be <Col N="369" /> insisted on that the Government should let these people out or bring them to trial, the country could not carry on; we could not preserve our peace or our neutrality, because these people are determined, and have shown their determination from the very beginning of this war, to involve us in it, if they could.  That is no wild statement; it is an absolute fact, and is well known to members of this House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the people on hunger strike, I am very sorry, because I feel for them every day while they are on hunger strike, but I am up against this position: that we have got to maintain the right to intern people without trial while the emergency lasts.</P>

      <P>I did not catch what the Deputy said.  We must maintain that right, and if any man who is interned thinks he is wrongly interned he has his remedy.  He has only to make representations, himself or through any of his friends, and I think I can say, without fear of contradiction, that at any time that that was done, no Deputy who ever approached me on behalf of any internee ever went away without being satisfied that if the person concerned was not released it was because I could give good reasons for holding him.  I can tell the House that the police advised me about the release of three internees against whom there was no charge.  I myself objected to the release of these men because I suspected them&mdash;not that I am very suspicious, but I had reason to suspect them.  The police, however, assured me that these men had mended their ways and would obey the law.  They were released accordingly, and what was the result? Inside a couple of months one of our best detective officers, Sergeant O'Brien, was foully murdered outside his home, and we suspect that some of these three men were the principal men concerned in that murder.  Since last September two other Guards were murdered, and we suspect one of these released internees of being guilty of <Col N="370" /> the murder.  We have not got them yet.  That is the sort of position that we have to face.</P>
      <P>One of these men on hunger strike was released, without any condition, on my instructions and against the advice of the police.  This man had been sentenced to five years' penal servitude in the Six Counties.  He was a native of Donegal, and our police arrested him. Representations were made to me on his behalf, and I thought he should get a fair chance, so I told the police that They advised me strongly not to release him, but I did not take their advice, and he was released, and inside of three months we found that he was acting as Chief of Staff of the I.R.A. That is the position.</P>
      <P>There is not one of these internees whose case I have not examined carefully from time to time.  There is not one of them in respect of whom I am not prepared to do that now, and I do not think the House should force me to give way under this pressure of the hunger strike, because it will mean that we can hold nobody.  I nave a melancholy recollection of the last time on which we released a man on hunger strike.  He was a friend of my own.  Pressure was brought to bear on us from all sides to release him, and we gave way and he was released.  What was the result?  That unfortunate man was at the point of death, as these men, as Deputy Norton says, are, and we did not think he could live.  Inside a couple of months of his release, he and a comrade shot two of our Gárdaí in Rathgar, and he himself and his comrade had to be executed for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the House should stand behind me in this matter.  I say this without fear of contradiction: that in the case of any one in respect of whom a case could be made to have him released, he has been released.  They have not been humiliated, they have not been asked to sign any humiliating conditions.  When one of the hunger strikers was standing for Donegal he was offered his release on parole, on condition that he would abstain from breaking the law, but he insisted that his release should he unconditional. That meant that he challenged our right to hold him, and it also means <Col N="371" /> that he was going to persist in trying to involve this country in the war.  As a responsible Minister, I could not stand for that.</P>
    <P>I do regret that any man should die on hunger strike, but I will not take the responsibility.  The responsibility is on themselves.  They have been offered their food.  They can get their liberty on the same terms as everybody else.  They can all have their liberty if they are prepared to obey the laws of the State; but if they will not accept their liberty on the same terms as everybody else, then the Government is determined that they will be held until they are prepared to do so.  I expect that the necessity for internment will not exist when the war is over, but unfortunately the war situation <Col N="372" /> is still there, and these people are a public menace.  If any internee wants to get out, he can get out in the way I have suggested, and every Deputy here should know that.  Perhaps some of the new Deputies are not aware of it, but I am always prepared to deal with any of these cases, and if there is any sign that these people are prepared to obey the law of the State that will be accepted and they will be released, but that is the position.</P>
    <P>I am very sorry to have to say that if any of these men are prepared to die on hunger strike, I cannot help it.  I very much regret it, but there is no way out that I can see, and I cannot see what else we are to do.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 8th July.</P>
