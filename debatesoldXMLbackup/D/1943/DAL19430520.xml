    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that shirt manufacturers in Eire are charging 108/- per dozen to wholesale and 126/-per dozen to retail for utility tunic shirts; that this price to the retail represents a profit of approximately 100 per cent. on cost for the manufacturers; whether he has consented to these prices being charged; and, if so, if he will reverse his decision in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that shirt manufacturers are charging prices which represent 100 per cent. on cost for utility tunic shirts.  I have not been consulted about, nor have I consented to, any such prices.  No such prices for tunic shirts have been fixed under my authority.  If the Deputy can give me particulars of the case he has in mind, I will have the matter investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, under arrangements made in his Department, all printed shirting material is being delivered to a group of shirt manufacturers in Dublin for distribution amongst all classes of manufacturers of shirts throughout the country; that that cloth is costing 1/0½ a yard, that 37 yards make a dozen shirts and the cut, make and trim of those shirts amount to between 24/-and 30/- per dozen, leaving the net cost to the manufacturer 66/- a dozen ex-factory; that they are at present charging&mdash;and invoices are available&mdash;<Col N="406" /> for those shirts at 108/- per dozen to the wholesaler, and 126/- per dozen to the retailer, and that those shirts are being sold in Dublin at the present moment at 14/11 per garment, having cost 5/6 to manufacture.  Will the Minister tolerate so grave an abuse of an arrangement made by him designed to secure cheap shirts for the comparatively poor people who use them?</P>

I have informed the Deputy that, so far as I am aware, the information which he gives is not correct, that no prices of the kind he has quoted have been fixed under my authority, and that if he has particulars of any such case I will be glad if he will furnish them to me.</P>

      <P>There are no restrictions on the importation of circular saws.

    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. P.J. Fogarty Mr. P.J. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is prepared to introduce proposals to amend the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, so as to ensure that all workers, whether permanent or temporary, will be paid for St. Patrick's Day, as this day is the recognised national holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, and the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938, all workers, with certain exceptions set out in those Acts, are entitled to a holiday with pay on St. Patrick's Day or to compensation in lieu thereof, provided they have worked not less than 150 hours for the same employer in the five weeks immediately preceding the holiday.  The requirement of 150 hours' work means, in effect, that workers should be in the employment of the same employer for at least three weeks before they qualify for payment for a holiday.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that any reduction of the qualifying number of hours would be in the best interests of the workers, as some employers might be tempted to refrain from employing workers in the period prior to the holiday.  It is not, therefore, proposed to amend the legislation on the lines suggested in the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that, at the request of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, the State Solicitor in September last instituted proceedings against a number of shipping companies for the purpose of determining whether the provisions of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, applied to casual dockers; that an adverse decision in the action was pronounced by the courts; and whether he will consider introducing proposals for the purpose of amending the Act to ensure that its provisions <Col N="409" /> will apply to the class of workers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the answer I gave to a similar question on the 3rd February last.  The position has not altered in any respect since that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that dockers who may have worked 1,000 hours for one employer and 1,000 hours for another employer still cannot get holidays under the Act?  Is that not a sufficient reason to amend the Act as it is at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wasting time talking about amending the Act. The purpose of the Act is to secure holidays with pay for workers in continuous employment.  The problem of applying that principle to casual workers is obvious.  If the Deputy has any suggestions as to how it can be done, let him put forward his suggestions, but so far as I know none of the trade unions catering for dockers or other classes of people interested in this matter have yet been able to solve the difficulty of applying the principles of the Act to those workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>If casual labourers like builders' labourers are able to get holidays, is there any reason why a similar position could not apply in the case of dockers who also are casual workers and very often are employed by a particular stevedore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no one excluded from the provisions of the Act because he is either a builder's labourer or a docker.  If he fails to get the benefit of the Act it is because he cannot comply with the conditions set out in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the Minister aware that dockers' work is casual work?  Very few of them are employed permanently.  Some of them will work 1,000 hours for one employer and perhaps 800 hours for another.  What difficulty would there be in amending the Act so that their periods of employment could be pooled, and so that they might get the benefit of an annual holiday like other industrial workers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that unemployed town workers in Dungarvan have been ordered to report for work on a relief scheme four or five miles outside the town, under penalty of having their benefits discontinued; whether the rate of pay on the relief scheme is 5/4d. per day, while the rate payable to men casually employed on agricultural work in the district is 8/-per day; whether the starting time on the relief job is 8.15 a.m. and whether these men must, therefore, leave home at 7 a.m.; whether work is available on the relief scheme for only four days per week for the men sent there from the employment exchange; and whether, in the circumstances, he will issue instructions that men living in Dungarvan must not be required to take rotational employment under the conditions outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme to which the Deputy refers is a Minor Employment Scheme undertaken by Waterford County Council in the townland of Ballyharahan, which is three miles from Dungarvan town.  The functions of my Department in connection with these schemes are confined to the submission of suitable recipients of unemployment assistance and to the notification of men selected by the employing authority of the time and place at which they are to report for work.  The rate of wages paid to workmen, the hours of work, the area from which workers are to be recruited and the period of employment allotted to each man are matters entirely for the authority carrying out the work.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the site of the work in question is within easy reach of Dungarvan town it is not proposed to issue the instructions suggested by the Deputy.  Where, however, a workman refuses any employment offered on the ground that the work is unsuitable for him the full facts of his case are considered before any decision which might affect payment of unemployment assistance to him is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of wages paid by farmers to <Col N="411" /> casual agricultural workers in the district of Ballyharahan is six shillings per day.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that owing to a recent decision of the county manager for Kerry no portion of cottage rent arrears will be accepted unless the whole amount is cleared off; and whether, in view of the fact that many cottiers are unable to meet their total liability without getting time, he will exercise his authority to protect people from the harsh repercussions of such a policy.</P>

      <P>The rent collection in County Kerry has been unsatisfactory for several years and although there has been some improvement in the position in the past two years the arrears outstanding at March last exceeded £16,000.  The collection of the rents is a matter for the local authority and I have no power to intervene in regard to any action which the county manager may consider necessary to ensure a satisfactory collection of the arrears.  From inquiries made I understand that there has been no decision not to accept portion of the rent arrears unless the whole amount is cleared off.

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>During this period, when agricultural countries generally <Col N="417" /> throughout the world are deeply concerned in the production of food, and while some of our neighbouring countries are actively considering how best to organise the distribution and ownership of the land, so that it can be used in the most economic and efficient manner in the best interests of the community, I suggest that we might pause and ask ourselves whether the method we have adopted is the best solution to the problem of uneconomic holdings.</P>
      <P>I have asked the question, on more than one occasion on this Vote in the past, whether the unit created by the Land Commission in the distribution of large estates here to allottees is an economic unit in present circumstances. I have expressed the view that it is not, but that opinion has been challenged from the Government Benches on more than one occasion.  In view of recent events, and with the limited knowledge I have gained of what has happened in other countries, and of the opinions expressed by agricultural experts there regarding the whole future of agriculture, I feel that our whole method of land distribution is wrong.</P>
      <P>In Great Britain, there is quite a big volume of opinion that there is no future for the smallholder.  In that country, men who possess 100 acres are looked upon as smallholders.  The experts feel that the smallholder cannot exist in a post-war economy there, except on a basis of collective organisation. I think there is some truth in that.  With the enormous development that has taken place in British agriculture, and the amount of attention that has been devoted to it in the way of organisation and technical advice in regard to the details of production, we know that they have got extraordinary results from their agricultural productive capacity and that they have expanded their production enormously since the inception of the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach expressed his views at Limerick in opening his election campaign, and the Minister for Finance, in his Budget speech recently, made reference to the value of the British market, but if we are to preserve that <Col N="418" /> market so that it will be available to this country in the future, we must ensure that our people are put in a position to compete with British farmers during the post-war period. To a large extent, that efficiency will depend upon the sort of organisation and the method adopted to harness our people to the work of production. With the modern methods and the high degree of mechanisation that British agriculture has attained, we have no room here for the sort of unit that has been adopted generally by the Department of Lands.  This House should face up to that situation. I do not think the Land Commission has faced up to it, or that they realise that the problem is a real one, which may be creating a slum problem in some districts, so far as land is concerned.</P>
    <P>The mentality and characteristics of our people are such&mdash;they are very individualistic&mdash;that I do not think you can easily adapt them to the collective idea.  I do not propose to advocate the collective idea, but there is in the Land Commission a great opportunity to try out the possibility of co-operative farming.  It is even late in the day to try it: it should have been tried long ago.  We know the results which have been achieved in other countries in that respect. There are ideal conditions here for the operation of a modern co-operative system.  In present circumstances, when we are prepared to spend large sums of money on individual families, in migrating them from the West of Ireland to some of the best land in County Meath and North Kildare, there is no earthly reason why a system of co-operation should not be tried out when a large estate is being divided into a number of small holdings. Why should we divide that estate into small individual units which, from the point of view of modern agriculture, are absolutely uneconomic?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the estate as a whole should be organised into one productive unit, at the same time maintaining the individual family on each portion. A committee of control could be evolved without difficulty, to organise production, and could be supplied with <Col N="419" /> the necessary modern machinery, plant and equipment to carry out a modern system of agriculture on the different units.  That would provide a great opportunity to carry out a series of experiments, to see how far we could group large numbers of uneconomic holdings throughout the country.  If an experiment can be made a success on such an estate, there is no reason why we could not go right through the country into counties where there are small holdings, group them together and organise them for co-operative effort.</P>
    <P>We will have to face the situation after the war when there will be competition from people who are highly organised and who have reached a high standard of production.  Our people are not equipped and organised in the same fashion.  If they are not in a position to command the same means of production, then we will simply fade out of the picture and that will be the end of it.  There is no use in talking about the value of the British market to this country if our methods, equipment and technique are not equal to theirs.  We cannot expect our people to strive against a handicap of that sort.</P>
    <P>No effort is being made to try that out now when the opportunity offers under the system being operated now by the Land Commission.  I have adverted to this on other Votes and I thought that at least some examination would be given to this matter.  If the experiment had been tried two or three years ago, we would be in a grand position, if it were a success, to organise our people generally on that basis in the post-war period.  Let us hope it is not too late.  But when we read about other countries tackling this problem of distribution, ownership, organisation, collective farming and all the other methods of putting people in a position where the most efficient and most economic method can be adopted, I feel that we have made no effort whatever to tackle that sort of organisation.  We are bound to meet that post-war and we have not got plans to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I think we want to be extremely careful, <Col N="420" /> too, in picking the best material. Many people do not appreciate that in Great Britain to-day farmers are classified into three categories&mdash;A, B, and C.  Any man who does not reach the C class goes out.  Mind you, when we talk of security of tenure we appear to overlook the fact that the people we are competing against are insisting on efficiency or &ldquo;get-out&rdquo;, one or the other.  If we do not insist on some standard of efficiency, we can forget that market to which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have been paying pious tributes.  It may be all right to say that the most important and most essential things are right of ownership and security of tenure, but we cannot overlook what is happening around us in other countries, and the competition which will be set for us in a difficult post-war period.  In that respect, so far as the personnel for settling on the land is concerned, in my opinion the Land Commission should be extremely careful about picking men with knowledge, experience, ability and energy to work the land in the best interest of the community.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies yesterday referred to the problem of settling migrants in Meath, Westmeath and North Kildare and, as representing North Kildare, I must express my view on that.  I feel it is unfair to disregard the just claims of local applicants.  I do not want to minimise the problem in any way.  The congestion in the West has got to be tackled and eased to some extent. That can only be done by bringing them on to the lands where you have a sparse and thin population, but in doing that you cannot overlook the fact that the local people have at least a just claim to equal treatment with the people brought up from the West. I do not want to go beyond that, but I want to stress the point that in reason and in justice the local applicants are at least entitled to be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. P.J. Fogarty Mr. P.J. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite understand that the activities of the Land Commission have been slowed down owing to the emergency, but there are a few items which I should like to bring to the Minister's attention. <Col N="421" /> One is in connection with Land Commission roads which are made when lands are divided.  The Land Commission make the road, but no one seems to pay any attention to it after it is made.  There may be eight, ten or twelve small holders living on a particular road.  After a few years the road is in a neglected condition.  I know roads on which the owners of threshing mills refuse to bring their mills and people delivering groceries refuse to bring their vehicles.  The Minister should seriously consider that matter.  When the Land Commission make these roads through lands that have been divided, they should come to some agreement with the county council.  When these ratepayers, as they are now, get in touch with the county council, the county council say it is not their business; it is a matter for the Land Commission.  The Land Commission adopt the attitude that it is the business of the small holders living along a road to maintain it.  It is impossible for these people to maintain a road which may be a couple of miles long.</P>
      <P>In the majority of cases these roads are very good substantial roads.  As I say, there should be some arrangement by which the county council would take them over and maintain them.  I know several of these roads made by the Land Commission on various estates in County Dublin.  They are very good roads and, if they had been treated the following year with tar, as the ordinary county council roads are treated, they would last for many years.  But they are let go into disrepair, pot-holes appear in them, and the job seems to be too big for the county council, too big for the Land Commission and too big for the people who live on them. The people on these roads have to go to Mass on Sundays, the children have to go to school, and they have to travel on these roads which are in a disgraceful condition.  All that could be avoided if the Land Commission got into touch with the county council and came to some arrangement with the council to take them over.  The matter should receive the attention of the Minister, as it is a very serious and important one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> Another matter I should like to mention is the lands at present in possession of the Land Commission.  I certainly should like to see more land divided, but I can understand that the activities of the Land Commission are held up owing to the emergency.  I think, however, that lands which are held by the Land Commission should be divided amongst local applicants, because if the Land Commission continue to let out these lands, the individuals who take the lands will get the most they possibly can out of them and rob the lands of their fertility.</P>
    <P>They will put in a couple of crops of wheat and the land will not be much good to anyone else.  Such an individual will take it and go all out for tillage that year, the next year and perhaps the third year, so that eventually the land is not much good to anyone.  If the fertility of that land is to be maintained, it would be far better that it should be divided amongst deserving people.  I know several areas round North County Dublin&mdash;and I suppose the same applies to other counties&mdash;in which the Land Commission have a considerable amount of land which, year after year, they let out.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider, when the letting season ends next November, dividing these lands.  I agree with Deputy Hughes when he says that where there are deserving applicants who have satisfied the Land Commission that they are in a position to utilise these lands to the fullest extent, they should be given preference &mdash;not that I have any objection to people from the West of Ireland getting land, because a number of them may be coming back to lands from which they were driven in years gone by, but where you have local applicants who have proved their worth on small holdings of two, three, four and five acres and who have reared families on them, the Minister would be wise to consider them in connection with the division of these lands when the season ends next November.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know what the Land Commission is doing at present.  I know they have <Col N="423" /> lands on their hands for a number of years, on which houses have been built in some cases, but these are still being retained, let in grass or some other fashion, and not being used for the purpose for which they were originally taken over.  Strange to say, it is impossible to get any information as to why these lands are not divided.</P>
      <P>There are too many suitable applicants trying to get planted on them, and houses have been built on some of them, but when the Land Commission are asked to do anything, we are told that the staff has been reduced and they can do nothing.  It would save time, trouble and work for the Department if they would dispose of the lands they have instead of answering correspondence in connection with them. I have in mind one part of an estate&mdash; only one holding&mdash;on which a house was built, and which is ready for taking over at any time.  There are too many suitable applicants for it, but the Land Commission merely sit down and give no information as to why that holding has not been distributed. They complain that they are short of staff, but I know that hundreds of letters must have been answered by the Land Commission in respect of that land, and yet it remains undistributed. It is all very mysterious, and I should be glad if the Minister could throw some light on why these things are done in such a peculiar way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion made by Deputy Hughes, I think it would be a very good experiment, if it were no more than that, to try the benefits of co-operation.  It might prove a success, but in any case it would be worth trying.  Money in plenty is voted for the Land Commission and the Department of Agriculture, and these Departments should be striking out in new directions, trying to make discoveries, and if possible to improve standards of production.  Our farmers want a lead.  We are very far behind, and these two Departments should cooperate, where necessary, in order to enable experiments to be carried out. Individual farmers cannot afford to make experiments, and even if they did <Col N="424" /> try it would be very difficult for individuals to come together and start organising in respect of something which would be more or less an experiment for some time.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Hughes pointed out, if the Land Commission, having a compact unit broken up, worked it and it proved a success, it would be much easier to spread the organisation and induce others to follow suit.  If farmers see something proving a success, there is no trouble in getting them to come together, as they did with regard to the co-operative dairying business, but they will do so only when they see something proven.  These lands which are actually in the possession of the Land Commission would be suitable for experimenting, and one thing I should like to see is the starting of demonstration farms.  It is a matter which was raised and discussed here many years ago.  It was turned down by the Minister for Agriculture, but there have been many changes since and the need for demonstration farms is no less now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I am suggesting that the two Departments co-operate.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to raise it when the Vote for Agriculture comes up, but I am bringing it to the notice of the Minister now because I want the co-operation of both Departments.  If the Minister for Agriculture decided to give it a trial, he would be saved the trouble of buying or hiring land, <Col N="425" /> because it would be easy for the two Departments to make the necessary arrangements and to provide suitable sized farms from amongst those in the hands of the Land Commission.  These could be put in the charge of the local instructor, who could put in men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely bringing it to the notice of the Minister so that, if he were prepared to cooperate, we could recommend that the Minister for Agriculture should take such steps.  I believe that the land in the hands of the Land Commission would be the best land on which to try the experiment, and I should like the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Lands to give the matter a little consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Hughes, I think the dividing up of farms into small holdings of 25 and 30 acres is not a sound proposition.  I saw land divided some years ago.  The people there got 40 and 45 acres of very good land, and, although it was very dear, working out at nearly £1 per acre, they made a real success of their holdings for the reason that the land was good and that they got up to 45 acres. I have seen other estates divided into holdings of 35, 30 and, I think, 25 acres and given to landless men who were powerless to do anything effective with it.  They had no capital, and, with the cost of the land and the house built on it, they were unable to pay the rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say whether it is due to financial stringency that the houses built on these allotments are anything but houses built for families.  I am inclined to think that we are building down to a price rather than up to a standard because of financial stringency.  Deputy Dillon yesterday tried to make little of this matter by insisting that some of us believe that by giving extra money to the consumers, all our economic evils will be solved.  I want to tell Deputy Dillon and anybody else who <Col N="426" /> speaks in that fashion that money is not wealth.  It is just a measure of wealth.  The sooner we make up our minds to become convinced of that and look upon money as a medium of exchange rather than as a dominating factor, the sooner we will get rid of much of the criticism here.</P>
    <P>I would say that, where a 400 or 500 acre estate is being divided, there would be nothing wrong in building eight or ten houses on different parts of that estate for occupation by persons interested in agriculture.  We could then try an experiment and deal with the 400 or 500 acres on a co-operative basis, while at the same time maintaining the family unit.  It is obvious to any thinking person that if you put ten men on allotments of 35 or 40 acres without sufficient financial backing they will find difficulty in working the land.  They will have to buy horses and ploughs and other machinery.  If that were done on a co-operative basis, there would be a much better chance of success.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on the subject of co-operative farming along those lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a problem I came across in my constituency.  It affects a number of small holdings.  The people occupying these holdings have been living there for years and the valuation would indicate that the land at one period was good, but in several places it has deteriorated considerably; in fact, it could only be described now as non-arable.  When I made inquiries I was surprised to find that the deterioration was due largely to neglect of drainage.  I asked the owners why they did not take proceedings against the people responsible for maintaining the waterways, and they told me that the responsible authority in one case was the railway company; that in the past the railway company maintained the waterways along by the railway and, at that period, they were able to cultivate the land; but for a number of years the company had not been quite satisfactory in attending to the drainage, and the people whose lands were <Col N="427" /> affected did not feel equal to going into the courts with a big concern like the railway company.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Land Commission have a duty in this connection.  What I have just said applies also to the small farmers who reside on the verges of large estates.  On some of those large ranches drainage does not count very much.  If a man has a big area of land and only the tail of it is flooded, he does not mind very much; but the small holder who adjoins may have his land flooded through the neglect in the matter of drainage on the part of the large landholder.  The people who occupy the smaller holdings dislike going into the courts.  I think the Land Commission should pay some attention to the need for keeping the land in a fertile and arable condition.  Much of the land that is classed as non-arable by inspectors under the compulsory tillage scheme would be, to my mind, quite arable if some attention could be given to the drainage.  In the past it was arable land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not getting the area of land under cultivation that we should get, largely because of the neglect of drainage.  This is a matter with which the Department of Lands should immediately concern itself.  It may be suggested that this is a matter that should be left over until the report of the Drainage Commission is given effect to.  I do not agree with that outlook. I say that there is a lot of field drainage that should be undertaken.  In the past, when these estates were in the hands of the landlords, the landlords saw to it that the farms were kept in a fertile condition; that the lands were not allowed to deteriorate. That aspect of the matter should not be neglected by the Land Commission. Many landowners neglect their holdings and fail to carry out proper drainage schemes and their neighbours suffer.  One satisfactory feature of the old landlord system was that, where there was a good landlord, he saw to it that the fertility of the soil was maintained.  I trust the Minister will give consideration to my suggestions. He should consider more particularly <Col N="428" /> the position of large companies, such as the railway and canal companies, who seem totally to ignore the rights of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHCrowley" hpid="Mr. F.H. Crowley Mr. F.H. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F.H. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to draw the attention of the Minister to the position of the Kenmare tenants in relation to turbary.  I am very pleased to know that inspectors have been sent down within the past two or three weeks to divide turbary among practically 3,000 tenants but, unfortunately, activities in the matter of division are more or less finished for the moment, largely on account of the lack of roads and drains.  I hold that the construction of roads and drains should have precedence over the actual division of the turbary, and I am given to understand by the inspectors that no further division can be proceeded with until they complete the construction of the roads and drains.</P>
      <P>There is one very serious aspect and I am drawing the Minister's attention to it particularly, because I think it could be remedied.  The Turf Development Board have acquired about 70 acres of turbary in a highly congested area; they have acquired it for a scheme known as the Barna scheme. They intend eventually to instal a machine for cutting the turf.  The 70 acres which they have taken over were originally ear-marked for some 50 tenants who are living in the townlands of Tureencahill and Tureenamult. I suggest it is not yet too late to ask the Turf Development Board to surrender the portion up to what is known as the second drain in the turf development scheme&mdash;that portion of the turbary which they have lately acquired.  If they do so, they will be accommodating 40 to 50 tenants; otherwise these 40 or 50 tenants would have to travel some eight or nine miles to another bog in order to get their necessary turf supplies.  This is a very important matter.  I hold that the rights of the tenants should come before the rights of the Turf Development Board.  The turbary to which I am referring was not private property; it was ear-marked for those tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be critical, or in any way harsh in regard to the Turf <Col N="429" /> Development Board.  I quite realise the good work they have done.  I suggest that with a little re-adjustment they can move their scheme back to the second drain and still be in a position to have an economic unit from the point of view of working their machine.</P>
    <P>There is one very important point that I wish to stress and it is that I would like very much if some effort were made to provide the tenants of the Hartropp, the Cronin Coltsman, and the McCartie estates with turbary. They are surrounded by turbary and it is only a question of devoting a little attention to it to enable them to get it in their district.  I particularly refer to the people of Rusheenmore and Rusheenbeg, Arteagallivan and other townlands.</P>
    <P>A number of holdings have been offered to the Irish Land Commission in exchange for holdings in other counties and these, if taken over, could be divided amongst the uneconomic holders.  I am not stressing any particular case except those that have been offered in congested districts. With a stroke of the pen we could, by taking over one of these holdings, make four or five uneconomic holdings economic.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to pay particular attention to the acquisition of a number of these holdings by giving suitable exchanges in other counties to the tenants from whom they are taking the land.</P>

      <P>There is congestion, and terrible congestion in County Mayo. Deputy Nally yesterday referred to it. It does exist, and only the fringe of the problem has been touched up to the present.  The Government started on the right policy in trying to take people out of those areas which may be rightly called rural slums.  It is the only solution, because there is not enough land in County Mayo to meet the problem.  Even if all the land available were taken over to-morrow by the Land Commission, it would still be insufficient to deal with congestion in the County Mayo.  There is a certain amount of land&mdash;I might say a considerable amount of land&mdash;in the county that could be acquired, and the Land Commission should take steps to acquire it.  In my view there should be a limit put to the size of holdings in the County Mayo, but even that will not solve the congestion problem in the county, where you have farms of seven or eight acres in about 20 pieces and where, in some cases, one man's front door is beside another man's back door.  There is one particular place in my constituency where, in order to allow his next-door neighbour to use his horse and cart, a man has to allow him to bring his horse and cart through his farm.</P>
      <P>These are problems that have to be dealt with in the County Mayo if there is to be any genuine attempt made to settle the land question.  There has been good work done, undoubtedly. There has been good work done by the old Congested Districts Board, and there has been good work done by the present Government.  The best day's work was when they started bringing people out of the county and giving them a chance of making a living elsewhere.  I can assure men like Deputy Hickey that if the congests in Mayo could get 25 acres that he seemed to despise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the County of Cork or any other county, there would be a lot of applicants for it.  There would be no difficulty in getting people to take it.  I am not saying that it is too much or that it is even enough, <Col N="431" /> but the old saying is that you must cut your coat according to your measure.  There is only a certain amount of land available and there is a big problem to be dealt with.  As far as County Mayo is concerned, the only way to deal with the problem is to take, at the very least, 1,000 of those small land holders out of the county and bring them where there is land and give them some chance of making a living.  Those people really have never lived on the land for generations; it is only a lodging for them. We have heard a good deal in different debates in this House of emigration, especially at the present time, to Great Britain, but were it not for the fact that that outlet was available to people in places like County Mayo, for the past three or four generations, I do not know what many of these small land owners would do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not live there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, they could not possibly live there.  I would appeal to the Minister and to the Department of Lands not to hold up this migration scheme, to extend it further and to try to deal with what we know in Mayo as the rundale system.  As I have said, there are men with seven or eight and, in some cases, five acres in perhaps 15 or 20 pieces.  To a certain extent that has been relieved by the operations of the Land Commission but the places from which migration took place are still there; the neighbouring land owners have merely the grazing rights of them and these townlands have never been rearranged. I think the Ministry should make a serious attempt to rearrange those townlands where opportunity arises for doing so because there are places in the County Mayo of that description that have been hanging fire for nearly 30 years, going back to the old days of the Congested Districts Board.  Something should be done about rearranging these townlands.  I know there are townlands in which it cannot be done for the simple reason that the people have not yet been taken out of them and there is not <Col N="432" /> enough land available in the neighbourhood, but there are places where there is enough land and where it can be done and should be proceeded with.</P>
      <P>I would also appeal to the Minister to extend the grants for reclamation and lime.  These are two very good things as far as County Mayo is concerned. Of course, the lime subsidy probably arises on the Vote for Agriculture but I think the grants for reclamation do not exactly come under the Vote for Agriculture.  Housing is a thing that needs attention and I find, especially now, due to the rise in the cost of housing material, that the farm grant plus an advance from the Land Commission is not enough in most cases.</P>
      <P>There is a Land Commission regulation to the effect that advances cannot exceed ten times the amount of the annuity.  I think that at the present time that regulation should be withdrawn because the provision that is being made is not at all sufficient to enable those small land holders to build houses.  I have seen the different types of houses shown to those new land holders&mdash;numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.  The number two house is, unfortunately, the most common type of house that is being built in the County Mayo.  In my opinion it is not at all adequate for large families, and might as well not be built at all.  In my opinion, the number five or number eight type of house should be concentrated upon.  The Minister will say that the holding would not be able to bear the increased annuity that would have to be imposed as a result of providing the superior type of house.  If there is the danger that people would not be able to make the required payments, then, I think, that difficulty should be met by an additional grant from the State.  The problems that I have referred to are, so far as land in the County Mayo is concerned, the most pressing at the present time, and I would appeal to the Minister to consider what I have had to say on the Estimate.</P>

      <P>I think that the points raised by Deputy Walsh can be dealt with by me when I come to reply to the points made by some other Deputies.  With regard to the houses in general use by the Land Commission, so far as I know the accommodation consists of three bedrooms and one large living-room.  It is a type of house that is suited for a family.  Deputies familiar with their constituencies will know that the Land Commission house is superior to a very large number of ordinary farm houses.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harris raised a question about the flooding of certain lands in the County Kildare.  If, in addition to the multifarious activities with which the Land Commission is entrusted by statute, it was to have forced upon it the additional duty of looking after the interests of people who have not taken action against the third parties concerned when they feel that their property is being damaged and have failed to seek a remedy in the ordinary way, its position would become very difficult.  There are drainage boards and local authorities dealing with drainage questions throughout the country.  As Deputies know, we will, in all probability, have a new national drainage authority set up when the Drainage Bill is introduced and, I hope, passed by the Oireachtas in the near future.  I do not think that Deputy Harris has very strong grounds for asking us to take upon ourselves the protection of these neighbours of his whose lands are being flooded.  As regards the particular case that he mentioned, we had some difficulty in identifying the land.  In view, however, of the Deputy's interest in the matter, I have asked for a report from the local inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies seem to think that the Land Commission should be able to carry on as in normal times.  The <Col N="434" /> war has been on now for a considerable period, and each year on this Estimate I have had to emphasise that the Land Commission is working on a very restricted scale, first of all, because of the reduced staff which we are carrying, and, secondly, because of the fact that a decision was come to early in the war that only actual commitments would be proceeded with. As I shall explain later, it would be quite impossible for us to undertake new commitments at the present time. With regard to the position generally, as I indicated in my opening statement, the situation is much the same as it was last year.  In fact, we are in a much worse position this year owing to the petrol shortage.  We still have about 340 officers lent to other Departments.  In the case of our outdoor staff, we have only about half the number which we normally had, and of that half only about one-fifth are in a position to use their cars. Normally, the Land Commission inspectorate used about 7,500 gallons per month.  Now they are using, if they can get it, about 300 odd gallons. Deputies will realise, therefore, that it is absolutely impossible for the inspectors to cover anything like the area of ground which they used to cover in normal times.  I would, therefore, ask Deputies to exercise a real discretion in bringing cases to the notice of the Land Commission unless they deal with very serious matters such, for example, as the danger of serious damage by flooding if not attended to.  I think that Deputies ought to avoid bringing matters under notice when they know that really very little can be done.</P>
    <P>I think, having regard to our circumstances, that we have done fairly well in the past year.  As I have stated, over 20,000 acres of land have been divided among 1,400 allottees and about £250,000 have been spent on improvement works.  When one considers the exceeding difficulty there is in getting houses built, roads made and fences provided at the present time, I think we have every reason to congratulate ourselves that a fairly decent programme of that character has been carried out in spite of emergency difficulties.  At the moment, the <Col N="435" /> Land Commission has about 40,000 acres of arable land in hands&mdash;that is to say, in the machine.  This is land which, in normal times, the inspectors would be scheming.  They are, as far as it is possible, preparing schemes, but the difficulties I have alluded to make their work very tedious, far more than in normal times.  However, there is that amount of land in the machine to be dealt with.  We have a further 45,000 or 50,000 acres in respect of which proceedings are in progress.  In some cases, the price has been agreed upon or fixed by the tribunal.  In other cases, the land has been gazetted for acquisition or notice of intention to resume has been served.  That means, therefore, that there is a very considerable reservoir of land which, even if we had our normal staff and normal working conditions, would probably take us some years to clear off.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a further large area, running into hundreds of thousands of acres, which has been inspected either for suitability or price or for preliminary consideration. It will be very difficult to deal with that latter category for any considerable time.  The position is, as I think I stated in the House last year, that with regard to the acquisition and resales branch of the Department, about two-thirds of the work is of a post-scheme nature.  Deputies must remember that the settlement of the people on the land has to follow a recognised procedure which has grown up over a considerable period of time. Legal questions arise and, before the land is finally vested in the tenants, a great deal of work has to be done in the office.  Even in normal times, the staff of the acquisition and resale division was not able to keep abreast of the correspondence from allottees all over the country.  In the present situation, they are simply swamped and could only deal with a small percentage of these allotted parcels.  The House will have some idea of the extent of that problem alone, when I say there are about 45,000 parcels which have been allotted under the 1923 to 1939 Acts, in which this post-scheme work has still to be dealt with. We are trying to do that and, with the <Col N="436" /> reduced staff, it is simply impossible.</P>
    <P>Then we have the vesting of holdings. Out of 104,000 holdings coming under the 1923 Act, only 30,000 have been vested, leaving some 74,000 still to be dealt with.  A great many of these need to be rearranged, to have new buildings placed upon them and to have roads and fences constructed. When I am asked what the Land Commission is doing, I would like Deputies to find out for themselves the nature of the work which the officers in the acquisition and resale branch and the purchase branch have to carry out.  This is tedious detailed work and, in the cases I have mentioned, each individual holding may have special points which have to be cleared up.  It is not as in other Departments, where some general formula will cover a multitude of cases and, with the stroke of a pen and a decision at headquarters, everything goes along smoothly.  These cases in the purchase branch, and often in the acquisition and resale branch, involve attention to individual holdings.  If these individual holdings are not attended to, and if the work of revesting or completing the settlement of the tenant in the proper legal manner, according to the usual procedure of the Land Commission, is not done in the usual way, leaving no leaks or points to be cleared up later, it simply means that you have further correspondence.  I would ask Deputies, therefore, to make allowances for the huge amount of work that the commission is trying to carry out under extremely difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the vesting of the 74,000 holdings is one of the most important problems which remain to be dealt with.  In addition we have the problem of congestion in the west of Ireland.  Deputies probably know that there are between 40,000 and 50,000 holdings there, which were purchased under the old Congested Districts Board.  It was intended that rearrangement of them should take place and that an effort should be made, not alone to provide houses, roads, fences and drains, but by the rearrangement to bring the existing holdings&mdash;of a very miserable character, in very many instances&mdash;to <Col N="437" /> something more approaching an economic level.  As Deputy Walsh has pointed out, there would not be enough land in the country to provide an economic holding for even a percentage of those 40,000 or 50,000 congests. I consider that it is perhaps the most important problem that lies before the Land Commission to complete that work, which is a legacy left over from the previous régime&mdash;which, in any case, showed that it had good intentions when it started and which, during its period, accomplished very good work indeed.</P>
    <P>It is rather disappointing that we have not been able to make more progress in dealing with the problem of congestion.  It is really a form of social service, in my opinion, which is superior to many of the social services which the taxpayers provide.  Aid is certainly given by the State in carrying out this policy of resettlement, and in enabling migrants to be transferred from congested areas and have the holdings they left behind them used in rearrangement to increase their neighbours' holdings.  But that money is very well spent, if it provides large families with opportunities to people the more fertile lands of the country, which are practically unpopulated, or were so until this scheme started, and also if it gives the people left in the congested areas a somewhat better chance to eke out an existence there. The money seems to me to be very well spent indeed.  It is in the nature of capital expenditure, and a considerable amount of it is repaid.</P>
    <P>Anything that tends to keep a healthy industrious and intelligent stock on the land, which might otherwise have become a proletariat in some foreign slum&mdash;not even an Irish one&mdash; is very good business.  In these days, when we hear so much talk of social security, I am rather surprised that there could be any doubt that the policy of trying to relieve the very bad congestion in certain districts on the western seaboard should be pursued, and even pursued intensively.  If it is true, as some Deputies have suggested, that far more will have to be done after the war and that people will require <Col N="438" /> more security, I fail to see in what way you can give them greater security to build upon, not alone so far as being members of the State is concerned, as individual citizens, but for the building of healthy and happy families, which is also a matter of great importance.</P>
    <P>The House knows that, some years ago, an interdepartmental committee was set up by the Government to examine the question of seasonal migration which goes on from many of those congested areas.  This committee recommended that the Government should take all practicable steps to concentrate its energies on a policy of land resettlement, with a view to solving the problem of the congested areas. In paragraph 59 of their report the committee state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The area of untenanted land available in the congested districts counties for the relief of congestion has been reduced considerably in the manner described in paragraph 56 since the abolition of the Congested Districts Board and is now definitely insufficient by itself to enable the conditions in the congested districts to be improved to anything like the extent required.  It is not possible from the statistics available to state the precise area likely to be available, but it is estimated that it will exceed 100,000 acres.  At least 50,000 acres of this total would be required for the enlargement and improvement of the holdings of adjoining uneconomic occupiers, and in order to provide scope for the rearrangement and enlargement of the remaining uneconomic holdings the migration of at least 8,000 families will be necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That will give the House an idea of the extent of the problem.  Later on the committee state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The area of untenanted land likely to be available for distribution outside the congested districts counties is estimated at about 600,000 acres and we recommend that not less than one-fourth of this area, in large blocks, be ear-marked for migrants from the congested districts so as to enable migration to be <Col N="439" /> carried out in colonies or large homogeneous groups.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government accepted the recommendation in 1938 after the committee had reported, but before we could put the recommendations into operation in the way that we would have wished, the emergency situation arose and our inspectors were transferred to compulsory tillage work, to turf work, and so on.  Most of the turf schemes throughout the country are, of course, the result of the work of the Land Commission inspectors.  In the same way, as I have explained to the House, the indoor staff of the Land Commission has been very seriously reduced, so that it was impossible to operate the scheme of migration on anything like the scale that the committee suggested, and that I believe the Government would have wished to do.</P>
    <P>At the present time we are trying to carry on migration as best we can. There are great difficulties in the way, but I believe that, no matter what Government is here, that problem of bad congestion will have to be tackled by the Department of Lands, and that they will have to continue to pursue it for a period of time until a very substantial number of those families are taken out of the congested areas altogether.  Those who have been taken out have proved that the Land Commission inspectors knew what they were doing when they recommended them for transfer under these migration schemes.  They have impressed those who have come in contact with them by their industry and capacity, and I have no doubt whatever but that they will be a great success.  They have been a success up to the present time, and I have not the slightest doubt that, far from being a failure as has been suggested, even if the scheme were to be stopped at the point that it has now reached, it will be of tremendous national benefit, because I believe that the families of these migrants will spread out.  As the House knows, and as was pointed out during the debate, it would, of course, be impossible in a household of 14 children for everyone to get a <Col N="440" /> livelihood on the land which the Land Commission has provided them with. But I have no doubt that a certain number of them will, through their industry, remain in the area, if not on the parental holding, and they may be able to acquire holdings themselves later on, if they are worthy and suitable. So far as the migration scheme is concerned, far from having any apology to offer, or finding it necessary to make any explanations, I am very happy and proud to have been associated with it during my period in the Department of Lands, and I think my predecessor and the Land Commissioners have reason to congratulate themselves on the success which has been achieved.</P>
    <P>One of the points we have to keep in mind in connection with this problem of migration is that after the war it will be necessary to provide employment for very large numbers of our people returning to this country from Great Britain, and I do not see any way that is better socially than enabling people to have better homes, enabling them to have better means of living in the congested areas through the improvement works that the Land Commission have been carrying out.  Very large sums of money have been spent, and I hope that when normal conditions are resumed far greater sums will be spent.  It may very well be that if all these, or even if only a large percentage of them, return immediately the war is over, the Government will find it absolutely necessary to find employment for them in this way.  There is scarcely any better way of providing employment in rural areas.  Of course, the 40,000 or 50,000 holdings I have referred to are mainly in Galway, Mayo and Donegal.  We have not got them in Kerry, and, therefore, we are not able to spend the same amount of money as we spent in the other counties I have mentioned.  We have not the problem of re-arrangement and resettlement in the same way.  The Land Commission are very restricted in what they can do in Kerry.  But we have been trying to concentrate on turbary.  I am afraid we have not always been met with the support locally that we would wish.  When the <Col N="441" /> surveyors of the Land Commission went down there, far from getting cooperation, they got opposition.  Deputies who come from areas where turbary is a burning question will realise the extreme difficulty of getting agreement from the owners of turbary in connection with these schemes.  It takes a very long time before a proper survey can be carried out, where there is a large number of tenants involved.  If, in addition to the other difficulties that the surveyor and the inspector are faced with, they are to have the hostility of those who, for the time being, are using the turbary, it makes it almost impossible for them to carry out the work in the way that our friends in Kerry would like.  Nevertheless, a good deal of money has been spent, and I hope that through the joint operations of the Turf Development Board and the Land Commission more money will be spent on bog development in Kerry. The bog in which Deputy Crowley is interested&mdash;Tooreencahill, I think, is the name&mdash;is the subject of discussion between the Turf Development Board and the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fionan Lynch referred to the Emergency Powers Order which prevents the Land Commission from dealing with fresh applications for admission to purchase benefits under the Acts.  Since the closing down on these applications has come about, it appears that landlords have been, more than was the custom, asking tenants to sign grazing agreements, but we are not in a position to deal with applications in the ordinary way, and it did not seem fair to allow the powers to continue and allow tenants to make application knowing that we were not in a position to deal with them.  I shall consider carefully the Deputy's suggestion that perhaps applications made to the Land Commission under these sections might be filed away and acknowledged, even though we may not be in a position to deal with them at present.  I think that in a good many cases in which these people have written in, they have been informed that note has been taken of the matter and that we may assume that the question will be taken up as soon as the emergency situation <Col N="442" /> is ended.  I shall look into the matter specially, however, and see whether we cannot have a regular plan, if there is not a regular system in operation already by which applications of that nature are noted for future consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell referred to the case of Mr. Robert Lambert, who has been provided with a holding on the Smith estate at Rathfarnham.  He wanted to know if Mr. Lambert has a pension of nearly £300 per annum, and if his wife also has a pension.  I understand that he and his wife have pensions. His pension, I am informed, amounts to £67 and his wife's to £52 10s.  Of course, the fact that a man has a military service certificate does not mean that he is excluded from eligibility where he would be otherwise eligible in the case of schemes for the division of land.  Quite the contrary&mdash; in each category of ex-employees, landless men or uneconomic holders, as I think the House knows, ex-I.R.A. men receive preference.  They will not receive preference over those in a prior class, but they will receive preference over others who may not have I.R.A. service in their own class.  I am informed that this allottee is carrying on his business satisfactorily having regard to his circumstances. There are no buildings on the place which he has been given, and the inspector's report goes to show that he is carrying out a good amount of tillage and doing everything possible to utilise his land satisfactorily.  So far as the Land Commission are concerned, they have, I think, no grievance on that score, according to the reports we have received.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan wants the Land Commission to take over land, even if the staff is not there to divide it, keeping it on hands and letting it in conacre.  It is true that that was the custom in the West of Ireland, and, although at present many uneconomic holders would be quite glad to get conacre, in the end I think, as experience has shown, they would be very dissatisfied indeed if the Land Commission were to hold land in conacre for a very considerable period of years. There seemed to be general dissatisfaction <Col N="443" /> in the West of Ireland with the Congested Districts Board by reason of their having pursued that policy during the last war.  The object of the Land Commission is to divide land with a minimum of delay after acquisition.  The ideal would be to acquire to-day and divide to-morrow, and I fear that no other plan except that of maximum expedition will be found to satisfy those concerned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy would also like us to increase grants for house building and to go back to the old Congested Districts Board system of direct building by the Department for the tenants. In the old Congested Districts Board days, the grants given by that body represented the only avenue by which the tenants could reconstruct their dwelling houses, and at present the situation is entirely different.  We have a housing code and we have different Departments, including particularly the Department of Local Government, giving grants for housing. There is a certain anomaly in the Land Commission giving grants, particularly where the grants are at the higher rate than those given by other Departments when the same class of beneficiary is involved, and I fear it would be out of the question for the Land Commission to go back to the old system.  We must have regard&mdash;I am afraid it is inescapable&mdash;to what is being done by other Departments, and, in our scheme of grants, we must pay attention to the amounts being given by other Departments.</P>
    <P>I explained to Deputy Cogan that the Land Commission have made no rule against giving land to unmarried applicants.  What we have done is to insist that bachelor allottees will get married within a year and, more recently, within two years.  Owing to the emergency difficulties and the fact that our inspectors have not been able to get about, we have had to give the bachelors a little more latitude, but we do not intend by any means to allow them to escape.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so.  The future <Col N="444" /> will show.  Deputy Cogan seems to be under the impression that the Land Commission inspectors have no definite rules to work upon in the allocation of land.  They have, of course, very definite instructions, such as that uneconomic holders in the vicinity must get preference over landless men, that ex-employees must get preference over both classes and that in the case of landless men, if their claims are to be seriously considered, they must show that they are in a position to work the land.  They must have some means and must satisfy the inspector on that point.</P>
      <P>Deputy Nally wants to know why land which the Land Commission hold in County Mayo is not being divided. Nobody ought to know more about the work of the Land Commission in Mayo than Deputy Nally.  Not alone have the Land Commission done a great deal in Mayo, but it might be said by Deputies from other counties that Mayo has received exceptional treatment. Really it has not, on account of the fact that there are these enormous masses of rundale holdings there which have to be dealt with, but if land is being held, in nine cases out of ten, it is because the Land Commission are waiting for some other portions to fall into their hands so that they can complete the necessary rearrangement schemes.  It is being let, where that position arises, to the best advantage of the local people.</P>
      <P>I need scarcely go over the list of estates to which the Deputy referred. The tremendous amount of work which, he tells us, the Land Commission has not done, has evidently made the Deputy forget the huge amount of work that it has done in the matter of land division, migration to other areas, land improvements, housing, roads and drainage.  A huge amount of such work has been done.  Perhaps the Deputy had not by him the reply to a question which he put to me on the 9th December last.  In my reply I stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In County Mayo, the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board have acquired and divided a total area of approximately 317,000 acres of untenanted land, of which <Col N="445" /> 65,000 acres were acquired under the Land Acts, 1923-39, and 252,000 acres were on estates acquired by the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners under Acts prior to the Land Act of 1923.</P>
    <P>There are in hands for division lands acquired under the Land Acts, 1923-39, to the extent of about 11,750 acres (together with some undivided shares of commonage), of which only about 4,500 acres are arable.  Scarcely any arable land remains on hands in Congested Districts Board estates, but there is a considerable residue of mountain and turbary of little value and difficult to dispose of finally.  The precise area of such land is not readily available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was glad to have Deputy Bartley's commendation in connection with our migration scheme.  I can assure him that, so far as I am concerned, I shall do everything possible to see that that work is continued, and continued even at a greater rate, if circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon suggested that the roads made by the Land Commission should be maintained by somebody. The point is that the roads made by the Land Commission for their allottees are in just the same category as the houses, drains and fences which are also provided.  The Land Commission cannot undertake to maintain them and I think it is the duty of the local authority to take over these roads or, if not, the people, as has always been the custom.  The Land Commission have never undertaken to maintain them, and are not likely to do so in the future.  The people themselves, therefore, will have to endeavour to keep them up.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also stated that we are paying half the cost of the land which allottees are now getting, through the halved annuity.  The reason is that it would be extremely difficult to draw the line between the older and the newer tenants, and most of the allottees, whether migrants or landless men or ex-employees, would find it very difficult to pay the full annuity.  The help that we are giving them is to enable them to work their lands properly. <Col N="446" /> They do not come from, or cannot be compared with, that class which is able to buy land in the open market, and it is the policy of the Land Commission to assist them in this way.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin would like us to withdraw the Emergency Powers Order restricting operations and he said that we should continue proceedings, or withdraw, wherever we have notified the owner of our intention to inspect with a view to acquisition.  As I have already mentioned, the question arises whether we can do the work that we expected to do.  We are not in a position to do it at present, owing to the limitations I have mentioned, but as soon as we get our staff back we shall certainly try to clear up the arrears. I think there would be nothing gained by taking in hands new applications. It is unfortunate that we have cases in hands which we cannot bring to completion within a reasonable time.  Until we are in a position to do that, I think the House will recognise that it would be a serious blunder to open the door to entirely new cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn spoke about the amount of money that is being spent in County Kerry.  It is not really a question of spending money.  The Land Commission have taken over, as I have mentioned already, uncompleted work belonging to the Congested Districts Board.  They could not avoid that responsibility, because it was definitely placed upon them when the Congested Districts Board became amalgamated with the Land Commission.  The problem of congestion is not at all in the same category in County Kerry as in other western counties.  We cannot spend money on land improvement in County Kerry in the same way as in Donegal, Mayo and Galway, because we have not the same conditions, the same problems, and the same responsibilities. If there is some other way in which useful schemes can be promoted, such as by the extension and development of turbary work, I am sure the Commissioners will be very glad to do what they can to see that employment is provided in rural areas and that useful work is done.  But there is no use in saying that it is merely a matter of spending money.  It <Col N="447" /> is not.  All this money is spent on reproductive work.  As I have already mentioned, we have not always got the co-operation that we would wish.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan complains that allottees have to repay advances for buildings which have not been constructed. That is in accordance with the usual procedure.  The tenant begins to pay back his advance from the date of his agreement.  The advance is there to his credit and he is repaying it with every instalment.  When he signed the agreement he definitely promised and undertook to build a house, and for that purpose the Commissioners granted him a loan and, therefore, he is legally bound under the system to repay that as from the date of the agreement.  Sometimes tenants are not willing to build; sometimes they have difficulties in completing these obligations, but, if you had not the present system, they would, of course, be relieved of their obligations altogether.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton complained that the work of the Land Commission has destroyed national credit.  He tells us that no bank will lend money on the security of land, because a visit from a Land Commission inspector may at any moment deprive the farmer of his asset in his land.  I think that point was very well met by Deputy Brennan, who said that he doubted very much whether the position was that farmers could not get credit from the banks, and who suggested that it was not always to the advantage of the farmer, as experience after the last war showed, to get unlimited credit.  What injures the credit position is that land is not a realisable asset.  The Land Commission and the banks realise that, and the public generally realise it.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned that the Land Commission were pressing annuitants who were in arrears.  Of course, the figures I have given show that there has been a considerable improvement in the arrears situation. Where those in arrears make any reasonable offer it will, of course, be considered.  We have a great many chronic cases where it has been impossible to collect any <Col N="448" /> annuities since 1933, and when the House remembers that arrears were wiped out in 1933 they will appreciate the truth of what I say, that a good many of these chronic cases, in fact, have not paid any annuities since 1923.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin referred to local action which immediately follows on the announcement of a holding being for sale and said that in many cases all sections combine in passing a resolution that the sale be stopped and that the Land Commission should take over the land.  I am afraid that there has been too much of that kind of thing through the country and I should like to say that, in spite of the fact that it is quite understandable that small-holders and landless men should want to get land, when they are very badly off and when they see that huge profits can be made, and are prepared to pay high rents for these holdings, we have to be careful that we are not doing anything to encourage any kind of lawless agitation, and I would appeal to Deputies not to associate themselves with any agitation of that kind.  If an owner of land wants to sell his land, there is nothing in the law of this country to prevent him from doing so.  He may have good reasons of his own for selling the land, and, as I have frequently had to say in reply to demands of such a kind, the Land Commission have no power to interfere with or block such a sale. In many cases, the land concerned would not interest the Land Commission, while in other cases it has to be admitted that in normal times it would interest the Land Commission, but even in the congested districts agitations and illegalities of the kind referred to&mdash;destroying fences, interfering with auctions or sales in the case of people who are selling or letting their land &mdash; not alone does that not encourage the Land Commission to take action, even if action could be taken&mdash;it cannot be taken at present because we are not undertaking any new commitments&mdash;but even if we were proceeding entirely on a normal basis and were absolutely free to go ahead with the matter, the House can take it from me that the reaction of the Land Commission in regard to agitations <Col N="449" /> of that kind is not to take any action whatever.</P>
    <P>There is a constitutional way of pursuing this matter, and it can be brought to the attention of the Land Commission through the proper channels, but no encouragement should be given to local parties who want to create agitation.  When normal times return, the Land Commission will acquire land where that is necessary. That is their policy, particularly in connection with the relief of congestion. Immediately normal conditions return, the Land Commission will concentrate their energies on that, but illegal action is not going to help anybody and it certainly is not going to induce the Land Commission to take action which in any case they might not think it wise to take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a question, to which he did not advert at all, and that is what consideration, if any, has been given to the carrying out of experiments in co-operative farming?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the matter has not been considered.  The policy on which the Land Commission is working at present would have to be changed entirely so as to enable lands to be given by them for that purpose. Last year I mentioned that the Minister for Agriculture had set up a committee of experts to look into the agricultural position, and if their findings have a bearing, as they may very well have, on Land Commission policy, then I am sure that the Land Commission will reconsider the position.  I have no information whatever about experiments of the kind the Deputy has referred to, and I do not know that they are in operation.  There is a great deal of theorising going on, but when the war is over the plans may be entirely different from what some of the present theorists expect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have another question to put to the Minister.  Where the Land Commission are dividing up a large estate, is any consideration given at any time to the organisation of land in the immediate vicinity? Take the case of a man who owns a <Col N="450" /> farm of land at a considerable distance from his parent holding, is any effort made to avail of the opportunity of providing him with a holding that would be more economical, when a big parcel of land is available for division in his neighbourhood?  Do you go outside the area to consider what problems are involved, or would the Minister consider it wise that the Land Commission should concern themselves with that aspect of land ownership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that these two matters&mdash;not alone co-operative farming but the matter to which the Deputy has referred of the conditions in the area generally from the agricultural point of view&mdash;are probably matters for the Department of Agriculture. As I have already indicated, Land Commission policy may very well be affected by changes in agricultural policy, but it would be a great mistake for the Land Commission, even if they were in a position at present to carry out inquiries, to embark on big changes until they know what plans we are going to make for agriculture in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister realises that the question of land ownership and land division is very important in our land economy, and that when an opportunity exists, as a result of the division of a big estate&mdash; possibly, the only opportunity that can be availed of in a district&mdash;to adjust such problems, that is the time to adjust them so as to enable holdings to be worked more economically?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must feel that persons interested in these problems, and who believe in them, ought to be in a position to deal with them themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us understand each other.  Supposing a farmer with a holding adjoining, contiguous to, or in the neighbourhood of a large estate in which the Land Commission are interested makes representations that he has two holdings, and that the outside one is not economically placed from the point of view of working it properly, is such a position examined <Col N="451" /> at any time by the Land Commission? He is prepared to surrender the outside holding provided that he gets land from the estate which is to be divided, and which would be more convenient for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>If the holding is beneficial for Land Commission purposes and would improve the position of small holders in the vicinity, then it is quite possible to arrange for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is not generally examined?</P>

    <P>Do réir mar atá an cogadh ag dul i bhfad, tá obair na foraoiseachta ag eirghe níos deacra.  Síolta, oirnéisí agus abhair sconnsa, tá siad go léir ag eirghe níos deacra d'fháil.  Do féachadh le líonradh miotal-shreinge d'fháil o Aimeiriceá; agus gidh go bhfuaireamar roinnt áirithe, níl fáil againn fá láthair ar chuid dá bhfuil ceannuithe againn cheana féin.  Do rinneadh iarratas oifigiúil mar gheall ar sin, ach ní heol dúinn go fóill ciaca <Col N="452" /> bhéas toradh ar an iarratas nó nach mbeidh.  Níl aon chosúlacht ann go mb'fhéidir níos mó a cheannach, agus, mar sin de, caithfear tuilleadh laghduithe do dhéanamh ar na scéimeanna planntála go dtí go n-athruighidh an staid ina bhfuil an saoghal.  Táthar ag déanamh díchill leis an laghdú sin do sheachaint chomh maith agus is féidir; ach ní bheadh ann ach ag cur airgid amú bheith ag gabháil do phlanntáil nach mbeadh a sáith de chosaint aici ar choiníní agus ar ainmhithe eile.  Ar an abhar sin, caithfear teacht le planntáil na n-áiteach ar baineadh na crainn díobh le goirid agus a bhfuil sconnsaí ina dtimcheall cheana.</P>
    <P>Gidh gur deacair síolta d'fháil, níl sin ag cur cúil ar an bplanntáil fá láthair, ach beidh faoi cheann dhá bhlian nó trí.  Tá roinnt deacrachta ag baint le soláthar síolta Aimeireacánacha ar na gnáth-bhealaighe, ach táthar ag súil le oiread de bhuaidh d'fháil ar sin agus go bhfuighfear réasúntacht, ar a laghad, dá bhfuil ag teastáil ón Roinn.</P>
    <P>Mórán de na bealaighe inar gnáthach síolta ón Eóraip d'fháil, tá siad dúnta fá láthair; ach táthar ag féachaint leis an easbaidh d'fháil as an Eilbhéis, as an bPortuingéil, nó as an Spáinn.  Ina theannta sin, tá ullmhú déanta ag an Roinn chun níos mó síolta do bhailiú i gcoillte feiliúnacha de chuid na tíre seo.  Ní féidir, ámhthach, sin do dhéanamh ach le cineálacha áirithe crann; agus ní gach bliain a thig síol ar na cineálacha sin féin.  Rud eile, is éigean bheith cúramach agus gan síol do thógaint de chrainn atá mí-fholláin, nó mionda, nó mí-chumtha.</P>
    <P>I gcomórtas leis an soláthar le haghaidh na bliadhna 1942-43, tá £42,771 de laghdú ar an meastachán seo. Baineann an laghdú le dhá chineál oibre: (1) tógaint nuadh-thalmhan, agus (2) leanúint don obair in áiteacha do bhí idir lámha againn cheana. Maidir leis an laghdú i geás nuadh-thalmhan, ní hionann é agus gur mian leis an Roinn níos lugha talmhan do ghlacadh ar láimh.  Is amhlaidh atá deacracht níos mó ann ná mar do bhíodh maidir le talamh a mbaineann cearta coitcheanna inghilte léi; agus, <Col N="453" /> ina theannta sin, tá Coimisiún na Talmhan ag stad go sealadach de thógaint eastát a mbeadh an Roinn Foraoiseachta ag súil le scaracha réasúnta díobh do theacht faoi n-a seilbh féin.</P>
    <P>An fuigheall cuibheasach mór de airgead atá fágtha sa gCiste chun Talmhan do Thógaint agus an £30,000 atáthar d'iarraidh anois, is dócha gur leor iad le haghaidh gach íocaíochta dá mbeidh le déanamh sa mbliain airgeadais seo chugainn.  Táthar ag tógaint oiread agus is féidir de thalamh sa gcaoi go mbeifear i ndon cuid mhór sa mbreis de phlanntáil do dhéanamh nuair a rachas an saoghal chun socrachta arís.</P>
    <P>Ar iarratas na Roinne Soláthairtí, tá brainnse na Foraoiseachta tar éis tosnú ar áireamh do dhéanamh ar a bhfuil fágtha ina seasamh de chrainn sa tír, agus is éigean cuid mhaith de na Cigirí do choinneáil i mbun na hoibre sin.  Gach giota de thalamh chrannach a bhfuil ós cionn dhá acra go leith ann, déanfar a scrúdú agus a rangú do réir cineáil, cáilíochta agus tiughais.  Ina theannta sin, toghfar an oiread seo de bhailte fearainn chun a gcuid crann d'áireamh, agus, do réir an áirimh sin, measfar cadé an líon crann atá ar fud na tíre i gcoillíní, i bhfálta agus in ionaid scartha eile. Nuair a bhéas an t-áireamh go léir críochnuithe, beidh caoi ag an Riaghaltas a mheas cad is cóir a dhéanamh maidir le n-a thuilleadh toirmeasc do chur ar leagan agus ar dhíol crann, ionnas go gcoimeádfar lón le haghaidh na riachtanas is mó gádh don náisiún. Ní beag ná ní furas obair an áirimh sin go léir, agus cuireann sí cuid mhór de obair bhreise ar fhoirinn teicniceach na Foraoiseachta&mdash;go háirithe ós rud é go bhfuil ortha, san am chéanna, aire do thabhairt don líon an-mhór de Fhógraí Leagain atá ag teacht isteach go laethúil fá láthair.  Cho fada agus is féidir é, tá an dá chineál sin oibre á ndéanamh i dteannta a chéile.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an soláthar atá riachtanach faoi na Fó-mhírchinn, do réir mar tá luaidhte sna meastacháin chlóbhuailte, séard is mian liom gan bacaint le mion-chuntas ach amháin i gcás na neithe a bhfuil difríocht cuibheasach mór idir iad féin agus na neithe bhí sa Vóta don bhliain 1942-43.</P>

Níor bhféidir dul ar aghaidh le ceannacht na n-eastát mór crannach do bhí beartuithe againn, bliain is an taca seo.  Gheobhaimid na heastáit sin amach anseo; ach, idir an dá linn, is fearr leis na húnaeir a mbealach deighleála féin do bheith aca ar an méid de na crainn nach bhfuil riachtanach le haghaidh foscaidh nó síolruithe.  Dá dheascaibh sin, do cuireadh ceannacht na n-eastát chun moille, agus laghdófar a gcéadphraghas tré luach na gcrann atá á mbaint díobh agus á ndíol.  Meastar go mbeidh £48,000 de fhuigheall le tabhairt ar aghaidh go dtí an bhliain airgeadais seo chughainn, rud is ionann agus £78,000 do bheith ar fáil chun talamh do cheannacht sa mbliain sin. As an suim sin airgid, do coimeádfaí tuairim is £21,128 do cheannach 7,543 acra a bhfuil socair cheana féin ag an Roinn iad do cheannach ó n-a húnaeir, agus do coimeádfaí £17,763 mar phraghas talmhan is dócha do bheith le fáil ó Choimisiún na Talmhan.  Ina theannta sin, táthar ar aghaidh go maith sa deighleáil bhaineas le 5,716 acra do cheannacht ó únaeir phríobháideacha ar chostas £21,144, agus táthar ag féachaint ar bhfhéidir socrú chun ceannachta do dhéanamh le Coimisiún na Talmhan i dtaobh 3,381, nó mar sin, de acraí a bhfuil £9,010 measta mar luach dóibh.  Féadfa sé, dar ndóigh, go mbeifear ag pléidhe le <Col N="455" /> tairgsiona eile, taobh amuigh díobh sin, sa mbliain atá romhainn.  Cé's moite de bheagán de achair mhóra, níl 100 acra féin de mheadhon-achar sna píosaí atá á dtairgsint chun díola ag únaeir phríobháideacha; agus, mar gheall ar a leithéid sin, is obair fhadálach dheacair í talamh d'fháil sa geaoi go mbeadh sé ina phíosaí sáthach mór le foraoiseacht do dhéanamh gan an iomarca caiteachais.</P>
    <P>Is mór ba mhian leis an Roinn seilbh d'fháil ar limistéir mhóra de thalamh sléibhe atá níos feiliúnaighe don bhforaoiseacht ná d'fhéarach ná a leithéid; ach tá cuid mhaith de na limistéir seo faoi ualach de chearta coitcheanna inghilte, agus is rídheacair&mdash;más féidir ar chor ar bith é &mdash;aontú d'fháil ó lucht na gceart sin go léir chun iad do dhíol ar shuim réasúnta airgid.</P>

Sa séasúr atá ann fá láthair, táthar ag súil go gcríochnócfar 4,273 acraí.  Is eagal liom nach mbeifear i ndon an oiread sin do dhéanamh sa séasúr seo chugainn; óir, mura bhfaghthar damhna sconnsa as Aimeiriceá, caithfear gan planntáil ar bith do dhéanamh ach amháin sna háiteacha ar baineadh na crainn díobh le goirid agus a bhfuil sconnsaí ina dtimcheall cheana.  Dá réir sin, is cosúil nach fada go gcaithtear obair na planntála do laghdú tuilleadh.  B'ionann sin agus cuid de na hoibrithe d'fhágáil díomhaoin, ach táthar ag ullmhú le n-a aghaidh sin, agus féachfar le obair do thabhairt dóibh ag tanú na n-óg-chrann, ag déanamh bóthar, agus ag leagan díogha na sean-chrann le n-a ndíol mar chonnadh sa gcomhursanacht.  Is an-tairbheach an obair í tanú na n-óg-chrann, óir bíonn an choill i bhfad níos luachmhaire i ndeireadh <Col N="456" /> báire dá dheascaibh.  Táthar, fá láthair, ag tanú crann do planntáileadh so tréimhse 1922-27, nó mar sin&mdash; tuairim is 1,500 acra.  Féadtar bheith ag súil go mbeadh ós cionn 2,500 acra den chineál sin ann faoi cheann chúig mblian eile, agus go mbeidh tuilleadh agus 3,500 acra ann faoi cheann deich mblian.  Do réir mar fhásfas an obair seo, is cinnte go méadófar an obair bhaineas le díolacháin, agus le hullmhú na n-óg-chrann ina gconnadh agus ina stácaí sconnsa, agus rl.  Is mór a rachas an chuid seo den bhforaoiseacht i méid faoi cheann tamaill eile de bhlianta.

Ní thig athrú mór ar bith, ó bhliain go bliain, ar an méid sa chéad a planntáiltear de gach cineál fá leith.  Fá thuairim 88 per cent. a bhíos na crainn chírneacha.  Crainn leathan-duilleacha an t-iarmhar&mdash;Dair, Fuinnseog agus Feagha sa mhór-chuid. Maidir leis na crainn chíríneacha, bíonn na Spriúsanna (Nor-bhuaidheach agus Sitka) fá thuairim 30 per cent.; bíonn na Learóga (Iartharach agus Seapánach) fá thuairim 20 per cent., agus Ciréis (Albanach sa bhfurmhór) an chuid eile.

Thiocfadh leis an mhuintir ar leo na crainn cuidiú leis an Roinn agus leo féin mar an gcéanna, dá marcáladh siad go soléir na crainn a ba mhaith leo a leagan.  Nuair a thig Cigire na Roinne, is minic a thárluigheas sé fá láthair nach mbíonn marcáil ar bith déanta ar na crainn atá le leagan agus nach mbíonn duine ar bith le fáil leis na crainn sin do thaisbeáint dó.</P>
    <P>Ordú do cuireadh amach, ar iarratas ón Roinn Chosanta, go luath anuraidh, do thoirmisc sé, ach amháin i bhfochásanna áirithe, crainn ar bith a leagan taobh istigh de thriochaid troigh ó lár aon bhóthair mhóir nó bóithrín.  Baineann riarú an Orduithe seo leis an Roinn Dlighidh agus Cirt, ach tá Brainnse na Foraoiseachta ag có-oibriú agus ag déanamh díchill nach dtugtar cead faoi'n Acht Foraoiseachta crann ar bith do leagan dá mbeadh faoi'n toirmeasc seo atá ráite agam.

Ní hé amháin nach bhfuil líonradh in aghaidh coinín le fáil ag únaeir na talmhan, ach níl lón sáthach mór de phlanntaí oiriúnacha ag gach dream díobh siúd a ghníos plantaí d'oiliúin le n-a ndíol. Mar sin de, is minic a b'éigean don Roinn aontú go gcuirfí ar gcúl a leithéid d'athphlanntáil.  Ach tugtar rabhadh do lucht ceadúnas nach bhfuil an cur-ar-gcúl sin ach sealadach. <Col N="459" /> Déanfar aithbhreathnú ar gach cás aca seo nuair a rachas an saoghal chun socrachta, agus cuirfear an dlí ar gach duine nach gcólíonfaidh na coingheallacha a bhaineas leis na ceadúnais a tugadh dóibh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>One can appreciate the difficulties under which the Forestry Department is labouring at the present time, and it would be unreasonable to expect that there could be during the emergency even a maintenance of the acreage planted in 1936, 1937 and 1938, not to speak of an expansion of the programme.  Up to that time there was a slow but steady improvement in every year.  At the present time with the amount of land devoted to forestry the shortage of essential materials, the difficulty of procuring seeds and in maintaining nursery stocks, of course it is a physical impossibility to have any expansion of the programme. Even if the trees were there, when we have not the necessary wire and fencing materials to keep out vermin and to prevent trespass, it would be ridiculous to plant without that necessary protection.  As I said before, no one could reasonably expect any expansion of the forestry programme during the emergency or until the essential materials are again available in the post-war period.  However, I would suggest to the Minister that that should not prevent the acquisition of whatever lands are suitable for the purposes of planting.  There is no doubt that this country will have to face in the post-war period an acute problem of unemployment.  Thousands of people have gone across to Great Britain during the past few years and the vast majority of them will, I suppose, inevitably return to this country during a period of difficulty and depression in the post-war years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be making our plans now to carry us through a period of that <Col N="460" /> kind.  Here is an avenue opened up, if we had all the land that we could acquire at the present time available to carry out an extended planting programme in the post-war period. For that reason I would impress upon the Minister the desirability and necessity of acquiring to the fullest extent all the land it is possible to acquire in the interregnum between now and the post-war period.  I am one of those who are not inclined to exaggerate the value of forestry or of a big scheme of afforestation for this country because I feel that we should not plant lands that are suitable for other purposes.  Lands that are suitable for food production in any form should not in my opinion be planted; in other words, land on which men can live and maintain families should not be devoted to the production of timber.  In the long run, no matter how attractive it may appear to some people from the national standpoint, the production of timber on such land will not prove more profitable.</P>
    <P>There are just one or two questions I should like to ask the Minister. There is first the question of felling notices.  I have got a number of complaints in the past year in regard to the delay in issuing felling licences.  I can appreciate the difficulty with which the Department is confronted there.  The number of inspectors the Minister has at his command is limited and there has been a huge increase in the volume of applications for permission to fell trees.  Then there is the transport problem.  All these factors tend to operate against the expeditious issue of licences, but in our difficult situation, with an acute shortage of commercial timber, it is desirable and essential that the issue of permits for the felling of timber to be used for commercial purposes should be expedited.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us some figures with regard to timber conversion, and mentioned the amount that is being turned out by the forestry section of his Department, particularly in firewood. He mentioned that 12,000 tons of firewood had been prepared mainly for the Dublin Corporation and Fuel <Col N="461" /> Importers, Ltd., and he said that 6,000 tons had been handled in the counties Wicklow and Wexford by four fixed mills and ten portable crosscutting outfits.  Does that mean that there are no circular saws in operation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There are portable saws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there no portable circular saws?  However, it does not matter very much.  The Minister does not give us any idea of the quantity of commercial timber handled during the year for conversion purposes.  I think it is an opportune time to utilise to the fullest extent whatever mature timber we have.  I think it is well to handle it at a time when it is at its maximum value.  We should not hesitate to use that timber now that the market is favourable.  We should not hold it for use in the post-war period when we can import timber again at a price that would not be attractive from our point of view.  While it might appear, on the face of it, that we are making fairly substantial inroads on the amount of timber we have at the present time we should remember that this war will have an ending some time and between this and the termination of the war we should not hesitate to avail to the fullest extent of whatever mature timber we have. On the question of timber for fuel purposes there does appear to be a very great demand for timber even for the City of Dublin.  Reading through the Minister's statement here, we are led to believe that local demand is catered for as well.  In fact I have had complaints from County Kildare, from the Celbridge Parish Council, that their efforts to procure fuel for their people have been hampered by the fact that they cannot get any fuel locally.  While there are different woods there owned by the Forestry Department, the fuel goes to the Dublin Corporation and Fuel Importers, Limited, and the local people are not given an opportunity of getting any supply.  I should like the Minister to look into that matter, and at least make some quantity of fuel available to the parish council.  The Government has given every encouragement to the setting up of parish councils <Col N="462" /> throughout the country for the purpose of dealing with problems of this sort, and where we have parish councils anxious to function in the interests of their people they are entitled to some consideration and some co-operation.</P>
      <P>We are told that a very considerable portion of the money spent on salaries and allowances relates to this woodland survey.  I think that is a step in the right direction.  A survey of that sort will give us a lot of very useful information, and I think it would be desirable to have many other surveys of that type at the earliest possible moment.  I believe that is the system by which we should approach this problem of the provision of our requirements in timber.  By that means we would get the whole picture right away; we would know the condition of our forests at the moment, what has been achieved, and what can be done in the future.  The Minister informed us that, where private woods had been cleared out, it is not possible at the moment to insist on replanting, because the necessary young stock is not there.  I suppose if the stock is not there we cannot insist upon replanting, but those things should not be lost sight of, and I am sure they are not being lost sight of.  Similarly, in the case of those forests and woods under the control of the Department, restocking ought to be done at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>Molaimse an Vóta seo.  Vóta é a bhfuil tábhacht mór don Stát ann.  Isé mo thuairimse nach bhfuil ár ndóthain déanta againn ar aon chor, ná baol air, le adhmad a chur ag fás le haghaidh teine.  Is léir agus is soiléir anois go bhfuil adhmad de dhíth orrainn le haghaidh teine agus go mbeidh an díth adhmaid sin orrainn an fhad a mhairfeas an éigeandáil seo. Is cuimhin liom duine eile bhí ina Aire i bhfeighil na Roinne seo á rá ná raibh adhmad ag teastáil uainn cho géar agus theastuíos sé san Euróip.  Níl an tuairim sin ceart indiu.  Ag dul i méid o lá go lá atá a dteastuíonn uainn d'adhmad sna bailte móra agus sna cathracha.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember, when another Minister was in charge of this Department and <Col N="463" /> we were pressing for more money to be spent on forestry, that particular Minister indicated to us that, unlike other countries in Europe, we were not dependent on timber for fuel.  He said that in France and other countries, where they go in extensively for forestry, they do so because a big quantity of that timber is used for fuel.  Now, owing to the emergency, timber is being used more and more for fuel purposes, and that is a very good reason why more money should be provided for the growing of timber. I should like to get a comparison between the acreage planted and the acreage cut down in providing fuel for the cities and towns.  If we are not planting quickly enough we should speed matters up.  I am not one of those who believe that we have unlimited peat resources in this country. That is a farce.  This emergency has shown that the bogs are being cut away very rapidly.  With the county councils cutting miles of turf, one can see the bogs being exhausted in the near future.  That should be an incentive to the Forestry Department to go on with their afforestation, particularly with the growing of wood suitable for fuel.</P>
    <P>I believe that charcoal is the coming thing for motor traction.  I am not one of those who believe that there are, in the bowels of the earth, limitless reserves of petrol and the oils from which petrol is derived, and that those will go on for ever.  I think that is only a temporary phase in traction, and that we will eventually have to go on to charcoal.  The growing of wood suitable for charcoal, like laurel, should be developed by the Forestry Department, as I believe that suitable engines will eventually be constructed to consume this wood charcoal.  I am not minimising the work which the Department has done; they have done a considerable lot of good work in my county.  With regard to the matter of establishing forestry units, we should like to see them taking more definite shape.  Six hundred or 700 acres of wood have been planted in the north of my county, and the Department is supposed to be taking over large <Col N="464" /> estates.  I should like to see that forestry unit taking shape.  There should be an officer in charge in Mullingar, around which the forestry country lies.  I heard an Englishman from one of the biggest timber firms in England say that Westmeath, particularly in the district around Mullingar, is the best forestry country in Ireland, and it seems very strange that the officer in charge of Westmeath should reside in Navan where there is practically no timber at all.  The unit should be developed from Mullingar.  I previously advocated that we should have here something like the system which existed in Germany&mdash;that men should be trained at the university, should get a degree in forestry, and then be sent down as ordinary workmen to the State forests, studying there for three years the work of forestry, learning all about felling, sawing, planting, and so on, before being switched on to the more technical side of the work.  Only in that way will you make practical woodsmen in this country.  I do not know what has been done with regard to that matter, and I should like the Minister to give us some information.  That was the practice in England and particularly in the North of Scotland, some years before the war.  I think it originated in Germany, where the cult of afforestation is developed very highly and from whose basic ground-work the English learned a lesson that we should try to learn.  I am not taking from what the Department has done.  I should like in future to see a special Department for Forestry rather than that it should be an adjunct to the Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Department, like the Department of Lands, work is being held up to a considerable extent, and while there is a widespread demand for an extension of afforestation generally, nobody, I think, would urge the Minister to extend the area under afforestation or to extend the scope of the work at a time when materials are either very expensive or difficult to obtain and when there is a danger that even if seeds could be obtained, they might be inferior.  It is <Col N="465" /> far better to postpone that work until the period of emergency has passed. There is, however, quite a lot of useful work that the Department can do during the emergency and which, to a great extent, the Department is doing. During the last couple of years, very useful work has been done by the Department in providing firewood.  That work should be pushed on to the utmost extent.  The felling of mature timber must always form a part of the Department's activities, but in a time of emergency it is desirable that more timber should be felled than would be done in normal times.  In other words, if it is the settled policy of the Department to thin out woods to a certain extent or to remove timber which has matured, at a certain rate per annum, it is desirable to increase that rate during the period of emergency so as to provide the maximum amount of timber for firewood and commercial purposes and, if necessary, to slacken off the rate of felling in the post-war period.  I think ordinary common sense would indicate that course and I am sure it is the course that will be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During this period, when it is so difficult to proceed on a large scale with planting, fencing and drainage, it would be very desirable to check up on the work that has been done or, at any rate, to give the House and the country generally a clear statement of account of the progress which has been made.  The people generally would like to know the cost per acre of the land that has been planted and the estimated value of the mature timber produced per acre.  We have at the present time widespread demands for a very extensive increase in the area under afforestation.  We have at the same time counter claims by people engaged in agriculture, particularly in sheep-raising.  There is no doubt whatever that while timber is and will be in future a very valuable asset to this country, sheep-raising is also a valuable industry and the production of wool is a very important branch of our national activities which should rank as of equal importance as the production of timber for industrial purposes and for firewood.  For that reason, I <Col N="466" /> think it would be well if a clear statement were given as to the value of the work which has been done up to the present so that the House and the people generally would be able to form a definite idea as to whether or not the policy of afforestation should be very substantially extended.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that the work of the Department in the acquisition of land for the purpose of planting is surrounded with enormous difficulties. We know that an afforestation unit to be economic must be of considerable size for the purposes of supervision, drainage and fencing.  That always raises a problem in dealing with lands which are suitable for afforestation but which are also suitable for agricultural purposes.  There is no doubt that serious complaints have been made in many areas in regard to the acquisition by the Forestry Department of land which is eminently suitable for agricultural purposes.  There is no doubt whatever that very large areas of good arable land have been planted during the past ten or twelve years and it is a question as to whether or not that policy should be continued.  I quite appreciate the difficulties of dealing with small patches of arable land in areas where the greater portion of the land is suitable for planting and it is very difficult to isolate a small area and at the same time deal with the problem of fencing the area to be planted and of avoiding trespass and other inconvenience.</P>
    <P>I think this is a problem to which the Minister and his Department should direct their attention during this period in which there is a lull in the general work of planting.  They should find out how this problem has been dealt with in other countries where it has arisen.  As far as I can see, there are in every townland in the country very small areas which are eminently suitable for planting and which are suitable for no other purpose, but, with the present administrative machinery, it is impossible to deal with these areas.  I am anxious to know if the Department have considered the question of dealing with such small areas.  I know, of course, that there is provision for grants to <Col N="467" /> farmers to carry out this work and I would like the Minister when replying to let us know how far these grants have been availed of.  I know from personal knowledge that there is a very large amount of land in the country, in small areas, which could be planted and which, notwithstanding the provision of these grants, no attempt has been made to plant.  I should like if the Minister could find some way of getting over that difficulty. I do not know whether or not it has been surmounted in other countries.  Naturally, the planting of timber on anything approaching a large scale is not attractive as far as farmers are concerned.  The average farmer cannot very well afford to look 30 or 40 years ahead or, at any rate, the average farmer is not inclined to do so.  It is not likely that timber would mature in 30 or 40 years and it is too long a period for the average farmer to look ahead.  Even with the grants that are available, I think there is not much likelihood of a large number of farmers availing of the grants.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Minister's work in this Department which deeply concerns farmers and that is the question of labour.  The forestry Department may be looked upon as a reservoir in which there is a considerable amount of labour employed which would be suitable for agricultural purposes during the busy seasons of the year.  I think it should be the policy of the Department to make this labour available during the harvest season.  In other words, to let men go from the forestry Department during the harvest season if they are required by farmers.  I think that would be a great help to the agricultural community generally.  This would not cause any difficulty whatever to the Department.  It would only mean suspending work for a few weeks, but the result would be of immense benefit to the farmers in those areas.</P>
    <P>I think that the work which has been done by the Department, particularly in my constituency, has been very efficiently carried out.  Vast areas <Col N="468" /> have been planted and the timber is showing good progress.  Drainage, fencing, and the protecting of those plantations have been very efficiently carried out.  This emergency has brought home to the minds of every section of the community the value of timber both as a fuel and as a raw material for industry.  I think it is desirable that the fullest investigation should be made into every possible avenue by which the work of the Department can be extended with the elimination of particular activities of the Department which do not appear to be justified.  It is only by bringing the Department up to the highest standard of efficiency that we can hope to be in a position to extend its work to that degree which the situation would appear to demand.  Any work of this kind which has behind it the finances of the State or of the taxpayer is difficult to check up upon because it cannot be judged by the ordinary standards which apply to private enterprise.  For that reason, the public should be given a profit and loss account by which they could ascertain the profit which had been returned to the community on the money expended over a period of years.  That would be in the interests of the forestry Department and of the country generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes referred to some points which I mentioned in my opening statement, the first and most important being the acquisition of land.  I should like to assure the House that the Forestry Branch is doing everything possible to acquire new land for forestry.  I should also like to say, in reply to the Deputy, that everything possible will be done to attend promptly to felling notices. As regards the acquisition of land, last year the net area acquired was 9,645 acres, leaving the total area on hands approximately 165,500 acres.  As I have mentioned, while occasionally large blocks of land come into the hands of the Forestry Branch, as a rule only small portions are available.  Land is also getting far more expensive than it used to be.  The Forestry Branch has not increased the rate that it is prepared to pay and, therefore, we do <Col N="469" /> not find very many willing sellers of really good land for forestry purposes. Deputy Hughes seems to think that good land, or even land on which people could live, should not perhaps be made available for forestry.  Unless the Deputy and the country can be got to realise that this whole problem of afforestation in the future depends upon the rate of acquisition of land, and that a considerable reserve of land must be built up, sufficient, let us say, to cover a three years' programme, our efforts to attain the ideal that we have set before ourselves of supplying our entire requirements from our own resources will be pushed very far back. We want the co-operation of public men, of public authorities and of all those who are interested in afforestation work in bringing home to the public the importance of afforestation.</P>
      <P>The present crisis, as has been stated in the debate, has shown us that some of our most important industries, for example, the printing industry, depend to a very large extent on supplies of timber.  Then there is the question of housing.  We do not know how long the war may continue, and even when it is over there will be such a scarcity of materials for a period of years&mdash;the belligerents will be very anxious to get raw materials for building and constructional work in some of the devastated countries because it will probably take a generation to replace the damage that has been done&mdash;that our people should realise that we may not get raw materials, such as timber, very easily for a considerable period.  While stressing the need for public co-operation in helping us to secure timber in large blocks, if possible, I might mention that we already have 100 different centres throughout the country.  Unless we can link up these centres, or numbers of them, into one large centre, it is obvious that it will be very difficult to frame a programme where you will have equal progress in the acquisition of land in each of the 100 different centres, not to speak at all of the difficulties connected with your nursery programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain areas in the country that I am advised are particularly <Col N="470" /> suitable for forestry work, but the people in those areas do not appreciate its value and, even when land has been acquired legally and paid for, the local people often put obstacles in the way of forestry work, by claiming that they are entitled to certain grazing rights.  In Wicklow, for example, where forestry work is largely concentrated, there is probably a good appreciation amongst the people of its value in giving employment, but in other areas that is not the case.  I would like to impress upon Deputies who may be interested that there are counties like Waterford, Offaly, Tipperary and Cork, where very excellent work could be done, if only the land were available.  It will be impossible for us to get the big programme that we have in mind into operation for a good many years, unless we are able to build up this substantial reserve of land&mdash;say 30,000 acres&mdash;that I have spoken of.  That reserve at least would be necessary to carry out a yearly programme of, say, 12,000 or 15,000 acres.</P>
    <P>I would also like to issue a warning to the people generally that, under the Forestry Act of 1928, we must prosecute, and we are prosecuting very large numbers.  I must compliment the Gárda Síochána on the effective way in which they are seeing that the provisions of the Acts are carried out.</P>
    <P>Our resources of timber are limited. A very considerable amount of commercial timber has been felled.  The Forestry Branch sold about 250,000 cubic feet in 1941-42 and about 300,000 cubic feet in 1942-43, and from the stocks in private woods it is estimated that, in the past year, some 4,400,000 cubic feet have also been felled; so there is very substantial felling of commercial timber being carried on. While we have no representations as to specific instances where timber was not available for urgent purposes, it is obviously necessary, particularly as we do not know how long the present crisis may continue, to conserve our stocks of commercial timber.  It is still more necessary that the Forestry Branch should do so, as felling is going on in private woods at a greatly increased rate.  There is probably a great deal of felling, too, by individuals, <Col N="471" /> that has not come under notice.  On the Forestry Branch will rest the responsibility of seeing that an iron ration always is available, in case an urgent necessity should arise for timber requirements on a large scale from our own resources.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan has mentioned the question of commercial accounts.  The Department has been considering the matter, but so far it has not been possible to get the accounts into commercial form.  On the emergency basis, I am informed that the costs of planting would be about £21 per acre, made up as follows: Cost of planting, fencing and plants, £14; cost of land, £3; cost of over-heads and material, £4.  The scheme for the encouragement of planting by private owners only resulted in the planting of 330 acres in 1941-42, and about 400 acres in 1942-43.  I would appeal to farmers to take advantage of the scheme and to do more planting.  I feel that the nurseries will be in a position to supply them with their requirements in plants. By encouraging our farmers to do more by taking advantage of this scheme, we may spread a more proper reaslisation of the value of woods to our country.</P>
    <P>As regards parish councils, the Forestry Branch will try to facilitate them, provided that our commitments to the Department of Supplies, to see that fuel is made available for the larger centres, are not prejudiced thereby.  Wherever timber of a material suitable for firewood is available, I am sure the Forestry Branch will try to facilitate parish councils.</P>

      <Col N="472" /> The normal functioning of the Department of Industry and Commerce has been seriously disturbed by the circumstances of the emergency.  In ordinary times its main functions&mdash; placing them, not so much in the order of importance as in the order in which&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will excuse me, it is quite clear that Deputies are not aware that the Forestry Vote has been disposed of so soon.  I, therefore, direct the attention of the Chair to the fact that a quorum is not present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce can be classified under four main headings.  It is responsible for the stimulation and control of industrial development in all spheres and for the supervision of commercial activities to the extent necessary in the public interest or which is prescribed by law.  It is responsible also for the supervision and the control of public transport services by rail, road, sea and air, and for the administration of the law relating to these services. Thirdly, it is responsible for conciliation in industrial disputes and for the administration of legal safeguards of conditions of employment of workers. Fourthly, it administers the social services for the relief of unemployment. As I said, its normal working has been disturbed to some extent by the circumstances created by the emergency. Its function of industrial stimulation is, in fact, in abeyance except in so far as its activities have been directed towards examination of the possibility of producing at home materials which were previously imported or substitutes for those materials.  The Dáil, I think, is already familiar with the success of some of the efforts made to that end, and in that connection the work of the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau has borne good fruit in many important directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, the effect of <Col N="473" /> the war upon industrial employment has been less severe than we might originally have anticipated.  Certainly when in 1939 we were facing the war situation and trying to estimate the effect it would have upon economic and social conditions here, it was thought that there would be a much more substantial deterioration in industrial employment than in the event there has been.  That is due to a number of causes, partly to the success of the Department of Supplies in maintaining supplies of industrial materials; partly to the ingenuity shown by our manufacturers in adapting themselves to the new situation, and partly perhaps to the fact that our anticipations were gloomier than the circumstances justified.  Certainly there are very few Deputies who in 1939 could have expected that after four years of world war, with all the disturbance that world war involved in international trade and economic conditions generally, only a very small percentage of our industrial workers would have lost their employment. In the case of the industries which were classified in our statistics as protected industries, that is, those industries brought into existence here by the application of the Fianna Fáil industrial policy, the decline in employment has been comparatively slight.  The maximum number of workers employed at any time in those industries was 82,500.  In September of last year, the most recent date for which the figures are available, the number employed was 70,500.  In September, 1941, the number was 76,000. There has, of course, been a steady diminution in the total number employed, but it has been, I think, considerably less than might have been expected.  It is an interesting fact, which some Deputies may be pleased to know, that the number at present employed in these protected industries is still 39,000 greater than the number employed in them before the Fianna Fáil policy was applied to them.</P>
    <P>In some industries, however, because of the emergency, because of the greater opportunities given to them in the circumstances of the emergency, and the special efforts that had to be made to maintain their output by <Col N="474" /> every possible means, there has been an increase in employment recorded. The industrial groups in which that increase has been recorded are those which are classified, firstly, under the heading of manufacturers of wood; secondly, under the heading of manufactures of leather and leather goods, and, thirdly, under the heading of chemicals, fats, oils and fertilisers.  In each of these groups there was recorded in 1942 an increase in the number employed.  In certain cases the reason for that is easily understandable. Manufacturers of wood, which includes saw mills, have, of course, been busier than they might have been in normal times by reason of the elimination of certain imports of wooden goods which are no longer available, and the necessity for using wood as a substitute for other materials not now procurable. Similarly, in the manufacture of leather and goods made from leather, the emergency has caused us to rely almost entirely upon our own resources, with a consequent expansion of employment.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, also noteworthy that the decrease in employment which has occurred has been much more pronounced in the case of female workers than male workers.  In the case of male workers, the decrease in employment in 1942, as compared with 1941, was 4 per cent; in the case of female workers it was 8 per cent.  That, of course, is explainable by reason of the fact that the maximum employment of female workers was given in what ordinarily would be regarded as luxury industries, and these industries have, of course, been more seriously affected by the emergency than industries classified as essential.</P>
    <P>Although the work of the Department in the stimulation of industrial development has been curtailed, it has been replaced by an emergency function which is occupying a great deal of the time and attention of the Departmental staff.  It is the Department of Supplies which is responsible for procuring industrial materials from abroad, but in the main the Department of Industry and Commerce supervises the use made of these materials when procured and, where necessary, <Col N="475" /> rations them amongst industrial users. That work of regulating the use of available materials and of insuring their equitable distribution amongst those requiring them has necessitated the creation of special sections of the Department for the purpose.  No doubt it is in connection with that particular aspect of the Department's work that the Dáil may desire most keenly to have information, because, no matter how carefully it is discharged, inevitably there are individuals who feel that they have not received the proportion of the available supplies to which they consider themselves entitled or that the distribution arrangements in force are not working in their interest.</P>
    <P>I would not attempt to give in detail an account of the arrangements made in respect of all the materials controlled by the Department, but there are materials which are of outstanding importance to which I should like to make some reference.  In the case of cement, during the past year a situation of great seriousness threatened to arise.  In July, 1942, it appeared for a time as if a very drastic reduction in the use of cement would have to be enforced and that future output would be seriously curtailed, if not stopped altogether.  In that situation, an order was made bringing the distribution and use of cement under official control, and steps were taken to confine the available supplies to the purposes which were considered most essential in the public interest.  That drastic control over the sale and use of cement was maintained for a period, but, following upon arrangements made by the Department of Supplies, an increased production occurred which made possible a relaxation of the control.</P>
    <P>It can be said now that, contrary to our expectations, the quantity of cement being produced is sufficient to meet the country's needs.  The control exercised over its sale and use has been relaxed considerably, but is still being maintained, in agreement with the cement manufacturers, for the purpose of having in existence the machinery which will permit of a rapid tightening of the control, should the supply position deteriorate again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We made arrangements to ensure that there would be diverted to cement production coal which otherwise would have been used for some other purpose.  At the time that control was imposed upon the sale and use of cement, a similar control was brought into operation over the sale and use of asbestos cement goods. Again, there has been an improvement in the production position which has made possible the suspension of that control in its entirety.  The present prospect is that the output of asbestos cement goods for the immediate future will be sufficient to meet current requirement.  I cannot say that that situation will continue indefinitely, but it is deemed unnecessary to maintain at present the control which we exercised last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another industrial material which has been the subject of many questions in the Dáil is explosives.  An adequate supply of explosives is necessary for the maintenance of a very large number of industrial activities.  It affects the output, not merely of the cement factories to which I have referred, slate quarries and other important industries giving a great deal of employment, but also the nature and extent of the public works which can be undertaken by Government Departments for <Col N="477" /> the relief of unemployment.  During the course of last year, the total supply of explosives available to us was somewhat less than 50 per cent. of the supply we normally use.  It became necessary, therefore, to ensure that a strict supervision should be exercised over the use of explosives. The total supply available was allocated in specific quantities to the users who were regarded as of primary importance.</P>
    <P>Many representations have been made by individual firms for an increase in their allocation, but such increase could not be given, except at the expense of other firms regarded as of equal or greater importance from the point of view of the general national interest, and, while these representations have been made and sometimes supported in the Dáil.  I think it is true to say that there has been a general agreement as to the fairness of the basis of allocation decided upon.  The same basis of allocation has been maintained this year.  What the supply position will be is, of course, uncertain, but the priorities which were established for 1942 are, I think, equally applicable to the circumstances of 1943 and whatever quantities of explosives come to hand will be allocated upon that basis.</P>
    <P>Attempts have been made to procure, from materials available in the country, alternative explosives which could be substituted for those imported.  These attempts have been successful to the extent that explosives have been produced which could be used.  In so far as any fault can be found with them, it is that they are too explosive and consequently it would be a source of danger to allow them to be availed of for ordinary industrial purposes by workers unfamiliar with their use.  It is, therefore, more correct to say that we have not solved, by means of scientific research, the industrial problems created by the scarcity of explosives.  To some extent, the substitutes produced and recommended by the Research Bureau can be used, but only in circumstances in which very meticulous supervision can be exercised over them.</P>
    <P>Early in the present year, the Irish <Col N="478" /> Steel mills at Haulbowline commenced production of steel bars from the steel billets and rails which had been accumulated there.  The total quantity of such billets and rails was limited, and consequently the output of steel bars which can be made from them is equally restricted.  It has been decided to confine these steel bars to the manufacture of shoeing iron to meet the requirements of farriers, the manufacture of bolts and nuts for certain essential industrial purposes, the manufacture of agricultural machinery and, to a limited extent, of nails.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I am not in a position to tell the Dáil whether it will be possible to complete the furnaces and thus put the mills in a position to manufacture bars from steel scrap. Earlier in the year hopes were entertained that the materials required for the completion of the furnaces would be procurable.  These hopes are less sure now.  It may be still possible to obtain the equipment required, but there is no certainty of it.  If it should prove impossible to complete the furnaces, then the steel bars at present being produced from the billets and rails available to the mill will represent the total output possible.  If, however, the furnaces can be completed&mdash; and the only thing that arises in that connection is the possibility of obtaining the equipment, which has to be imported&mdash;then a continuing supply of steel bars will be available in the future.</P>
    <P>Difficulties have arisen during the course of the year in connection with the collection and utilisation of scrap cast iron by foundries.  Arrangements have been made, and are being brought into operation, to endeavour to improve the collection of cast iron and also to confine the production of foundries to the most essential articles. In relation to all the industries using metals of one kind or another, it can be said that difficulties have been accumulating and there is not much prospect of a diminution of these difficulties.</P>
    <P>The next industrial material to which I wish to refer is paper.  Under the term paper, I include cardboard.  In the course of the debate upon the Vote for <Col N="479" /> the Department of Supplies, I gave the House a general indication of what the supply position is.  The Department of Industry and Commerce is responsible for the allocation of the available supplies amongst industrial users, and they are restricted to the use of these supplies for essential purposes only. Orders have been made, in the case of paper and cardboard used for packing and wrapping purposes, designed to ensure that all waste will be eliminated, and unnecessary packing or wrapping of goods will be made illegal.</P>
    <P>The utilisation of newsprint for the production of newspapers and periodicals has been strictly controlled and that control has been enforced for the purpose of ensuring that the supply available in the country will be made last for the longest period possible.  In the middle of last year it looked as if the daily newspapers would have to cease production, and the total supply of newsprint was strictly limited.  Even on the basis of the most economical use of it, it could not be made to last over the period in which no new supplies could be procured.  Fortunately, the arrangements made by the Department of Supplies to get additional quantities worked more expeditiously than had been anticipated. Supplies reached the country earlier than we had planned and the period of crisis was averted.</P>
    <P>I think, however, there can be no confidence that supplies will continue to be available to us.  The restrictions on output in the countries from which we draw supplies, and the regulations imposed upon exports by the Governments of these countries, create the possibility of circumstances arising in which we may not be able to replace our present stocks and, therefore, it is the policy of the Department to make the existing stocks last as long as possible, both in the interest of the public and of the workers employed in the various printing and newspaper firms.</P>
    <P>On the Estimate for the Forestry Department the Minister for Lands gave the House a review of the position <Col N="480" /> in respect of native timber stocks.  The Department of Industry and Commerce exercises control over the use made of the timber that is available. By means of various Orders, as well as by agreement with the firms concerned, economies have been enforced in the use of timber for packing purposes and other industrial purposes and attempts have been made to divert the demand to the types of timber in most abundant supply for the purpose of economising in the use of the timbers which are of most commercial value but which are the most scarce of all the varieties available to us.</P>
    <P>There is no prospect whatever of replenishing our stocks of timber.  We have to do to the end of the war, no matter how long it will last, with the timber available in the country, whether standing or cut.  We must try to ensure that that supply will continue to be available during the longest possible period for the very essential purposes for which timber is required. One person's guess is as good as another's as to how long the war will last, but we cannot plan on the basis that these supply difficulties which trouble us at the moment will cease when the war ends.  It is probable they will continue, to a greater or lesser degree according to the materials concerned, for some time after the termination of hostilities, and on that account our plans for the conservation of stocks and their reservation for use only on essential articles must be based on the assumption that a protracted period of difficulty is in front of us.</P>
    <P>The mining companies which were set up by the Government since the outbreak of the war to undertake certain forms of mineral development have met with varying fortune.  The Slievardagh coal mining company has been pushing its plans ahead.  I know that many Deputies assume that the opening of a coal mine and the bringing of it to a stage of regular production is a comparatively simple matter.  In practice it takes from two or three years to get even a small scale coal mining enterprise to the production stage.  We have tried to push matters <Col N="481" /> ahead more rapidly than would normally be attempted by commercial enterprise at Sliovardagh, and on that account we have been taking risks, upon the assumption of the accuracy of the information available, which commercial firms, financed by private capital, might not be disposed to incur.  The company, however, has now reached the stage where a steady output can be contemplated, although the circumstances that were found to exist below the ground, when they got down, were in some respects different from what had been anticipated on the basis of the geological reports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A little of both.  The Minerals Development Company has been, up to the present, confining its activities to the production of phosphate rock in County Clare.  It has reached its maximum production by means of quarrying operations, and now contemplates trying to increase production by the use of mining operations.  The use of mining operations as against quarrying is a more expensive matter and, normally, would not be regarded as economically practicable, but having regard to our circumstances here and to our need for the production of phosphate rock for fertilisers, the company is being encouraged to proceed with the contemplated mining activities.  If these activities work out as contemplated, then there should be an increase in the total output of phosphate rock, although the total cost of all the rock that will be raised may be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company has been actively concerned in what is hoped will be a large-scale development in the County Wicklow area.  The workings at County Wicklow are expected to yield not merely the material which is immediately required, that is pyrites for the manufacture of sulphuric acid for use by the fertiliser manufacturers in connection with the phosphate rock, but also a number of metallic ores. Everything, of course, depends upon the ability of the company to procure the necessary plant.  Efforts are being made at the moment to secure the <Col N="482" /> plant, but I cannot say that we are hopeful that it will be procured.  However, it would be of great advantage to us if we could get it, and would, I think, make possible the initiation of a development in County Wicklow which would be of importance to this country and which would have a permanent future.  The indications are that there is in County Wicklow an area in which mineral development work can be undertaken on an economic basis and which would be capable of developing into a large-scale enterprise.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that a normal function of the Department is the control of public transport services.  I think the House is generally familiar with the nature of the difficulties that have arisen in connection with our transport problems since the emergency began.  They are, in the main, supply problems, and the effects of the supply position on transport services were discussed during the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Supplies. The functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce in relation to these transport services are of a somewhat different character from those which affect the Department of Supplies.  The Department of Industry and Commerce is responsible for ensuring that the best use is made of the available transport services and that the necessary safeguards are maintained to ensure that the public interests are protected both in respect of the maintenance of transport services as a whole and in respect of the relations between the members of the public and the transport operating companies.</P>
    <P>The various restrictions which have been imposed upon road transport services by the Department of Supplies, in order to economise in the use of motor fuel, have been made in consultation with the Department of Industry and Commerce whose concern is to see that, despite the reduction in the total transport which can be undertaken, transport services will still be available in all parts of the country to meet the essential needs of the people.  The policy in relation to the control of rail transport services <Col N="483" /> is similar.  Deputies have been pressing to-day, and on other occasions, for increased transport facilities for passengers in various parts of the country all over the system as a whole.  It is not possible to permit the railway company to expand its services in that way.  The supply position does not permit of that being done and, if we were to do it, we would create greater difficulties in the comparatively near future.  The maintenance of this transport service is not wholly a matter of the supply of coal or substitute fuels, but also, and to an increasing extent, a problem of engine power, the maintenance of rolling stock, the renewal of existing equipment, and the difficulties which are inevitably associated with the contraction in the supply of machinery, metals, and parts manufactured from metal.</P>
    <P>In the case of the air services, there has been since the outbreak of the war, despite a substantial reduction in the number of aircraft miles flown by Aer Lingus Teoranta, a remarkable increase in the number of passengers carried and in the weight of goods carried. The number of passengers carried in 1942, for instance, was more than double the number of passengers carried in 1939, and there was also an increase in the weight of goods carried, although not to the same extent. That expansion in the number of persons using the air services has been accomplished despite the fact that the total number of aircraft miles flown has been, of necessity, very substantially reduced.</P>

      <P>That is true, and one of the purposes of this Estimate is to procure a subsidy for it.

It may be possible after the war to organise it on a paying basis, but up to the present, <Col N="484" /> as I have said, it has been found necessary for Governments in all parts of the world to provide subsidies for these commercial air lines.</P>

      <P>One of the most fruitful sources of public controversy has been in connection with the measure adopted by the Government for the regulation of personal remuneration during the emergency.  I wish particularly to refer to suggestions which were made by Deputies here during last year, to the effect that the Orders which were then in force should be codified so that persons who had occasion to refer to them would have a single document in which they could find the whole of the law relating to the matter.  That codification of Orders made under the Emergency Powers Act, dealing with the control of wages, salaries, directors' fees, and other forms of personal remuneration, has been made, and Emergency Powers Order No. 260 represents not merely the result of the effort to codify the previously existing Orders but also contains modifications of these Orders which experience has shown to be necessary.  I think it can be said that whatever controversy may still exist about the wisdom of the policy as a whole, the machinery established by that Order is working smoothly and to the satisfaction of all parties concerned. The number of applications which are being made for standard rate Orders and bonus Orders is very considerable but, nevertheless, they are being disposed of with considerable dispatch.  It is not now necessary to refer all these applications to a tribunal established under the Order. Under the new procedure, when there is agreement between the parties concerned, and where the nature of the employment is not such as to raise an obvious consideration of public interest, then bonus Orders and standard rate Orders can be, and are being, made without reference to a tribunal at all.</P>

    <P>Where there is no agreement, where the facts of the case are in dispute or <Col N="485" /> where it is clear that the effect of granting the application upon the cost of living might be considerable, then there is an examination in public by a tribunal and Orders are made upon the recommendations of a tribunal.  In each case, the tribunal consists of a chairman, appointed by myself, a representative of employers and a representative of workers.  I am happy to say that, in the great majority of cases, the recommendations of tribunals have been agreed to by all members.  Up to date, there have been, roughly, 450 standard-rate Orders and about 550 bonus Orders. The difference between the number of standard-rate and the number of bonus Orders is explained by the fact that, under the provisions of Emergency Order 260, it is possible to make a bonus Order without having previously made a standard-rate Order.  That modification of the original provision was considered necessary in order to deal with the circumstances of occupations in which, for one reason or another, it was impracticable to determine or to put down upon paper what the standard rate of wages of the employees had been on the appropriate date.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that, in normal times, a large part of the work of the Department of Industry and Commerce is concerned with conciliation in industrial disputes.  Fortunately&mdash;I am sure all Deputies will agree as to the use of that word&mdash;the number of industrial disputes reported to the Department of Industry and Commerce during the past year was substantially less than in previous years.  That is, I think; partially due to the fact that the Government decided upon a wage-control policy.  I feel sure that, apart from any objections in principle which there may be to that policy, most people concerned with the interests of workers or the interests of employers will agree that it is eminently desirable in present circumstances that the number of stoppages of work, due to industrial disputes, should be reduced to a minimum.  It has, I think, been a real benefit to this country that, during the past year, the stoppages of work which did occur <Col N="486" /> were few in number and that no case was so extensive in character or so prolonged in duration as to cause serious difficulties of supply.</P>
    <P>The Statistics Branch of the Department is continuing to serve with increasing efficiency the need for reliable information concerning national conditions. I refer to it in the course of these introductory remarks for the purpose of informing the House that it will be necessary, in the course of the coming twelve months, to take a new register of population.  The ration books now in use by the public will have become exhausted about the middle of next year.  It will be necessary to replace these ration books with new books.  Originally, it was contemplated that the back page of the present book would serve as a registration form and thus simplify the re-registration of the population when the issue of another book became necessary.  Experience has, however, shown that it would be too unreliable to proceed in the manner originally contemplated, and that it is better to prepare a new population register. That will be done during the course of the next 12 months.  It will have to be done to enable a new issue of ration books to be made next year.  We contemplate the preparation of the new ration book upon the basis of the need to maintain the rationing of some commodities in some form for three further years.  It may be, and I am sure we all hope, that circumstances will permit of the termination of rationing before the expiration of that period but, having regard to the known facts concerning the world supply situation in respect of commodities which are regarded as essential, we have to face up to the possibility that rationing will still continue to be necessary for a period, even should active hostilities cease.  At any rate, it is upon that assumption we are making our plans.  If the circumstances should prove that the assumption is too pessimistic, we shall all be delighted.  On the other hand, if they show that the assumption is correct, then it will be a relief to know that the necessary arrangements for dealing with that situation have been made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="487" /> I presume that, in accordance with the normal practice, the administration of unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance will be debated upon the main Vote.  A number of Votes for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible have, for legal reasons, to be moved separately, but it has always been the practice of the House to discuss them together.  I do not think that there is any special point to which I wish to refer in connection with the administration of unemployment insurance or unemployment assistance.  During the course of the past year we brought into operation a special register of agricultural workers.  That register was complementary to the decision of the Government to place restriction upon the emigration of persons who were experienced in the work of agriculture or the work of turf production. It was felt that, if such persons were subjected to greater restrictions than applied to the population as a whole, some compensatory benefits should be made available to them.  It was decided to give increased benefits by the device of setting up a special register of such workers, those included on the register being entitled to the enjoyment of certain privileges, which include payment of extra sums during unemployment, exemption from the operation of Unemployment Period Orders and preference on works financed out of public funds.  The number of persons registered as unemployed at employment exchanges at present is lower than it has been at any time for the past ten years.  The number of persons on the register in January of the present year&mdash;I take January because it is the period in which unemployment is normally at its worst, and in which the number on the register is at its highest&mdash;was 88,435.  In no previous January, back to 1934, was the number so low.  In fact, for each week of the present year the number on the register has been on the average 10,000 less than for the corresponding week of last year.</P>
    <P>That circumstance, while partly due to the amount of work available in turf production and in other employment <Col N="488" /> in rural areas is, of course, as Deputies well know, attributable very largely to the emigration which has occurred during the past year.  The Government's policy upon emigration has been stated frequently in the Dáil and made clear to the public by means of announcements in the Press and over the radio.  Normally, we ban the emigration of any person who is in employment, or for whom employment is immediately available in this country. The ban applies, except in special circumstances, also to people under 22 years of age.  Of course, agricultural and turf workers were provided for under the special register scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not know that any modification of that policy is practicable. Certainly, nobody has at any time suggested that the particular procedure now in operation should be changed in any specific way.  I know, and every Deputy knows, that the way to deal with the emigration which is now proceeding is by increasing opportunities for work at home.  The Government would like nothing better than to be able to expand the opportunities of work here so as to encourage Irish workers to remain at home rather than to proceed to employment elsewhere.  Under existing conditions, however, the work which can be given by private employers is contracting in volume, and the work that can be financed and carried through by Government Departments is also limited in scope by reason of the dearth of materials, tools and fuel.</P>
    <P>It is not now possible to carry through large scale housing schemes or other constructional works of the type which the Government financed and supervised in pre-war years.  If we could do these works upon the same scale as in the pre-war period, the House knows that they would be done. It is solely because of inability to obtain the necessary equipment that the number of such works has diminished.  In so far as large works can be carried through with the available materials and available equipment, they are being undertaken, but the impossibility of expanding the scope and size of such works to the extent which would absorb workers <Col N="489" /> disemployed from the service of private firms owing to the emergency, will be readily recognised.  If, however, Deputies have proposals to make as to how restrictions upon emigration should be modified in one way or the other&mdash;either to allow classes out that are not now allowed out, or to prevent classes who can secure travel permits from emigrating&mdash;I should be glad if they would put forward their proposals in a specific and detailed manner.</P>
    <P>At the present time there is coming into operation the Wet Time Act. That is the title given to the measure which was passed here for the purpose of insuring workers engaged in the building trade against loss of employment due to inclement weather.  The need for legislation of that kind had been recognised in the building industry for a long time, but neither here nor in any other country had an attempt been made to carry it through until that Act was passed in the Dáil just before the outbreak of the war. I do not think that any other country has legislation of the same kind in force, and it is interesting to note that Government Departments of many countries have asked for reports on the legislation we prepared and on the administrative problems that have arisen in connection with it.  It can be assumed, therefore, that our Act has been regarded as a headline by the Governments of these other countries but, while that is something upon which we can compliment ourselves, it is necessary for Deputies to keep in mind that inevitably, as is the case with all pioneers, we are going to run into difficulties which we have not foreseen, and we may have to amend our administrative methods in order to circumvent these difficulties.  The Act is now coming into operation.  Workers employed in the building industry are now making contributions, but the payments of benefits will not begin until next month.  It will be necessary for a worker to have been in employment and to have 12 contributions to his credit before he becomes entitled to benefit.  By that means a fund is created from which benefit will be paid.  That Act will be in full operation <Col N="490" /> before the end of next month&mdash; that is to say, all workers employed in the industry will be making contribution and all workers who lose their employment by reason of inclement weather will be entitled to the benefits prescribed in the Act.</P>
    <P>The only other matter to which I wish to refer is the food voucher scheme, so far as it is administered by my Department.  The Department is responsible for the distribution of food vouchers to persons entitled to unemployment assistance.  I think that we can say that on the whole the scheme has worked well throughout the year. Ten thousand five hundred persons benefit by the scheme every week&mdash; that is to say that number of persons, entitled to unemployment assistance, are receiving food vouchers, graded in accordance with the size of their families.  Food vouchers are also given to other classes, but I am referring now only to unemployment assistance recipients.  It is true that at various periods in some districts persons with food vouchers experienced difficulty in procuring supplies against the vouchers.  Such an experience is almost inevitable in circumstances such as we are now passing through, but everywhere it was reported that such difficulties had arisen, <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements were made to try to reduce them or remove them altogether.</P>
    <P>It was not possible in some cases to guarantee to holders of food vouchers that they would get their appropriate supplies every week but, where temporary difficulties arose, we tried to meet the problem by enabling the vouchers of recipients to be cashed in arrear so that they suffered only a temporary inconvenience caused by the inability of traders to meet their case. It is, however, necessary to impress on traders that persons presenting food vouchers should have a prior claim upon supplies in circumstances of temporary difficulty.  Their need is obviously greater than that of others, and I am glad to say that the vast majority of traders have always acted in the spirit of that appeal, so much so that, having regard to the difficulties of the time and the number of <Col N="491" /> persons concerned, it is really remarkable how few the complaints have been.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, a number of functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce to which I have not referred and to which I do not propose to refer unless some Deputy requests me to do so.  I can assure the House that any matter concerning the activities of the Department about which they desire information will be fully dealt with by me in replying.  My sole anxiety is to see that the fullest possible information is given to Deputies, so that they may be familiar with the many problems which have arisen in the Department, and the methods by which we have decided to cope with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. The Minister has given us a very interesting survey, and has covered a very wide field.  I propose to cover only a much narrower field&mdash;what I might call the normal pre-war activities of the Department of Industry and Commerce, carried into the present emergency period.  I am afraid that, with regard to some of the problems, we do not know how much they are truly economic or how much the phobias of the Government in political matters have leaked into the economic field.  I think it was two years ago that the Minister's predecessor in the Department of Industry and Commerce said that they were examining into the question as to the extent to which factories in this country could be employed on work which, while not war work, would be something akin to it. I never heard whether they pursued those investigations or whether they arrived at any conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to timber as one of our principal difficulties.  I entirely agree with him, and I think that, with regard to native timber, a good deal has been done.  Of course, native timber will serve only a certain number of purposes, but undoubtedly a big advance has been made.  I think the country is more or less adjusting <Col N="492" /> itself to war conditions.  Some of the timber merchants have undoubtedly partly seasoned the native timber, and the buyers have considerably altered their ideas as to what timber ought to be.  Turning to the other side of the timber industry, of course our main requirements in soft timber&mdash;and indeed in hard ones too&mdash;were brought in from abroad.  At the present time, there are supplies of timber available in Sweden.  Sweden has ships, and is anxious to sell them to us.  The Swedes are prepared to drop wood products in any neutral port like Lisbon.  I suppose on a fine day a person with a good telescope might discern a Swedish ship sailing past our coast.  If the Swedes are willing to put into our ports, is there any reason why we should not use every effort to find out why they do not put into our ports?</P>
    <P>For some years past the Department of Industry and Commerce have been tightening their hold on industry.  In the pre-war period, there were quotas in operation.  Those quotas were usually based on some previous trading figures.  That system resulted in some people getting too big a quota, while others probably got too small a quota. That had to be sorted out afterwards, with, I suppose, profit to some and loss to others, but it seems that there was a needless interference with industry. I am sure the Minister will strenuously deny what I am about to say now, but that does not necessarily alter the truth of my statement.  One of the major blunders of his Department was that, while they were fostering industry in the pre-war period, and very properly fostering it, they failed to realise when the war clouds loomed on the horizon that a period of danger was approaching and that the country ought to be stocked up.  What happened was that the native industries were geared for only a very moderate peace-time rate of supply.  The quotas and restrictions were in operation, and the country was not stocked up as it was before the war in 1914.  The Minister will probably retort by telling us that now, with great advantage to the country we have industries which were not in existence then.</P>
    <P>That is perfectly true, but it does not <Col N="493" /> alter the fact that what we gained on the swings by industrial expansion we lost on the roundabouts by shortages of supplies in this country.  There is no good in talking about the past&mdash;I suppose some wag will say that Ireland's future lies in the past&mdash;unless we learn from the past some lesson for the future.  The war will not last for ever.  At the present time, of course, an importer who could bring in any goods would get a free import licence &mdash;I will do the Minister the justice of saying that he is as glad as anybody else to see goods arriving in this country&mdash;but, while that position might have been all right just immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, it ought not be prolonged indefinitely.</P>
    <P>No decision has been come to on the general post-war policy; no information can be obtained; no policy has been adumbrated.  I would like to give the Minister an instance of what I fancy could occur and, while I am going to mention one particular commodity, I imagine that this can be carried into almost every type of industry and every type of goods that come into this country.  The finished products of one industry are the raw materials of another.  Nobody knows&mdash; and I do not envy the Minister in trying to make up his mind&mdash;whether raw materials or finished products are likely to be available for supply to this country in the post-war situation. Remember, it will not be like when the war was coming on, because we will have no materials when the war comes to an end.  Let us suppose that somebody wanted a steel building.  In the post-war period, I suppose, the tariff on fabricated steel will be reintroduced, but it may be found that the raw materials cannot be obtained by the steel fabricators in this country and if the building programme is held up it will be just too bad for many employees and many firms who employ them.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are very fond of telling us that they have a plan.  I would like to ask the Minister, has any policy yet been decided upon that would cover a situation such as I have mentioned? Remember, that while I have given an <Col N="494" /> instance of steel, it could be carried into the soft goods line or into almost every other line.  If a policy has been decided upon, is industry fit to hear it? The Minister has mentioned to us the scramble that will probably ensue if any goods are brought into this country in the post-war period.  Nothing influences an exporter or manufacturer of goods in another country so much as the prospects of a continued business.  If a manufacturer or an exporter finds that there is just one order available and then the business will probably shut down, there will be nothing doing.  I would like to suggest to the Minister that at the present time importers ought to be contacting exporters in foreign lands as to what they can send out when peace comes again, and as to the terms on which they will be able to trade with this country.  If this question is unduly delayed, exporters in other countries may have allocated their supplies, post-war, before we have made up our minds as to what our policy is to be in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not realise it, but he has sewn industry up in a sack.  The part played by industry has now largely been taken over by his Department. The control is under his officials and the experience of generations of traders in this country is now brought down to a four years' experience which has been acquired by the Minister's Department about supplies.  If that is the position that ought to prevail, either the Minister's Department is composed of supermen or all the people in industry are fools.  I would like the Minister to give me an answer, if he can, as to what the post-war policy in general is going to be for industry because, remember, they can do nothing until they get some idea as to what tariffs are going to prevail and what restrictions are going to be imposed.  The Minister may say that that is a very difficult question, that he would want to be a prophet to answer it.  I quite agree with him, but he will have to give that answer, at any rate for a limited period, and say: &ldquo;Well, now, I am going to do this for so long and you can get busy along those lines.&rdquo;  Nothing can be done <Col N="495" /> until the Minister makes up his mind and lets people know where they stand.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  On many occasions during the last 12 months, when speaking outside the House in particular, the Minister admitted that the major problem confronting the country was the possible collapse of the transport industry.  The Minister, when referring to this matter in particular, has been critical about the failure, the refusal or the inability of the Labour Party at any time since they came into this House to put forward constructive proposals for the solution of the present problem.  I would like to remind the Minister, in case he may have overlooked it and in that way was unconsciously unfair to the members of this group, that as far back as the 23rd November, 1923, this Party got leave to introduce a Bill into this House under the title of the &ldquo;Transport and Communications Bill&rdquo;.  The title of it was: &ldquo;A Bill to provide for the acquisition by the State of railways in Saorstat Eireann, for the management of such railways and the Post Office and for the coordination of road, motor, aerial and other transport services and other purposes connected therewith&rdquo;.  At that period I think the Minister was not a member of the House or an elected representative of the people.  I would like to remind him that long before he <Col N="497" /> became a member of the House, and for many years before he publicly committed himself to a solution of this problem by a particular method, we had, after a good deal of consideration, drafted and put into the framework of a Bill all the details under which an effective and efficient transport system might be, and should be, set up in this country.  I hope that disposes of the allegation repeatedly made by the Minister against the members of this group in connection with this and other matters.</P>
      <P>This problem is a major one, and if it is as serious as the Minister admits to-day, it is because he has not taken any effective steps to put into operation his own declared policy for dealing with it.  When the Minister, particularly between the period 1927 to 1932, was in opposition in this House, and even after he became a Minister, he publicly declared himself, both inside and outside the House, as being in favour of the public ownership of the transport services of this country. Instead of proceeding to put that policy into operation when he became a Minister, he brought in a Transport Bill and a Railways Transport Bill in 1933.  In winding up the debate on the final stages of these two Bills, he made it quite clear that these measures, for which he then got approval from the majority of the members of this House, were, in effect, the last trial to be given to the private ownership system for the transport services of this State.  If I am unfair to the Minister he can contradict me. If he challenges the accuracy of my statement, I will quote from the official records of his speech on the concluding stages of the 1933 Bill. That Bill, in the opinion of the Minister, would provide better transport services, both road and rail, for the community; it would give cheaper rates to the persons who made use of these services, and would provide better security in employment and conditions of service for the workers in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next serious statement made by the Minister in connection with the position of the transport industry was made in this House on the 7th December, <Col N="498" /> 1938, when he indicated that, in view of the situation then existing and in view of the then pending financial collapse of the railway system of the country, he was proposing to set up a tribunal with power to send for persons, papers and documents, and to make recommendations.  In that speech the Minister indicated that the matter was of such urgency and importance that the report of that tribunal should be in his hands in February, 1939.  I remember indicating, in the course of the discussion, that, in my opinion, it would not be possible for the members of the tribunal to furnish a report within such a short period.  As everybody knows, the reports of the members of the tribunal were handed to the Minister in August, 1939.  For reasons which he never gave to this House, the Minister filed those reports in some secret cabinet and only allowed them to be published two years after they had been handed to him.  What transpired between the date on which the Minister received them and the date of their publication is not even now known to me or to anybody else interested in this problem.</P>
    <P>The next most important event in connection with the transport industry of the country was the action of the Minister under the Emergency Powers Order issued in February, 1942, which placed the Great Southern Railways services under the control of a chairman-dictator without any previous or subsequent explanation to this House as to the powers of the chairman appointed by the Minister, his responsibility to the Oireachtas, if any, or his responsibility to anybody else, as far as I know.  The action of the Minister in appointing a chairman-dictator of the Great Southern Railways in 1942 is certainly a complete contradiction of everything said by the Minister from the time he came into the House in 1927.  With the exception of the powers given to the Fuehrer over the people and industries of the German State, I know of no one in the world having such powers as the chairman of the Great Southern Railways. The public control policy, at any rate, was thrown completely overboard by the action of the Minister on <Col N="499" /> that particular occasion, and we find it impossible to get any statement from him up to the present as to the powers possessed by this extraordinary individual. Previous to the appointment of the chairman-dictator of the Great Southern Railways, it is well known that the directors appointed by the shareholders who were in control previous to February, 1942, took no effective steps to purchase the necessary raw materials, including coal, for the carrying on of the company's services.</P>
    <P>Statements have been made on various occasions as to who should be held responsible for the failure of the Great Southern Railways to purchase the necessary coal and other raw materials to carry on an efficient railway service.  I assert here and now, again, as I did before, that the action of the Great Southern Railway directors in not doing their duty in that respect must have been made known to the Minister.  In any case, the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;who is also Minister for Supplies from some period in 1938&mdash;was bound as Minister for Supplies to inquire as to the position of the Great Southern Railways and other essential undertakings.  He was bound to provide them, if he had the desire to do so, with whatever State guarantees might be necessary, in order to enable them to purchase coal, when coal was available in large quantities at very low prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Why would State guarantees be necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is obvious.  The Minister knew perfectly well that, for a long period previous to the appointment of this chairman-dictator, the finances of the Great Southern Railways were in a very serious condition.  This was recognised by the Minister in his appointment of the tribunal on the 7th December, 1938, shortly after the Department of Supplies was established, I think.  In any case, I am pretty certain also, from what I can gather, that the members of the tribunal, and particularly the chairman of the tribunal, were in constant consultation <Col N="500" /> with the Minister and his advisers, in regard to the internal affairs of the Great Southern Railways, and if the Department of Supplies had any function, it was to assist the owners of essential undertakings and employers throughout the country to get the necessary raw materials, which the Minister advised them to get before the outbreak of war or immediately after the Department of Supplies was set up.</P>

If he had made such inquiries, I am sure he would have got only one answer from the Great Southern Railways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>You took good care you did not come into the House on the last day when I attempted to read the minutes of the conference which was held with the Taoiseach and which are in your possession.  You kept out of <Col N="506" /> the House.  Dealing with the matter of transport, in this House on the 24th March, 1943, I addressed the following question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) Whether he is aware that Mr. A. P. Reynolds, Chairman of the Great Southern Railways, stated at the annual meeting of shareholders on March 3rd, that he proposed embarking upon a reorganisation of the company, including a reorganisation of its capital; (b) if he will say whether he has been consulted by Mr. Reynolds as to the nature of the reorganisation contemplated; if so, (c) whether he can state if the proposed reorganisation is along the lines recommended in either the Majority or the Minority Report of the Transport Tribunal, and if so, which, (d) whether he will take steps to ensure that the proposed reorganisation, as a matter of public interest and of vital concern in the community, will be undertaken only by the authority of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass in reply said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the affirmative. As regards the other parts I have discussed from time to time with the chairman of the company its position generally and from the discussions, certain proposals have emerged as a basis for consideration. Considerable examination and development will be necessary before a practicable scheme will be available. The recommendations of the Transport Tribunal will be borne in mind in such examination and any reorganisation to be effected will be the subject of legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From that reply it transpires that certain proposals have emerged as a basis for consideration.  After the long period during which the Minister had tied himself to the public ownership and control policy as a means of finding a solution for our transport difficulties, and in view of the legislation which the Minister has had experience of between 1933 and the present period, will the Minister now tell the House and the country whether he still believes that this whole problem can <Col N="507" /> only be solved inside the system of private ownership and control?  Is it intended, or has it been decided to give powers to the new dictator-chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company to produce a scheme of reorganisation based on the private ownership system, or is he to produce a scheme based on the old policy which the Minister advocated for such a long period, namely, the policy of public ownership and control?  It would be well if the Minister would define to the House, in clear and unmistakable terms, the duties and responsibilities of Mr. Reynolds, appointed by him as dictator-chairman of the Great Southern Railways.  To whom is he responsible?  Certainly not to the shareholders or to the employees. Is he responsible to the Oireachtas and, if not, to whom?  These are questions which, in my opinion, ought to be answered by the Minister, who is responsible for the appointment of Mr. Reynolds.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear, so far as I am personally concerned, that I do not want in anything I say to cast any reflection on the individual concerned.  I did say in this House on a previous occasion, shortly after his appointment, that I wanted him to get a fair trial to do one of the most difficult jobs ever given to any man in this country in the circumstances under which he went into the position in February, 1942.  Right from the date of his appointment, it is alleged at any rate, Mr. Reynolds has adopted an aggressive and provocative attitude towards the whole of the railway employees. This attitude is deeply resented and has tended to impair efficiency and destroy confidence in the management or the success of the undertaking.  The speech of Mr. Reynolds at the annual general meeting of the company on 3rd March was calculated to mislead the shareholders and misrepresent the workers.  In addition, it contained certain glaring inaccuracies.  I was amazed when I read in the <i>Irish Press,</i> which cannot be accused of telling lies at any rate, certain statements made by Mr. Reynolds at that meeting.  One of them was that out of every two miles of running there was one mile <Col N="508" /> occupied in shunting.  As a railwayman of 36 or 37 years of experience, I cannot imagine that that was the position. In any case, I know it is not a fact.</P>
    <P>Mr. Reynolds, in comparing railway with road transport said: &ldquo;Do you realise that for every two miles run by a steam engine on the railway it is necessary to run one mile in marshalling and shunting?&rdquo;  He made this statement, although in the balance sheet, only an extract from which was supplied to the shareholders, he could see that last year the shunting and marshalling miles represented only 23 in every 100 miles run.  It is important that this misleading statement should be corrected.  This was the highest on record, because the mileage was the lowest on record, and hence trains which would &ldquo;run through&rdquo; otherwise had to stop at numerous stations The Minister and his advisers know perfectly well why the passenger and goods trains had to stop so often during the particular period covered by Mr. Reynolds's speech.</P>
    <P>In 1941, the shunting and marshalling miles were 18 in 100 miles run; in 1938, the mileage was 15 in 100; and, in 1937, 15 in 100 also, or about one in seven, as against one in three suggested by Mr. Reynolds.  In actual fact, the same amount of shunting is done practically every year, but, as the mileage was artificially reduced last year, the proportion of shunting to running miles was somewhat higher. How Mr. Reynolds could make these statements and circulate at the same time a certified return by the chief mechanical engineer showing something different, I do not understand, unless they were made for the purpose of blackening the railway system in the eyes of the shareholders and the public who might read his speech.</P>
    <P>Mr. Reynolds gave the shareholders and the public to understand that last year the railway section of the concern was a pronounced failure.  On the contrary, it made a new record in proportion to the extent to which it was allowed to operate.  For example, the total mileage run in 1938, the last prewar <Col N="509" /> year, was 11,994,255 and the gross receipts £3,166,128.  Last year, the mileage was only 8,726,259, but the receipts went up to £3,928,416.  This meant a reduction of 27 per cent. in the mileage, but an increase of 24 per cent. in the receipts.  That is not disclosed in the speech made by the chairman.  Although no dividends were paid last year, in the previous three years dividends on the guaranteed stock were paid, most of it out of a refund of rates overpaid, but the money, of course, had to come from revenue originally.</P>
    <P>In actual fact, the net receipts of the concern have risen steadily from £351,113 in 1938 to £567,240 last year. This is a remarkable achievement, seeing that, since the outbreak of the war, there was no increase in either rates or fares, except in the case of exceptional rates, most of which are 40 per cent. or more below standard rates, and these were increased by only 15 per cent.  Everything the railway carries has gone up by at least 60 per cent. or more.  The cost of fuel and all necessary materials has increased in price four or five times. Why have the company not sought an increase in charges commensurate with the general increase in the cost of the goods they carry and the materials they buy?  Is this a deliberate attempt to create a financial crisis, with a view to compelling shareholders and workers to accept distasteful and disastrous conditions?</P>
    <P>It is also known&mdash;and if the Minister challenges me on this, I will give him dates and everything else&mdash;that, previous to this speech being made by the dictator-chairman, the Dublin Transport Company put a certain number of the Great Southern Railways Company's guaranteed preference shares which they held on the Dublin Stock Exchange.  Less than a month before the chairman made his speech, they sold these shares on the Dublin Stock Exchange at £25 each, and the day after Mr. Reynolds made his speech the value of these shares dropped to £11.  I make that statement for the purpose of trying to convince the Minister that it is wrong, in existing circumstances, that the <Col N="510" /> managing director of the Transport Company should also be chairman and dictator of the Great Southern Railways Company.  I invite him&mdash;and he has plenty of ways and means of finding out&mdash;to find out whether that statement is or is not correct.  I have a written statement supplied to me to the effect that it did happen.</P>
    <P>Mr. Reynolds also said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Even if railways were modernised, the country could not afford a transport system which needs to employ some 15,000 workers to operate it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here we have Mr. Reynolds telling the Great Southern Railways Company shareholders and the public, through his speech published in the <i>Irish Press</i> and in other papers, that it will take him seven years to set up and put into operation a proper scheme of reorganisation, but before starting to put the scheme down on paper in consultation with the Minister and for the information of the Minister, he makes up his mind that it cannot carry 15,000 workers.  If I got the job of framing a scheme of reorganisation of a railway company or any other company I knew anything about&mdash;I do not say I know a terrible lot about these things&mdash;I would frame the scheme first and relate it, when framed, and the number of men required to the working conditions in existence at the time the scheme was finally drafted and approved, and relate it further to the capital requirements of the company and the rates and charges necessary to raise the sum required to pay the overhead charges and whatever dividends would reasonably require to be paid to the people who put their money into the industry.</P>
    <P>I understood that Mr. Reynolds was a man who accepted generally the meaning of the Papal Encyclicals, and admitted that they should be applied in every case to workers employed in industry, but he goes on in his speech to say that the one thing which is imperative in this scheme of reorganisation, which apparently the Minister has given him power to frame, is that certain interest charges and rates of dividend must be paid in order to induce <Col N="511" /> those who have money to put the necessary capital into the concern. The first charge on the revenue of any industry, under the terms of the Papal Encyclicals, is the right of the worker employed in the industry to a living wage for himself and his dependents, a right which comes before that of those who put their money into the concern in order to get dividends at the rate of 5 or 6 per cent.</P>

      <P>What are the facts in regard to the employees?  There are nearly 13,000 wagons and carriages owned by the Great Southern Railways Company.  Taking a ridiculously low estimate and assuming that only 7,000 of these were in use on the average, and that each lorry and bus carried as much goods or passengers as a wagon or carriage, it would take at least 14,000 men to work them. Each lorry has a driver and helper and each bus a driver and conductor. Then you would have to provide for your repair and maintenance staffs, even if you did not build the buses or lorries here, as in the case of the carriages and wagons, but sent the money overseas and exported your workers who would otherwise be building them here.  In addition, the clerical, supervisory and administrative staff would have to be added.  Taking the position on this basis, which is all in favour of the road, it is obvious that to perform on the road the work now performed by the railways would require thousands of extra workers, apart from the fact that somebody would have to pay for the building of roads, the roads under present conditions being quite unfitted for the carriage of heavy goods now carried by the railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Reynolds attacked the hours of duty in his speech also and complained <Col N="512" /> about having to pay overtime if men had to work after their eight-hour day. I know, of course, that Mr. Reynolds made his speech with less than 12 months' experience in his position, and that may be one reason why he apparently was not giving the full facts to the shareholders and the public.  At all the smaller stations on the railway system, the wages grades have a spread-over of nine and a half hours, and the station-master one of 12 hours, without any extra payment.  In addition, hundreds of hours of overtime are worked for which the company declined to pay because authority for working them was not secured in advance.  What does Mr. Reynolds, acting on behalf of the Minister, want, or is this the &ldquo;New Order&rdquo; which Mr. Reynolds and the Minister propose to put into operation in the post-war period?</P>

      <P>The Deputy, however, was reading with running comment the whole speech made by the Chairman of the Railway Company.  I merely wanted to know what documents the Deputy was quoting from, whether speech or statement, and when he was giving his own figures.  A Deputy may use tables of figures, which he might not be expected to carry in his head, for example, statistics of the railway traffic and such like.

      <P>The chairman, in the opening portion of his speech, made a remarkable statement, which I hope the Minister will explain when he is replying.  The statement was that the railways were designed to meet a transport problem vastly different from the problem of to-day.  Before this war ends, before the emergency period comes to an end in this country, I am sure it will become more and more evident to the Minister that the only section of the transport system that will be left to serve the community will be the railway section.  I should like to hear from the Minister whether, in consultation with the chairman of the Great Southern Railways, he has come to the conclusion that there is no further use for the maintenance of the railway system and, if that is so, whether it is the intention of the Minister, either before the end of the emergency period, or in the post-war period, to bring in a scheme of re-organisation of our transport services which will put the responsibility upon those in charge of it at the time of carrying the commodities which require to be carried mainly on the roads.  If that is the point of view of the Minister and the chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company, who has been appointed to draft this scheme, will he say whether it is their intention to build new roads and, if so, who is to pay for the new roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> Can the Minister say, in all sincerity and seriousness, that it will at any time be possible here for the roads to carry the live stock which usually are carried every day in the week and every week in the year from fairs held in towns in internal areas on the branch lines of our railway system and on the main lines to the ports from which they are being sent out of the country to Great Britain?</P>

Let us have a clear statement of policy on this matter now, after the consideration which the Minister must have given to it since 1927, and particularly since he came into office as Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1932.  The Minister surely has had sufficient experience between 1932 and 1943 to enable him to make up his mind as to whether a scheme of re-organisation of transport will be more efficiently operated under a system of public ownership and control or under the existing system of private ownership and control which has been breaking down at every stage at which the Minister has interfered since he came into office in 1932.</P>

There were some exchanges between himself and the Minister, and I asked at one stage why did they not purchase the coal in 1938 and 1939 when there was plenty of it available, and the Minister looked at me and said: &ldquo;Well, was I not justified in appointing the managing director?&rdquo; as if to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I never heard a case of slamming the stable door after the horse was gone more dramatically described than that, and I say that that is an epitome of all that the Minister has done since he got control of this Department.

      <P>Not only have we been concerned with the slamming of doors on empty stables but, even after that, the Minister for Industry and Commerce came along with a special type of galvanized iron lock to put on the doors, but unfortunately on the wrong side.  Who is it that prevented the stocks of commodities in this country from being kept up and replenished? Who is it that prevented the people of this country from bringing into the country supplies when they were easily available?  Was it not the Minister for <Col N="518" /> Industry and Commerce of Eire?  It was not the base, bloody and brutal Saxon who prevented these supplies from being brought in here.  Will anyone in this House challenge the fact that in 1939, when the war broke out, there were abundant supplies of artificial manures to be had, abundant supplies of cotton textiles to be had, abundant supplies of leather to be had, abundant supplies of agricultural machinery to be had, abundant supplies of boots and shoes to be had&mdash; any amount of them to be had&mdash;and that there was abundant shipping available to carry these commodities to this country and abundant storage in this country in which to store these goods against a rainy day?</P>
      <P>Will anyone in this House deny that there were any number of merchants in this country willing and anxious to bring in these commodities, without any State guarantee&mdash;merchants with empty storage space who were willing and anxious to fill that storage space with these commodities without any kind of stipulation on their part that their profit or finance should be guaranteed by the State, and that in respect of each one of these commodities effective measures were taken by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is now sitting on the Front Bench, to prevent their being brought in, and that when supplies of these commodities had been secured in Great Britain by the merchants of this country and landed on a Liverpool quay, with shipping awaiting to transport them to the North Wall, the persons who bought the commodities and landed them on Liverpool quay were told that they would not be allowed to bring them to this country?  In some cases there was a categorical prohibition against bringing them here, and in other cases the tariff put on these commodities was so prohibitive that the merchants concerned could not afford to pay, not the price of the goods, but the tariff that had been levied upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember, in this House, 18 months or two years ago, when Bamfords had a large display of agricultural machinery at the Spring Show, asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="519" /> if he would take the tariff off agricultural machinery because there was certain to be a shortage very soon in this country, and I remember Deputy Allen and the Minister combining to protest that there were abundant supplies of agricultural machinery in this country, that there was no reason whatever for altering the tariff policy in regard to agricultural machinery in this country because anybody who wanted to get it could get all they wanted in Wexford. Where is the agricultural machinery to be got now?  Try to buy a horse-rake, a tedder, a mowing machine, or a reaper and binder, and you will soon find out that they are not to be had.  Now, however, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has suddenly awakened to the fact that there is a shortage of agricultural machinery and&mdash;no doubt, we have to give him credit for this&mdash;bang went the stable door immediately and off came the tariff when he was satisfied that there were no supplies of agricultural machinery to be got between here and the Yangtze-Kiang, and that there was no place where it could be got. Anybody can get full and free licence from the Minister now to bring in agricultural machinery when there is none to be had.</P>
    <P>I remember urging on the Minister the necessity of removing the tariffs on cotton textiles, flannelette, and other materials for shirtings, which are so vitally necessary for the clothing of the poor, and we were laughed at for suggesting such a thing.  We were told that &ldquo;Gentex&rdquo; was functioning in Athlone&mdash;a beautiful new enterprise&mdash; and was turning out such wonderful goods that they would take the sight out of your eyes.  What are they producing now?  There were millions of yards of long-cloth, calico and so on in Manchester which were at the disposal of the shopkeepers of this country who wanted to buy them, and there were tens of thousands of drapers in this country who were willing and anxious to buy these commodities, but who would not be allowed to bring in a yard, and now we are faced with the situation in which we have no calico, no flannelette, and a very small quantity <Col N="520" /> of low-grade shirtings, coming from some of the poorest quality of shirting in Manchester.</P>
    <P>I shall have something more to say about that on the adjournment tonight, but let us do the Minister the justice of saying that when the whole world had been searched and it was established that there was not an inch of cotton textiles to be had anywhere, bang went the stable door again, off came the tariffs and restrictions, and all and sundry were invited to go out and buy cotton textiles anywhere they could.  Is that not so?  Is it not true? Unless we went out and stripped the cotton burnouses off the Arabs in the Tunisian desert, I do not know where you would get these materials now, but for anybody who cares to do so, there is a full and free licence now from the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this country to bring home the fruits of his labour.  Deputies know that at the present moment boot factories in this country are experimenting on a hinge.  They are trying to find a hinge for wooden soles, that will not creak and that will keep opening and shutting as long as the sole holds out, because there is no sole leather.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> He kept it on while there were mountains of leather to be purchased in Great Britain if he wanted to go and buy it.  But, true to form, the stable door was triumphantly slammed again when there was not a hide to be had anywhere.  The population of this country will have the pleasurable experience of having to walk not with soles that do not squeak but with hinges that do not creak.  We could have stored in this country sufficient sole leather to keep the people in footwear for the next ten years.  We could have bought it at one-fifth of what it costs at present, just as we could have bought at 8d. cotton textiles in abundance which are at present costing about 2/4 to produce.  It was the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the exercise of his functions, who refrained from removing the tariffs, restrictions and quotas on these commodities until none could be had.  Does anybody in this House realise that at the present moment there is a quota on boots and shoes? Does anybody here realise that if he managed to get hold of two pairs of boots and brought them in here, he would commit an offence?  Does anybody here realise that if he carried a few pairs of boots and shoes into Éire he would be arrested at the Border for bringing in boots and shoes in defiance of the quota order?  At this moment any person who is not licensed for the import of footwear is rigidly prohibited from bringing in a pair of shoes into this country.  Such are the blessings of the glorious policy of Fianna Fáil economic self-sufficiency. Does anybody imagine that, outside Bedlam or outside a mental hospital designed for Ministers, he would discover in the present situation an Order prohibiting anyone from bringing shoes into the State?  Such an Order still survives.  That at a time when the price of boots is soaring steadily, when no farmer or farm worker can get a nailed boot, when no farmer or farm worker can get a kip boot or a split boot, when every pair of boots you purchase from an Irish manufacturer carries a label stating that, owing to the standard of the materials which they have to put into the boots now, they are not in a position <Col N="522" /> to give any guarantee as to their wearing quality.  In such a situation there is still a prohibition on imports!</P>
    <P>While we must recognise that a great many of the commodities in scarce supply are scarce owing to circumstances over which we, in Ireland, have no control, a very considerable part of the scarcity from which we are suffering is due to the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce refused to permit supplies of essential commodities to be brought in when supplies were abundantly available and only gave permission when everybody but himself knew that supplies of these commodities were no longer available. Will any person here, save the Minister, get up and deny that?  Does the Minister himself not realise how gravely criminal his conduct was?  It was not that he was not warned.  It was not that nobody directed his attention to it.  The most vigorous representations were made in this House again and again, long before world scarcity of these commodities began to make itself felt, urging upon him a complete suspension of the whole tariff and quota system.  It was pointed out to him that this would not be made the subject of controversy, that nobody was going to interpret this general suspension of tariffs and quotas as a repudiation of Fianna Fáil policy.  It was urged upon him as a special emergency gesture.  It was urged upon him as a display of intelligence not more impressive than that annually practised by the squirrel&mdash;the storing up of nuts against the frosty day.  Nothing was stored and the reason was that the Minister for Industry and Commerce refused to allow those who wanted to store to do the storing.  Phosphate rock ought not to be very difficult to store.  You have not to put it under cover.  You have not to put it in a place of safety because the number of people who would walk away with a pocketful of phosphate rock is small. Phosphate rock could be dumped on the sloblands at Fairview and nobody would go near it.</P>
    <P>For nine years, we have had a manure ring in this country sustained and protected by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  For nine years, the Minister maintained a prohibitive <Col N="523" /> tariff on imports of superphosphate of lime.  Might not one well imagine that, having whetted these vultures' claws and provided the prostrate carcase on which they were able to grow fat during those nine years, the Minister would feel entitled to go to these people in an emergency and say: &ldquo;Having grown fat on the profits derived by the aid of tariffs, will you spend some of your ill-gotten fat in providing a reserve of phosphate rock&rdquo;?  Was there a cwt. of phosphate rock bought as a reserve?  Was there any dump of phosphate rock anywhere which could be subsequently converted into manure?  Did the Minister for Industry and Commerce at any stage represent to the group of companies constituting the manure ring that, in exchange for the concessions they enjoyed in the past, they should bring in some phosphate rock?  Not at all. The Minister's sole contribution was to take the tariff off superphosphate of lime when the veriest child knew that there was no superphosphate of lime to be got.</P>
    <P>I think that that gesture was made just after Hitler had seized Belgium. It is common knowledge that the great bulk of our superphosphate of lime came from Belgium.  But there was not a fraction of concession until Belgium was occupied by the German Army.  We were then told to go over and buy any superphosphate of lime we could.  Our Minister, or our representative there, would, I suppose, open negotiations with Hitler to see if he would let it out.  We discovered that the merchants would not be allowed to bring in &ldquo;super,&rdquo; because of the operations of the ring, and signs by it, we are in the position in which we find ourselves at the present time. We have got nothing in the way of phosphate, except what we manufacture out of the deposit in Clare.</P>
    <P>The Minister took up the position in discussing the transport problem that he was not to be expected to make any representations in matters where he was not directly responsible, that it was not his job to compel any semipublic company to discharge its duty in building up reserves of essential <Col N="524" /> supplies for the community.  Surely, he had that responsibility?  Surely, it was the duty of the Minister who was responsible, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has at all times been responsible, for the general supervision of transport companies and analogous undertakings to see, in the special circumstances in which they were functioning, that against the impending emergency proper safeguards were taken to ensure that they would be carried on.  I leave that aspect of the problem to be dealt with by Deputy Davin, and goodness knows it is wide and large enough to deserve very serious consideration.  I dwell on one feature only, not in the hope that much can be done in this emergency to repair the appalling damage that has been done, but in the hope that Deputies in this House, and the people of the country generally, will come to realise the disastrous consequences of the policy of so-called economic self-sufficiency. It is the hanging on to that piece of economic &ldquo;codology&rdquo; which has left us in the position in which we are at present.  If we had free imports in 1939 we would not be in the sorry position in which we find ourselves to-day.</P>
    <P>I beg of the House to think of this, that over and above the relief which it would be to our people to have this stock that I have described, they would have bought it on credit.  They would have created immense sterling debits in Great Britain in 1939, debits contracted for flannelette at 8d. a yard, for leather at 1/- a lb., for boots and shoes at 10/- per pair on the average&mdash;commodities which we could not have hoped to pay for there and then, but the debit for which we would have proceeded to liquidate over the succeeding period of five years.  And when the time came to pay for these debits we would have discharged them in a currency the value of which must be measured by the fact that the same flannelette is now costing 2/6 a yard, that the 10/- pair of shoes are now costing £1, and that the leather which we could have bought at 1/- per lb. is now costing 3/- per lb.  We would have got these goods for a high value currency and we would have paid for them in a currency that was steadily <Col N="525" /> depreciating with every payment we made and, on every ounce we bought, we would have made a big profit not only for the individual who brought them in but for the nation as a whole. Nobody could then say that we were shipping our sheep and cattle to Britain and taking paper money for them.  We would not be taking paper money; we would have tangible assets which we would have in our cupboard and our exports would be doing no more than discharging an honourable obligation.  We might then take pride in every cargo of live stock that was sent to Britain.  We might even justifiably join in the slogan so popular in this modern age, that in discharging obligations of honour we were lining our pockets.  What could more appeal to latter day industrial Ireland than that?</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell has, I think, failed to keep track of the changes in the policy of his Party. Like Deputy Dillon, he has been criticising the Government on the ground that, in the years before the war, adequate stocks of materials which were then available were not brought in.  The policy of the Fine Gael Party, as expounded in an official statement issued from the headquarters of the Party, is against Government interference with private commercial enterprise.  The Fine Gael Party has gone on record in support of the opinion that if the procurement of supplies had been left entirely to private enterprise, instead of being brought under Government supervision, we would have got more supplies. That is a very convenient policy for a Party in opposition.  If the supplies come in, then, of course, it is due to the initiative of private individuals and no credit to the Government; but if they do not come in, the Government can be blamed.  I do not know what way Deputies opposite want it. In so far as they purport to have an official policy, it is contrary to Government interference in business, contrary to the Government taking from private firms the business of bringing in goods, but if private firms, despite Government stimulus and Government assistance, do not bring in the quantity of <Col N="526" /> goods Deputies think should have been procured, then they want to blame the Government.  I submit that either they are conscious of the contradiction in their own statements or else they are not giving the matter serious thought at all.</P>
      <P>In the pre-war years the Government endeavoured to improve the supply position in this country by encouraging, stimulating and assisting private firms to bring in supplies.  I enunciated that policy here in the first speech I made as Minister for Supplies after the outbreak of war.  I stated in this House that, so long as it was possible, it would be my policy to deal with the problems of supply through private individual firms and not through Government organisations. There was not a Deputy in this House who disputed the wisdom of that policy.  It is true that circumstances forced a change in it.  These circumstances were, mainly, not within our control.</P>
      <P>Changes were necessitated by the fact that other Governments declined to deal with private firms or created such conditions that private firms could not operate.  In some cases it did happen that the purchase of supplies abroad by private firms had to be prevented because the total available supply was limited and separate firms in this country were competing against one another for these limited supplies and thus forcing up prices.  Where this situation arose, the Government interfered and took the business of importing out of the hands of private concerns and set up organisations for that purpose.  It is, however, completely untrue to say that there was a failure either on the part of private firms in the pre-war period or on the part of Government organisations in the subsequent period to get as large a quantity of supplies as could be obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an easy matter for Deputies to talk about the possibility of securing large stocks of coal for the railway company before the war, but if they would cast their minds back, they would temper their criticism of the directors of the railway company by reference to the fact that there was <Col N="527" /> nobody here, and indeed nobody in Great Britain, not even the members of the British Government, who contemplated before the war that a situation would arise in Great Britain in which their coal output would fall below their own requirements.  It is easy enough to expect the directors of the railway company to be more accurate in their forecast of future developments than members of the British Government.  Members of the British Government have frankly admitted that they never anticipated the situation which arose in the production of coal in that country.  Why criticise the directors of the railway company here for not being more accurate in their forecast of developments than members of the British Government? When Deputies talk about 1,000,000 tons of coal which could have been brought in in 1940, they are talking utter nonsense.  In the Spring of 1940 coal supplies fell so low in this country that a scheme for the rationing of coal for domestic purposes was put into operation.  Deputies are inclined to forget that.  After the collapse of France there came a temporary period in which abundant supplies of coal could be procured for this country, and they were procured.</P>
    <P>Within a period of a few weeks, 250,000 tons of coal were brought in. Every available ship, every available facility, for the importation of coal was fully utilised.  I went myself to the broadcasting station to broadcast an appeal to industrialists and commercial firms to buy coal rapidly and to the fullest extent possible because our ability to import coal was limited by the fact that the coal yards at the quay were full, that the quays were congested and the opportunity of getting the supply was restricted by the inability to get the coal away from the quays more quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Supplies to-day whether he is aware that shirt manufacturers in Éire are charging 108/- per dozen to the wholesalers and 126/- per dozen to the retailers for utility tunic shirts; whether that price represented approximately 100 per cent. profit on cost for the manufacturers; whether the Minister had approved these prices and, if so, would he alter his decision in this matter.  He says he is not aware that shirt manufacturers are charging prices which represent 100 per cent. on cost for utility tunic shirts; that he has not been consulted about it; that he has not consented to it; that no such prices have been fixed under his authority and, if the Deputy has any particulars of the case he has in mind the Minister will have the matter investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is this: some weeks ago the Minister announced, in reply to a question put down by me, that he was going to introduce a system for the control of cotton textiles, linings and certain other textiles in order to ensure that what supplies were available would be used for the greatest advantage of the greatest number.  He said that 75 per cent. of the linings would be directed to the makers-up. Then he came to shirting and said he had decided that 100 per cent of the available shirting must go to the <Col N="529" /> makers-up as well, in order that the consumers of shirts, those who use them, would be assured of getting supplies of shirts at the lowest possible cost.  He then proceeded to give effect to that policy and when he gave effect to it he discovered that the large bulk of this printed shirting suitable for conversion into tunic shirts was coming, under the British Board of Trade regulations, from two or three manufacturers of low-grade shirting in Manchester.  There are technical reasons why that should have been so, into which we need not now go.  It appeared most convenient that a small group of makers-up should be established, and that one firm amongst them should bring in all the cotton print intended for tunic shirts from the Manchester manufacturers and distribute it when it got here amongst the persons whom the Minister designated, and in the proportions that the Minister thought right.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the shirting was delivered here and the Dublin Shirt and Collar Company proceeded to distribute it, in accordance with the Minister's instructions, amongst the makers-up and a very small percentage of other persons who were entitled to quotas of the material which they ordinarily got made up on contract, though they themselves are not manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The invoiced price of this shirting cloth was 1/0½d. per yard.  Pre-war, when a shirt was made on full lines, it took 39 yards to make a dozen of tunic shirts.  Under the Minister's new regulation in controlling the size of shirts, 37 yards are allowed for the dozen shirts.  You can, therefore, multiply 1/0½d. by 37, giving, approximately, 38/6 for the material required to manufacture one dozen shirts.  I have no intimate information of manufacturers' costings in making shirts but I do know what makers-up will charge you if you send your material to them to cut, make and trim it.  There are manufacturers in this country who, in addition to manufacturing their own materials, offer a service to cut the cloth, make it up and trim it, put on buttons and collar bands, and such like, for a fixed sum per dozen.  The <Col N="530" /> quotation for that service up to six weeks ago, was 24/6 per dozen shirts. That is to say, if you deliver 37 yards of cloth to a cut, make and trim merchant, he will return you a dozen shirts made up for 24/6 as payment for his service.  Bear in mind that when he quoted the 24/6 he had not only paid his own costs in making up the shirts but had some profit on it, as all such men have in that business.</P>
    <P>Let us assume, however, that since that quotation was made, six weeks ago, there has been some increase in costs.  Let us assess that increase at 3/- a dozen.  That would mean a quotation to-day to cut, make and trim would be 27/6, that is allowing a margin.  27/6 and 38/6 make 66/- a dozen.  I ask Deputies to remember that the price for making up that I am quoting to them is a price for a cut, make and trim service but the persons whom I am indicting are the manufacturers who cut, make and trim for themselves and who have to pay no profit on that service.</P>
    <P>I am only giving the figures I have personal knowledge of, but, taking these figures&mdash;and they are figures which leave the manufacturer who is operating on first costs a generous margin&mdash;the cost of the shirts manufactured from this textile which cost 1/0½ a yard, is ? per shirt, or 66/-per dozen.  I have seen an invoice for these shirts from a manufacturer to a wholesaler, and the invoice reads: &ldquo;One dozen of shirts, 108/-.&rdquo;  I have seen an invoice for these shirts to a retailer and the price charged to the retailer is 126/- per dozen.  The wholesaler is buying the shirt which cost ? for 9/-, and the retailer is buying the shirt which cost 5/6 for 10/6.  I have seen these shirts in a Dublin shop window offered to a working boy for 14/11.  So that the shirt which begins its history at a modest 5/6, owing to the economical restrictions placed upon it by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of this State, arrives at the user of the shirt for the modest price of 14/11.  5/6 from 14/11 leaves 9/5.  A shirt costs 5/6, but getting the shirt from the manufacturers' premises on to the man's back costs 9/5.  It would be much cheaper <Col N="531" /> to buy the shirt in Valparaiso, pay the current costs of transport to Lisbon, tranship it there, bring it by the Irish Mercantile Marine to Dublin, send a brass band down to meet it, and carry it home in triumph.  You would still have it at home for less than it costs to bring it from the Irish manufacturer's factory to Marlborough Street.  The Minister blandly says to me that he does not know anything about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Minister consulted? If he was not consulted, why was he not consulted?  Having insisted upon the delivery of all this cloth to the manufacturers, why did not the Minister say to them: &ldquo;Show me now what the costs of producing a shirt from this cloth will be.  Inasmuch as I am giving you a monopoly, show me the margin of profit you want to make, and see that there is endorsed upon the shirt a retail price which will bear a reasonable relation to the cost of making it&rdquo;?  Mind you, I think interference of that kind in ordinary trade is highly undesirable in normal times, but, if you take control of this cloth and place its entire disposition in the hands of a small ring of private manufacturers who are working for profit, if you are going to eliminate absolutely all possibility of competition, then you are bound to regulate the price most rigidly from the moment of manufacture <Col N="532" /> to the point of consumption, and, having left a reasonable margin between the manufacturers' costs and the price to the consumer, let the wholesaler, the retailer and the manufacturer fight it out between them as to how that profit will be split up.  That is the only way of reintroducing into the trade some element of competition. If five manufacturers have each an allocation of this cloth, let them fight it out between one another as to what price they will charge for it.  The retailers will not sell it unless they are given some margin of profit, and the manufacturers cannot dispose of it if the retailers will not act as distributing agents for them.  I affirm that the figures quoted by me are incontrovertibly true.  I say that the failure of the Minister to know all those facts before I directed his attention to them is in itself a scandal.  I say that the possibility of making such a profit while the Minister is supposed to be functioning as Minister is a great scandal, and, now that his attention has been directed to the matter, if he permits such things to continue I consider that it will be worse than a scandal.</P>

      <P>My difficulty in dealing with the Deputy's question is that I cannot even grasp what he is driving at because the statements made by him are so unrelated to any facts that I know of.  It is for that reason that I asked him to give particulars of the case he has in mind, so that I could find out what he is getting at.  If he means by his question that the price for shirts charged to the retail trade represents a profit of approximately 100 per cent. on the cost to the manufacturers&mdash;that the manufacturers are taking a price which is twice as great as the total costs of manufacture&mdash;that is nonsense.  If he means that they are making 100 per cent. gross profit, that is still nonsense.  Every manufacturer of shirts in this State is working on a fixed profit margin.  That margin of profit is fixed by the Department of Supplies.  Every manufacturer of shirts in this State, with one possible exception, has adhered strictly to the margin fixed.  Their accounts are examined.  Their auditors are interviewed. <Col N="533" /> The various costings shown in the accounts are examined in detail, and, on the basis of the information made available through those accounts and through the examination of their auditors, I am satisfied that none of them has departed from the fixed margin of gross profit determined in relation to each firm by my Department, with one possible exception.  I say there is one possible exception because there is one firm from which we have had difficulty in getting accounts in the form that we want them.  They may or may not be acting contrary to the arrangement made with the Department of Supplies; I cannot say definitely that they are.  We do not fix, and obviously, could not fix, the actual price to be charged by the manufacturer for each garment, but the margin of profit which the manufacturer is entitled to take over and above the actual costs of production is fixed.  That profit, of course, is nothing like either 100 per cent. on costs or 100 per cent. gross profit, whichever the Deputy means.</P>

      <P>I do not know, Sir, what your authority is in this House, and whether Deputy Dillon has full liberty to interrupt.  I want to speak. I am entitled to speak, and I ask you to see that I am allowed to speak.  It is possible that firms that have adhered strictly to the profit arrangements for the last three years have suddenly decided not to adhere to them.  In any case, if Deputies know that anything like that is happening they have a duty to give evidence to that effect to the Department to see that action will be taken.  I do not believe it is happening.  I believe that Deputy Dillon falls for every fool's story that he is told, and that someone <Col N="536" /> has been pulling his leg.  If there is anything whatever in the suggestion that he has made, why is he so reluctant to give information which will enable inquiries to be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been giving it for the last ten minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that shirt manufacturers are all working on fixed margins of profit determined by my Department.  I will admit that there is at the present time the possibility that the margins of profit taken by the wholesale and retail distributors of shirts are unduly high.  I have not evidence that that is so, but the possibility is there, and it is for that reason that an attempt is being made by an Order which is now coming into force to fix the margins of profit which may be taken by wholesale and retail distributors. Whether that attempt will be as successful as I hope, I cannot forecast.  It is clearly very difficult to operate price control measures effectively in relation to this trade, but the attempt is being made.  It is, however, based on the assumption that the manufacturers of shirts and of other apparel are at present effectively controlled in the margins of profit that they can take, and I believe that they are being effectively controlled.  I believe that any story to the contrary told to Deputy Dillon is just nonsense. If he thinks otherwise it is open to him to produce whatever information he has so that it can be examined.  If he does produce it&mdash;I do not believe he will because I do not believe that he has any information&mdash;I promise him that it will be examined.</P>
