    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Shortage of Strong Boots and Repairing Materials.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware of the serious shortage of strong boots for working men; also of the difficulty of getting leather, sprigs and hemp for patching and repairing such boots, and if he will take steps to ensure the manufacture of a sufficiency of these boots to meet the normal requirements of the working man and also secure as far as possible the necessary repairing outfit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there has been a reduction in the quantity of heavy boots available for working men.  This is due to reduced production resulting from the shortage of certain raw materials. I am also aware that boot repairers are experiencing difficulty in getting sufficient supplies of repairing requisites. In the case of leather, I understand that the tanners have increased their deliveries to the repair trade considerably above pre-war level, but it appears that these additional supplies are not sufficient to meet the greatly increased demand for repairs.  My Department is at present investigating the matter with a view to seeing how the needs of the repair trade can best be met and whether there is any possibility of increasing the output of heavy types.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supply of sprigs and hemp presents much greater difficulty under present arrangements.  Every effort is <Col N="944" /> being made to secure increased supplies of sprigs for the repair trade.  A substitute for hemp is now being manufactured in this country and limited supplies are being distributed through the usual trade channels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not seem to hold out any hope that there will be an increase in the supply of strong boots for working men, at least in the immediate future.  Would it be possible for the Minister to see that the manufacturers will concentrate on supplying strong boots for the men who are in the front line trenches at the moment producing much-needed foodstuffs and let those who are accustomed to using lighter boots content themselves with supplies now available and with whatever can be done in the way of repairs for the time being?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The leather used in the manufacture of lighter boots would not be of much use in the manufacture of strong boots such as the Deputy has in mind.  I would not like to say that there is no possibility of an increase in the supply of strong boots.  Arrangements are being made to establish such control over production as will ensure that the maximum output of heavy boots will be effected.  Of course, that will be determined largely by the supply of the necessary materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the tanneries have ample supplies of strong leather, and yet the manufacturers are not producing the strong boots.  Is that true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The supply of sole leather is good; we have nearly all the sole leather we require.  The supply of upper leather, while it is good, is not sufficient to cover full requirements. The demand for sole leather for repairs is much heavier than in ordinary times because of the absence of protectors, and the like.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any hope of increasing production, will the Minister see that the output of strong boots will be increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in certain districts no sole leather has been received for almost three months?  Is he satisfied that there is an equitable distribution of the sole leather available?  Is he aware that a number of boot repairing shops have closed down because they were not able to get supplies of sole leather from the wholesalers or manufacturers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible that there is a scarcity of sole leather in certain districts, but supplies are distributed through the normal trade channels.  The actual quantity of sole leather being distributed for repairs is nearly 200 per cent. of the pre-war usage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider the advisability of rationing the available sole leather among the boot and shoe repair shops in the country districts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication of statistics of the kind asked for in the first part of the Deputy's question has been suspended since the outbreak of the emergency for reasons of public policy.  The average cost per barrel of wheat imported during the period mentioned in the question was 65/10½d. per barrel, c.i.f.  Since December 1st, 1942, however, reduced freights have operated on the Atlantic route and the present average cost of wheat shipped direct to Irish ports is 50/7½d. per barrel.</P>

      <P>As the Land Commission only took possession of the Waller estate (comprising 597 acres) on the 2nd of February, 1943, it is not possible to have a scheme prepared for the division of the lands this year.  A portion of the lands was recently let by public auction for tillage and grazing on the usual conditions of auction for such lettings&mdash;approximately 100 acres for tillage, 349 acres for grazing.  The balance of 148 acres of callow land will be let for meadow in due course.  It is not possible to state the net profit (if any) derived from letting the lands until the various items of debit and credit are accounted for, but the aim of such lettings is to provide income as a set-off against the interest payable from the appointed day on the land bonds representing the purchase money of the estate.

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  There are five Army Pensions Acts which deal with disablement due to Army service and they are the Army Pensions Acts, 1923, 1927, 1932, 1937 and 1941.  The purpose of the present Bill is to amend and extend the provisions of those Acts.  The Bill amends and extends the Acts in five different ways: (1) By extending the time limit within which disablement caused by disease attributable to service may be eligible for pension.  (2) By increasing the rates of pension payable for disablement due to injury received, or disease contracted, during the emergency period.  (3) By bringing members of the Army Nursing Service within the scope of the Army Pensions Acts. (4) By making dependents, other than widows and children, of deceased personnel <Col N="956" /> eligible for pensions.  (5) By providing special allowances for persons who are in possession of military service certificates under the Military Service Pensions Acts of 1924 or 1934 in respect of service during Easter Week, 1916, or who are in receipt of a wound or disability pension in respect of a wound received or a disease contracted during the said week and who, in addition, are incapable of self-support either by reason of age or permanent infirmity of mind or body.  Such, briefly and generally, are the five main objects sought to be achieved by the present Bill.</P>
      <P>Under Section 10 of the Army pensions Act, 1927, a person suffering from a disablement caused by disease attributable to service was entitled to a pension provided that the disablement was 80 per cent. at the date of examination by the Army Pensions Board, and was contracted before the 30th September, 1924.  The Army Pensions Act of 1937 amended this provision in two respects, (a) by allowing the disablement up to the 1st July, 1938, to reach 80 per cent.; and (b) by reducing the minimum percentage eligible for pension from 80 per cent. to 50 per cent. in cases which were refused solely on the grounds that the disablement was less than 80 per cent. at the date of examination by the Army Pensions Board.  In both instances, however, the qualification remained that the disease must have been contracted during the period commencing 1st April, 1922, and ending on the 30th September, 1924.  In other words, if the disease was contracted after the 30th September, 1924, it was not covered by the Acts no matter how grave the resultant disablement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The omission in the Acts to cover that period from the 1st October, 1924, onwards has frequently been the subject of adverse comment in this House, but hitherto we have not been able to cover it, because the view was taken that under the sheltered conditions of peace-time soldiering any disease which may have arisen could scarcely be said to arise out of any particular hardship, but would simply be an incident <Col N="957" /> which would have arisen in any circumstances and not necessarily out of Army service.  This argument, however, cannot be applied to the conditions under which the Army is serving since the proclamation of a state of emergency.  Those conditions, indeed, closely resemble those obtaining during the previous statutory period from the 1st April, 1922, to the 30th September, 1924, and, if anything, the present conditions are more arduous and strenuous.  Accordingly, this Bill provides pensions, both disability and married, for disablement due to disease attributable to service when the disease is contracted during the emergency period beginning on the 3rd September, 1939.</P>
    <P>This is the effect of Section 3, sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) of the present Bill.  These sub-sections apply the provisions of the 1927 Act to disease contracted during the emergency period, but Section 6 deals with the same subject and applies the extensions of the 1937 Act to all such cases. Under the 1927 Act the minimum degree of disablement due to disease attributable to service had to be 80 per cent. before it could be pensionable, but the Act of 1937 reduced that minimum to 50 per cent.  Section 6 also makes the minimum degree to be 50 per cent. for pension purposes.  The position, therefore, is that if a person on examination by the Army Pensions Board is found to be 80 per cent. or over disabled due to disease he will be entitled to the rate set out in Parts I and II of Section 3, sub-section (5) of this Bill.  If the pension awarded be of a temporary character, and if on subsequent examination he is found to be less than 80 per cent., but at least 50 per cent. disabled, he will be entitled to a final pension of £1 per week, but if, on the other hand, at that first examination he is found to be less than 80 per cent. but at least 50 per cent. disabled, he will be entitled to 15/- a week final pension.</P>
    <P>The second feature of this Bill is that it increases the rates of pension payable in respect of disability whether due to disease or injury contracted during the emergency period.  The effect here is best shown by the case <Col N="958" /> of a private soldier totally disabled. Under the old rates his pension would be 26/- a week with, in the case of a married man, a married pension of 5/- a week.  The new rates will give such a man 42/- a week with, if married, a further married pension of 10/- a week. Both the disability and married pensions for other degrees of disablement are correspondingly increased.  In effect the increased rates are virtually those operative under the Army Pensions Act, 1923, which dealt with the active service of that period.  Moreover, under the various schemes of compensation for injuries sustained by members of such voluntary organisations as the L.D.F. or the A.R.P. service, total disablement is assessed at 30/- a week with, in the case of a married man, 7/6 a week for his wife and 4/- a week for each child, within a maximum of 72/6 a week including any allowance in respect of loss of earnings.  Hence, excluding the payment in respect of earning capacity it will be seen that the new rates of pension payable to a married soldier totally disabled, compare favourably with the allowances payable under the schemes to a married man totally disabled with a wife and three children. These new rates of pension are effected by Section 3, sub-section (5) of the Bill which, it will be noted in passing, only deals with cases occurring during the emergency period thus leaving intact the application of the old rates to cases pensioned before the commencement of the emergency.</P>
    <P>Little need be said about the third object of the Bill&mdash;to bring the members of the Army Nursing Service within the scope of the Acts during the period of the emergency.  The Sisters were previously covered by the Defence Forces pensions schemes which fix pension in relation to service; but they were not covered by the Army Pensions Acts in respect of wound or disease contracted during and arising out of service.  It is only just and equitable that the members of the Army Nursing Service should now be afforded the protection of those Acts.</P>
    <P>The fourth object of the Bill is to make provision for the dependents of <Col N="959" /> deceased personnel other than their widows and children.  The Army Pensions Act of 1923 made provision not only for widows and children of deceased personnel, but also for their dependents, such as their parents and grandparents, together with their brothers and sisters when permanently incapacitated.  The Act of 1927, however, which dealt with peacetime conditions, provided only, as far as personnel discharged after 1st October, 1924, were concerned, for the widows and children of deceased personnel; and now in the present Bill we are reverting to the old position under the 1923 Act by providing for the parents, grandparents, brothers and sisters, as well as for the widows and orphans of deceased personnel.  The Bill, however, differs in two important respects from the previous Acts.  In the first place, it provides for more than one allowance in respect of totally dependent relatives, and in the second, it provides an allowance instead of a gratuity to persons who were not totally, but who can be shown to have been mainly, dependent on a deceased person.  The allowances provided by the Bill will be £52 a year in the case of an officer, and £26 a year in that of a soldier.  These allowances and the conditions appertaining thereto are covered by Section 5, sub-section (5) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, the fifth purpose of the Bill is to deal with the very special problem created by the passage of time and by economic circumstances of men and women who fought during Easter Week, 1916, and who are not incapable of self-support by reason of age or permanent infirmity.  Section 7 applies to every person who is in possession of a military service certificate in respect of service during Easter Week, 1916, or who is in receipt of a disability pension in respect of a wound or injury received or a disability contracted during that week, provided that the person is incapable of self-support by reason of age or permanent infirmity of mind or body and that his or her yearly means from all sources do not exceed a certain sum.  For a single man or woman that sum will be £78 a <Col N="960" /> year; if married, £97 10s. od. a year, and for each child the sum is raised by £10 8s. 0d. a year.  In other words, if a single person be totally destitute he or she will be entitled to £78 a year, or if married to £97 10s. 0d. a year and £10 8s. 0d. a year will be added in respect of each child.  On the other hand, if the person be not totally destitute, but be in receipt of a service or disability pension, his means will be brought up to the scales of allowances mentioned.  It will thus be seen that every person qualifying under this section will be entitled from all sources, if single, to 30/- a week, if married to 37/6 a week, and to an additional sum of 4/- a week in respect of each child.</P>
    <P>Section 8, 9 and 10 are administrative provisions.  In some cases which will fall under this Bill <i>ex-gratia</i> grants have already been made on the understanding that no statutory provision had been or would be made by way of compensation.  Now that the cases will be covered statutorily by this Bill, if it becomes law, it is only equitable that power should be vested in the Minister to recover such grants if he deems fit.  That is done by Section 8 of the Bill.  Again, Section 9 prevents the widow or child of an officer from receiving a double pension in respect of the same bereavement&mdash;one under the present Bill and the other under schemes made under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Acts. Finally, Section 10 is simply intended to relieve the Army Pensions Board of any work which is not strictly of a medical character.  As the Acts stand at present, a fairly large volume of work, in which no medical considerations arise, has to be referred to the board, and that reference occupies a proportion of the board's time, which could otherwise be devoted to work of a strictly medical nature.  Hence, as we anticipate that under this Bill we shall have a very large number of applications, and as we are anxious that they should be dealt with as speedily as possible, power is being taken not to refer to the board any matter in which we consider that their investigation would serve no useful purpose.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to offer to, or no criticism to make of, the main principles of this Bill.  In the main, the principal criticism we have had to offer on the Bill is that it is a bit late in being brought forward. These Army Pension Bills are becoming more and more complicated from the point of view of the ordinary Deputy.  Any of these Bills standing alone and read by itself is now absolutely meaningless, in so far as these Bills are either amending or extending enactments referring to previous Bills.  In the course of the Minister's remarks he told us, with regard to disabilities, that it was decided that disabilities other than wounds arising during a normal period were not and would not be pensionable. I do not know if I misunderstood the Minister because my idea of the previous Acts is to the effect that the Act of 1923 dealt with wounds, that the Act of 1927 dealt with disabilities other than wounds, but disabilities which had to have their origin prior to the 1st October, 1924, that the Act of 1932 extended those two Bills to bodies other than the National Army, and that the Act of 1937 made the disability and wound clauses apply to disabilities and wounds which arose prior to July, 1938.  I am now asking the Minister am I incorrect in that or is it incorrect that no disabilities were covered which arose between 1924 and 1938?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On that particular point, I can see a case for the Departmental point of view.  I can see a case can be made but it is a case which I think should not be accepted without very close investigation.  It is reasonable enough to say that, in the ordinary life of a soldier in a small army in peace time, any disease which arises, very often would have arisen if he were a civilian.  That is true in nine cases out of ten, but it would not apply in the one case out of the ten. Even in that small army in peace times there are occasions of manoeuvres, of exposure and of hardship to which the ordinary civilian has not to submit, and diseases, not very many but certain <Col N="962" /> diseases leaving permanent disability, may arise directly out of a man's occupation as a soldier.  The very fact that it is true to state that, in the great majority of cases, that disease might have occurred if the man were never in the Army, does not remove responsibility from the Department for meeting the exceptional case which does arise because of a man's Army service.  The exceptional case should be differentiated from the bulk of the cases, not by broad Departmental policy, but by an expert medical board functioning on behalf of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's attention during recent years has been called to a certain number of glaring cases where there was no question about the fact that the disability was attributable to service but in which the disability could not be made pensionable because of the Departmental policy.  I myself have got a certain number of replies from the Minister's Department, not contesting the fact that the disease arose on service and was attributable to service, but pointing out that these cases were not covered by any existing Pensions Acts.  What I have got, other Deputies have got, and if the decision is as now stated by the Minister, that it is the considered Departmental policy that any permanent disability, no matter how grave, arising on service between 1st October, 1924, and September, 1939, clearly attributable to service, should not be covered by pension, then I submit that that decision should be reconsidered, because it is evidently on the face of it an unjust decision&mdash;unjust to the individual and unfair to the State.  It is unreasonable to say that if a man gets a crippled leg through an injury attributable to service, you will pay a pension according to the scale laid down, but if he gets a crippled leg through disease attributable to service you will pay him nothing.  It is unfair to the soldier in so far as it discriminates between individuals equally disabled through similar service, and the disability in each case being attributable to that service.  It is really an indefensible policy.  It is defensible only on the ground that the <Col N="963" /> majority of cases of permanent disability through disease would have occurred if the individual were never in the Army.  The decision ruling in such cases should not be taken by the Minister or the Minister's Department. You have competent people in your service, competent experts who are well qualified to decide which is the isolated case which is clearly and definitely due to service and attributable to it.  In those few small number of cases, a responsibility rests on the State just as clearly as in the case of a wound injury.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to turn up his own files and also the files of soldiers discharged from the Army, permanently disabled, the board finding that the disease which caused the disability was attributable to service.  Yet those men, State cripples, crippled in the State service, unable on account of disability to earn a living, were thrown on the rates merely because the bulk of these disabilities or a great number of them would have arisen if these men were never in the Army.  There is, however, a fraction, a percentage, be it ever so small, definitely linked with service and attributable to service and those cases should be met.  The sifting machine to discriminate between the ordinary case and the exceptional case should be a board of experts appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (b) of this Bill&mdash;the section extending it to emergency service with regard to married officers and soldiers &mdash;covers for pension purposes married officers and soldiers who either occupy married quarters or were in receipt of living-out married allowances.  The advisability of that particular clause, in its reference to pensions which will be due to wounds or disabilities during the emergency period, is very questionable. If this Bill goes through in that form, it is as certain as I am standing here that there will be an amending Bill before the emergency is 12 months older.  We are getting too many amending Bills, because we are taking not two but 22 bites out of every cherry that relates to the Department of Defence.  This Bill will give a pension to the widows and children of officers <Col N="964" /> and soldiers who are on the official married strength, that is, who are living in quarters or drawing official marriage living-out allowances.  The Minister knows as well as I do that there are a number of married officers and married men who are not officially married from the point of view of the Department of Defence, in so far as they married after a certain date, when the married establishment was full.  Does the Minister say to me that, if one of these officers or men is shot or killed as a result of a military accident, the widow and children will be left absolutely unprovided for? Does not the Minister know that a case will be made here when that arises and that he will bring in an amending Bill which will merely complicate things further and confuse us further, in so far as we will have an Army Pensions Bill, 1944, amending this Bill and half a dozen other Bills that went before?</P>
    <P>The place to provide for that is in this Bill, laying down that, if a man is married at the time of his accident or the time of his death, the clauses in this Bill will apply to his widow or his dependents as the case may be.  I am taking it that the meaning of this particular sub-section is confined to those officially married, from the point of view of the Department of Defence, and that it excludes those who are married, but not on the Army married establishment.  If that is so, I would ask the Minister to consider it in association with this Bill and not adopt the old policy of the Department of Defence&mdash;of knowing that a thing will arise, knowing that it will be a grave situation when it arises, knowing that when the grave situation arises a case will be put up which is unanswerable and that it will be met.  It is better to anticipate what is clearly in front of you and make provision for it when you have a Bill and not be amending that Bill before it is really 12 months old.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that there is nothing very contentious in this Bill and, as far as we are concerned, it is gratifying to note that provision is being made for <Col N="965" /> those serving during the emergency.  I am very interested in some cases I mentioned during the debate on a a recent Supplementary Estimate.  The people to whom I refer are those who, from 1916 onwards, contracted certain diseases&mdash;diseases either contracted or aggravated by their service.  It appears to me that the Department is altogether forgetting those men.  Time after time, Deputies come across those cases of men who served their country during the War of Independence from 1916 onwards and who contracted certain diseases.  In a great many cases, because of the exposure and hardship which they endured while &ldquo;on the run,&rdquo; they have now become almost permanent invalids.  Representations have been made repeatedly on their behalf.  I myself submitted some applications from time to time.  In many cases, two doctors' certificates have been given, but the Minister has turned a deaf ear to all appeals made to him.  I would ask him to do something under this Bill to meet cases of that kind.  He knows as well as I do the number of such cases in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not very long ago, I submitted a case to him myself where two doctors' certificates were submitted, but the Minister could only tell me that there was no machinery to deal with it.  I ask him, now that this opportunity is provided, to use it to do something for these unfortunate men.  They should not be forgotten by the country.  I am sure everybody in the country would be very satisfied to know that these men were provided for.  As a matter of fact, the men suffered such exposure and hardship during that period, being &ldquo;on the run&rdquo; and out at night lying in ditches and fields, that many of them contracted tuberculosis and passed away.  These men got nothing from the Government on account of their services.  At present, a man who got the slightest wound gets some recognition or pension, or a grant of some kind, but these men got nothing. I am surprised that the Minister&mdash; knowing his record as I do, and knowing that he was in intimate touch with these men during those stormy periods <Col N="966" />&mdash;has not taken the opportunity to do something in this Bill for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I avail of the opportunity to ask the Minister two or three short questions.  The Minister may remember that, about 12 months ago, I asked a question about an old I.R.A. man who was 70 years of age, and who got an old age pension of 10/- and two food vouchers.  He drew the pension and food vouchers for a year or two.  Shortly after getting his old age pension, he got an award from the I.R.A. Pensions Board sitting at the time.  That gave him 10/- or 10/6.  He had already a miserable 6/- a week pension from some other Department. His old age pension and the two food vouchers were withdrawn.  I asked at that time if that I.R.A. man could have the right to forfeit his 10/- I.R.A. pension so that he could get the old age pension and the two food vouchers.  The Minister sincerely said he regretted he had no power to give the man permission to choose the better of the two sums.</P>
      <P>This aged man, who served his country in the days gone by, according to his lights, would not be allowed to draw the full amount of his old age pension of 10/- per week, plus the two food vouchers, because he had an I.R.A. pension of 10/-.  As a result of that, he actually lost 2/- a week, because he would not be allowed by the Minister's Department to draw the two pensions combined.  The means test was applied in his case, and the result was that the unfortunate man was left with only 16/- a week.  Now, I was led to believe by the Minister, on a former occasion, that when an opportunity would arise he would try to remedy that state of affairs and see that better terms would be afforded to such unfortunate men, but it would seem that that has not been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another case with which I should like the Minister to deal, and that is the case of a man who was a serving soldier&mdash;I think his name is McElhinney&mdash;and who met with an accident while on duty.  He was knocked down by a motor-car and received certain injuries, as a result of <Col N="967" /> which he has a short leg.  He was discharged from the Army because of his disability, and he took an action at law against the owners of the lorry which knocked him down.  I think he got the sum of £300 in compensation as a result of the action he took.  Now £300 is a rather small compensation for a man who has been enjoying fairly reasonable pay, but the Government, or the Minister's Department, will not give that man his pension until every 1d. of the £300 is either exhausted or refunded.  The man concerned went to law and secured £300 compensation for his injuries, but all that has happened is that the Army Pensions Department benefits by that, instead of the unfortunate man who met with those injuries.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Army Pensions Department decided that they would give the man concerned an artificial boot or something like that to help him along, but the boot supplied was of a different colour from the other boot, and it would appear that the Army authorities could not get a boot of the same colour.  According to my information, the Army authorities said that they had no funds at their disposal to give this man a brown boot to match his other boot, and I would appeal to the Minister to take up such a matter as that.  I think that the Army authorities should not be so niggardly in such cases as these, and that this man should be given his full pension as well as what he is entitled to as a result of the legal action he took. After all, what would £300 amount to? I suggest that it would only amount to about two years' wages on his ordinary scale of pay.  It would be exhausted at the end of about two years, at the man's ordinary scale of pay, and, instead of his getting the benefit of that compensation, the result is that the Government has benefited by his action at law.  I would put this question to the Minister: Supposing that the man concerned lost his action in court, would the Army authorities have paid his law costs?  I am satisfied that they would not.  In this case, however, he won his action, and the only people who have benefited by that are the Army authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> I have a third case in mind&mdash;that of a man who was accidentally shot about five or six years ago.  He left a wife and six children, and the ages of the children ranged from, approximately, 11 years down to six months.  This, at any rate, is the statement that has been made to me.  The man had been a captain in the Army, but when it came to a question of the payment of a pension, his widow was awarded only the pension of a lieutenant&mdash;£45 per annum, I think, plus the usual allowances for the children&mdash;because her husband had not the required number of years of service as a captain. Now, it appears to me that that is a sad case.  This woman and her children had been enjoying a captain's pay during the lifetime of her husband, with the usual standard of allowances for the children of a captain, but when the man concerned is shot, in the course of his duty, the pension she receives is reduced to the standard of that of a lieutenant; and to-day all she can draw is the pension and allowances that would be awarded in the case of a lieutenant.  I think that that is wrong, and I would appeal to the Minister to see that when men who served the State, either in the early days before this State was brought about, or who are serving the State to-day, meet with accidents in the course of their duty, whatever awards are made to them should not be deducted from their pensions.</P>
    <P>I would refer again to the other case I had in mind&mdash;that of the man with the old age pension.  I am sure that a number of Deputies in this House must know the man to whom I am referring, and I would appeal to the Minister to look into such matters.  On the whole, I think the Minister is taking the right steps to deal with this matter, but I should like him to take further steps to meet such cases as I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  The only thing is that, as I saw the amendment there, I thought it was intended to take the Committee Stage to-day and I am glad that that is not intended.  What I want to point out is that we have certain defence measures, provisions for pensions for soldiers, and so on, but no clear idea at all as to what standard of life we want to defend in this country, and if we are to judge by this measure the standard of life in this country, then the question arises here again, as it arose before, of what is the use of spending money to defend the State at all if there is not to be a proper standard of life.  When a scheme of compensation for civilians who were injured through bombing raids, and so on, was introduced here, the Government laid down a certain scale, such as that a married man, with children, who was permanently disabled as a result of bombing, would get 30/- a week, for the rest of his life, to maintain himself and his wife and whatever family he might have.  When that was challenged here, the only answer we got from the Government was that it was as much as the country could afford. Happily, however, a changed outlook on that situation came about as a result of a subsequent discussion in the Seanad, and a further Order was issued, which provided 30/- a week for the man, 7/6 a week for his wife and, I think, something like 5/- a week for each child.  Whatever may be the implications of that standard of compensation with regard to civilians, when we look at the measure that is before us now, we find that that standard, apparently, is set up as a subsistence standard for a person who has served his country very well in the past and who is now leaving that service, as a result of accident or disability, and who has no other income or any possibility of earning any other income, to sustain himself and his wife and family.  We ought to have an opportunity of hearing from the Minister on the Committee Stage what the background of calculation is upon which it is decided by the State that <Col N="970" /> men who, in the service of the State in a military capacity, become completely disabled and have no chance of an income in life are to be reduced to a position in which they will get 30/- a week for themselves, 7/6 for their wives and 4/- for their children.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of the question of standard disclosed in Part I on page 3 of the Bill.  The Minister indicated that officers and men serving in the National Army now were serving under more rigorous and more exacting circumstances than the men to whom the 1923 Army Pensions Act applied, and he is removing the Schedule from the Army Pensions Act of 1927, a Schedule which should never have been in any Army Pensions Act. It was introduced in 1927, and subjected to a very considerable amount of criticism.  It was brought in, I imagine, by the rather narrower mind of those people who have to defend the financial interests of the State as distinct from those who have to defend the liberties and lives of the people. It was introduced at a time when the National Army had done its business, when we were entering a period of peace in which people thought that there might never be an army required again, but that there might be a few &ldquo;chancers&rdquo; among the men of the old Army who might make demands for disability pensions or pensions of one kind or another, based on service given in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Schedule in the Army Pensions Act of 1927 contained a provision that a private of the National Army who had become completely disabled as a result of military service and who had a family would get 26/- a week for himself and 5/- a week to keep his family. He was given 31/- per week to keep himself and his family, which was 1/- better than the compensation scheme introduced here originally, but it was nevertheless a proposal which, even in the circumstances of 1927, should never have been made.  So far as men are concerned, the Minister is now going back to the Schedule which accompanied the 1923 Act, and, instead of the 26/- a week for the permanently disabled private, there is to be a sum of 42/-, and instead of 5/- per week <Col N="971" /> for the family, there is to be a sum of 10/- per week.  I think that even that 10/- per week requires to be examined and explained in the light of our present outlook on social matters.</P>
    <P>I come now to the Schedule in which the change in respect of officers is made and I ask the Minister to direct his attention to it.  Under the Bill, an officer who is 100 per cent. disabled will receive a pension of 60 per cent. of his annual pay at the date of discharge, or a sum of £120 per annum, whichever is the greater.  Under the 1923 Act, an officer who was 100 per cent. disabled got a pension at the rate of £200 per annum.  This Bill contemplates circumstances in which, instead of getting £200 per annum, a completely disabled officer will get £120 per annum.  If he suffers from 90 per cent. disability, instead of the £180 per annum which the 1923 Act gave, it is contemplated by this Bill that there may be circumstances in which he will get only £108 per annum.  If there is 50 per cent. disability, the Bill makes provision for circumstances in which he may get only £60, whereas under the 1923 Act the pension would have been £100 per annum.</P>
    <P>It is particularly desirable, when we are dealing with pensions and disability allowances for men who are serving in the military forces to-day, that we here should have a clear idea which will enable us to be satisfied that, if these men are disabled permanently, or to the extent of 90 or 80 per cent., we are making such provision for them that they will not have to go to the poor law system in order to be enabled to exist, not to speak of being enabled to exist with a feeling of comfort and satisfaction, and a feeling that they have an honourable status in the country.  It is because I am not satisfied with the whole background which discloses itself here that I suggest that the Committee Stage ought not to be taken until next week, so that all Deputies may have a chance of considering the matter.  None of us will be in a position to put forward an amendment which would be acceptable as being in order because it would <Col N="972" /> mean increasing the charge under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I, nevertheless, think that every section of the House should face the responsibility now of contemplating the position of the officer or soldier of any rank, permanently disabled or losing his health under the rigorous training which the Army is going through at present, and of satisfying itself that when this amending measure is passed, a standard of compensation is not being set which will leave soldiers in the Army at present uncertain as to whether they can, with a sense of duty and responsibility to their families, risk their health or their lives, and with the feeling that if they do, they will leave their families behind in such a position that they will have to go to the poor law authorities for assistance to help them to eke out an existence. If we allow this occasion to pass without bringing our minds to bear in a concentrated way on that aspect, we are doing a very serious disservice to the State as a whole.</P>

      <P>I have in mind a few cases of men who joined the Army for the period of the emergency, and who were discharged disabled, the disability being caused by service.  I understand that these men cannot qualify for a disability pension, because, under the Army Pensions Acts, they must have a certain minimum period of service before they can apply.  I should like the Minister to examine cases of the kind, with a view to seeing whether the period of service could not be reduced so as to enable men who joined the Army for the emergency, and who were discharged permanently disabled, to qualify for some pension, because otherwise they will be very badly off.</P>

      <P>I feel that no Bill that could be brought in or that the mind of man could conceive would satisfy everybody.  I have not attempted in this Bill to satisfy everybody, because I know that that would be an impossible task.  What I have tried to do in this particular Bill is to make the conditions that I found existing better than they were.  When this emergency <Col N="973" /> started and when I was not very long in the Department I found that individuals who contracted disease which arose out of their service and who were discharged from the Army for that reason were not entitled to be compensated and I set out to see what I could do to right what I felt was an injustice.  When the unfortunate Glen of Imaal catastrophe occurred I contacted some of the soldiers involved in it and found their cases were very sad cases and I set out to see if it were not possible to better their lot from the pensionable point of view.  This Bill represents the efforts which I made in that direction.  I never had any illusions that this Bill would meet the demands and desires of all the Deputies.  I knew that was impossible.  Deputies had been making representations to me in respect to various types of cases, many of which I felt would not come under the present Bill, and I warned the Deputies of that on the occasion of the Supplementary Estimate.  I think I said in so many words that Deputies should not regard this Bill as being a cure-all for all the complaints they were receiving.  There again I feel that there will be still a large number of people left outside this Bill who will feel that they had a perfect right to be inside it.</P>

I know it is unnecessary to point out that in Deputy Mulcahy's own time the condition of affairs which I am trying now to right existed; that his Government then found the same difficulty that I find and, therefore, he did not find it possible, or the Government of that day did not find it possible to increase the pensions any more than this Government were able to do during the years before the emergency.</P>

A week or two ago I distinctly heard Deputy O'Higgins, in the course of a speech, saying that he never on any occasion adopted the rôle of prophet. On this occasion he has done so.  He has assured the House that if we do not alter certain things in this Bill we will have to bring in an amending Bill.  I will not dispute the possibility that that may happen.  He referred to the fact that already we have had to produce a short drafting amendment. I merely circulated that to-day in order that Deputies would have an opportunity of seeing it and of realising that it was only a drafting amendment; that if this sub-section were not added, certain things could not take place in regard to payments to certain persons under the Bill.  But, as I have said, the Bill, so far as I am concerned, represents the best that I found it possible to secure.  The extent of the period between my setting out to bring this matter to its present position and the present time is due to the fact that the Bill had to be carefully <Col N="975" /> considered and discussed, and rediscussed, and this represents the result of that consideration and discussion.</P>
      <P>The points raised by Deputy O'Higgins in respect to Section 3 (b) are not likely to arise, in my opinion, for the reason that there are very few officers or men who are not on the married establishment.  If there are some who are not on the married establishment, then they have not complied with the regulations but they will in time become eligible.</P>
      <P>If I am not misinterpreting what Deputy Corish said, I think the cases which he raised are already covered by the 1932 Act.  If these people contracted disease during the periods which the Deputy mentioned by reason of their service, owing to lying out in fields or anything else, they had a full opportunity of presenting evidence to the disability pension board, and I presume that they were unable to satisfy the board that the disability from which they were suffering was attributable to service.  I cannot say anything more about that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne referred to a man who received a pension and was unable to drop some other pension&mdash;I think it was an I.R.A. pension.  He was anxious to hold on to some other pension.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Emergency Powers (No. 234) Order, 1942&mdash;Motion to Annul.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Emergency Powers (No. 234) Order, 1942, made by the Government on the 29th October, 1942, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>It is not intended, in moving this motion, to do what would appear on the face of it to be the object of the motion.  This is the only way in which the House can have a debate on the Order.  The Minister and the Government know that this motion was not put down in any spirit of hostility to the Order.  It was put down in order that we may have a discussion which will reveal Government policy and in order to create an opportunity for the House and the country to understand the purpose and the operation of the Order.  Deputy Cogan and I, who have done this annually since 1939, feel rather flattered that the Minister and the Government are now coming to realise the value of the suggestions we made three or four years ago.  We are glad to see that, even though it is done in a rather clumsy and, in my opinion, not the best way, an attempt is being made to secure that the principal crop which we want to increase, namely, wheat, will get some attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to this Order there was no Tillage Order that made it obligatory on any farmer to grow wheat.  Even this Order does not make it obligatory on a farmer to grow wheat, but it gives what I consider a very wrong power to an inspector, a power not definitely expressed in the Order, but a power such as he might suggest on his own, to tell a farmer how much wheat he is to grow, within certain limits, and where he is to grow it.  I do not think that <Col N="979" /> is right or fair and we would definitely oppose that section of the Order if procedure would permit us to do so.  We have to take the whole Order and move its annulment if we object to any portion of it.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has adopted a very bad principle in that connection. We are satisfied that the Minister will do his best to get suitable inspectors, but we all know it is a very difficult thing to get suitable inspectors to go through the country for that purpose. There is a grave danger of abuse of power; there is a danger with regard to the selection of unsuitable sites for the growing of wheat.  Even though that might be done with the best intentions in the world, such power should not be permitted.  I think it would have been much better if the Minister had adopted the suggestion we have been making every year since the emergency arose, namely, that, realising we required a certain amount of wheat to give us a sufficiency of bread, and being aware of the area of arable land, it was merely a matter of arranging what percentage of that arable land would give us the necessary quantity of wheat.  I think the Minister should have calculated that X per cent. of our arable land was required to give us a sufficiency of wheat and the owners of land to whom the Tillage Order applies should be obliged to till a definite percentage of their land and crop it with wheat.  I do not think there is any more effective way of doing it.</P>
    <P>I know that in generalisations of this kind one might class as arable land the type of land that might not be the best for wheat growers, and it might be better to get a little more wheat grown in some areas rather than have a flat percentage.  Of course, the Minister will realise that it is well nigh impossible to attain perfection in any wheat-growing scheme.  I think the only fair way would be to fix a flat percentage calculated to meet our requirements, and I would be inclined to go a little beyond the sufficiency standard and leave a margin to cope with a bad harvest&mdash;something in order to be on the safe side.  I believe that <Col N="980" /> 5 per cent. of the arable land under wheat would give us a sufficient quantity to meet our needs.  If that is calculated to give us a bare sufficiency, I would not mind putting a decimal point or two on in order to safeguard the position.</P>
    <P>That would be much better than giving power to an inspector to tell a man how much wheat he should grow and where he should grow it.  Those who have grown more than any percentage would ever make it incumbent upon them to grow, and who will continue to grow wheat in large quantities, would resent such power, would resent being ordered out and told how much wheat they should grow and where they should grow it.  I would not object so much to being told how much wheat to grow, but I certainly would object to being told where to grow it.  I think such a position would be intolerable.  The Minister must have some reason for that, and I would like to know that reason.  I can conceive no reason sufficient to warrant such interference with the freedom of the citizen.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no exemptions. I have asked him from the start to make exemptions with regard to dairy land.  I think it is a pity that he did not do so.  If the emergency continues very much longer, the milk position in the City of Dublin may become very grave.  The arrangements for transporting milk to Dublin are, as the Government know very well, becoming more and more difficult.  If the transport position becomes worse, I cannot see how supplies of milk can be brought to Dublin.  As regards wheat, oats, barley and potatoes, they can be transported to the city at any time; but milk has to be transported at least once a day.  I think the safest thing would have been to conserve the dairy land in close proximity to Dublin, so that there would be the Minimum of transport.  That land should be conserved for dairying purposes rather than for tillage.  As a matter of fact, instead of encouraging tillage on dairy land, it would be better business to encourage dairying on tillage land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> I notice that the Minister has adopted the principle of a motion we submitted a couple of years ago and which, of course, was rejected.  He has adopted it only in the case of land entered on by himself or his representatives. That principle is that the crops produced on such land cannot be seized for annuities or rates.  When we introduced the motion some years ago, our idea was to have a kind of standstill Order with regard to arrears of rates and annuities&mdash;just to seal up the debt and leave it there until the emergency had passed and allow the owner of the land to carry out his obligations under the tillage Order and pay his current commitments.  The idea was that all arrears would be frozen until after the emergency.  That was then turned down by the Minister.  If he reflects for a moment, I think he will find that a better purpose would be served by clearing away the difficulties that certain farmers found themselves in by reason of their arrears, by freezing up their indebtedness for the time being and permitting them to till their land.  That would save a good deal of trouble and result in the production of more food.  I am quite satisfied that any land entered upon will not produce the same quota of food for the same outlay as land worked by a farmer&mdash;even by a bad farmer.</P>
    <P>I would like to have some points cleared up by the Minister.  In Part VII it is stated that if land is entered upon and used on behalf of the Minister, or for conacre, the buildings on the land can be used.  I should like to know if that includes the farmhouse. Is a right given, for instance, to a person who takes conacre, to seize the dwellinghouse on the land, or to dispossess the occupier or owner?  In reference to compulsory tillage, regard should be paid to what is being demanded.  If pressure is exerted at one point, it will have other ramifications throughout the economic system. When the Minister made an Order for the tilling of a percentage of land did he consider the rise in the price of the goods that the farmer has to buy and the consequent increased cost of production? Did he take into consideration the high cost of living of agricultural <Col N="982" /> workers?  The Minister is part and parcel of a Government that made a standstill Order that was amended; varied, amended again, and further varied within the last few days.  It was expressly stated that the object of the Order was to prevent a rise in prices and inflation.  The Minister is handling the most important job in this country at the present time.  It does not matter what manoeuvres we have, what war weapons we have, there is now really only one weapon of defence for the neutrality and the freedom of this country, and that is the plough.</P>
    <P>The greatest soldier in this country is the man behind the plough.  He is the greatest defender of our liberties and of our neutrality, as he is saving the State; yet he is the worst paid man in it.  The price of the produce of that man's toil is not guaranteed by this Order or by any Order made by the Government.  His price is controlled and, in reaching that controlled price, the Minister based his case upon the wage and general outgoings of farming. A price of 50/- a barrel was fixed for wheat last year, notwithstanding that imported wheat cost 65/10 per barrel.  We were told to-day that it would not be in the national interest to say how much wheat was imported. I can say that, in the national interest, none would be imported if as good a price had been paid for wheat grown here as we had to pay for imported wheat.  The 50/- paid for wheat last year was based on a wage paid throughout the greater part of the country&mdash;33/-.  To a small section 34/- was paid, and to a still smaller section, around the City of Dublin&mdash;I do not think it applied to the City of Cork&mdash;39/- was paid, but broken time was deducted.  Is there anybody working for such a wage except the unfortunate man who is producing food for the people and saving this country from surrender?  An Order has been made, which is operative from February 1, of this year, increasing these scheduled wages by 3/- per week.  In my area the wage payable is now 42/- per week, but broken time is deducted. On that wage and on other outgoings the Minister has fixed the same price for wheat this year as last year, 50/- <Col N="983" /> per barrel.  If 50/- was an equitable price last year, surely it is an inequitable price this year.  I put this question to the Minister: what man can, on 42/- per week, feed himself so as to be able to do a day's work?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The relationship is that farmers are obliged to till 25 per cent. of their land.  They are obliged to grow more wheat to the extent, and on the site, that the Minister's inspectors direct them.  That wheat, we know, has to be sold at a certain price.  Men have to be employed to produce that wheat.  Their wages, and the price of the wheat, have a very important bearing on whether it is equitable to ask us to cultivate 25 per cent. of our land and to submit to the orders of inspectors to grow a certain area of wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, when you have heard me through, you will not say that is the burden of my speech. That is only the beginning.  It is supremely important for us, if we have to put a large area under the plough, to be sure that we will have men to put in the crop, and men to take it out.  I am satisfied that at these wages we will not have the men.  Just for the purposes of comparison, may I mention that in my area the wages Order provides that I am to pay my men two guineas for a 54-hour week.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot pay all I like because I am controlled by the price fixed for the crop.  That is the strait-jacket into which we are being put.  My contention is that the wages we are paying are not enough.  I would be very glad to see a very substantial increase in the price of the crop and <Col N="984" /> to see the whole of that increase given over to the labourers in order to keep them on the land.  How are we going to keep them on the land?  I have men working in my fields to-day sowing potatoes and spring wheat.  I am paying them at least two guineas a week, perhaps more, but I am not going to say anything about that.  I could have them working according to the basic line taken by the Minister in fixing the price of the crop we are sowing, while there are men pretending to sweep the road outside at £3 10s. a week, working fewer hours, and with a fortnight's holidays and pensions.  How long are we going to tolerate that?  I am not saying one word against the men who are getting £3 or £3 10s. a week.  I say &ldquo;good luck&rdquo; to them.  If they are worth that, are not our men worth it, and if they are, why are they not getting it?  If that wage is to be paid why are not prices based on it instead of having a starvation wage, or worse than a starvation wage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Men are using every pretence to get permits to clear off the land.  I have spoken to farmers all over the country about this, and my fear is that men are not going to stay on the land for that wage.  Here we are in the intolerable position of having a fictitious wage on which men cannot live.  That wage has been fixed for farm workers.  The price of the crop is based on that wage.  The Minister makes this Order and says that we must till 25 per cent. of our land.  We are told that we are patriots.  The greatest patriot in the country is the farm labourer, that we are all conspiring to starve and drive off the land. I say that unreservedly.  I doubt if there is a member of the House who employs as much agricultural labour as I do.  These men are working at a starvation wage and we are being driven to employ them at a starvation wage because we will not get a price for our crops.  In the year that has passed we had the price of 50/- a barrel fixed for wheat, while at the same time we imported wheat from the ends of the earth&mdash;Irishmen's lives being sacrificed to bring it here&mdash; at a cost of 65/11 per barrel.  It would not be in the national interest to tell <Col N="985" /> us what quantity was imported.  We had a flourish of trumpets a couple of weeks ago about a ship load of Canadian oats that arrived here, costing us 35/11, while our price for oats is 25/8.  How is that?  If we got 35/- a barrel, we would have enough oats to send to Canada; we would have sufficient for ourselves, and we could pay our men a wage.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us, when he is replying, of one job in the country that the agricultural labourer would not be better paid at if he cleared off the land.  That is the position of expert agricultural labourers &mdash;that they could get better pay at any other job.  Mick Redmond, the champion ploughman from the Minister's own county, was so badly remunerated &mdash;he the champion ploughman, a man who should command a good position in this country&mdash;that he left the land just before the war, and was engaged selling gravel for building purposes here in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that we shall hear something informative from the Minister when he is replying.  I want to know why the farm labourer must continue to be the worst paid man in the country.  There will be no trouble about the production of food here, to the limit of our fertilisers and of our farmyard manure, if only we are prepared to pay for it.  I do not propose to dwell further on that.  I will do so when replying if the Minister does not tell us why our farm workers must be the worst paid men in the country, and why they must work the longest hours.  Let us drop the bunkum of a guaranteed price.  There is no such thing as a guaranteed price for agricultural produce in this country. <Col N="986" /> There is a controlled price.  Why is Irish wheat controlled at 50/- a barrel when you have to pay 65/10 for the wheat that you bring in?</P>
      <P>I should like to know why the Minister insists on a starvation wage for agricultural labourers, or why agriculture here must be artificially depressed. I cannot see any reason why the man who takes out a tractor or a pair of horses, a plough, a corn drill, or a reaper and binder, should be paid a lower wage than a porter in a public house or any man working for the county council or the corporation. Then an appeal is made to the patriotism of those men, who are underpaid and underfed, to save the country in this emergency.  They are doing it, but I do not think any lower wage than 50/- a week should be offered to any agricultural labourer at the present time, and agricultural prices should be regulated accordingly. Those agricultural workers are continuing to work without grumbling much, but they should not be forced against the wall, or more may have to be paid for less return.  Show your appreciation not by nice phrases, not by appealing to their patriotism&mdash;they are patriotic all right&mdash;but in the only way that counts, that is by paying them a living wage.  How many cases are being considered&mdash;I am not arguing against those cases&mdash;for a bonus on wages at the present time?  The wages in question are far above 50/- a week. I repeat that I am not arguing against those cases.  It is not my business, and it would be a bad approach to equity to attempt to pull down the wages that some men have to the level of the low wage that others get.  It is best for the community and best for business that the highest scale of wages which industry and agriculture can afford should be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Order is ill conceived.  Those men who are asked to do this work should be paid a living wage, a due return should be allowed to the farmer, and prices should be fixed on that basis.  If the subject were approached and dealt with in that way, the wage that is being paid now would be found to be inequitable, and the prices of the farmers' produce would not be <Col N="987" /> controlled at the present figures.  The Minister can see for himself that the increased price every year resulted in increased produce.  We need have no fear of hunger, no fear of shortage, if the farmers were paid for their work. When the Minister is replying I hope he will attempt to justify the wages fixed for the coming year&mdash;36/&mdash;for the greater part of the country, 37/6 for a smaller part of the country, and £2 2s. 0d. for a still smaller part. No able-bodied agricultural labourer should be offered less than 50/- at the present time.  How does the Minister expect those men to stay on the land and work for a starvation wage?</P>
    <P>In a question about a year ago I asked the Minister to consider the Order relating to the standard of milk.  It is a terrible thing to put a man in such a position as a very prominent dairy owner in this city was put into recently when the milk showed a shortage of fat.  With the present food for animals at the disposal of the dairying industry in Dublin, it is not possible to maintain the required standard.  If a man grows a crop to feed his cattle in order to produce milk of the proper standard, he is prosecuted.  Last year a few farmers &mdash;around Youghal, I think it was&mdash; grew surplus wheat, ground it and fed it to their cows and pigs, and they were prosecuted.  They were held up to public odium because this valuable human food was given to the common pig.  Of course, all the people in towns and cities howled for the blood of those savages who wasted, as they thought, good human food.  They changed their tune soon afterwards when they found that they had no bacon, and when they found that butter was rationed.  I see the Minister has changed his attitude.  He is now advising the people to grow all the wheat they can for human food, and, when they have grown enough for human food, to grow for animal food then.  We are learning as we go along. If 5 per cent. of the arable land will give us enough to eat, and a farmer put 5 per cent. or 6 per cent. of his arable land under wheat, and throws that into the common pool for food <Col N="988" /> for the nation, I submit that that farmer has discharged his moral duty to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>If every other farmer in the country does not grow as much wheat for the common pool of food, it is the fault of the Minister who did not make him do it.  Those farmers who looked beyond their noses, who had cows and pigs, and who knew that they could not produce the proper standard of milk and could not fatten their pigs for want of proper fattening food, grew extra wheat and ground it and gave it to their cows to produce more milk and to their pigs to fatten them.  They showed an example to the Minister, and it is not they who should have been prosecuted but the Minister for not having formulated the right policy for the country in order to secure us from a shortage of bread.  I should like the Minister to explain why he did not take time by the forelock and see that every farmer did his job and grew enough wheat.  I notice now that he has taken the clumsy way of vesting power in inspectors, who come to us and say: &ldquo;You cannot grow wheat here, and you must grow it over there.&rdquo;  If we grow it in the place pointed out to us, and the crop is a failure, who will foot our loss?  We will have to foot it, not the inspector. That is intolerable.  When people show not only their willingness but their determination to produce enough food for the country they should be encouraged; the agricultural community should not be obliged to carry a host of inspectors on their backs.  I wonder how the country is living.  If a census were taken of those who have nothing to do but tell the few who are working how they should work&mdash; inspectors inspecting inspectors <i>ad infinitum</i>&mdash;you would wonder how the game can be kept going at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister, before it is too late, if he is satisfied as regards the quantity of winter wheat sown.  After three or four years' experience now in this job, he should have his information up-to-date &mdash;information not later than a week behind the actual sowing&mdash;to show how much winter wheat has been sown and how much winter oats, if any.  He <Col N="989" /> should also know the quantity of spring wheat for the sowing of which preparations have been made.  He could then form an estimate of what the total acreage under wheat will be. Then we require more oats.  I think a calculation he made here some six months ago showed that we were about 1,000,000 acres short in tillage. I should like to hear from him whether he has any information that this Order is adequate to secure that 1,000,000 extra acres or whatever is the estimated area he requires under tillage.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if we are sure of our ground as we go along.  If we are not sure of our ground, and if preparations have not been made to produce the required quantity of food in this country for the coming year, now is the time to take the necessary steps.  This is only the 4th March, and there is still time to sow any crop we want, with the exception of winter wheat.  If the job is not done now or within the next couple of months, we cannot hope to have any extra yield of food until next harvest 12 months, and that is a bit too long to wait for a meal.  Now is the time for the Minister to be up and doing.  It is due to the House and to the country that he should take this opportunity to tell us what steps he has taken to provide the necessary food supply for the nation. We farmers have shown that we will do the job.  We can tell the Government we have done the job and will do it, if they do their job.</P>
    <P>I did not propose this motion for the purpose of criticising the Government. I have criticised them in my speech up to the present but I certainly pay them the tribute that, when the emergency came on this country, in the matter of food production they had a springboard prepared from which the country could jump off and provide 100 per cent. of the food requirements for the country if handled properly. When I say &ldquo;if handled properly&rdquo;, I admit that the man on the sideline is the best hurler.  I know they were up against difficulties and that it is easy perhaps for those of us looking on to think that we could do better than they <Col N="990" /> did.  Allowing for that, I think they could have done a little better, particularly having regard to the way they rushed like a bull at a gate to prosecute people for doing what the Government themselves should have done.  I remember the Taoiseach threatening, down in Tullamore a few years ago, that, in effect, if the farmers did not produce more food for human consumption the live stock would have to be shot off.  He has changed that tune.  He now has another key and the Minister knows it.  If he does not know it, I will give him a little lecture on it.  I will give him a little demonstration, such as he never saw in his own place.  The Minister need not shout until he is out of the wood.  He now realises that the area of production in this country cannot be regulated by Order.  The area that will produce economically in this country is governed by one factor, and one factor only, and that is the quantity of manure we have at our disposal.  The land of this country will not grow crops without manure and there is a limit to the area of land that can be manured.  The quantity of manure at our disposal is limited and the area which can be manured economically will be limited.</P>
    <P>Many people, particularly townspeople, ask why, if a 25 per cent. tillage does not give us enough food, should we not have a 30 per cent. or a 40 per cent. tillage.  I am convinced from personal experience that we have reached the limit of the area which can be tilled economically.  If the quantity of manure at our disposal has to be spread over a larger area than that embraced in a 25 per cent. tillage, instead of producing more food we shall produce less food. We shall have reached the point at which the law of diminishing returns, economically speaking, operates.  If we say that there must be a 30 per cent. tillage instead of a 25 per cent. tillage, I am satisfied that the yield from the 30 per cent. will be lower than that which can be produced from the 25 per cent.  To increase the area under tillage you must first of all increase the quantity of manure you have.  If the Minister can manage to get fodder <Col N="991" /> for our live stock, if he can get a good market for our fat stock in Britain, and if we can go in for stall feeding cattle on a more extended scale, we shall have a greater quantity of manure, and the area which we can till economically and productively can be increased, but not otherwise.</P>
    <P>I said in moving this motion that it is put down, not in opposition to tillage or to the Order, but in order to bring the matter before the House for discussion and to get the Minister to give his viewpoint and that of the Government on certain very important matters relative to the industry of agriculture and to food production for the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion on the definite understanding that it will not be put to a division.  It is put down in order to secure an opportunity to criticise some items in this tillage Order and to afford the House an opportunity to discuss tillage policy generally.  There are some features of this Order which are undesirable and which should not have been included in it in their present form.  One matter &mdash;which may appear small but which is, nevertheless, important&mdash;is the definition of arable land as &ldquo;land capable of being tilled&rdquo;.  In my opinion, as a farmer, that is not a proper definition of arable land.  It should be defined as &ldquo;land capable of being tilled with horse or tractor implements and capable of producing a satisfactory crop&rdquo;.  Practically any land in this country can be tilled with a spade or a pick, and a large amount of land could be tilled but would not produce a crop, as in the case of marsh, bogland or water-logged land.  Therefore, this definition of arable land is incomplete and unsatisfactory and is capable of being construed in such a way as to inflict injustice upon the occupier of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers vested in inspectors have been criticised already in this House. Of the 105 inspectors operating the Order, at least 51 are purely temporary inspectors and, as far as I know, the majority of these are very young men, some of whom are under 21 years of <Col N="992" /> age.  It is hard to imagine that such men would have sufficient experience to visit a farm and, by inspection, decide whether a certain portion of the land was arable and which particular portion of it should be utilised for the growing of wheat.  Having regard to the drastic powers vested in these inspectors, there should be some satisfactory system of appeal from decisions taken by them.  It has been urged already by the Minister that any form of appeal would take considerable time&mdash;and time is a very important factor in enforcing the tillage Order&mdash; but surely it would not take very much time for the farmer to appeal to the local agricultural instructors, who would be quite competent to decide as to whether land would be suitable for growing wheat or not.  Wicklow, generally, is not a wheat-growing county, but I happen to know a case of a certain farmer there who was ordered to grow wheat at a very high altitude, quite close to Lugnaquilla. He protested and offered to bring in the local instructor.  The inspector was reasonable enough to accept the protest and the opinion of the local agricultural instructor, but there should be definite power under this Order to appeal in cases where the inspector is determined to enforce his order.  There may be cases where an inspector would stand resolute and insist on his order being carried out and thereby inflict a great injustice on a particular landowner.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the statement made by Deputy Dillon the other day that there is no justification whatever for this particular power to compel a farmer to till a certain portion of his land.  Deputy Dillon stated that only a lunatic would seek to cultivate the inferior portion of his land.  He cannot have been familiar with every type of land in the country, or he would know that cases may arise where a farmer might derive some advantage from tilling the more inferior portion of his land, continuing in permanent pasture that portion which was good fattening land.  It is justifiable to give this power, provided there are safeguards.  The safeguard I suggest is an appeal to the local agricultural <Col N="993" /> instructor.  It is not too much to ask that this suggestion be included in the Order now.  Deputy Dillon was hopelessly inconsistent, inasmuch as he was prepared to give the Department power to compel every farmer to grow wheat, but was not prepared to give the Department power to decide which particular portion of the land should be tilled.  Both these powers are drastic, and as great an injury could be inflicted on a farmer by compelling him to grow wheat as by compelling him to till a particular portion of his land.  Therefore, the only effective means of doing justice to the farmer, while serving the best interests of the community by getting the land cultivated to a proper extent, is to provide the safeguard I suggest.</P>
    <P>There is another section of this Order which protects the crops, chattels and equipment of the Department and of persons taking conacre from the Department&mdash;in the case of land compulsorily acquired under this Order&mdash;from seizure in respect of arrears of rates and land annuities.  It is a very extraordinary thing to afford this privilege to the Department and to people who take land from the Department, and not to afford the same privilege to the farmer who takes land by conacre from the occupier.  I think that the man who takes land by conacre from the occupier for the purpose of tillage is as patriotic and as good a citizen as the man who takes land by conacre from the Department.  The man who takes land by conacre from the occupier usually pays a much higher price than the man who takes it from the Department. It is not right that his crops should be liable to seizure while the other man's crops are protected.  That privilege cannot be justified, unless it is extended to all who take land by conacre.</P>
    <P>While these particular sections of the Order are open to criticism and are unjustifiable, the Order itself is necessary and justifiable&mdash;provided, of course, that the Government, having taken this drastic power to compel the agricultural community to till a minimum percentage of the land, also takes the precaution to see that the people <Col N="994" /> who comply with the Order and who safeguard the nation's food supply are adequately repaid for their enterprise and their labour.  That provision has not been complied with, as far as the Government is concerned. It is unfortunate, as Deputy Belton has pointed out, that the man who works on the land is remunerated on a much lower scale than the man who works in industry, transport or commerce. Deputy Belton also referred to the low wages of the agricultural labourer, but he did not refer to the still lower wages of the agricultural landowner, or to the wages paid to the sons and daughters, or other dependants, of the agricultural landholders who, for the most part, have enabled tillage to be carried out in this country for all these years, and who have received nothing in exchange.  Those are the people who have carried on agriculture here, and who, through the Government's policy, have been driven off the land.  As a result of these people being driven off the land, our country is now presented with a serious danger both in regard to the cultivation of the soil during this spring and the saving of the crops in the coming harvest. There is no doubt that a serious difficulty, and even danger, will arise with regard to agriculture in this country during this spring and the coming harvest, in view of the fact that many of our best and most skilled agricultural labourers have emigrated; and I think that the Minister for Agriculture should seriously deal with this question of the harvesting of the crop, with a view to seeing that there will be an adequate supply of skilled labour.  Nobody, for example, can tell whether there will be sufficient tractor fuel this year to enable the crop to be harvested expeditiously.  It is possible, for instance, that there may not be sufficient kerosene for tractors to enable harvesting operations to be carried on by means of tractors, or at least that the cost of it will be 100 per cent. higher than we anticipate.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to remind the Minister that the position in regard to food supplies does not leave any room for complacency, and <Col N="995" /> I hope the Minister is not adopting a complacent attitude in regard to our food supplies for the coming year.  We know that last year our wheat supply was far short of our requirements, but that, as a result of imports from other countries, we were able to obtain sufficient supplies to tide our people over, probably, until the next harvest, but there is no guarantee or security that imports from other countries will be possible this year on the scale that was possible last year.  For that reason it would be no harm for the Minister to check up on the quantity that has been sown already.  I am sure that there are ample means at the Minister's disposal to enable him to ascertain, approximately, the amount of winter wheat which has been sown this year as compared with the amount which was sown last year.  I think it is a matter of urgent importance to ascertain what has been done with regard to the amount of winter wheat that has been sown and, if the adequate amount has not been sown, to ensure that the acreage of spring wheat will be increased.  I hope&mdash;and I think I have good reason to hope&mdash;that there are adequate supplies of spring wheat seed to enable the necessary acreage of spring wheat to be sown.  It is for that reason that I urge the Minister not to be complacent.  For example, we know what happened in regard to beet last year, when we had falling off of, I think, 70,000 acres, as a result of the fact that the price offered to the beet growers was not adequate, and I suggest that the same may happen in regard to the acreage under wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the price had been adequate, the farmers would have taken the risk of growing a lesser crop as a result of the lack of artificial manures, and I think that the fact that the Minister has agreed to increase the price this year is an answer to Deputy Killilea's remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy admit that the price is quite satisfactory this year?</P>

    <Col N="996" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not say that, but I say that the fact that the Minister has increased the price is an answer to Deputy Killilea's contention.  I have not suggested, however, that the Minister has increased the price sufficiently. I said that he had increased the price, but not sufficiently, and the fact that the price of 50/- a barrel was paid last year, and yet did not produce a sufficient supply of wheat, ought to be a warning to the Minister that the price is inadequate for the present year, particularly when we take into account the extent to which the costs of producing wheat have increased this year as compared with last year. Surely, the Minister will not contend that the cost of growing wheat this year is the same as last year?  I am sure that he will not deny that the cost of labour has been increased in the case of farmers who employ labourers, and surely he will not deny that the cost of living has been increased very substantially in the case of farmers who do not employ labourers, but who have to provide for the needs of themselves and their families.  There was an increase this year of 10/- a barrel for wheat, but what might have been entirely justifiable last year is a different matter now.  Of course, I know that the Minister will reply that if we try to force up the price of wheat or other essential foodstuffs it will mean the forcing up of the price of other things&mdash;wages and so on&mdash;and that we will be led into the vicious spiral of inflated wages, with prices going higher and higher, but I do not think that that will enable the Minister to get away with the inadequate prices that he has given for tillage products this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no increase this year in the price of any grain crops produced in this country, notwithstanding the increase in the costs of production. Surely, the Minister must realise that the farmer who grows oats in this country is entitled to the price of 35/- or 35/11 which was paid for the imported oats, and I suggest that if a sufficient price was paid for the homegrown product, it would not be necessary to import such commodities as wheat or oats, and that it would not <Col N="997" /> be necessary for men to risk their lives in importing wheat or oats from other countries.  In that connection the Minister should give some attention to the steps that are being taken, for example, in Great Britain, to enable the agricultural producer to produce at a profit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At lower prices than ours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a few cases, prices are slightly lower than ours, but in the majority of cases, they are higher.  In addition, the step has been taken in Great Britain of providing adequate and ample subsidies per acre for land under tillage.  In the case of the potato crop, although potato prices are much higher in Great Britain than here, there is a subsidy of £10 per acre.  That is one way in which the Minister could enable the farmer to till with profit, without increasing the cost to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very serious feature of our tillage policy is the fact that the hand-feeding of live stock has been discouraged during the past couple of years, due to the fact that store cattle pay much better than stall-fed cattle. All Deputies realise the desirability of maintaining the fertility of the soil and providing adequately for its manuring and it is essential that measures be adopted to promote the hand-feeding of live stock and thus enable land to be cultivated profitably and effectively and with good results to the community. For that reason, it would not be unjustifiable to pay a substantial subsidy for the stall-feeding of cattle in order in some way to restore the balance which has been upset.  There is no doubt whatever that there is a famine in grass at present.  Notwithstanding the fact that it is sound national policy at the moment to promote tillage, grass is paying more at present than land under cultivation and land set for grazing is commanding prices almost equal to those commanded by land set for tillage, which shows that our policy of promoting tillage which is envisaged in this Order is being upset by the scale of prices prevailing for store cattle as against stall-fed cattle.  Surely it should be <Col N="998" /> the duty of the Government to rectify that balance in favour of tillage.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to inform us, if he proposes to take part in this debate, to what extent the powers taken by the Department's inspectors to compel farmers to sow wheat have been utilised and how many acres under wheat have been required by the Department's inspectors.  That would be very useful information for the House, inasmuch as it would show the extent to which these drastic powers are being used.  The Minister might also inform us as to how many holdings have been taken over by the Department's inspectors and to what extent the powers to compel farmers to till certain portions of their land have been used.</P>
    <P>While certain sections of the Order are unjustifiable, open to severe criticism, and give scope for the inflicting of severe injustice on the occupier, I am not prepared to advocate that the Order should be annulled.  Farmers fully recognise their obligations to the community.  The farmer is a good citizen, and, as a good citizen, realises that he has an obligation, as the owner of the soil, to provide for the feeding of the population of the country.  All he asks is that he be given fair play, that he will be at least as well treated as the industrial producer has been treated, and will be given a price for his produce which will enable him to pay his workers as good a wage as is being paid in industry and allow him a margin of profit.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency on the part of some people to regard the difficulties of the situation as insurmountable.  I do not take that view.  I am rather an optimist, and I believe that if we handle the problem of providing food for our people efficiently, it can be done.  When we consider that there are 12,000,000 acres of fairly arable land&mdash;I do not say it is all arable because I do not believe it is&mdash;on which we have to support 3,000,000 people, it will be realised that that represents a farm of 24 acres for every family of six persons.  If six people are not able to maintain themselves during an emergency period on 24 acres, there must <Col N="999" /> be something radically wrong somewhere. I make that comparison just to show that the problem is not insurmountable, but it demands efficient handling, and efficient handling is what the problem has not got up to the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the various complex economic problems confronting this country during the emergency, the most vital of all is the securing of sufficient food for man and beast, and of getting the maximum production from the land.  When one examines the results achieved by other countries in the matter of agricultural production, even for many years before the war, and compares them with the stagnation in agricultural production for many years in this country, one must come to the conclusion that there is something fundamentally wrong with the whole organisation of our agricultural economy.  Obviously, at a time like this, when our people have to rely absolutely on their own resources, that problem should have commanded the immediate attention of the Government and of those charged with the responsibility of ensuring the provision of our essential requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one remembers that economists have computed that an acre of land, properly used and cultivated, will maintain an individual, then in this country, where we have a population of less than 3,000,000 and where we have arable land aggregating 12,000,000 acres&mdash;bearing in mind that some of that land ranks amongst the finest in the world&mdash;we should not, assuming that our work is properly organised and properly done, have any problem at all in the matter of food production.  It does seem an extraordinary state of affairs that we have had a problem of the magnitude of that which has existed for the last two or three years.  Our aim, apart altogether from the emergency, to secure the prosperity and progress of the country, should be a policy which would ensure maximum production from the land.  I do not think that the mere issuing of a compulsory <Col N="1000" /> Order by the Government, as an effort to secure that end, relieves the Government of their responsibility in the matter.  It appears that the Government and the Minister felt that their responsibility ended by merely making a compulsory Order compelling our people to till a certain percentage of land, amounting in this present year to 25 per cent., and by going down the country on a campaign of speech-making and appealing to the people to fulfil the conditions set out in that Order, and in a patriotic way appealing to their sense of duty to produce our requirements.  I do not think that that was sufficient at any time.  I have criticised it in the past, but no further effort has been made by the Government to bring to bear on this problem the organisation which, in my opinion, is necessary to secure maximum production.</P>
    <P>So far as tillage operations and the fulfilling by individuals of the amount required under the Order are concerned, of course it is obvious that in those counties where mixed farming was not the order of the day the problem was most acute, because in those counties the people lacked the necessary equipment. Very often in the grass counties you found you had the bigger units, and because of the bigger units the amount of land that came under the Order was considerable.  In a great many cases individuals in these counties were faced with an almost insuperable problem.  No matter how anxious they were to comply with the Order, they found the equipment was not there and that it was impossible to hire it.  Prosecuting such a man under the Order, bringing him to a court of justice, finding him guilty and imprisoning him for the offence, I think is unfair and unreasonable.  Some effort should have been made by the Government and the responsible Minister, in those districts where equipment was lacking and the individuals were unable to procure the essential equipment, to provide that equipment.  In order to ensure that the work was properly and efficiently done, it was necessary to build up an organisation <Col N="1001" /> of some sort on the lines of a local committee of agriculture, giving them statutory power to provide a certain amount of equipment in each county, so that that equipment could be operated in districts where equipment was lacking.</P>
    <P>That is the procedure that is being adopted in other countries, and notably by our neighbours across the Channel. I know that the Minister has taken exception in the past to any suggestion in this House that we should follow on the lines that they have pursued in other matters.  But it does seem to me, in that regard, a rather strange anomaly that very often the Government, in legislation in this House, are inclined to follow slavishly enactments which have been passed in another Parliament. Be that as it may, there is no doubt that, through intensive organisation and the opportunity that is being given through that organisation to attend to details in the way of providing credit facilities and the use of equipment, tremendous attention is being given in Great Britain to the breaking up of common lands and park lands, and, in fact, land that was rapidly deteriorating and going back into forest or semi-forest conditions, with a view to producing food for the nation.  Nothing has been done in this country with regard to that.</P>
    <P>In the past, I have taken the opportunity of suggesting to the Minister that in those districts where they find it almost impossible to provide the necessary quota of tillage because of lack of equipment, there was a responsibility on him to make some effort to provide equipment so that an inspector going on to any farm in a grass county would be in a position to say, if the farmer pleaded the excuse that he had not the equipment or could not hire it: &ldquo;I will send you a tractor and plough on Monday morning and leave it with you until your quota of ploughing is completed.&rdquo;  Outside of that consideration altogether, the Minister should realise that in those districts where equipment is lacking and where the work is rushed it is invariably inadequately done.  The necessary cultivation is not secured.  The necessary depth of cultivation, the necessary <Col N="1002" /> compact seed bed that is so essential to good production, the necessary rolling and after-cultivation when the crop is in a rather delicate state of growth, are lacking, with the result that in a great many districts partial failure has occurred and occurred on the richest land where we had tremendous reserves of fertility and where we should, in an emergency like this, be in a position to draw considerably on that store of fertility.  That fertility, to a great extent, has not been used effectively and properly, I contend, through lack of proper organisation, through not providing the proper equipment, and through lack of proper attention and proper technical advice in counties where practical experience is lacking.</P>
    <P>I think every farmer Deputy must agree that the best results so far as cereal production is concerned are got on partially worn land, simply because of the vast amount of experience and practical knowledge in those districts that is so essential to effective production.  I think that there again the Minister and his Department have failed to provide some sort of practical advice in the critical period, say, in the months of April and May, when we invariably experience in this country a period of drought and east winds and frosty nights which severely test a crop that is in a delicate stage of growth.  The experienced man can hold that crop on the land by the necessary amount of rolling and top soil cultivation so as to ensure that the roots will get sufficient moisture and, at the same time, cut off at the top soil that tremendous amount of evaporation that occurs in a dry period of that sort with east winds and good deal of night frosts.  I suggested before that it would be very easy to arrange at a very reasonable cost that young fellows from the tillage districts, with ample knowledge of the methods of handling a crop at that stage, would go round on bicycles in the non-tillage areas to advise people how to handle crops in that delicate stage of growth.</P>
    <P>To my mind, this whole question of production has an inevitable effect on the fertility of the land of this country. The future prosperity of this country is bound up with the preservation, conservation <Col N="1003" /> and building up of the fertility that exists in the land.  The Taoiseach, quite recently, at a food production meeting down the country, said that he had no doubt, even if the present emergency were to continue for a number of years, that we would have ample reserves in the fertility of the soil to secure the necessary food for our people.  I have no doubt that we could continue to produce the necessary food for our very small population, but I suggest that that is not sufficient. Our whole economy is built on the foundation of a surplus production of agricultural goods.  That surplus is the only medium of exchange we have.  We can exchange for that surplus production essential requirements and raw material for industry.  If that surplus production should disappear, then the whole economic structure of this country must, inevitably, undergo a change.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone can view with complacency the position into which we are slowly but surely drifting.  Not so many years ago, we had a considerable export trade in many agricultural commodities, not only live stock but live-stock products.  To-day, our only export of agricultural goods is cattle. The pig industry, so far as exports are concerned, has disappeared; we are now unable to supply our own requirements. Butter is in the same position. Exports of eggs and poultry have almost disappeared.  We have not exported any mutton for over 12 months. We find this country at the present time with an export trade in cattle only.</P>
    <P>I think that is a most alarming position and I dread the position in which we may find ourselves in a post-war period if we have to try to win back the market in which we have sold in the past, when we have failed to maintain our quota trade with that market and with those people in the most critical period of their history.  If they have to look to other countries to supply the quota of goods that we failed to give them, it is very hard to expect that they will make room for our produce in a post-war period.  I have suggested in the past that we <Col N="1004" /> should strain every muscle to ensure that we would maintain our quota of export trade with that country so that we would be in a position to say to them after the war that, no matter how they might judge our attitude in other respects, they were very glad to get that quota of food from us during the war and that we were entitled to at least that quota of trade in a post-war period.</P>
    <P>To revert to the question of fertility. I do not think the Taoiseach was right in saying that there was no danger to the fertility of the soil.  I think that in many intensive tillage districts and in districts which are not intensive tillage districts, the fertility of the land is considerably reduced and is continuing to diminish.  In many districts, there is old turf with a very low nutritive value, mostly weeds and vegetable matter of a poor type, bent grass and agrostis, that have a very low animal feeding value.  Because of that, its power to build up fertility is almost negligible.  Nothing has been done in regard to examining that problem.</P>
    <P>I asked a question of the Minister to-day as to the basis on which the lime subsidy is allocated to the various counties.  I was told the lime subsidy was based on the demand for lime in the various districts.  It appears to me an extraordinary fact that in some counties the amount of the lime subsidy available is only about one-quarter per ton of the amount of subsidy that is available in other counties.  It appears to me that, long ago, we should have made a proper survey of the soil condition of this country.  There are huge tracts of land in a very sour condition and, because of this sour condition, it does not give its maximum production and cannot be used properly and efficiently. I suggest that in the matter of providing lime to correct that acidity the first and most essential thing is to make a survey of the soil, so that we may ensure that for those lands which have become highly acid lime would be provided immediately to correct that condition and restore the fertility of the soil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton stated that the volume <Col N="1005" /> of our production can be determined only by the amount of manure that is produced in the country.  Manure is the great medium of inducing fertility and providing humus matter in the soil, but it is a most expensive way of doing it.  The Minister is probably aware of the amount of experimental work and pioneer work that has been done at Aberystwyth by Sir George Stapleton in recent years in the cultivation of grass and the use of grass as a medium for inducing fertility.  It seems extraordinary that both Stapleton and Davies have made a grass survey in Great Britain and have come to the conclusion that of the total acreage of arable land in Great Britain only about 250,000 acres of grass land is really first class, that all the rest of the grass land needs to be broken up and rejuvenated.  Their system of rejuvenation is simply turning over the old grass, which has a very low value as far as animal food is concerned, testing the soil for acidity and, where it is present, correcting it, and making up any deficiencies there may be of potash and phosphates.  Then, if a cereal is not put in as a nurse crop, grasses should be sown.  Those grasses are put in, say, in the month of April, before the rainy season ends, and a compact seed bed is secured by ample rolling. By the month of June that land is able to carry a very much increased amount of stock and there is a tremendous medium for the provision of fertility. That land will take the droppings of the animals it is carrying; the animals will compact the soil and that compact soil will promote rapid vegetation and the production of foliage and leaf matter and, in that way, rapidly build up fertility.  That sod can, in fact, be ploughed down and provide any amount of organic matter for the production of cereals.</P>
    <P>It required an emergency to bring about in Great Britain a situation where farmers began to realise the advantages of this new technique in agricultural production.  It has brought about revolutionary methods in British agriculture.  This pioneer work has been going on for a number of years. They have decided in Britain that it is necessary to breed their own grasses, as many of the imported grass seeds <Col N="1006" /> were not suitable for their conditions. Already they have bred a variety of grasses and clovers suitable for their soil and climate, some very suitable for hay and others suitable for grass-feeding their animals.  In New Zealand ten years ago they developed this system.  I have always connected Stapleton's visit to New Zealand ten years ago with the expansion of the dairying industry in that country. They adopted the advice given to them by Stapleton, and they went in for the cultivation of grasses.</P>
    <P>I say that that development has revolutionised agriculture in the countries that have adopted it.  I do not want to convey any wrong impression with reference to this new technique in grass cultivation.  I merely point out that you cannot continue to produce cereals without considering the grass factor, the right type of grass and the right mixture of legumes that will take the nitrogen from the soil and help to feed the grasses that are so essential to agricultural production, whether they be Timothy, Cocksfoot, or the basic grass, rye-grass.  I think it is time that something was done in this connection.  We have a technical staff, sufficient facilities and all the advantages of good land, with a moist climate, proper weather conditions, and everything else necessary to operate a system of that sort with advantage. This method of farming will secure, not only that we can carry a much greater quantity of stock on the land, but that we can produce more and better cereal crops.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter last year on a somewhat similar motion and I am glad to observe that the Minister has made a provision that next year a first-crop meadow will be recognised as part of the land that is tilled under the Compulsory Tillage Order.  It is unfortunate that that provision was not introduced at the very start because, in my opinion, that is the type of thing that will have a very important bearing on the future prosperity of agriculture here.  We must recognise that in the post-war period competition is going to be far keener, and those countries that had to extend their production enormously, countries that were <Col N="1007" /> manufacturing countries and that have, in fact, mechanised their systems, will be among our chief competitors.  We shall have to compete against highly efficient methods of production, methods largely brought about by mechanisation, resulting in reduced costs of production.</P>
    <P>If we do not wake up to the situation, we will simply fade out.  We are drifting and we are quite complacent about the situation.  The few people who look to the future must view with alarm the position into which we have drifted.  There is a complete disappearance, from a valuable market that we have supplied for many years, of a considerable volume of our agricultural production.  Of course, in this matter of food production our people are very seriously handicapped by the fact that they are limited in regard to supplies of artificial manures.  The amount of nitrogen and phosphates at the disposal of the producer is almost negligible, and people are handicapped by reason of that fact, particularly in the districts where there is no reserve of fertility.  The Minister endeavoured to suggest that Deputy Cogan was satisfied with this year's beet price.  I do not know that that was Deputy Cogan's attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt he will support it.  There is one thing you must have for a satisfactory beet crop, and that is early establishment, and it is hard to have an early establishment and a good stand if you have not a certain amount of nitrogenous manure.  How far the Government have tried to secure supplies of sulphate of ammonia by way of a barter agreement, I do not know. They have been advised here and in the Seanad that some effort should be made in that direction.  We have been told that the Government have tried to secure a quota of artificial manures. It appears to be a short-sighted policy on the part of Great Britain definitely to turn down our quota of sulphate of ammonia, of which they appear to have a surplus.  In my opinion the greatest handicap to the production of beet here is the fact that we have such a small amount of nitrogenous manure. It may be argued by the Minister that a very considerable acreage of beet has already been contracted for. I do not think that is the position.  We have an increased amount of land under cultivation for the past two or three years, and a good deal of that land has now grown three cereal crops and is due to be put under a root crop. Farmers decided for beet again as it is the only crop that will secure them 4 cwt. of artificial manure.  We must have roots to clean the land, and coupled with that is the bait of a half-cwt. of sugar.  I agree that the idea came from Deputy Corry.  It is a poor compliment to Irish farmers if the Government decide, that by merely handing out a carrot like that, the farmers will fall for producing beet at an uneconomic price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  The demand for sugar came from Mallow and Tuam <Col N="1009" /> areas only.  I believe the company for the first time recommended an economic price for beet.  I have no information whatever about it.  That was kept strictly secret at the time. Nobody but the Government know what the recommendations of the company were.  I am satisfied from discussions that took place between representatives of the beet growing association and the sugar company that more than £4 a ton was recommended by the company.  However, the Government, regardless whether or not it was profitable for farmers to produce beet at £4 a ton, have secured the necessary acreage to meet the sugar requirements of the country for the coming year.  The price this year, taking all relative factors into consideration, increased cost of production, of labour, of machinery, of horse shoes, and the serious handicap of a shortage of essential artificial manures, is definitely worse than it was two years ago.  We ought to have a common policy on this question on all sides in a country where agriculture is the primary industry, so that agriculturists will be rehabilitated and made financially strong for the bad years that must inevitably come in the post-war period.</P>

One of the things that might be done is to have our people made sufficiently strong financially to be in a position to meet any difficulties that may arise after the war.  I have always <Col N="1010" /> supported the provision of remunerative prices for farmers and for their workmen.  No sections of the community get a poorer return for their efforts.  In certain grades of society in this city no sections are looked upon with more contempt.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made suggestions on all sides with regard to the price of barley.  I think it is unfortunate that Messrs.  Guinness are tied to a fixed price for the barley they want, when one considers that they intend to pay 70/- a barrel for barley for the production of stout on the other side of the Channel, while a considerable quantity of the product of the barley they get here is shipped to Great Britain.  There is no reason why farmers here should be asked to produce <Col N="1011" /> barley at the low price of 35/- a barrel.  I do not see why the Minister does not fix a quota for this firm, and leave them free to select the best samples of barley suitable for malting and to pay a much higher price for it. I believe the company would be quite satisfied to avail of the opportunity if they were given permission to pay a higher price.</P>
      <P>The Minister may suggest that any differentiation in price as between one individual and another might give rise to difficulties and create problems that he wants to avoid.  The Minister, however, should remember that the real barley land, the sharp, light land that produces an ideal sample of barley, is not suitable for wheat production.  The results, therefore, will not be satisfactory.  In fact, you will get poor results.  The people in the barley-growing counties who have been providing that firm with barley for years should not now be denied the opportunity of continuing to grow it at a satisfactory price if that firm wants the barley and are prepared to pay for it.</P>
      <P>There are some other points that I would like to touch on, but since the time for this debate is limited, and since there are other members of the House who wish to take part in it, I do not propose to say anything further.  In conclusion, on the fundamental matter of examining the fertility of the soil and of what can be done to build it up, as well as what has already been done in that regard by pioneers, I want to put it strongly to the Minister that all that ought not to be lost sight of by him or his Department.  Some experimental work in that direction ought to be undertaken now.  Indeed, we should have been engaged on it before now.  I want the Minister to bear in mind that when we talk about prosperity, so far as agriculture is concerned, the basis of it is the preservation and building up of the fertility of the soil. If these who are charged with the responsibility of government succeed in that direction, then I believe they will be doing a good day's work for Irish agriculture.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton, in moving the motion, announced that he does not propose to put it to a division.  I take that as a very sincere compliment. He assumed, I take it, that I will answer his arguments as satisfactorily as I have done in the last two years, when he was induced to withdraw motions that he had down. His first argument, which he made here on former occasions, was that every farmer should be compelled to put a certain percentage of his arable land under wheat.  As the Deputy himself said, we have dealt with that point very fully in the last couple of years.  I have already given my views on it.  It would be an extremely difficult Order to carry out.  As I said here before, if we were to attempt to carry it out I imagine that about one-third of our farmers would appeal against it and say that, although they had arable land, it was not wheat-growing land.  We would need to have some tribunal for the hearing of the appeals.  Deputy Belton complained about all the inspectors that are going around.  I imagine that he would hardly see the door with inspectors if we were to try to put an Order of that kind into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister not give them a discretion under the Order to say how much wheat one was to grow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will have to admit this, that if you were to take the counties along the western seaboard, from Donegal to West Cork, the big majority of farmers there would probably appeal on the ground that their land was not suitable for wheat growing.  They would say that they did not object to tillage since their land was suitable for the growing of oats and potatoes.  Therefore, they could come within the tillage Order. I think the best way to get wheat grown is by inducement, which is the system that has been adopted; by appealing to farmers to grow it because it is the most important item of food for the nation, and at the same time paying a price that will induce farmers to grow a good acreage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1013" /> Under the tillage Order of this year we have made two new provisions in that direction.  The first is, that an inspector can object to the particular land that a farmer is tilling under the Order.  He can say that it is not arable land or suitable land, and that the farmer will have to till more suitable land in order to comply with the Order.  The second provision is that he can go to an individual and say: &ldquo;You must grow wheat.&rdquo;  If the individual is not agreeable to do that, the inspector can say to him: &ldquo;You will grow it in that particular field.&rdquo; Anyone with experience in administration will agree that provisions of this kind have to be very drastic since people have a way of finding loopholes if exceptions are put in.  The best thing to do, therefore, is to make the provisions drastic, and in the administration of them try to be reasonable. I know that in a number of cases inspectors have gone to farmers&mdash;in all cases big farmers&mdash;who have very good land and who were not growing wheat. They were obeying the tillage Order, but they were not growing wheat because they had the idea that to do so would be bad for their land.  They were men who had more regard for the fertility of their land than they had for the feeding of the population. From the reports that I have seen in these cases, where an inspector went to one of these men and showed him his powers and told him that he would have to grow wheat, he got that done by agreement.  It was not necessary for the inspector to serve an Order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

The Deputy need not have any fear <Col N="1014" /> that an inspector will go in on the land of a farmer who has been growing wheat for some years, even since the beginning of the emergency, and compel him to grow wheat in a particular area of his holding rather than in the area in which he had been growing it.  I suppose that legally an inspector could compel a man to do that, but, administratively, it is entirely for application in the case of those who were not growing wheat at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy is clear as to the type of inspectors we have.  About half of them are from the Land Commission, men of great experience as administrators and so on.  The other half were recruited as helpers.  It is the inspector who would take a decision in the case <Col N="1015" /> the Deputy puts, but even he, on his own, would not take a decision of a drastic nature without referring it to some one higher up.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton and Deputy Cogan raised a point about tillage crops being immune from seizure for rent and rates.  That, of course, deals with legislation that was passed here in 1925, long before this Government came in.  I think that although at the time it looked to be a very drastic provision it would be very hard to carry out this Order without some measure of that kind.  You would entirely vitiate that whole scheme of legislation if you were to allow the ordinary conacre tenant, taking land from a farmer, to have his crops immune from seizure because there would, in certain cases, be complicity between him and the owner of the land.  Undoubtedly, in that way he could escape if he wanted to. Luckily in this country we have a very small proportion of dishonest men, but there are some.  The dishonest man could escape paying rent and rates by arranging with his neighbour to let his land in conacre, and then the whole thing would be immune from any seizure.</P>

The next question which Deputy Belton asked was this: he said it is provided in the Order that the Minister can take over buildings as well as land, and he wanted to know if that would enable the Minister to take over a dwelling. I am not very clear on the legal position there, but I can assure the Deputy that we have no intention of ever taking over a dwelling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care what we pay for imported wheat, and I never did.  I did not care in 1933 and 1934 and 1935, when we were getting Canadian wheat in here at 13/- a barrel; that did not influence what we paid to the Irish farmer, because we paid the Irish farmer what we thought was a decent price for him.  That is what we should do now, too.  We should pay him what we think is a fair price, and, if the Irish farmer does not do his duty <Col N="1019" /> and grow wheat at a fair price, then we must bring in wheat from Canada. The point raised was a ridiculous one, because we do not know what the Canadians might charge for wheat or what reason they might have for charging £10 a barrel.  We cannot fix our price in relation to their price.  We must fix what we consider a fair price, and after the war when the Canadians are again down to 13/- or 15/- a barrel we will continue to fix a fair price for wheat here and not bother about what the Canadians are charging.  I think Deputy Belton would have been of that opinion eight or nine years ago&mdash;that we should not mind what the foreign price was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not grow it at home and not mind about the foreigner?  The price of wheat was 30/- before the war. We were paying the Irish farmer 30/- then.  We are paying him 50/- now. That is 66 per cent. increase.  He is paying an increase of only 33? per cent. in wages.  His rent and rates have gone up 10 per cent., and the increase on small items like horseshoes would not come to 1 per cent. of the whole lot. As far as the growing of wheat is concerned, the Irish farmer is infinitely better off now than before the war.</P>

Lest Deputies here may think that we were unjust, let us refer for a moment to the price which the English farmer is getting.  I <Col N="1020" /> am sure that Deputy Hughes reads the English farming papers&mdash;the <i>Farmer's Weekly</i> and others.  I have never seen in any of those papers any complaint expressed as to the price of wheat in England.  The English farmers are paying double the wages to their labourers that we pay to our farm labourers and they also give them a half-day in the week.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton says that the price of wheat is not sufficient, and I want to deal with the price of wheat. The English farmer, as I have said, is getting £3 per acre and 14/6 per cwt. for what he sells.  Our farmers get 20/- per cwt. for what they sell.  If they get a crop which averages 12 cwt. to the acre, they get as much as the English farmers for their wheat, but if the crop averages more than 12 cwt. to the acre <Col N="1021" /> they are getting more than the English farmer.

I should like to mention this fact too.  I am sure that Deputy Belton knows that if you go out into County Dublin, Carlow, Wicklow, or even into County Wexford to look for land on which to grow wheat, you will get farmers to bid up to £10, £12, or £20 an acre against you.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmer, after all, has a good head and he is not going to pay that price for land unless he makes money on it.  If the farmer can pay £10, £12 or £14 an acre for land for <Col N="1022" /> wheat-growing away from his own home and make it pay, it must be a paying proposition on his own land.  I think that taking all these facts into consideration, Deputies must agree that the price of wheat is a fair price and that nobody can find fault with it. Deputy Cogan and Deputy Belton suggest that because there was not enough wheat grown that is proof that the price was unsatisfactory.  I do not think we could argue that is the absolute truth, as there are other considerations. If you pursue that argument and say that is the only consideration, then we have to admit that the farmers are very satisfied this year with the price of beet.  There are, however, other considerations to be taken into account there also.  I think myself that the fact that farmers this year are getting an allowance of artificial manures for beet-growing has much more to do with the increased area under beet than the price of it.  I thought last year that the price of beet was attractive.  I know that when the price was announced last year I heard no complaints about it, although I did hear complaints about this year's price. I did not hear any complaints last year, yet we did not get a large beet acreage because the farmers could not grow beet without artificial manures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other considerations besides price that we must remember.  That brings me to the big point which Deputy Belton mentioned. I think he said, for instance, that the Taoiseach stated earlier in the campaign that if there is a shortage of food, animals must be sacrificed. He went on then to say that we had now changed our tactics and that we were telling people we must get food for animals.  I do not see anything inconsistent in that.  The very first meeting I addressed in the food campaign about three years ago was <Col N="1023" /> in County Dublin, and Deputy Belton was there to welcome me.  If Deputy Belton would go back to that time and get a copy of the newspapers&mdash;I do not ask him to do it because perhaps it would entail too much trouble&mdash;he would find that I made exactly the same speech&mdash;not perhaps using the same words, but expressing the same ideas&mdash;as I have been making this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>You were under good influences that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe so.  That is, that we required 1,000,000 tons of grain&mdash; 500,000 tons of wheat and 500,000 tons of feeding stuff for animals, and that we wanted to get it as soon as possible. I may have said publicly&mdash;and I think everybody will agree I was right&mdash;that our big push should be for wheat to feed the people, and that if there was to be a shortage, let it be a shortage of animal feeding, in other words, that the animals might have to be sacrificed. I think anybody in the shoes of members of the Government of that time would have come to the same conclusion. First of all, it was not likely that we would get 1,000,000 tons of grain in the first year.  I think everybody will agree that you were not going to get men in County Meath, for instance, where there was no great tradition of tillage, to go straight out for a 25 per cent. tillage.  We could not get 1,000,000 tons in the first year, and we came to the conclusion that human food should come first and that if there was a shortage of food, the number of animals must be cut down.  I think Deputies will remember that in our public statements of that time we said that pigs and poultry were the big competitors with human beings for grain.  The numbers of pigs and poultry have been reduced.  Poultry, however, have gone down by only 10 per cent., while pigs have gone down by 50 per cent.  In speeches recently made in going round the country, I said that not only should we grow all the wheat we required for human consumption, but that we should also grow a large quantity of animal feeding stuffs in <Col N="1024" /> order to get the amount of meat and animal products that we require. Were we sure of a sufficient supply for human needs, we could fulfil all these other wants.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton then made the point that we have reached the optimum in tillage, that we could not grow very much more, that it would not be advisable or economical&mdash;I think these were the words he used&mdash;to till any more.  That is not consistent with another part of Deputy Belton's speech.  Deputy Belton gave us the impression in another part of his speech that if we paid enough for grain crops we would have plenty of wheat for human beings and plenty of wheat, barley and oats for all the poultry and pigs in the country.  Why should we get more produced at any price, if what Deputy Belton says is true, that the manure position will prevent us from growing more?  After all, if the land is not fit to grow any more oats, wheat or barley there is no price that we can offer that will induce the farmer to grow more of these crops on his land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>An improved price for cattle would give us more cattle and that would give us more manure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was another point made by the Deputy&mdash;that we could get a better form of farmyard manure by more stall feeding.  And that we could arrange to get a better market for stall-fed cattle on the British market.  I think what Deputy Belton said was that, if we did not get a better price for fat stock, we would lose our only hope.  We have done our best, but that is something outside our control.  After all, if we cannot succeed in getting anything done that is outside our control, naturally we must try to get something done apart from that.  We are not going to throw in the sponge and say that if they do not give us more for fat cattle we must starve.  We must do our best to find a substitute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have tried to get the British Government to see that, from our point of view and, perhaps, even <Col N="1025" /> from their own point of view, they ought to give us a bit more for stall-fed cattle, but they do not agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Belton made a very serious mistake when he talked about Mr. Michael Redmond. I did not want to interrupt the speech of the Deputy at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a small point. The Minister can take it from me that it is true and I am sorry that it is true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he does not want his name mentioned in the House, but Michael Redmond was reared and lived all his life on a very small farm of 25 acres and made a very good living.  He reared ten children and has now two sons, as well as himself, who are ploughmen.  They are very happy on that farm and are not depending on the drawing of sand or anything else like that.  Deputy Belton will find that that is so, if he verifies it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan mentioned the young inspectors.  I explained that point already to Deputy Hughes. Probably, Deputy Cogan was thinking of the assistants to the inspectors.  The inspectors are all men who have been many years in the service: they were in the Land Commission before they came to this Department.  They have younger men recruited as their assistants, but these younger men never take a decision of the kind referred to, as to where wheat should be sown or anything of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Hughes that my responsibility and that of the Government do not end with making an Order or by going round making speeches.  I am sure Deputy Hughes <Col N="1026" /> did not mean to deprecate in any way the value of those meetings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <P>They provide equipment for certain farmers.  On the whole, they are very big farms where tractors could be usefully employed.  In this country, where 75 per cent. of the holdings are under 25 acres, that sort of equipment would be largely misplaced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from that, we cannot get the equipment.  I was down in County Mayo last Saturday at a meeting and was told that certain people had not got their threshing done, as the thresher had not reached them after the last harvest.  What can I suggest? We cannot get any new threshers, though we have tried hard to get them.  The only thing they could do there would be to go&mdash; or send someone on their behalf&mdash;to the County Carlow or County Wexford to buy a thresher and bring it to Mayo, but that would leave Carlow and Wexford at the loss.</P>

      <P>A lot of threshing machines this year travelled very much <Col N="1027" /> further than before; they went long distances to get a good deal of work done.  There is not very much use in setting up these committees to provide equipment when we have not got the equipment.  We are doing the best we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to provide parts, kerosene, and so on, for them, and I think that is the best we can do at the moment.  Deputy Hughes raised a rather big question about maintaining our exports, so as to be in the foreign market when the war is over. That is all right, but, owing to circumstances to which I have referred, and the shortage of foodstuffs, we are not able to get enough of certain articles for ourselves at the moment.  We may be better off next year than we are now with regard to bacon and butter; but as long as this emergency lasts we will not have any quantity of those articles for export.  Our export position is all right at the moment, in so far as there is plenty of exports for what we import&mdash;more than enough, in fact, as we cannot get the imports.</P>
      <P>The question of fertility of the soil was raised.  Although it is a word used always, I think the word &ldquo;fertility&rdquo; gives a person a wrong impression. We are really talking about plant food, and farmyard manure is, undoubtedly, the best from that point of view.  As far as I know, artificial manures have no lasting effect; they are good for the time being, for whatever crop is there, and they have some effect in the following year, but by the third year there is no effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>You must have the humus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  There is no humus in the artificial manure.  So far as post-war fertility is concerned, the lack of artificials will not be as important as is the continuous cropping during the emergency, which will have a very bad effect, if done in a particular portion of land.  That is why it would be very useful if the crops could be rotated, and, as Deputy <Col N="1028" /> Hughes remarked, the first crop meadow brought in.  The good farmer was not in any way prejudiced by not having that included, as I am sure good men like Deputy Hughes did go on with the ordinary rotation, first crop meadow, and so on.  By bringing the tillage next year up to 33? per cent. Deputy Hughes will be in exactly the same position, as the first crop meadow will be counted; but we do not want to have the other men doing this continuous cropping, as it will mean much better farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In talking of Sir George Stapleton, we should remember to take credit here for the things we have done.  I remember reading Sir George Stapleton's book&mdash;<i>Land</i> was the title, I think&mdash;which was a very interesting publication.  His conclusion was that three big things should be done to improve agriculture in England.  The first was a Government control department, very much on the lines of our Land Commission.  It did not differ very much in outline from that Department, which we have had here for many years.  The second was a scheme of drainage and reclamation&mdash;again very much on the lines of the scheme we have here, though his would go in for bigger things.  The scheme of grants and so on is very much like the scheme we have here, so we had two of the three points he advocated for England. The third point was mentioned by Deputy Hughes&mdash;indigenous grasses, which they have not got to any extent in England yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>But they have been developing them for some years.  Why are we not doing so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The quantity is very small.  The most important of all, as everyone will admit, is perennial ryegrass. We have that indigenous, at any rate: we have always had our perennial rye grass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We could improve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Something is being done to improve it.  On the whole, when you take a book like Sir George Stapleton's <Col N="1029" /> and read through it to see what is recommended, you find that we have done at least as much as&mdash;if not more than&mdash;has been done in England.  We should not lose sight of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister.  I think we could do far more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, we could do far more, but we should not overlook the fact that we have done something. Regarding the price of barley, Deputy Hughes anticipated my answer.  It is extraordinarily difficult to have one price for malted barley and a different price for another type.  The maltsters only used about 40 per cent. of the 1942 crop.  If more barley is offered for sale than the maltsters will actually take, the difficulty immediately arises as to what sample they will take, what particular farmers they will deal with and whom they will leave out.  There will be great trouble and, on the whole, I think the price of barley is better left uniform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain farmers were going in to the maltsters and the maltsters were taking all from one and none from the next.  It created a lot of bad blood between individual farmers and between maltsters and farmers, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>I should like to call the attention of the Deputies to the fact that this debate must finish at 7.40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not take long but there are a few matters to be dealt with here, and the first is concerned with Deputy Belton's point about the inspectors' powers.  I am sure that Deputy Belton has seen, as I have seen, coming up by rail through the country, fine fields which would yield, if not as fine a crop of wheat as Deputy Belton grew, at least a very fine crop of wheat&mdash;fields which, at any rate would grow one ton of wheat per acre&mdash;and I have seen them left unused or else tied down to the growing of oats, just because of the careless policy that was pursued in this country for so many years, to the effect that the growing of wheat would ruin the land.  That can be seen even here in the County Dublin, and I am sure that Deputy Belton realises it, and that is one of the reasons why I am in favour of giving power to inspectors to go into a farm and say to the farmer concerned: &ldquo;You must sow that field with wheat.&rdquo;  However, I should like to say this with regard to Deputy Belton: that he was one of the pioneers of wheat-growing in this country.  We had very few friends of the growing of wheat in this country up to some years ago, and I do admit that Deputy Belton was one of the men who stood up and said that we could grow all the wheat we needed here.  I certainly will give him that credit, but when we came into power, in 1932, the quantity of wheat that was being grown in this country at that time would not be sufficient to <Col N="1031" /> feed our people for a few weeks, not to speak of feeding them through the period of emergency that has ensued since 1939, and it was the work that was done by the present Minister for Agriculture that saved us from starvation, that saved our children from being murdered in Flanders or elsewhere, or being left in this country starving for bread.  That was the position, and it was the present Minister for Agriculture who saved this nation, so far as our food supplies are concerned, and he had a lot of opposition to meet with in the doing of that.</P>
      <P>The next point that was made here was in connection with farm labourers. I was one of those who fought, tooth and nail, to get at least a minimum wage fixed for farm labourers, but it must be remembered that in the first year that the Minister fixed a minimum wage of 24/- for farm labourers throughout the country, the average wage was 20/-.  It is now 36/-.  I should like to see it even more than that.  I, more than any man here, I think, should like to see it increased, but there is a limit to everything, and I say that the best judges of the prices of farm produce in this country are the farmers themselves.  You need only watch what happened last year in the case of the beet acreage, which dropped by many thousands of acres because the farmers did not consider they were getting an adequate price. They are being offered a better price this year, and we are led to believe that a sufficient acreage of beet will be produced, but I think I shall wait to see whether that acreage will be produced until the beet is actually drawn into the factories next harvest, because my opinion is that we did not get the acreage last year because the beet growers proved to themselves that our statements and our beliefs were false.  I think that that is very definite. The ordinary farmer has driven up the acreage of beet this year, although I thought it would have gone down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I should like to say to the Minister is that I do not agree with <Col N="1032" /> his statement with regard to barley. We are entitled to Guinness's market for barley without control, if Guinness is entitled to turn out stout here and to sell it across in Britain where they are getting 70/- a barrel.  That is one of the points in respect of which I lock horns with the Minister.  Another point on which I disagree is that, instead of having a price fixed by the Government for what we produce on our land, we should be put in the same position as the industrialist who can go to the Prices Commission, prove his case and get his price.  We are the industrialists of the soil and we are entitled to the same whack as the artificial industrialist outside who gets his 6 per cent, rain, hail or snow. As beet growers, we go to the Sugar Company and put our case, and they then thrash it out with the Government. That is an unfair way of doing it.  We have at least equal rights with any iron or steel owners in the country, and we should insist on those rights.  It is unfair that the industrialist should have the Prices Commission before which he can prove his costs, have his profit added and get his price, when we do not get the same treatment.  Let us be given the same treatment as the industrialist, and then there will be no fight as to whether we are getting enough, too much or too little.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree that we should not get, and are not entitled to get, to-day the price which has to be paid for imported oats and wheat.  We embarked on a policy of insurance in 1932 to ensure that the people would not be dependent on Britain or other countries for bread in time of war, and that we would not have any outside country taking us by throat and saying: &ldquo;You want bread for your people. Give us 500,000 men and you will get it.&rdquo;  I know there are Deputies who hoped to see that condition of affairs brought about.  They failed, thank God, but that insurance policy meant that the farmers here got more for their wheat from 1932 to 1939, than they would have got in the ordinary way if the foreign grain had been allowed in.  They cannot now say: &ldquo;It costs so much to bring it over in time <Col N="1033" /> of war and we are entitled to the difference here.&rdquo;  Let us get a fair and honest price&mdash;that is all the farmers ask.  I say that I am as much entitled to speak for the farmers as any Deputy, and I say that we do not want too much.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Minister did not deal more specifically with what I consider to be the most important point in the whole debate, that is, the wages we are to pay for the production of this food.  Quite obviously, the Minister must have taken the cost of production into account in controlling prices.  He must have had regard to the wages item, but he did not explain how he could fix 50/- a barrel for wheat last year and 50/- a barrel for wheat this year and increase the wages by 3/- a week, giving a wage which is entirely inadequate for a man to live on and give a return in work.  He did not face up to the principal point at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has given to an inspector the power to tell farmers to grow wheat. Why did he not tell them himself? Why did he not put in the Order that a farmer must put a percentage of his arable land under wheat?  The Minister said that a farmer might not have land fit to grow wheat.  In that case, he has not wheat-arable land and would be automatically exempt.  He has given to an individual power to do what he would not do himself, which I think is altogether wrong.  The Minister spoke of what was done for wheat growing in the pre-war period.  We know all that; we know that in 1938 and 1939, one could buy as much first-class foreign wheat here in Dublin as one wanted at 15/- per barrel, and perhaps less.  The Minister said that 30/- per barrel was being paid here in order to encourage the growing of wheat.  That is true and it was necessary in order to encourage the growing of wheat here, but when he reaches the point at which it is cheaper to grow wheat here than to import it, why does he not grow it here?  Why pay 65/11 per barrel for wheat when you can get it grown here for £3 per barrel?  I cannot understand the Minister's action in importing wheat at a higher price than that at which it can be produced at home.  The case has often been made here that our ships <Col N="1034" /> which run all the risks of importing that wheat would be better employed economically in importing artificial manures.</P>

      <P>We would grow all the wheat necessary if we got the price paid for the foreign wheat.  The Minister made a very poor case, in my opinion, on that point, but the poorest case he made was that in respect of wages.  I genuinely fear the danger of a shortage of labour for handling the crop.  It must inevitably be so when they are paid so badly.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not agree with me on the question of manures.  The reason he did not see my point is that he did not want to see it.  He talked about the prices of crops in England and about what they were getting for wheat.  When I asked him what they were getting for the potato crop, he said he was dealing with wheat, but, as the Minister knows, you cannot separate the prices of two crops. Potatoes are the best crop to precede wheat, and covering two years of expenditure and takings in respect of two crops on the same land, and ascertaining what your aggregate takings, expenditure and net profit are, is the only way you will arrive at a business method.  The Minister knows that a subsidy of £10 per acre and a guaranteed price of £8 per ton for potatoes are given in Great Britain.  They have unlimited quantities of fertilisers, which we have not got here.  He knows quite well that the conditions over there are much better.  If we had unlimited artificials here we would get heavier yields and a less price would do, because there is the same outlay in cultivating the land for a good crop as for a poor one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not putting this motion to a division.  It was put down for the purpose of having this discussion on agriculture.  One thing I am disappointed with is that the Minister <Col N="1035" /> did not face up to the fixing of prices for agricultural produce and in fixing the prices make provision for a wage which would induce people to work on the land; induce the best labour to work on the land.  The best labour is now clearing out of the country, if they can get half a chance to clear out, and there is a migration from the land such as we never had before.  The Minister for Agriculture will have to bear a very large responsibility for controlling prices at a figure that will not enable a wage equivalent to the wage paid in industry to be paid in agriculture.  When men do not get a living wage in agriculture they migrate to the towns, and the countryside is being denuded of the rural population.  The Minister and his officers will have all the responsibility of that on their shoulders, because they are not giving a chance to agriculture to pay a wage that will enable people to live in any sort of decency or comfort on the land.  The Minister is gambling with agricultural production and not ensuring that sufficient labour will be retained on the land to produce food for the people.</P>

    <P>That, in view of the increased cost of living and the inadequacy of the benefits payable at present to unemployed persons, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the Government should at once introduce proposals for increasing substantially the rates of benefit under (a) the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and (b) the Unemployment Assistance Acts.&mdash;Deputies Davin, Hickey and Everett.</P>

      <P>There were a few matters raised in the course of the discussion on this motion yesterday with which I did not deal last night and concerning which I am anxious to enlighten Deputy Davin and his colleagues, <Col N="1036" /> because they appear to require enlightenment.  I am glad Deputy Davin approves of this process of education to which he is being subjected. A willing pupil is always much easier to teach than an unwilling one like Deputy Hannigan.  The motion asks that because of the increase in the cost of living we should increase the unemployment assistance rates and provide for an increase in unemployment insurance benefits.  So far as the unemployment assistance rates are concerned, I pointed out last evening that we have increased them on more than one occasion since the war started; that in fact, if one takes the average family of a man with a wife and five children, the percentage increase in the rates of assistance payable to these people now is greater than the percentage increase in the cost-of-living index figure.  I pointed out that the cost-of-living index figure is no longer a reliable guide to the cost of living of the average family, because it is based upon assumptions which are no longer correct.  Even if it were taken as a reliable guide, the percentage increase shown by that index figure is less than the percentage increase in the value of unemployment assistance given to a family of the description I have mentioned residing in any town in the country.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the Deputy, the percentage increase varies from town to town, because one must make allowance for the actual cost of foodstuffs supplied upon the food vouchers.  The percentage increase in Dublin is 62, but it rises in other towns to 100 and 106.</P>

      <P>The cash given to unemployment assistance applicants, plus the value of the food vouchers.  In some towns it is as much as 100 per cent. in the case of a family consisting of a man with a wife and five children. As the increased allowances were given mainly in the form of additional benefits in respect of children, naturally the <Col N="1037" /> percentage increase is higher in the case of larger families than smaller families.  That is a fact.  Unemployment insurance was also mentioned.  Deputy Davin read out a list of figures.  I do not know where he got them.</P>

The figures read out for the income and expenditure of the Unemployment Insurance Fund may have been the number of heifers and calves in County Laoighis, or the number of votes the Labour Party hope to get in the next election, but they have nothing to do with the income and expenditure of the Unemployment Insurance Fund.

      <P>Keep the apprentice quiet.  For the year 1937-38 the contributions totalled £975,688 and for 1941-42, £934,888.  The State grant remained unchanged, and the only item showing any substantial difference was that in respect of interest on the assets of the fund.  The payments from the Unemployment Insurance Fund showed, of course, a substantial increase in the year 1941-42, not because the number of persons drawing unmployment insurance benefit had increased proportionately, but because the rates of benefit had been enlarged.  The Appropriation-in-Aid of administration showed a reduction. Deputy Davin asked me why there had been such an increase in the expenditure upon administration.  The actual fact is that in 1937-8 the Appropriation-in-Aid of administration was £188,000, but in 1941-2 it was £180,000.  There was a contribution from the Unemployment Insurance Fund to the cost of unemployment assistance of £300,000.  Deputy Davin said that that came as a shock to him. I was astonished to hear him say that, because it is provided for in the Unemployment Assistance Act passed in 1934, when he was a member of the Dáil.  Although he spoke a lot during the discussions upon that Act, he may not have read that Act or understood what was contained in it.  That was contained in it, but apparently it slipped his memory, so that when he came across it in Mr. Luke Duffy's statistics it gave him a shock.  If the Deputy sticks to Mr. Luke Duffy's statistics he will get many a shock. There is the situation.  That fund has been accumulating a surplus for some time past, but because of the increase in the benefits which have been already brought into operation that surplus has disappeared.  During the <Col N="1039" /> past two years for which complete statistics are available there was an excess of payments over revenue, and it is anticipated that the accumulated surplus will have disappeared this year and that the fund will possibly close on the 31st of this months with a small deficit.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin, of course, wanted to give increased unemployment benefit without increasing the contributions. That is typical of the Labour Party: give everybody more at nobody's expense.  How it is to be done they will not tell us.  The Unemployment Insurance Fund is composed of contributions from workers, their employers and the State, and the benefits paid out of the fund relate to the number of contributions credited to each worker.  We can increase substantially the benefits paid to insured persons if there is a corresponding increase in the contributions.  I think the contributions are at present high. I am not at all sure that the workers of the country would regard it as beneficial to them that there should be an increase in the rates of benefit involving a substantial increase in the rates of contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies, perhaps, have a wrong idea about our unemployment problem. In respect of 65 per cent. of the total number of persons in this country who work for wages there is no unemployment at all.  Sixty-five out of every 100 workers never experience unemployment. The balance experience periods of unemployment of varying duration, but I want Deputies to remember that the 65 per cent. who experience no unemployment are the people who contribute the revenue of the Unemployment Insurance Fund which is expended for the benefit of those who experience unemployment. In present circumstances it is necessary to bear in mind the interests of those workers as well as the interests of those who are from time to time in the position of having to draw upon the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  We can increase the amount they will get only by decreasing the amount the others get and, in the last resource, it is a matter of balancing interests in <Col N="1040" /> order to ensure that the welfare of those who are in employment will be taken into account as well as the welfare of those who are temporarily out of it.</P>
    <P>One of the matters raised in the discussion yesterday was the Construction Corps, and statements were made by Labour Deputies and by Deputy Byrne that it is wrong for the Government to deprive young men who declined to join the Construction Corps of their unemployment assistance.  I was told that was conscription.  Some Deputies called it conscription; others referred to it as a mild form of conscription. I am anxious to know what the attitude of the Labour Party is in this matter.  The obligation which they say rests upon the Government is to provide unemployed people with work or with maintenance.  Surely, in the case of a single man without dependents, whose home circumstance involve no barrier to his leaving home, who is not in employment, not apprenticed to a trade, not a skilled worker, with no immediate prospect of employment, the offer of enrolment in the Construction Corps, involving as it does the opportunity of useful, healthy work, good clothing, good food and reasonable remuneration, must properly be regarded as an offer of work.  Or, is the attitude of the Labour Party this: that we must give to each worker not merely an offer of work, but an offer of the kind of work which he is willing to accept?  If they are going to adopt that policy, if they ever get into the position of forming a Labour Government, they are in for a lot of trouble.  I advise them to reconsider it, because, immediately, they will be in conflict with the Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>I think one of the weaknesses of the position that has arisen in relation to the Construction Corps is that although we have been able to give those who joined it healthy occupation, good food, good clothing, and the opportunity of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Getting married?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;adapting themselves to hard work, we cannot give them training; we cannot give them an opportunity of acquiring skill which will increase their value in the labour <Col N="1041" /> market when they leave the corps. There is no use in doing so.  If we train a member of the Construction Corps to be a bricklayer, a baker, or a butcher, it will be of no value to him, because, although any member of the Construction Corps can hope to become President of this State or a Cardinal, or even a member of the Labour Party, he cannot become either a butcher, a bricklayer, or a baker, because there are rigid trade union rules which confine entry into these trades to persons whose fathers or grandfathers were bricklayers, butchers or bakers.</P>
      <P>If we are to tackle this problem of unemployment properly it will involve training people in occupations of one kind or another.  That cannot be done without the co-operation of the trade union movement, without some evidence of a willingness amongst those who direct the activities of trade unions to modify their rigid rules in order to ensure that those who get the training will subsequently have an opportunity of using it for the purpose of getting employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree entirely with the suggestion made here that it is wrong for the Government to withhold unemployment assistance from a young man who refuses to join the Construction Corps.  Once the State has given to such a person the opportunity of employment in the Construction Corps, I think it has released itself from any obligation to provide maintenance.  I get a number of letters from parents who tell me that they dislike the idea of their sons leaving parental control for the purpose of going into the corps, or from parents who think their sons are not tough enough to mix with their <Col N="1042" /> fellows in the corps, and who urge that, therefore, they should be allowed to refuse the opportunity of enrolment and to continue to draw unemployment assistance.  I think that while a parent is undoubtedly entitled to exercise the choice of not allowing his son to enrol in the Construction Corps, it is not reasonable to expect that the State will, nevertheless, continue to provide maintenance for that young man when he has decided upon that refusal.  He has the option of refusing, but refusal does involve releasing the State from any further obligation, for the time being at least, to provide maintenance for the individual.</P>
      <P>The statement was made that any person who refused to join the Construction Corps was refused unemployment assistance.  That is wrong.  The position is that a person between 17 and 25&mdash;these are the present ages for enrolment in the Construction Corps&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who declines the offer of enrolment in that body is, nevertheless, entitled to draw unemployment assistance if he is a skilled worker or apprenticed to a trade, if he has a good industrial record and has not been long unemployed or can show that he has a reasonable prospect of obtaining employment in the near future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne, of course, mentioned the case of the young man who was the sole companion of his aged grandmother and said how cruel it was to require that young man to leave the aged grandmother alone in order that he might join the Construction Corps. That never happened.  Any applicant for unemployment assistance, within these age limits, who declines to join the Construction Corps but who can show that his family circumstances are such as to make it unreasonable to expect him to leave home, or whose absence from home would cause undue hardship to members of his family who have to rely upon him for care and attention, is entitled to receive and is getting unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance officer in the first instance, subject to appeal to the Court of Referees.  Out of some 8,000 people who declined the invitation to join the Construction Corps since that body was set up, 2,274 were, nevertheless, permitted to continue to draw unemployment assistance on one or other of the grounds I have mentioned.  These figures and the other facts I have mentioned do, I think, answer the case that the Government have acted harshly or unreasonably in dealing with this class of unemployed persons.</P>
      <P>I think I can say that the Government have never acted harshly or unreasonably in dealing with any section of the community that has to apply, in times of temporary need, for assistance.  The expansion of the social services which the Government have initiated since they came into office, their record since the outbreak of the emergency alone, is proof of the sympathy with which they judge the problems of those persons and their endeavour to secure that the resources of the community will be made available to assist them in their dire need.  We are not taking on obligations to give out money for nothing, or without due examination of the need for it.  It is a very easy matter for Deputies opposite to propose that we give out more and more money to anybody who cares to apply for it and take no responsibility for raising the money. That would be an irresponsible approach to our national problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the keynote of the whole discussion, so far as it concerned the Labour Party, was fixed by Deputy Hannigan when he warned Deputies on this side to vote for the motion or face political extinction.  I do not wonder that Deputy Hannigan is perturbed over the possibility of political extinction, and I do not blame him in the least for thinking that other people apply the same test as he does to considerations of public policy.  I know he cannot understand that there are people who would decide questions of public policy on their merits and not from the point of view of the effect on their political interests.  So far as <Col N="1044" /> we are concerned, we are quite capable of looking after our own political interests. We have done fairly well up to the present.  Deputy Davin, no doubt, hopes that we have lost some support.  I admit that we have lost Deputy Hannigan, but whether that is a gain to the Labour Party, time alone will tell.</P>
    <P>Another statement that was repeated here yesterday is that the Government's only solution for unemployment is emigration.  We had the usual rhetorical embellishments about exporting human beings and trading in the lifeblood of the country.  What is the attitude of the Labour Party to emigration?  Have they ever expressed it?  I do not believe they have. They have never attempted to formulate any proposals or give any idea of their policy in relation to that particular matter.</P>
    <P>The Government have imposed barriers on the emigration of people from this country.  Nobody can emigrate who is in employment or for whom there is employment immediately available.  No one is allowed to emigrate whose services might be required in agriculture or in turf production.  These are the classes who are denied emigration. Others are allowed to emigrate, provided they are not subject to the age ban or have not left their previous employment voluntarily or lost it through their own fault.  Do Deputies opposite suggest that those for whom there is no work, those who are not in employment and whose services are not likely to be required for agriculture or for turf production, should be prevented from emigrating?</P>

      <P>We will get a good deal of rhetoric from the Labour Benches, and probably Deputy Norton will thump his chest, as he usually does, and talk about the export of human beings.  But the Labour Party will not attempt to formulate a policy or bring forward a constructive idea.  For the 20 years of their existence as a Party here, Labour Deputies never thought of a constructive idea.  I am asking them one question.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the question now and Deputy Davin will have an opportunity of answering it later. We decided we could not justly stop these people from emigrating.  We have power to stop them, but we had to consider what was best in the interests of the people, what was the just thing to do.  We desire to stop emigration and to be able, if possible, to provide work for those who now have to emigrate; but, under the present circumstances, the only type of work we can provide, having regard to the limitations upon the supplies of material and implements and fuel is, in the main, unskilled work.  Does Deputy Davin regard it as adequate compensation for a man who was employed as a motor-driver, a metal worker or a printer, that he should be offered a job on some construction scheme?  Does he want that man, because of the Government's ability or intention to offer him a job on a construction scheme, to be prevented from <Col N="1046" /> emigrating to a job where he can retain his skill while at the same time providing for his family on the standard to which they have been accustomed? The Deputy will not answer that question, because he knows that the Government's policy is the only intelligent policy in the circumstances; but he does not want to admit that.</P>
      <P>These skilled workers, who are temporarily disemployed because of certain conditions arising out of the emergency, have been allowed to emigrate by the Government.  We have endeavoured to protect their interests in emigrating.  We have made arrangements with the authorities in Great Britain and elsewhere that will ensure that their interests will be safeguarded while they are away, and we hope it will be possible for them to come back here speedily when the resumption of the inflow of raw materials and fuel results in the revival of activities in their normal occupations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say there is no work for them.  In fact, there is a likelihood in many parts of the country that there will be a scarcity of workers to meet the requirements of agriculture this season and, because of that, we had to make special provision in order to compensate the workers who wanted to emigrate, but whom we would not allow to emigrate, during the period in which they had to wait until agriculture needed their services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point of view.  I think the Government have a right to ensure that the number of workers required to handle the harvest, and to produce the country's requirements of fuel, are kept within the country.  Once we decided that we <Col N="1047" /> ought to restrict their right of movement there devolved on us an obligation to make provision for them during periods of unemployment over and above that made for ordinary workers. That provision is not merely the payment of additional cash allowances.  It includes also a preference for employment upon work financed by the Government and exemption from the usual Employment Period Orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true to say that a substantial proportion of those who emigrate do so because they want to go.  In fact, one of the functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce at the moment is to check up on statements made by applicants, that they lost their employment through no fault of their own or because their employment was terminated, and it is not infrequently the case that workers who were in employment left with the connivance of their previous employers, who signed the necessary documents on their behalf, in order to get the opportunity of employment elsewhere, having been influenced by stories that they heard of the higher wages prevailing and other conditions operating temporarily outside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are going to deal with the problem of emigration, or with the associated problem of unemployment, by providing work, then we must make an effort to ensure that skilled workers, accustomed to remuneration at the rate of skilled workers, are provided with the opportunity of getting some corresponding type of employment. It is no solution for them to be offered employment on relief schemes. There you are up against the same trade union rules to which I referred <Col N="1048" /> already, because the biggest barrier to the employment of skilled workers, who are surplus to one employment, is the conservatism of trade unions which do not like to see any expansion in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>How many workers are covered by the restrictions to which you have referred?  A few thousand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that, in present circumstances, there are very few occupations affected but it happened in cases of which the Deputy knows.  In fact, there was a period during which the whole building industry was held up because of a scarcity of skilled workers in certain classes.  These classes were not by any means the most important numerically, but they were sufficiently organised to hold up the whole building industry and to upset its rate of progress, and did so rather than permit an extension of their numbers.  I appreciate fully&mdash;and I am sure the Deputy does&mdash;the motive that inspired that conservatism, but we must have a more generous approach to the problem of unemployment on behalf of the trade unions if we are to tackle it in the way that Deputies have always advocated&mdash;by providing workers who are surplus to the occupations in which they are trained with employment in other occupations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg pardon.  I do not know anybody better qualified to lecture on that subject than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He talks of the Labour Party's irresponsibility in asking for everything without caring where any of the money to secure it comes from.  I remember when the Minister was in Opposition, and I do not know anybody who asked for more than he did then.  I do not know anybody who paid less regard to where money was to come <Col N="1050" /> from than he did.  I remember him and his colleagues, when on the Front Opposition Benches, telling us on different occasions that they could solve all the problems that were confronting the Government of that day and, at the same time, reduce taxation. Now, we see whether these promises have been put into operation or not.</P>
      <P>I notice that, in recent months, the Minister told us that, so far as this election is concerned, he is not going to make any promises.  If he is to be judged on the promises he made at the last election, I do not think he will get very far.</P>
      <P>When referring to taxation, he said that the Labour Party has always voted against taxation.  That is not true.  The Minister knows it is not true.  The Labour Party has refused to vote for the taxation of tobacco and tea, when, in the same Budget, there was contained a proposal which permitted greater profits to be given to industry.  I defy the Minister for Industry and Commerce to indicate any occasion on which the Labour Party refused to vote for taxation in order to provide social services for the people.  We are confronted with a situation now when the people on whose behalf we speak find that they cannot live in anything like the same degree of comfort&mdash;or should I say discomfort&mdash;as they did pre-war. The Minister stated that the increases given since the beginning of the emergency would be as much as 100 per cent.  I differ seriously with him in that respect.  He was very careful not to give the actual figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was careful to keep away from the actual figures. He asked us to face realities.  We are in touch with people who have to face realities in matters of this kind, people who are trying to get the wherewithal to live on the meagre allowances paid as unemployment assistance by the Government.  The Minister stated that the statistics published in his own Journal were all wrong and not to be <Col N="1051" /> relied upon.  When Deputy Davin quoted from it, he said that the cost of living had increased 58 per cent.  That was in November last.  I am perfectly satisfied that the cost of living has increased since then.  I venture to suggest that the necessaries of life, which have to be bought from day to day by the poor, have increased considerably more than 58 per cent; that foodstuffs &mdash;bacon, of which the poor get very little, and butter, of which they also get very little&mdash;have increased in price by well over 100 per cent.  Deputy Davin quoted the price of rabbits, and as far as I remember the price has increased by over 300 per cent.</P>
      <P>The position at the moment is that up to last August&mdash;I have not made any calculations since then&mdash;the £ had depreciated to 11/1, so that a person would now require 31/7 to buy the amount of goods that a £ would have purchased in 1939.  I suggest to the Minister that any increase that has been given by his Department is not at all commensurate with the state of affairs there revealed.  The Minister told us that vouchers had been given to the people, but only, of course, to those in the urban areas.  I will have something to say about the rural areas later.  Would the Minister be surprised to hear that in some urban areas people have been unable to get the particular goods for which they have vouchers, and that in many cases because of the scarcity of butter&mdash;this has happened in my constituency&mdash;they had to get other goods and pay extra for them because the goods for which the vouchers were intended were not available?  Deputy Davin reminds me that has been general.  As regards fuel, in a great many places there is no firewood available so that people have had to take turf and pay more for it because the firewood is not there. These may appear small matters to the Minister.  I am inclined to think that he spoke rather flippantly on this matter, but it is a serious one for the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asked us what was our policy on emigration; were we against emigration?  Strictly on principle we are, but, at the same time, we do not <Col N="1052" /> see anything but emigration facing the people, firstly, because of the small amounts of unemployment assistance and of unemployment benefits that are being paid; and secondly, because of the fact that the Minister, under Order 83, has prevented people from getting decent wages.  He may say what he likes about examinations by his departmental inspectors to prevent people from going away, but I think it can be proved that people have had to leave their employment because they could not live on the wages that he has stipulated they should get.  In consequence they have had to go to the other side.  The reason why we speak so much about emigration is this: because of the statements made by the Minister and his Party prior to the election of 1932, when they told us very definitely that they would have to bring the people back.  Fianna Fáil members, of course, are now beginning to say that is a very hackneyed phrase, and should not be mentioned, but, nevertheless, it was mentioned by two members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are prominent Ministers now.  In the light of what was said at that particular time, one could never visualise a Fianna Fáil Ministry providing facilities for an English officer in order to facilitate emigration from this country. In our wildest imagination we never thought that Fianna Fáil would come to that.</P>

The rural workers have been mentioned.  I suggest to the Minister that it is just as necessary to provide food and fuel vouchers for them as it is for urban workers, and especially for rural workers living on the outskirts of towns who have always worked in a town and who know nothing about agricultural work.  I think the time has arrived when that matter ought to be examined with a view to seeing that those people get vouchers as well as the urban workers.</P>

There was nothing coming into the house but a widow's pension of 5/- a week which his mother was in receipt of.  He was signing on at the employment exchange for a period of six weeks, and at the end of it was told that he was to get 2/- per week.  The widow's pension that his mother was in receipt of was taken into consideration when a calculation was being made as to the means coming into that house.</P>

Of course, he made it as low as possible.  Deputies will remember that whenever we talk about unemployment here the Minister for Industry and Commerce always seeks to show that the income is very high.  He tells us about the number of stamps purchased during the previous year and all the rest of it, but when it suits his book he has other figures to prove something else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what purpose or object the Minister had to serve by bringing these figures in at all except it was to counteract the figures submitted by Deputy Davin, which he disputed.  On this whole matter the position, in so far as the people are concerned, has depreciated. When the Unemployment Assistance Act was first brought in there must have been some standard in the minds of the Ministry before they introduced it, some basis on which they set the value of unemployment assistance that they would give.  I suggest that if an examination were made on the same basis now, and if one were to take into consideration the cost of the actual necessities of life which have to be procured by those unfortunate people who find themselves looking for unemployment assistance outside the employment exchanges it would be necessary to give more than double the amount they were receiving pre-war.</P>
      <P>There is very little use in the Minister jibing at the Labour Party.  The Labour Party are well able to look after themselves, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce will know that before many months are at an end.  We do not require any lectures from him.  He has assumed different rôles in this House.  In his rôle as lecturer on taxation, we know the promises that he has made.  The people of the country can now assess them at their real value when they consider the reputation of the man who made those promises and who had no concern whatever, especially before he got into office, as to where the money was to come from to fulfil those promises.</P>

      <P>Unlike Deputy Corish, I do not write down the value of the Minister's lectures, but I disagree with the Minister on one point.  He stated that this motion by the Labour Party was quite unnecessary owing to the generous action of the Government in taking the necessary steps to look after the welfare of the unemployed. According to the Minister, apparently, there is no need for a Labour Party in this House, but the test will come in the very near future.  The Minister gave us a very fine lecture last night, showing his wonderful fatherly interest in the future of the Labour Party.  He is particularly concerned that the Party should be in such truncated numbers, and hopes for a big increase in its present limited ranks.  He attributed those limited numbers to wild and exaggerated statements and little regard for facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think every member of the Labour Party ought to be grateful to the Minister for the patriarchal interest he has taken in our future.  He stated that the motion was unnecessary, but I think it was necessary, if for, no other purpose than to receive that fatherly advice from the father of promises, who tells us now: &ldquo;Be careful of your future; if you are not more cautious, your statements will be used in evidence against you at a later time.&rdquo;  As a matter of fact, this motion is on the Order Paper purely because of the promises of the then Deputy Lemass, now Minister for Industry and Commerce, as to what was going to happen in the halcyon days when his Party would be in office.  The Minister was quite eloquent last night about the basis of this Act.  I think we ought to go back a little.  It was asked for by the Labour Party&mdash;they were the first people to ask for it&mdash;when the changeover took place and when the Fianna Fáil Party looked for the Labour Party's votes to make them a government. Without the Labour Party's votes they would not have been a <Col N="1056" /> government, and they got them in response to a definite promise that they would reverse the dictum of the previous Government who said that they had no responsibility for the employment or disemployment of the people of this country.</P>

      <P>I am stating what I know to be true, and the Minister probably knows it as well as I do.  When the Minister starts to record the history of this Act, as he did last night, it is as well to have the whole history of it. At that time, the Labour Party did not ask the Fianna Fáil Party, which was then coming into office, to give a continuous pension in the way of unemployment assistance.  What we asked for was work for the workers. That is what we are asking for now. The incoming Fianna Fáil Government said: &ldquo;Yes; we are prepared to admit that the taking of responsibility for the employment of our people should be the first function of a native Government, and we have plans ready that will absorb our people into employment.  Obviously, we cannot give effect to those schemes at once. Some time must elapse before we can put those men to work under the schemes which we have prepared.  So many arrears have been left here by an alien Government that it will probably take a quarter of a century to clear them up.&rdquo;  That was, I think, the statement of the leader of the Party.  But the Minister for Industry and Commerce was always a bit in front of the chief.  It was he who said that, from a check up of the number of unemployed people in the country and of the fine schemes of work which had been prepared, he thought the unemployed could be absorbed within a reasonable time.  It was then he made the historic statement that they would have to send to America for the exiles to come home.</P>

      <P>They did not come back anyway.  It is a good job they did not come back.  The Act was brought in, in redemption of that promise.  It was definitely stated then that those were not full maintenance allowances, but were intended only for the brief periods between one employment scheme and another.  They were not intended as a wage to maintain a man and his wife and family, but merely to bridge over the period between one scheme of work and another.  It was contemplated then that there would be a reasonable scale of wages, out of which a man could put a little bit aside.  In 11 years, those schemes have not materialised, and the Unemployment Assistance Act has become the principal industry for a lot of our people.  Seeing the drain there was going to be upon the national funds, the Minister took steps almost immediately, following 1934, to counteract an Act of this Legislature by filching with the left hand what he gave with the right.  He did that by means of Employment Period Orders from February to October for men with holdings of £4 valuation and from June to October even for men without holdings.  At a stroke of the Minister's pen they were struck completely out of the Act of Parliament passed by this Legislature. But they were only the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That sort of legislation does not operate for other sections of the community. Then he went further; he went the distance of violating even the sacred Constitution by giving us conscription. I have no hesitation in denouncing as conscription their latest regulation with regard to the Construction Corps.  It is nothing short of conscription.  The only omission is that the press gang has not been got into operation to force men into the Construction Corps.  But they have been told: &ldquo;You can join it or starve.&rdquo;  If that is not conscription, I do not know what it is.  Young men in the cities and towns throughout the country&mdash;single men admittedly, but sons of widows with no other means&mdash; who were getting the few shillings available to them at the labour exchanges, on failing to find employment were told: &ldquo;You must join the <Col N="1058" /> Construction Corps.&rdquo;  I know of many cases where they have been rejected when they offered themselves to the Army, but rejection by the Army is not good enough to satisfy the Minister for Industry and Commerce; they must again be rejected by the Construction Corps.  I challenge contradiction on that.  Although they have been rejected by the Army, they must offer themselves again for the Construction Corps before they are qualified for their few shillings benefit.  We are told that that is not conscription.  I say it is a definite violation of every promise that was held out to the young men of this country; it is a definite violation of their freedom and democratic rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very eloquent last night in speaking of the increases that have been given during the emergency, and in regard to which the Labour Party were silent.  But he did not speak of the average at all.  He spoke of the exceptionally high sum which a man might possibly receive, but other Deputies have cited cases of women in receipt of 8/- in the City of Dublin, who have to maintain their mothers. I know that in the City of Limerick the maximum allowance for an unmarried man is 10/-.  He cannot get the vouchers.  They do not operate in the case of single men in the cities, and they do not operate outside the cities even for married men.  The whole thing is a network of lines and barriers, as if we had not enough barriers in this country.  The Minister has failed to provide the employment which was so solemnly promised to the people.  As I have said, he has adopted various devices to rob us of the benefit of the Unemployment Assistance Act, and he has driven hundreds of thousands of our people to work in another country because they could not find employment at home.  He spoke last night about the barrow of marks &mdash;the old worn-out argument about the German workman going around with a barrow full of marks trying to buy his dinner.  It is suggested that the most shocking inflation will result here if the unemployed men get an extra couple of shillings to provide them with a bare subsistence, which they <Col N="1059" /> have not got to-day.  The definite fact is that a standard has been laid down by the Government for the unemployed, in addition to other types of people on fixed incomes.  At a time when the £ is worth 8/6, the widow has her 5/-, the old age pensioner has his 10/- and the man on unemployment assistance has whatever is given to him under the various schemes plus 5/- as a retainer if he remains on the bogs until he is wanted there or until the agriculturists want him to do a job for a couple of days.</P>
    <P>The net result of all this is that you have been economising and attempting to economise at the expense of the health and virility of the Irish people. The money sent home by the 100,000 people who have gone across Channel to earn something to maintain their parents and their families is derided as paper money.  That paper money we are told by the Minister is of no use, but I am just wondering what would have happened if this war had not come as a kind of blessing to these people, to allow them to escape from starvation here and to work amidst a rain of bombs in places where they can earn £5 and £6 a week at a time when there was no work for them in this country.  That money has not the effect, which the Taoiseach suggested, of creating vicious spirals, and of exercising an unfair purchasing power in a diminishing pool of commodities. The moral is clear: you can work for England and send home all the money that you can earn, but you must not work for Ireland because the Fianna Fáil Party has fallen down on the job.  They are bankrupt in any policy which could secure work for the people at home.  The Government which has failed to find work for people and to develop the potential wealth of the country&mdash;and in speaking of wealth I am not thinking of German marks or American dollars; I am thinking of the untapped Irish wealth that is there for exploitation &mdash;must be written down as a failure. The one thing they can do, however, is to provide an adequate subsistence allowance for the unfortunate people for whom employment cannot be <Col N="1060" /> found.  The Irish people will not object to that and certainly the Labour Party will not object to it. The Labour Party has never objected to any expenditure for national or patriotic purposes in this House.</P>
    <P>I say to Ministers that they have a solemn duty to preserve the health of the people and to arrest the malnutrition now so rampant amongst unemployed workers who are unable to obtain sufficient of the necessaries of life with these paltry allowances.  I charge the Minister that he carries a solemn responsibility in this matter, and that he should not have waited for this motion to be reminded of that responsibility.  It should never have been necessary to introduce this motion, and in bringing it forward we are animated, not by any political motives, but by the solemn belief that the Minister and his Party are leading the people down the road which is going to lead to a rapid deterioration in the health of our people and to lower our standards to those of a C. 3 nation, unless the election in June brings about a change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks to the courtesy of Deputy Davin, I am enabled to say a few words in this debate.  We are discussing a motion as to the adequacy or inadequacy of the bare maintenance allowance for the unemployed. We are discussing that motion in a time of intense difficulty and grave emergency, and I do not think that anybody inside or outside this House could be impressed by the Minister's behaviour here this evening in meeting a motion such as that by quips and jibes at the Labour Party, or at the past record of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would not mind if the question which the Minister was asked to face up to was what the Labour Party or the Fianna Fáil Party did or did not do in the past but we are asked in a serious way to consider whether a given sum is sufficient for the bare subsistence of a human being at a time when every one of us knows that the cost of living has risen acutely and that it has risen most acutely in the case of the bare necessaries of life.  It is known to every Deputy here that <Col N="1061" /> households which enjoy an income of £500, £800 or even £1,000 a year, in which there are families, are seriously disturbed as to the cost of maintaining the members of that household in just the bare ordinary supplies.  When there is a question asked in Parliament as to whether a few shillings a week are or are not sufficient to maintain a human being in bare health, one would expect a more serious approach to the question than we got from the Ministerial bench this evening.</P>
    <P>This emergency situation is no new situation.  No Government in this country ever operated with such immense staffs.  Coming on to the fifth year of that emergency situation, when most extraordinary powers have been taken to keep down wages so as to keep down prices and when every effort in that direction has been defied by soaring prices, we would expect a clear statement from the Government as to what, in the Government's opinion, is the bare minimum necessary in terms of cash to keep a human being in health.</P>
    <P>It would be unreasonable to ask for such a figure in the first year of the war.  It is not unreasonable at this stage, and whatever that figure is, it does not get over the difficulty to say that there would have to be a contribution from the workers or that the pool could not afford it.  Whatever that figure is, it will have to be afforded and will have to be found if we are to continue to pretend that we are a Christian Parliament, doing our work in a Christian way.  Irrespective of whose back is bent, whatever figure is necessary will have to be found, and where it can be found best is where most of it will have to be got. The Minister's approach to the question is merely playing politics, and very cheap politics.  This cornering and sparring as to whether emigration <Col N="1062" /> is or is not to be allowed, whether the Labour Party stand for or against emigration is merely cheap political sparring entirely unworthy of a Government spokesman in approaching a question of this kind.  As I have stated, comparatively wealthy people are concerned about the steeply rising cost of the bare necessaries of life for their households.  The cost of living has gone up in spite of the strong Orders of the Minister.  He had to depart to a certain extent from his Wage Orders.  He had to allow wages to go up in order that they might keep even far behind the acutely bounding cost of living.  On the face of it, it is reasonable to suggest that the ratio between what was at one time described as a maintenance allowance and actual maintenance must be kept up whether in peace or in war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I venture to say to the Minister that if the cost of living has gone up by 56 points, the cost of bare maintenance has gone up by 200 per cent.  I find, and the Minster finds, that the picture of the increased cost is not made up of the increased cost of luxuries, but of the increased cost of the plainest commodities. I think that the problem before the inhabitants of this country is the problem of trying to keep even a small family on what would be considered, in other circumstances, high wages. There is every reason, every justice and every soundness in the motion unless the Minister is in a position to meet it by saying that the present rate is higher than the bare cost of subsistence for a human being.</P>
