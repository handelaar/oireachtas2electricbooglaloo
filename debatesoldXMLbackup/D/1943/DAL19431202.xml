      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is now in a position to state the source of the ammunition, or parts thereof, which were found on the <i>S.S. Kerlogue</i> after it had been attacked from the air, and whether it indicates the nationality of the attacking plane; if so, what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

      <P>The ammunition fragments were found to be of British origin.  Representations were immediately made to the British Government, who instituted inquiries and confirmed that the <i>Kerlogue</i> had been attacked by British aircraft.  They informed us that the attacking planes did not identify the ship as Irish and that at the time of the attack the <i>Kerlogue</i> was sailing off her course, a fact which has been confirmed from the ship's log.  For that reason the British Government will not accept any responsibility for the attack, but they are prepared to make a payment <i>ex gratia</i> to the injured men.</P>

The standing instructions issued to such officers provide that where suitable persons who have already had experience on similar works are not available, unemployment assistance recipients, if otherwise suitable, should be employed; and that, generally, no persons who have other means of livelihood should be employed if other competent and suitable men can be found who are in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he will afford the small millers who have not the most modern drying machinery an allocation of coal sufficient to dry wheat coming into their mills in view of the <Col N="518" /> fact that turf as a drying agent in such equipment is liable to impart a disagreeable flavour like iodine to the flour subsequently abstracted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the replies given to recent similar questions, in which I have indicated that, in the present difficult circumstances in regard to coal supplies, I cannot see my way to make coal available to commission millers for the drying of grain.  The only exception is in the case of oats intended for conversion into oatmeal for human consumption, where it is satisfactorily established that the use of turf is impracticable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the difficulties under which the Minister is labouring, but does he not think that coal should, if necessary, be diverted from some other purpose, in order to ensure that substantial quantities of wheat will not be spoiled by an attempt to dry them with turf in drying equipment which is not adapted to turf, and has he received representations from certain small millers that the attempt to use turf in their drying plant has resulted in contamination of the wheat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course, amongst some of these millers a reluctance to use turf, but, in fact, in a very large number of mills of the type to which the Deputy refers in his question, turf has been used at all times.  An inspection has been made of a number of these mills in which turf is now being used, and in a large number of cases, there is no complaint by the millers as to the results secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of a miller finding that flour extracted from wheat dried in this apparatus with turf has an unacceptable flavour, will the Minister investigate that specific case and if the miller can establish that it is due to the impossibility of using turf satisfactorily in his dying kiln, will he consider giving him some alternative fuel?</P>

      <P>Employment in a situation vacant in consequence of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute is not suitable employment for the purposes of the Unemployment Assistance Acts, and a person who declines an offer of such employment may not be deemed to have failed to comply with the statutory conditions. The applications for unemployment assistance of Jeremiah Clifford, Ardmoniel, Killorglin, and 19 others were disallowed because they refused to accept employment which was duly determined in accordance with the Unemployment Assistance Acts to be suitable employment for them.  The situation in question was not vacant in consequence of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute.  All but one of the men concerned appealed to the Court of Referees against the decision given on their applications but their appeals were unsuccessful.  Unemployment assistance is not payable to these applicants for six weeks from the dates on which they refused the employment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware of the many anomalies affecting both officers and employees in the Local Government service regarding superannuation; that certain boroughs have statutory superannuation schemes, while certain other boroughs have no such superannuation schemes for employees; that many officials are nearing the age for retirement, and that there is considerable dissatisfaction in cases where no statutory superannuation scheme operates; and, if so, whether he has at present under consideration these anomalies and the desirability of a general code of superannuation applicable to permanent employees of local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Part IV. of the Local Government Act, 1925, provides a uniform superannuation code for officers of local bodies, other than officers of mental hospitals.  Officers who had superannuation rights at the passing of the 1925 Act were given the option of availing of the new provision or retaining their existing rights.  Established officers and servants of mental hospital authorities have a special superannuation code. Wholetime employees, as distinct from officers, of a local authority can be superannuated in the boroughs of Dublin, Dun Laoghaire, Limerick, and Waterford, but not elsewhere.  This is because in 1905 Dublin Corporation obtained power in its own local Act, while Waterford and Limerick Corporations had certain temporary provisions for that purpose inserted in their respective City Management Acts.  Dun Laoghaire Borough got the benefit of the Dublin superannuation provisions on the passing of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930.</P>
      <P>The preparation of a general superannuation measure was in progress at the outbreak of war in Europe.  Work thereon had to be suspended, however, owing to the volume of emergency work which fell upon my Department and the other Departments concerned, and which demanded prior attention. It is hoped to resume consideration of the measure at an early date.</P>

In 1940 the county council appointed two acting county surveyors.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been drawn to the scales of remuneration for nurses in the County Monaghan Sanatorium where the head nurse receives £85, rising to £100, and the permanent nurse £65, rising to £75, the temporary nurse £90, and a casual nurse two guineas per week, plus board and lodging in each case; and whether he will make a recommendation to the local authority to increase these rates of remuneration at least to the level of those obtaining in the county home.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been directed to the rates of remuneration of the nurses in the Monaghan County Hospital, and whether he will make representations to the local authority that they should be increased at least to the level of the rates obtaining in the county home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions 11 and 12 together.  The position of nurses at the County Hospital, Monaghan, and the sanatorium is at present under consideration.  So far as the county hospital is concerned, a proposal was received from the county manager on the 22nd ultimo, to grant an increase in the salary scale applicable to the nurses in the hospital, the effect of which would be to raise the maximum of the cash portion of the present scales by about £10 a year. The decision has not yet been notified to the county manager, but I may say <Col N="524" /> that it will be favourable.  In the case of the sanatorium nurses, no decision as to the general position of these nurses has yet been reached, but opportunity has been taken to remedy a couple of the more glaring anomalies regarding salary scales which existed in this institution.  For instance, one of the nurses on the staff had a salary of £60 per annum with board and residence, while other nurses were on a scale rising to £75 a year with board and residence.  I drew the attention of the county manager to the resulting anomalous position, and suggested that the nurse referred to should be placed on the same basis as the other permanent nurses.  This was done, and approved by me.  I also drew the attention of the manager to the inadequacy of the remuneration paid to the head nurse of the institution, which was £85 per annum with board and residence, and, as a result thereof, approval has recently been issued to the payment of remuneration to this nurse of £100 per annum with board and residence.  In the meantime, as I have mentioned, the general position is being reviewed in the Department.</P>
      <P>I wish, however, to point out that the salaries and emoluments of the nurses at the county hospital and sanatorium are not readily comparable with the remuneration paid to the nurses at the county home, as the latter do not receive rations as part of their emoluments, while the nurses at the other institutions do.  The Deputy is presumably aware that most of the nurses at these institutions are in receipt of emergency bonuses in addition.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the clause compelling tillage to be carried out the same year as reclamation is militating against the successful operation of the Land Reclamation Scheme in congested districts, and that this Order does not apply to land reclaimed under this scheme where the valuation is over £10; and if he will now agree to alter the rule which applies to small farms and holdings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to admit that the regulation requiring tillage to be carried out the same year <Col N="526" /> as reclamation is militating against the successful operation of land reclamation under the Farm Improvements Scheme in congested districts. The requirement as to tillage applies to holdings over £10 valuation where tillage of reclaimed land is considered necessary to render it productive or where the arable land in the holding is considered insufficient.  The present regulation whereby tillage of reclaimed land is required on holdings where the valuation on the agricultural land is £10 or under has worked satisfactorily and I am not prepared to alter it.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that lime and artificial manure applied to land on which drains have been just opened and closed are partly wasted and that it normally takes two or three years after the drain has been closed to drain the land; if he will reconsider the decision from the point of view that lime and manures are being wasted and only insist on tillage being done two years after the drainage has been completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course a lot depends on the type of land.  If it is land that has been water-logged for a good many years where drainage is necessary, tillage is not insisted on in the first year.  But, in most of these reclamation schemes, tillage is insisted upon the first year and works very satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the conditions and hours of work of sub-postmasters, and that some dissatisfaction has been expressed at the remuneration paid.  I am not convinced, however, that there are under present conditions exceptional grounds for such dissatisfaction.  While the position has, no doubt, been affected by circumstances arising out of the emergency, it has to be pointed out that an emergency bonus was granted to sub-postmasters as from 1st January last, in common with other State employees. I am afraid that I can hold out very little hope of any further improvement while existing financial conditions obtain.  Sub-postmasters are not supposed to depend, and do not in practice depend, on the Post Office for their sole income.  In most cases they engage in business of some kind.

In so far as it has been possible to plan out the administration of this Act in advance, I am satisfied that the most useful method will be to divide the country into three regions in order to split up the problem of administration.  I think, however, it is undesirable that we should make it a statutory provision that three should be three regions, no more and no less. It may prove when we get down to the actual problem of administration that two regions will be sufficient or that four regions will be necessary.

      <NameTxt>Mr. W.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, Sir, I take it, however, that your ruling does not preclude me from dealing with this question of the provision of claims for children's allowances in the case of persons not qualified on the appointed day nor in the period which is to be the first period payment for each region&mdash;I mean, not qualified in the sense in which we would assess qualification in the normal way.  What I have in mind is the case of people who may suffer through not having their qualifications acknowledged, because they may not be able to comply with statutory requirements.</P>
      <P>Let us take two cases.  Take the case of a person who makes an application for a children's allowance: he has a child aged 12, or approaching 13, and let us assume that that child will reach its 16th birthday one week after the period Order commences to operate.  Now, in the normal acceptation of the word &ldquo;qualification&rdquo;, that family was qualified for a children's allowance but, as a result of the way in which this Bill is drawn, the family concerned is not qualified to draw children's allowances for five months and three weeks.  Let me take another case.  Let us say that there are two children in a family, one aged 13, and the other just reaching its 16th birthday a fortnight before the payment period.  The child concerned was born, let us say, a day or two after the period which is covered by this section.  Now, I think that, according to the intentions of this Bill, that family should be able to qualify for a children's allowance in such a case, but the fact is that, statutorily, they are not entitled to claim on behalf of that child, just because the child concerned was born a day after the period that is covered under the statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that, in the absence of an amendment dealing with persons to whom we wish to be benevolent under <Col N="542" /> this Bill, an amendment suggesting the giving of statutory compensation to such persons is not permitted, but that it may be left to the benevolence of the Minister.  I submit, Sir, that it is not my business to interfere with the benevolence of the Minister, but I think that it is my business to try to see that there should be some statutory obligation to deal with such cases.  In the one case there are three children concerned, and in the other case there would appear to be a statutory bar against one of the children, and I only want to draw the attention of the House to this matter.  My idea in putting down the amendment was to make provision for a person making application in the case of, let us say, three children, one of whom might have been born within a day or two of the statutory period.  I concede at once that it is the Minister's business to put down an amendment to effect that purpose, but, nevertheless, I think it is my duty to point out that there is that infirmity in the Bill, because I think that the Minister himself will agree that it is an infirmity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's remarks, I am sure that it will be agreed that we should try to decide on a scheme that would be as least costly as possible.  I agree that it is theoretically desirable that the entitlement of a family to a children's allowance should be determined from day to day, and that if there is a change in a family which makes it necessary for an increased payment to be made, the payment should be made as soon as possible after that change takes place.  On the other hand, it would be necessary to ensure the cessation of such payments as soon as the qualification ends.  If, however, we were to try to do that in practice&mdash;a very desirable thing I admit&mdash;it would mean an enormously increased expenditure so far as this scheme is concerned, because, clearly, you would have to have machinery set up which would enable you to have an examination of each family, practically, from day to day, or to examine the details furnished by the head of the family, from day to day. In order to avoid the additional administrative costs that might be involved, <Col N="543" /> we devised this scheme of determining twice a year what was the amount of allowance to be paid, and paying it during the ensuing period after the qualifying date, irrespective of any change that might occur between that and the next qualifying date.</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, the general scheme is that there will be a qualifying date, and that subject to a division of the State into various regions or areas, a payment period with regard to each region.  The circumstances of each family will be determined and recorded as they exist on the qualifying day. Some three months later a payment, relating to that particular period, will begin, and during that period the payments to the family will be on the basis of what has been recorded.  Half-way during the payment period there will be another review of the circumstances of the families concerned, and it can then be determined what amount should be paid to each family during the ensuing payment period.  It is true that, under the system, some families will get more, during portion of the payment period, than that to which they would be entitled if we had an examination proceeding all the time; but, on the other hand, some families would get less than they were entitled to, and these things cannot be adjusted during the current payment period.  I think it works out fairly well, because it enables a checking-up on the returns made by the heads of families, and allows us to determine what payment should be made to the family concerned during the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit the desirability of the scheme suggested by Deputy Cosgrave, but I think it would be very costly; certainly, it would be very much more difficult, from the point of view of administration, than anything that is proposed in the Bill.  I think that the scheme proposed in the Bill is one of the best that could be proposed in the circumstances, and one which, certainly, admits of the least administrative difficulties or expenses.  I think that I mentioned, in the course <Col N="544" /> of the Second Reading debate on this Bill, that that was one of the things that influenced us in connection with this Bill.  It is inevitable, of course, that any scheme of the kind will offer a number of administrative difficulties and problems, and our aim is to see that the cost of the administration of the Bill will be only a small and insignificant portion of the whole scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one or two questions in connection with this particular matter. First of all, I quite agree with the Minister when he states that he wants to have the least possible trouble or cost in connection with the administration of the Bill, and I hope that, by that, he means the least trouble to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question I want to put to the Minister is this: Let us take the case of a family who have established their right to a children's allowance and who, through one cause or another, find themselves unable to draw the allowance for quite a considerable period.  At what period does the Minister propose to rule those payments as having expired?  I do not want to tie the Minister to any hard and fast decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the Bill. Section 18 provides for that.  The allowance payable does not become invalid until three months have passed. A person who gets a book which entitles him to a certain amount can, if he so desires, accumulate these cheques and not draw upon them for a period of three months.  After three months they become invalid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is good and sufficient reason for being unable to cash these cheques for a longer period would there be any appeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We fixed the statutory limit of three months.  I think that is long enough to provide for any possible <Col N="545" /> set of circumstances we might contemplate, except in the case of persons whose means are such that children's allowances mean nothing to them and they forget all about the matter.  Where the allowance means some appreciable difference in the family income three months will be sufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the next question would also arise on Section 18.  It concerns income-tax.  Would a person who pays income-tax have to draw the 52 weeks' allowance, amounting to £6 10s., to get an abatement in income-tax?  Is there any way by which such a person could hand in the cheques without drawing any of them, and have his assessment dealt with accordingly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be prepared to answer that question.  It does not arise on this Bill.  I mentioned that it was the intention to offset the benefit of children's allowance in respect of income-tax by an amendment of the income-tax code.  That is not provided for in this Bill.  Proposals for amending the income-tax code will be brought forward subsequently by the Minister for Finance, when questions relating to matters of this kind would arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of it relates to income-tax payers who get an allowance under this Bill, and then there is the allowance they are to receive under the Finance Bill.  Supposing an income-tax payer has to collect 52 allowances in return for a decreased income-tax allowance, will the Minister for Finance then say: &ldquo;Oh, that should have been raised on the Children's Allowances Bill&rdquo;?  Is there any provision so that a person will not have to go 52 times yearly to the post office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise now.  It need not necessarily happen. It might be possible to provide, where desirable, that the allowance could be paid in individual cases into a banking <Col N="546" /> account.  So far as the Bill goes&mdash;even if everybody were to be paid by means of vouchers&mdash;they would not necessarily have to go to the post office more than four times in the year, because of the three months' provision.  They could accumulate the vouchers for three months and then cash them. There can be no question of going 52 times to the post office.  There will be two payment periods and variations in the amount of the family allowance in particular cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>But these vouchers are out of date in three months.  I ask the Minister to ensure that there will be the least possible trouble involved for all concerned, including the post office officials, whose time is worth money to the country.  If the Minister will consider how what I suggest could be done so that there would be the utmost expedition, I am satisfied.</P>

This Bill does not even contain that much, with particular reference to Section 2.  Many things may be done by Order yet, and in his introductory speech, the Minister told us what he proposes to do under various headings.  It seems to me that it would have been much better for this House if the actual provisions which it was proposed to achieve were before us for discussion.  We are now merely discussing whether we will give this power.  We do not know what the Minister is going to do, particularly in this case, where apparently he has a scheme worked out and his mind made up as to what he will do.  I feel that that should be embodied in legislation like this, giving power to do so much by Order, which has become so prevalent not only in this country but elsewhere.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to explain that.  We are working the system on the basis of six-monthly periods.  That is what the Bill proposes because it simplifies the problem of checking family circumstances.  I admitted in introducing the Bill that there will be cases where there will be an addition to the number of qualified children in a family during the period from the qualifying date immediately preceding a child's birth to the next qualifying date and that in respect of such addition no children's allowance will be paid during that period.  There will, however, be other cases where the reverse will happen.  Deputy Cosgrave mentioned the case of a family with three children, one 13 years of age, one 14 years of age, and one just under 16.  The child under 16 will reach the age of 16 at some period between the two qualifying dates, but the family will continue to receive the family allowance during the ensuing payment period.  Whether we make the period weekly periods, monthly periods or six-monthly periods, there must be some period during which the allowances will be paid on a particular basis irrespective of changes in the family. We could not possible devise a system whereby changes in family circumstances would be immediately and automatically reflected in the payments made to the family.  These changes will take other forms also&mdash;children going to live with relatives, children going to certain schools, and other changes of that kind.  I could give a number of changes that may affect the circumstances of a family on one day as against another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal here put forward although open to certain criticism, can nevertheless be defended on the ground <Col N="549" /> that the public will easily understand it and that it simplifies the problem of administration.  We give to the head of the family a book of 26 vouchers, each voucher representing the payment to which the family will be entitled during each week of the payment period. Half-way through the book of vouchers there will be an application form pinned into the book, similar to the device used by banks in cheque books to enable the bank's customers to have the cheque book renewed.  As the family draws off the vouchers each week and cashes them in the post office, they will in due time come to the application form in the middle of the book which they will then fill in and lodge in the appropriate manner, representing an application relating to the qualifying date for the next payment period.  That is a system of administration that is simple and one that will be easily understood by the public whereas if we had a complicated system by which the payments would be frequently varied, as changes arose in family circumstances, not merely would it give rise to many administrative complications but also to misunderstanding of their obligations amongst members of the public.  The justification for this system is that it not merely facilitates the method of administration but that it will be easily understood by the average person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is right in his attitude on this point. Superficially it may mean that some injustice will accrue but, taking the whole picture, it will mean that while some people may have to wait a little longer, others will get something in the nature of a gratuity by reason of their being permitted to draw a child's allowance during a period within which they are not, strictly speaking, entitled to it.  Taking the case mentioned by Deputy Hogan, where a child comes into the world two days after a qualifying date, I think the parents in that case will have to remain nine months out of a children's allowance because there will be a three months' wait after the next qualifying date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be six months until the next qualifying date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be nine months in all.  We can at this stage say whether we are in favour of setting up immensely elaborate machinery which will enable the payment in respect of that child to be made at an earlier period, but whatever the payment period is to be, there is going to be some measure of hardship in respect of some children.  It has to be borne in mind, however, that the child who fails to get its allowance the morning after it is born, will, in all human probability, at the other end of its life bring in an unforeseen boon to the family by drawing an allowance for three, four or five months after it has passed the maximum age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We must take the long view.  Please God, that child will live not for 15 years but for five times 15 years.  I wonder would it be worth considering shortening the period to three months?  Somebody may raise the objection that we ought to make the payment in respect of the child who comes into the world a couple of days after the qualifying date retrospective, and so give the parents nine months' back money, but you cannot logically argue in favour of that course unless you argue on the other hand that poor families should also be asked to refund allowances which they receive during a period subsequent to the date on which a child reaches 16 years.  I think Deputies would agree that it is quite impracticable to go to people who have a slender income to ask them to refund four or five months' family allowances in respect of a child who had passed the age of 16 after the qualifying date.  I am in favour of the Minister's plan.  It is a rough-and-ready plan, but it has got this merit&mdash; that it is the first evidence I have seen of a Minister who is prepared to shake off red-tape and do things in a business-like way.  If it should prove in the course of time that this system has some glaring anachronisms the Minister can come to the Dáil with an amending Bill.  I should like to know from the Minister whether it would be an undue burden on the administrative costs to reduce the period from six months to three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="551" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A three months' period would actually double the administrative problem.  Let me give the House the statistics.  We assume that there will be 150,000 applications, roughly 50,000 in each of the regions.  That means that, within a period of six months, each of these 150,000 cases must be reviewed and there must be issued to each of them a book of vouchers representing the exact amount of the family allowance to which each family is entitled&mdash;2/6, 5/- or 7/6 as the case may be.  If you had a three months' period, you would have exactly double the work.  Instead of dealing with 150,000 cases within six months you would have to deal with 300,000 cases every six months.  I do not see that you could get very far away from the position that is contemplated by the Bill, in any event. It would not be possible to arrive at what would be regarded as the ideal solution referred to by the Deputy, that is to change the amount of the family allowance immediately following a change in family circumstances. There must be an examination of the change and an investigation of the <i>bona fides</i> of the claim, in so far as we want to provide vouchers in advance.  There must be some machinery for the cancellation of vouchers which are no longer valid, which may have to be substituted by others representing the payment to which the family are entitled.  This administrative method becomes impracticable if you depart from the conception on which it is based, namely, that once every six months we review the circumstances of each family and we pay family allowances on the basis of that determination for a further period of six months.  If you depart from that and want to have more frequent reviews at different periods for every family&mdash;because that is the basis of Deputy Hogan's suggestion&mdash;not merely does the question of the qualifying date and the determination of the basis on which payment is to be made during the subsequent six months become impracticable but the whole system of payments which we contemplate is thrown overboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> Deputy Benson said that a great part of what this Bill will achieve is not set out in the Bill, that the Bill merely empowers the making of regulations to do these things.  That is true. I do not think it is desirable that it should be otherwise.  Naturally, the Government having decided on a children's allowances scheme and upon the general principles of that scheme, asked itself: &ldquo;Can this be done? What administrative problems will arise in the doing of it and can those problems be successfully overcome?&rdquo; Before the Bill was framed, all the problems of administration which we foresaw were tabulated and the solution of them put down.  The Bill was framed in relation to that contemplated scheme of administration.  It may be that when we come to put those regulations actually into force some modification of them will be necessary.  If we set out here not merely the general principles of the scheme but the regulations under which the scheme would be worked, then not merely should we have to try to foresee every possible contingency and guard against it by regulation, but if we found that some of those regulations were unworkable &mdash;perhaps only in respect of minor details&mdash;it would be necessary to frame amending legislation to get out of the difficulty.  It is better, therefore, to do as is done in all Bills of this kind&mdash; enact the general principles on which the scheme is to be based and empower the executive Minister concerned to apply those principles to particular cases by means of regulations.  These regulations may have to be changed again and again before we get over all the difficulties that will emerge.  It is probably true to say that there was a new Unemployment Insurance Act every year from 1922, when the Dáil was set up, until 1929 before the unemployment insurance code got established and all the problems that had arisen in its administration were eliminated.  To try to avoid similar difficulties arising in connection with this Bill, we propose to proceed by this method.</P>
    <P>I have tried to convey to the Dáil as clearly as possible the scheme of <Col N="553" /> administration on which the Bill is based.  It is not intended to depart from the general principles of that scheme but, in the actual application of the principles to the circumstances which will arise when we get applications and when we shall have to consider the problems associated with these applications, modifications may be required from time to time.  I do not think that we should tie ourselves up so rigidly that we could not make those modifications without an amending Bill.  A period of six months is as reasonable as it is possible to get without contemplating an administrative scheme completely out of proportion to the Bill.  What is contemplated is that the cost of administration should be below 10 per cent. of the total cost of the scheme.  We can do that on the basis of the Bill as framed but if we decide to elaborate on the provisions here, to provide for more frequent reviews of the circumstances of families and to abandon this idea of having a qualifying date for all families and paying on the basis of the circumstances on that date for the ensuring period, the cost of administration is bound to go up and many become a far more significant part of the total cost than is contemplated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it is a delusion on the part of the Minister to imagine that by reducing the period from six to three months the cost would be doubled.  If the Minister is right in that, I agree that he should stick to the six months.  But if, in consultation with the experts, he is advised that the cost of administration would not be substantially increased, that all the machinery would be there to do the job, that it would not involve the creation of additional machinery, but merely require that the machinery work somewhat faster than originally intended&mdash;if, after consultation with these experts, he finds he can keep the administrative cost within 10 per cent. and reduce the period to three months, will he consider introducing an amendment on Report Stage providing for the three months?</P>

      <P>Not necessarily. I should like to regain custody of this child which Deputy Hogan has seized from me.  The case I put up was that a person having a sufficient number of children to qualify should be enabled to make his application and get payment without the contemplated delay. We are told that there are administrative difficulties.  What are they? Surely every family is not going to be called upon on a particular day by the administrative staff to see whether or not they are qualified, or what their qualifications are.  There must be varying periods.  Granted that there are, what is the objection to the man who is going to call on Mrs. O'Sullivan calling instead on Mrs. Murphy?  If he calls on Mrs. Murphy on a particular date, it will not be necessary to call on her again within a week's time. I do not see the administrative difficulties at all, and I believe they are non-existent.  As the Bill is planned, difficulties can be put in the way of people who are qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case I put to the Minister was that of a child born the day after the qualifying date and before the payment period.  There is no machinery in this section, nor under the Bill, whereby the parents of that child can get the allowance before six months. Although perfectly qualified, they will get nothing for six months.  Take a case in which one of three children reaches the age of 16 a week before the end of the period, and again before the qualifying date.  The parents of those children will get no allowance at all.  It is nonsense to say that this provision will result in fairness all round, that the family deprived of children's allowance will have the satisfaction of knowing that the family next door is receiving it, although not so well entitled to it.  From my experience of the people, they regard such a happening in the administration of an Act as a gross injustice.  If the Minister has 1,000 officials, there is no <Col N="555" /> earthly reason why the services of 50 of them should not be devoted to the examination of applications of persons not qualified on the qualifying date but becoming qualified immediately afterwards.</P>

      <P>It would.  One must be prepared to deal with 150,000 cases. It must not be assumed that only in some cases would there be a change. There may be a change in every single case and the probability is that, in the majority of cases, there will be a change.  This change will not take the form of a new child in the family.  A child may die or pass over the age of 16, or may go to live with relatives. A number of circumstances may arise involving a change in the entitlement of the family to an allowance, which could not be admitted without examination and investigation.</P>

      <P>Let us see the common factors that would bring about a change in conditions&mdash;a birth and a death.  Let us take the average county and leave the city out of it for a moment.  The average number of deaths and births are nearly equal in the ordinary county.  You have about 1,000 births and 1,000 deaths per annum.  We will say 15 or 20 per cent. of the deaths are children, and that would be only about 200 cases of children's deaths to investigate in a county.  There are 30 to 40 births in a parish or dispensary district per annum.  We come back to a point which was raised before, that is, the Department which should handle this Bill.  There is machinery at the moment under the Department of Local Government to ensure that, within 48 hours of every birth, the birth is notified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed it is not, nor anything like it.  We cannot get some registrars to notify for a month.  We know of cases of that kind in fixing the ration of commodities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is assuming that I am talking of the Registrar-General's Department.  I am not, I am talking of the Public Health Department.  Within 48 hours they have to be notified or there is a fine. The Registrar-General's Department is quite a different machine and very often there are very delayed registrations. Both those Departments are under the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who would tell the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there is no great administrative difficulty or expense in getting prompt notification of a birth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misses the point altogether.  That is merely getting notification of the birth.  Having got that, we would have then to alter the whole arrangement that would be already in force for the payment of the allowance to that family.  Will the <Col N="557" /> Deputy try to realise what follows on the birth, if we were to have this automatic change in the allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  Let us take the position at the end of the third month, the 13th week.  A child is born then.  It would be a case of issuing 13 new postal orders for that particular case.  A girl typist could do it, provided there were reserve books in the Department.  The deaths are a very, very small thing&mdash;the deaths of children under 16 are only a fraction of the births.  They are not worth discussing, as they are so few in number.  While not tying myself to exact figures, I would say the average number of births in a dispensary district outside the City of Dublin would be between 30 and 40 per annum.  That is not a very big problem.  The Minister may say it would cost a large amount, but he has not demonstrated that.  The issuing of postal orders or cheques to an extra 30 children&mdash;or rather, half that amount as they are being paid every six months, making 15 or 20 children&mdash;in each parish could not cost so much.  It is merely a case of getting one person who could issue the reserve postal orders.</P>

      <P>I do not think we could quarrel with the machinery the Minister has envisaged under this section.  I would be the last to agree with the Minister if I could help it, but I realise there must be some machinery.  From the point of view of claimants under this Bill, and from the point of view of persons who will have to advise them in making claims, it would be better to have the longer period of six months; as the less an ordinary person is troubled by investigation officers and the filling of forms, the better for themselves.  That is why I would be against the reduction of the period to three months.  Even without any change, as I gathered from the Minister, it still would be necessary for the family to fill in the application form in the book.  We here may find it no trouble to fill in applications, but thousands of people find it a severe mental and physical problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel we could agree with Deputy Cosgrave on the point he has raised regarding a child born a week after the qualifying date.  As the Bill now stands, that child will be deprived of benefit for a period of nine months. It is no use saying, as we do here, that the good is bound up with the bad; you cannot get the ordinary man or woman to understand that if they are denied something the balance goes to someone else who gets something to which he is not entitled.  We all agree that, taking the Bill as a whole, we would be more generous if we could, but we are tied down by certain limitations made by the Government.  Here is a small item in which there could be adjustment and which would not involve great expense.  It involves retrospective payment in the case of a child born a week after the qualifying date.  That could be investigated in the ordinary way six months later on the qualifying date, and they would become entitled to it three months later still, on the date payment commences. <Col N="559" /> When the investigation is made the officer must, of necessity, go back to the date of the birth of the child, and there is no special problem involved in allowing the child to become qualified from the date of birth and to issue the necessary payment orders for the retrospective period.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, from his own point of view and from that of the Government, a small thing like this might make for more value in such a measure as this than the larger questions of principle which we raise here.  The ordinary family, where an additional child is born after the qualifying date and which receives no payment in respect of that child, sees alongside another family where a child has qualified and has died and where the family continues to receive the payment for six months.  They do not understand that.  The Minister can take the necessary power.  This point can be met without any great administrative changes.  It is merely a question of giving retrospective effect, following investigations.  I think the Minister should try to meet this point.  I do not think it is impracticable, because the investigation must be made back to the birth of the child.  It is really only a matter of clerical work, giving effect to what has been checked and found correct.</P>

      <P>I think the births are the most important thing. I speak from the point of view of the way in which this measure will best be appreciated.  The child is born and the parents must wait nine months before any benefit is derived. Alongside that, another child has died and is buried.  The position outlined in the Bill is something the ordinary person cannot understand.  We can understand it here.  What I suggest will mean a very small change in methods of administration.</P>

      <P>Take a family with three children, one of whom qualifies.  The 3rd December is the qualifying date.  Let us say that on the 10th December another child is born.  There will be an application made for that child in due course because of the change in the family circumstances. The next qualifying date is in June.  Your officers make an investigation of that claim and they must of necessity investigate back to the date of birth of the child.  You must have the birth certificate.  You pass that child as being qualified. The proposal is to pass it for a period three months ahead.  I suggest it is a simple clerical matter to pass it in respect of the date of birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a simple way out of this difficulty.  There must be an appointed day.  Here is an opportunity to start the scheme and overcome the difficulties that you seem to be confused about.  The Act comes into force, and let us take as an illustration the family with five or six children.  A certain period must elapse in which you qualify the children who will benefit under the scheme of allowances.  We all know how officials deal with these things. There are some of us who can appreciate the difficulties involved.  Documents are passed from one official to another.  Then we must try to realise the difficulties of the persons who make claims.  I believe that 34 per cent. of the classes in Dublin who will be most affected by this legislation are illiterate.  Those of us who have been accustomed to fill in forms time and again for those people know what difficulties will have to be faced.  I might say they are almost insurmountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> A man has, say, two children and then he is lucky enough to have a third child born.  The first child and the second child are registered.  Why not carry that registration as a certificate of birth?  They have to be registered. I admit that some people are rather dilatory and may not register a child at once, but the child is eventually registered.  I suggest that you give the child the allowance on the certificate of birth, and pay from the week it is born, and then you will have very little difficulty.  As a parent you claim your money.  The only right you have to get the money is to bring the certificates of the other children with you.  If you cannot produce the certificates, your claim is objected to, and then you have to see the qualifying officer and have the claim investigated.  Let us suppose the child dies.  At the end of six months you have the death certificate. It only requires consideration to see that that obviates the postponement of payment for nine months and it does away with the overpayment after death.  The death certificate disqualifies them.</P>
    <P>The parents have to prove their right, and I see no difficulty about it.  It does not require elaborate machinery.  The birth registration clerk can qualify the child.  The responsibility then is on the parents and the child to prove the qualification.  We all know how many grave abuses there were with the Unemployment Act.  You found out those abuses only when they were brought to your notice.  There were people, who were working, getting unemployment money for months. Every Deputy here knows that.  In this case the only qualification needed is to carry with you your right as a newly-born citizen to get the money. There is no question of paying back money that you have drawn illegally, and there is no question of waiting for nine months.  I submit you ought to consider the matter from that angle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>With other Deputies I appeal to the Minister to take back this section and consider the points made by Deputies in nearly all parts of the House.  It will be a very grave injustice, and it certainly will be a very great disappointment to the <Col N="562" /> parents of a child that arrives a day or two after the appointed day for payment, because they will have to wait three, six or nine months before they receive money for the child.  I and other Deputies think, so far as the Minister is concerned, that there is a will in this matter, and where there is a will, there is a way.  All that will be needed is a little extra staff to inspect and report.</P>
      <P>There is no reason why the child, from the date of its birth, should not get the allowance of 2/6.  If payment cannot be made immediately, the parent should get the money retrospectively. It is really only a matter of routine office work.  I appeal to the Minister to make sure that disappointment will not be caused to persons whose third child arrives after the day appointed.  I was rather interested to hear one Deputy saying that a child could get additional payment by way of voucher even at 16.  I do not think that is possible.  When the child of to-day is 16, most of us will not be here.  Most of the younger members may recollect the Minister saying so.  In view of all these circumstances, I think the Minister should postpone to a later stage the consideration of this section.  I hope that he will be able to give it more sympathetic consideration.  He has been congratulated from all sides of the House on bringing forward this Bill.  It is a step in the right direction and from it we expect greater things.</P>

      <P>Deputies should appreciate that we must not merely try to get a children's allowances scheme that will look well on paper but one that will work.  That is the issue that is raised here.  It is, what type of scheme will work easily, having regard to all the difficulties that are there; the difficulties of administration on the one hand, and the difficulty of getting members of the public easily to understand what is required of them on the other.  If we abandon the scheme of administration contemplated in the Bill and adopt that which Deputies are suggesting, one which involves an alteration in the amount of the allowance paid to a family simultaneously with changes in the <Col N="563" /> family conditions, you are going to complicate the system of administration tremendously.  My belief is that machinery to carry through that type of organisation could not be set up. It would break down so frequently that it would be necessary to go back to some such device as that provided for in the Bill.  It may be that there are theoretical objections to this arrangement, but the practical consideration is that it will work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the fact that people should easily understand what is required of them.  As Deputy Larkin has said, the filling in of a form or the discharge of any duty of that kind, is a serious matter for a lot of people.  They do not always understand precisely what is required of them or how they should go about it. They go and seek the advice of a trade union official, the parish priest, the dispensary doctor, or some person of that kind.  Now, the less frequently they have to do that and the simpler the form they have to handle, the better it will be.  If we were to adopt the device of trying to modify the amount of the family allowance, according to changes in the condition of a family, then the whole scheme of administration that we have in mind would become almost impracticable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We contemplate an investigation of the family circumstances at a particular date, a report of that investigation coming into the officer administering the scheme, and on that there will be a determination of the amount of the payment to be made to each such family during the next payment period.  That amount will be paid by means of numbered cheques, each bearing on the face of it the amount of the weekly payment due to that family.  If we were to have this daily review of family conditions then we could not work upon the system in the Bill.  We would have to be continuously taking into account either increasing the amount provided for the family or, if we go the whole hog, possibly decreasing the amount as well.  I think that if Deputies <Col N="564" /> were faced with the task of administering this children's allowances scheme they would have devised a system similar to that in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a children's allowances Bill.  It is a family allowances Bill based on the number of children in the family.  Suppose you have three children who qualify&mdash;are you going to give them three half-crowns multipled by a certain number of days?  I think that would be a stupid thing to do.  If a parent has three children and one qualifies, the parent has the book and gets the coupons on that.  When a child dies the book has to be produced to the registrar of deaths who stamps it.</P>

What difficulty can there be in a parent getting a certificate to say that the child is in existance?  What is wrong, in regard to the qualifying date, in giving a book of coupons that will enable the parent or some person in <i>loco parentis</i> to get the money from the period covered from the date of the birth?  So far as I see, all the difficulties that the Minister has pointed out about the filling in of forms are simply specious pleading, and there is no substance in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to a different thing&mdash;to deaths.  In the case of births, if a birth means 2/6 a week to a family, will that not be an inducement to the head of the family to register the birth and have prompt notification given?  People are not going to dawdle for weeks and months when it means 2/6 a week.  If the Bill provided that when a third child was born notification of the birth was given as soon as possible so that payment would be made, I do not think there would be the same Departmental delay. I agree that, if payment is to be made by cheque or postal order to the head of the family, the changes that would have to be made would be rather unwieldy <Col N="566" /> in order to take in an extra child during the period.  Take, however, the system that obtains in the case of old age pensions.  If there are three old age pensioners in a house, it is not one draft that goes out weekly, so that in the event of the death of one of them the whole draft has not to be changed.  What happens is that a postal order goes out to each of those old age pensioners, and if one of them dies his or her book ceases to be operative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us apply that to the family.  Let us say that two children of John Jones&mdash;Mary and Edward &mdash;are getting allowances.  If one voucher was sent in respect of Mary and another in respect of Edward, and a third child is born, there need not be any change in the vouchers.  They go out as before, but an extra voucher, in respect of Willie, will go our&mdash;an extra set of postal orders for the balance of the period.  However, I do not want to delay unduly the Minister, the Bill, or the Dáil.  I am as convinced that it is not so very unworkable or represents such a tremendous volume of new work as the Minister is convinced is the case, and I ask him between now and Report Stage to look into it in conjunction with the Department of Local Government.  He may find that obstacles which appear at the moment to be very formidable are not so formidable.</P>

      <P>I do not want to pretend that I have seen all the administrative problems arising out of this Bill to the end.  That is not so, but I think we have devised a system of administration which will work, but no one can be certain until it has been brought into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the difficulties envisaged by the Minister are more imaginary than real, and that in his desire to get a workable scheme of administration he has devised a scheme which is unduly severe and unfairly rigid in respect of claims <Col N="567" /> under the Bill.  Deputy Larkin has with considerable force pleaded the case of the family in which there are two children, and in which a third child is born a few days after the qualifying date.  He sought to induce the Minister to permit the parent in that case to make a claim in respect of the date on which the child was born, and to have that claim dealt with without waiting for the subsequent half-yearly inquiry and payment, after the half-yearly inquiry, of the allowance.</P>
      <P>That may be the case of a family in very poor circumstances.  There are two children and the family is getting no allowance&mdash;there may, in fact, be four children, two over and two under 16 years of age&mdash;but the birth of a fifth child qualifies one of the family for payment of an allowance.  It seems unreasonable that in such a case the family should have to wait for eight months before one of the children, there being already four children, qualifies for the allowance.  Whatever difficulty the Minister may envisage in the administration of the scheme, I do not think any real difficulty will arise in a case of that kind.  The Minister says it is better to keep as many forms as possible away from these people, but you do not ease their position by postponing the filling up of a form for six months.  If they have to fill up a form six months afterwards, they might as well fill it up immediately.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy not agree that the public will easily understand, after a couple of years, that the qualifying date for their area is 1st January or 1st July?  That will be known to every household in the area. They will all know that on that date they qualify for payment of children's allowances in accordance with their family circumstances.  That date will become as well known to everybody as a bank holiday and the whole problem of administration will be much simpler than it would be if there were a separate date for every family, as the Deputy suggests.</P>

      <P>The dog in the Mother Hubbard story knew that he would not get a bone because he knew that <Col N="568" /> Mother Hubbard would not give it to him.  That is what is going to happen here&mdash;they know they will not get an allowance simply because the Legislature will not give it to them.  They never will be able to understand why they should not get it.  Here is the case of a family with two children.  A third is born, and one member of the family qualifies for payment of an allowance, but probably will not get it for eight or nine months.  I suggest that it is not good administration and not calculated to make for contentment in relation to the administration of legislation of this kind, if a person in these circumstances has to wait six or eight months, while, as Deputy Larkin has pointed out, the family may be living beside people who are receiving the allowance in respect of a child who is either dead or has passed beyond the age of 16 years.</P>
      <P>The number of inquiries necessary in respect of newly-born children could not be very large.  The Minister may say that there are 40,000 births in the year.  It will not be necessary to make an inquiry in respect of these 40,000 births, because some of them may be the births of first children and some may be the births of second children. Some might even be the births of third children and you might have to make an inquiry in such a case, but, even then, the inquiry might not be necessary in respect of a third child if the other children happen to be higher up on the age ladder.  For the limited number of inquiries which the Minister will have to make, he ought to agree to meet the case as from birth in respect of the payment of an allowance for children in the circumstances we have been discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out that if there are two children in a family receiving allowances, and a third is born, qualifying the family for payment of a third allowance, it is quite easy to issue a supplementary voucher to enable the family to get that third allowance.  It will be understood that the family will not get it for a week, two weeks or three weeks after the date on which the child was born, but it is some consolation to a family, and I think it would help to make the Bill more <Col N="569" /> acceptable, if the family knew they would not have to wait for six or eight months before getting the allowance in respect of that child.  It would be much better if the family were given payment from the date on which the child is born, if the child happens to be born between one qualifying date and another.  The Minister might review the matter between now and Report Stage&mdash;he has nearly a fortnight in which to do so&mdash;and perhaps devise machinery to meet a case of that kind.</P>

      <P>I will not say that there need necessarily be three months between the first qualifying date and the first payment period.  I could not attempt to forecast what problems will arise in that respect, but, once payment starts, in the case of each family, there will be half way in the payment period, a new qualifying date. It will not interfere with the actual payment proceeding at the time, but will merely modify or increase the payment in the next period.  How long a period there should be between the first qualifying date and the first payment period, I could not forecast. Deputy Larkin talked about bringing the Bill into operation on 1st April. What I contemplated was having 1st April as the first qualifying date, leading to a first payment period some time later.</P>

      <P>I should like to know what his intention is with regard to the length of the period, because it brings in a rather obnoxious feature in relation to dealing with Bills which we pass through this House.  If we want to find out what exactly is meant by the first payment period, we go back to the definition section.  On going back, we find that the first payment period is a period which is not fixed by the House, but which is to be fixed by the Minister at some future date. I think the House should have some explanation of what exactly the Minister has in mind with regard to the first payment period.  I take it that it will be during the Minister's period of office that this scheme will come into operation, and, as the Minister has now admitted, the first payment period is likely to be longer than 26 weeks.  I do not quite see the necessity for giving the Minister these powers.  He might make the period three years, if he wishes to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He could not do that. The necessity for having the first payment period more or less than 26 weeks arises out of the administrative device of dividing the country into three regions.  If we have a common payment period of 26 weeks, either the scheme must come into operation at a different date in each region, or we must have one period for the whole country.  In order to get the scheme into operation on the same date everywhere, and, at the same time, effect the staggering of the administrative work which the division into regions contemplates, it is clear that the first payment period must vary from one region to another, in order to get this staggering effect which we desire to have from the point of view of administrative convenience.  Therefore, we will assume that in the first region the payment period will be 26 weeks, in the <Col N="571" /> next region, the payment period 30 weeks, and in the next a payment period of 36 weeks.  That produces this effect: that the second and the subsequent payment periods in each of the regions will start on a different date; the qualifying date in each of these periods will be a different date for each region.  We get, therefore, the effect desired, which is the commencing of the operation of the scheme on the same date in all regions, while the administrative problems associated with the review of claims and the commencement of payment on the basis of such reviews arise on a different date in each of the regions.</P>

That will take at least three <Col N="573" /> months in the initial period.  At a subsequent stage it may be possible to speed up the arrangement.

But, if the child dies, the payment continues for the remainder of the six months.  That is what they call equalisation.  The Bill is like the Intermittent Workers' Bill.

      <P>As I say, especially if the family remains at three children, the child coming in and entitling the family to get the allowance may get the apprentice's end of the payment, so to speak, and owing to its being born a few days too late, may make the family late in qualifying, and on the other hand, the eldest child who will be passing out when it reaches 16 years of age, may pass out six months too early.  The net effect may be that that particular family may lose anything between one year's and one and a half year's payment, through <Col N="576" /> being unlucky in regard to the date of birth of two children.  Of course, it may be the reverse.  It seems to be a hit or miss arrangement.</P>

      <P>The Minister in reply to my previous remarks said that he felt it was necessary to have these powers to make Orders under this Bill, but surely, if the House accepts that argument and it is carried to <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, the position will arise that a Minister will come into this House and present a one-clause Bill stating &ldquo;This Bill empowers the Minister to make children's allowances&rdquo; and leave it at that.  That stage has not yet come, and I hope it never will, but it is an obvious result from this.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other discussion which has taken place in regard to this section, Deputy Dillon rather congratulated the Minister on producing a simple scheme, with his qualifying dates, and so forth.  Surely a qualifying date has been in existence for many years in the income-tax code, and, in fact, under the income-tax code if a child happens to be born one day too late it is very nearly two years before you get any benefit from it.  I think the Minister's arrangement here is the best that can be produced.  It may strike certain people unfairly.  It may strike them unfairly both ways. They may get more or less than they would get if the scheme came into operation on a change in the family circumstances but, taking the average, it will strike everybody pretty fairly. A family may get something here and lose something there.  I do not see how it can be improved in that connection without making administration very complicated.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (i) to delete from the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; in line 36 to the word &ldquo;paid&rdquo; in line 38 and substitute the following words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where such person has complied with the prescribed conditions as to identification there shall, during the <Col N="577" /> said payment period, be paid to the mother or other female relative or guardian functioning in the household as a house-keeper, or subject to the discretion of the investigation officer, to the person who has so applied&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to ensure the effective working of the Bill as envisaged in the Title.  The Bill is to make children's allowances available. While acknowledging the principle that the father is head of the household, I believe that the benefit to be derived from the allowances is intended for the children and, that being so, the person best qualified, the person in closest touch with the actual needs of the children, is either the mother or the female guardian operating in the mother's place if the mother for some reason, either death or inability, is prevented from acting.  The principal purpose of the Bill is to benefit the children.  The father has an overriding responsibility to provide for the family.  In this case, where an allowance is given which, as far as the family is concerned, is a new allowance, they may not realise that in certain ways, through taxation or increases in the price of certain commodities which the Minister envisaged on the Second Reading, they are paying for it otherwise.  So far as they are concerned, it is a benefit which they have not had before and it is quite likely that they will dissipate it.  Undoubtedly they appreciate the fact that it is given to them to be used for the best interests of their family, but generally in cases like this there is a danger that it may be spent either on gambling or on drink.  The reason I put down this amendment is to obviate that danger.  I think the Minister and the House would do well to consider it.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  I think from every point of view it is desirable, first of all, that the father should be recognised as the head of the family.  As such, he will be responsible for making the claim for this allowance and ensuring that it is paid and that the form of application is properly filled <Col N="578" /> in, and other matters of that nature. As it is quite a common thing for the father to hand over his wages or portion of his income to his wife for the upkeep of the household, it is right and proper that this allowance should be payable directly to the mother rather than that it should be cashed by the father and utilised as he thinks best.  I do not think there can be any objection to the principle involved in this amendment.  It is certainly a rerecognition of the importance of the mother as the person who is deemed best qualified to understand the needs of the children and to decide how to utilise this money to the best advantage. I think the Minister should accept this amendment.  It will not, I think, conflict with any principle in law which recognises, of course, the father as head of the family, and I think it will ensure that the money will be utilised to better advantage, perhaps, than if the section were to remain as at present drafted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in my view, this amendment implies that fathers of families in this State, who have been providing for their families, are not to be trusted with the expenditure of the sum provided by the State for children's allowances, but it must be remembered that the purpose of this Bill is to augment the family income as a whole, and I do not see why we should try to interfere with the father, as the head of the family, in connection with the use of this money.  In that connection, I should like to point out that under Section 20 of the Bill the father, or head of the household, may make whatever arrangements he may desire <Col N="579" /> as to whom the allowance should be given&mdash;whether the mother of the family, the housekeeper, or whoever else might be concerned.  I think that that is a matter that should be left for arrangement in the family itself and that, in this Bill, we should not try to interfere with the internal arrangements of the family.  I hold that, in questions concerning the family, we should keep Government or State interference down to the minimum. That is why I urge that this amendment should not be adopted.  After all, apart from whatever allowance for children may be provided under this Bill, the father, generally, is the breadwinner for the family, and I think that the less interference there is with him, the better.  If the head of the household&mdash;the father&mdash;wishes to arrange that these payments should go to the mother of the family, or to some other member of the family, or his housekeeper, a guardian, or somebody else, I think it should be left to his discretion to do so.  In effect, I think we shall have to regard the father as the head of the family, having regard to the family as a unit, and that we should not try to interfere with his functions.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows, of course, that the father is regarded as the head of the family, and we know that in the majority of cases, so far as this country is concerned, at any rate, it is the general practice for the father of the family, or head of the household to hand over the money to the mother, as being the one who is best acquainted with the needs of the family.  There are exceptions, of course, but provision is made for such exceptions under this amendment. The only purpose of the amendment is to ensure that whatever allowances <Col N="580" /> may accrue as a result of this Bill will be devoted to the benefit of the family in general.  I admit that this is a costly measure, and that it will involve the imposition of new taxation. I take it, from what the Minister has said, that he or his Depart ment are not likely to save anything on this Bill&mdash;belonging to a spend thrift Ministry, as he does, I quite realise that it is unlikely that any saving could be achieved&mdash;but I understood that the real purpose of social legislation of this kind is to ensure more nutritive food for our people and to put the children of the poor beyond the stage of malnutrition which is occasioning disease and, as a result, increasing the expenses of the State.  I do not think there would be any interference with the prerogatives of the father, as head of the family or the household, if this amendment were to be accepted.  After all, this money is a free gift to the people concerned. and no conditions are attached to it. but, apart from the sentimental point of view, it is my considered opinion. after consultation with persons who are in touch with our people, generally, and who, as a result of their efforts, have achieved a remarkable improvement in the conditions under which our people live, that the money should go to the mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the spending of the money of the household, in the majority of cases in this country, is left to the wife or mother, and I am sure that the Minister will admit that.  At any rate, the experience of people who are best qualified to know is to the effect that it would be better to leave it to the mother when it comes to a question of the allocation of any such moneys.  I admit that there are certain exceptions, which I do not propose to deal with now, where a husband or father may fail in his duty in that regard, but I think it will be admitted that, in this country at any rate, the woman&mdash;the<i>bean a' tighe</i>&mdash;is regarded as the head of the household.  Now, why should we interfere with that practice?  The whole idea of this amendment is to try to ensure that this money will be spent for the benefit of the children.  It might be found, in <Col N="581" /> certain cases, to be inadvisable to give the money to the woman, but the idea behind the amendment is to see that the money will be spent to the best advantage so far as the family is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not suggest that this money is being provided for any particular purpose, such as the buying of food or clothes for the children, or for any specific purpose.  The idea underlying the Bill is to provide something to augment the income of people with large families.  I admit that, in the case of some families, the income coming in may be used entirely for certain purposes, and that the children may be neglected; but on the other hand it might be found that the children are well provided for, while the father and mother are undernourished because of their efforts to provide for their children.  We are not proposing how this money shall be spent.  We are only providing this money to augment the incomes of people with large families, and I think we should not interfere with the manner in which that money will be spent by the heads of these households.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that the justification for this Bill is the present inequality in the distribution of wealth, and, therefore, the urge behind the Bill is only qualified by the question as to who is to have the spending of the family income.  Does the Minister want to tell me that there is any justification for his statement that someone is trying to undermine the main purpose behind the Bill, just because there is some criticism as to who, in a family, should have the spending of this money?  Does he not know that certain people are grossly incompetent when it comes to the handling of money, and that it is only in very few cases where the mother of a family will be found to be incompetent in the handling of money when it comes to taking care of her children?  A mother will fight for her children.  Why not, since she has brought those children into the world?  Even in the case of families with a large income, it is generally left to the mother to deal with the matter of housekeeping expenses. <Col N="582" /> Even in the case of men who are not married, they generally turn the money over to their housekeeper when it comes to a matter of dealing with household expenses.  Now, the only effect of this Bill will be that you are increasing the family budget by a certain amount&mdash;some people may think that the amount should be larger&mdash;but, at any rate, the general feeling in the world to-day is that the mother should get an adequate wage for the work that she does: that the mother is entitled to a wage just as the father is entitled to his wage.  It would appear to me that we have been too long impressed by this &ldquo;father complex&rdquo;, as I might call it.  I have known of cases of men earning £4 or £5 a week&mdash;men with large families&mdash; handing £1 a week over to the wife and spending the rest on themselves. Now, in such a case, there is the question of finding out to whom this money should be paid&mdash;whether the mother of the family, the housekeeper, the guardian, or the sister of the man concerned, as the case may be.  The only question to be determined there is who is the proper person to draw the money.  I understand that the Minister has agreed that that should be left optional, and, to that extent, I am quite satisfied with this provision.</P>

      <P>I am sure that every Deputy in the House, no matter to what Party he belongs, would agree that this money should be made payable to the mother as the head of the household.  There is no doubt that the mother is the chief parent in any family and that she has to bear 90 per cent. of the responsibility for the rearing <Col N="583" /> of the family.  There may be some cases where the mother might not be a proper person to be entrusted with the spending of such money, but they would be very rare cases, and therefore I would ask the Minister to give way to what appears to me to be the general voice of the House and make this money payable to the mothers.  It is all very well to say that this is only a supplement to the income of the family, and that it is not proposed to say who should have the deciding voice in the spending of that money, but I think that the mother is the best person to whom such money should be given, because she knows where it is most needed and how best it can be spent; and the half-a-crown, if made payable to the mother, would probably be just as good as 5/- if it were made payable to the father&mdash;in most cases, at any rate.  I think the Minister should seriously consider that. We are not denying the fact that the father is the head of the household; we are only pointing out that the mother is better able to use the money to its best effect.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider this matter seriously, and to make this money payable to the mother, where it is practicable to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an issue upon which most Deputies have personal rather than Party views.  I want to line up with those who favour paying the allowance to the father.  He is the head of the household and the head of the family.  One would imagine, from some of the speeches that have been made here, that he was the enemy of the family.  I regard the father as the natural head of the family, and as the person upon whom the responsibility for maintaining the family devolves. If modern thought in respect of the family is represented by the speeches made in this House, then I prefer to be old-fashioned and believe that in Ireland the father displays a loyalty and fidelity to the family which is probably unequalled in any other country.  Heavens, do we not know that 10,000 fathers have emigrated and gone to work in Britain, under intolerable conditions in many cases, in <Col N="584" /> order to sustain their wives and children? Although they were willing to leave their wives and children to get work in bombed cities in Britain, we think they have so little regard for their families that we will not trust them with an allowance of 2/6 or 5/- a week.  I think the whole approach to this question has been wrong.  In the Bill, there is a provision to pay the father, and it is rather extraordinary if the Legislature were to enact and declare to the country, and to the world, that in Ireland we could not dream of paying family allowances to fathers, because they were spendthrifts and could not be relied upon to devote the money to the benefit of their families.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan cannot be on the side of the mother and the father.  The position is that the father is the natural bread-winner.  It would be just as logical to say that an employer should be compelled to pay wages to a wife instead of to an employee as to say that the State should pay 2/6 or 5/- weekly to the mother because the father could not be relied upon to spend the money properly. Deputy Cosgrave stated that the woman was the person who managed the domestic expenditure.  That is true, but it is because of the father's loyalty to the family when he says: &ldquo;Here, Mary; go and shop; you are the wisest person to shop.&rdquo;  If Mary spends the money, it is only because John, being a good husband, provided the necessary means.  If John goes home on Friday or Saturday nights and gives Mary the weekly allowance, and if he did not fail for five or ten years, I do not imagine he will be a reckless fellow when he gets this 2/6 or 5/- from the State.  I do not imagine he will go to many race meetings, to many cabarets, or even go to the Gresham Hotel on Saturday nights on that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view in relation to such a change may be old-fashioned, but I prefer to be old-fashioned and to give the father what is due to him.  I have still sufficient faith in the father to believe that <Col N="585" /> he will use the money for the benefit of his wife and family.  Other members of this Party may not favour that view, but this is not a Party or a national issue.  I suppose it is more or less a psychological issue.  Personally, in view of what is involved, I prefer to see the father getting the money, because I am satisfied that we have in Ireland some of the most faithful and best type of husbands to be found in the world.</P>

      <P>I would rather line up on the side of paying the allowance to the father.  After all we have not yet deposed him from that position in this country.  I think what the Minister should aim at is to have the utmost flexibility as to whom payments should be made.  Deputy Larkin mentioned one case, but nobody could be under any misapprehension as to whom payments should be made in that instance.  If the scheme is sufficiently flexible, an application in such a case could ensure that payment would be made direct to the wife.  That should end the matter.  There are undoubtedly bad fathers, but they are not in the majority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Stage I expressed a mild preference for giving the allowance to the mother.  It is not a point of national importance.  I think Deputy Donnellan made a point which enabled Deputy Norton to jump on him for doing so.  That is the old gag.  When Deputy Donnellan's skin gets a little thicker, and when he becomes more of a professional politician than he is now, he will take these things in good part and discover that they do not carry much weight one way or another.  I do not think this is a matter to which much importance is attached.  I suppose there are circumstances in which, where a father is living a part from his family, it would be desirable to pay the allowance to the mother.  I understand that Deputy Cosgrave stated that ordinarily we associated a mother with her children. There is a certain amount of force in that.  When children are young and are truly children in the ordinary accepted sense, there seems to be a <Col N="586" /> peculiar nexus between themselves and the mother, but when they reach adolescence at a later stage the father comes more into the picture.  While it is not a matter to get excited about, I think it would be a pleasant gesture to make payment to the mother.  I do not think that fathers in Ireland would regard that as a reflection on them.</P>
      <P>However, if Deputy Norton is so sensitive about it and says that it would constitute a reflection, I do not think we should press the matter.  It is prefectly true that in 99 per cent. of cases fathers who get the 2/6 will pass it on to the mother to be used to the best advantage.  I do not believe anybody had it in mind that there was going to be any desperate evil resulting if the money was handed to the father rather than to the mother.  I rather fancy that those who wanted to pay the mother would be actuated by some desire to pay a mild tribute to motherhood.  In the vast majority of cases the money will be used for the benefit of the children, and an attempt to legislate for exceptional cases is always bound to fail. A bad father in this country is unquestionably an exception, therefore let us not be motivated to legislate to provide for that exception.  If there was any strong feeling on the subject I should not oppose giving the allowance to the mother but, in view of the depth of feeling expressed on this question by Deputy Norton, I should not like to hurt his feelings for all the money in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have rather mixed feelings on this question but I must say that the remarks of Deputy Norton rather led me to the view that this money should be paid to the mother.  The bad father may not be very common but I fear that there are in this country a number of heads of households who do not look after their children.  Deputy Norton knows that in the country the onus is usually thrown on the mother to provide for the household out of whatever income is received.  She has to do that every Saturday night, either out of her husbands earnings or as a result of begging. <Col N="587" /> The percentage of bad fathers in this country may be rather small but I feel that the Minister ought to accept this proposal and have the amount paid to the mother.  That would cast no slur on the father because it is generally accepted amongst small farmers, cottiers and people of that description that the mother must provide the necessaries of life.  She pays the bills, and sometimes has to incur debts.  I think, therefore, it would be no slur on the father of the household if these allowances were paid to the mother.  If any exception be taken to that course, it can be pointed out that there are in small towns and villages in rural Ireland a number of heads of households who do not even support their wives properly.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is to be any help, it should be a help to those who have to provide the necessaries of life for their children.  Although, as I say, the vast majority of fathers fulfil their obligations in respect to their children, there is quite a big minority who do not and who are content to throw that onus on the mother.  By paying these couple of half-crowns to the mother her hardships would be alleviated, because in many cases the onus falls on the mother to provide for the family all the week.  The father, perhaps, does not bother his head.  He goes to the &ldquo;pub.&rdquo; with the best intentions in the world on Saturday night, perhaps with the intention of spending 2/6 when really he will spend 10/-.  If he gets the 2/6 provided for his children in this Bill he will spend it there also.</P>

If the Minister is satisfied that the head of <Col N="588" /> a family is in fact neglecting the children the Minister can direct that the payment be made &ldquo;to such person as the Minister may think fit&rdquo;.</P>

I think we should be very slow to put that slur on a man living in rural Ireland.  If a man is neglecting his family to the extent that you cannot entrust him with the family resources, then steps should be taken to have him brought before a court.  There he would have an opportunity of making his defence before a judicial person who could determine whether he was recalcitrant or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that circumstances may arise which would require that some such power should exist.  I remember that in relation to the rationing scheme we had quite a problem in dealing with persons suffering from a certain mild form of mental derangement.  From time to time that form has the peculiarity that it urges them to tear up papers.  It is a form of derangement which does not involve certification or locking these people up in an asylum, but it created obvious difficulties in the rationing scheme, and we had to arrange that the ration books of these individuals should be given to somebody else.  A similar problem arises in this case to deal with that type of person.  As well, you have the person who is a foolish father, and it is therefore necessary to have some such power as is contained in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not complain of the Minister having that power.  I am merely anxious to sound a warning against what I seem to sense Deputy Donnellan was leading the Minister up to when he asked if the Minister received a letter from a parish priest and sent down an inspector who found that a person was not looking after his <Col N="590" /> family, would he make the payment to the mother.  I want the Minister to be careful in that case.  It is a very grave decision to take.  Once the Minister takes that decision it is a reflection on the father, either that he is half daft, that he is a &ldquo;drunk&rdquo; or a rascal.  You are injuring not only the father but his family in coming to that decision.  Deputy Donnellan knows how sensitive people are about any suggestion of lunacy being in their family.  You do not want to mark out the father of a big family as being half daft nor do you want to mark him as being a drunken and disreputable father, at whose children other children can point the finger of scorn.  I quite agree that occasions may arise when some exceptional step will be necessary, but we should not lightly brand a father as being incapable of looking after his children. Whereas it might not be a big sensation in urban areas, in rural Ireland it would be quite a nine days' wonder if a family were picked out and the allowance given to the mother because of some charge made against the father.</P>

If we were to depart from that principle in this case, we should be, for the first time, attacking the integrity <Col N="591" /> of the family.  That is my own belief.  If we were to adopt that course in this Bill, we should be forced into doing the same thing in relation to benefits under other measures&mdash;food vouchers, payment of children's allowances under the Unemployment Assistance Act and so forth.  I believe that, if we did this, we would have done something which we would always regret.</P>

      <P>My reason for supporting this proposal is that in rural Ireland the heads of families are generally working on Saturday night, and may not have an opportunity to go to the post office and receive this money.  Because of that, I think that arrangements should be made whereby the mother would be enabled to collect the money.  In certain parts of rural Ireland, the father of a family might not go into town once a month. It is his wife who goes into town and provides for the family.  For that reason, I support the proposal that the mother should be the person entitled to receive the money.</P>

      <P>Deputy Heskin has raised the point which I intended to raise.  In country districts, the mother is generally recognised as the financial head of the family.  In the majority of families of farmers, and in almost all families of workers in the country, the money is passed to the mother to administer.  It is the mother who goes into town to do the shopping.  I have seen labourers' wives trudging along the roads with their baskets to bring out provisions for their families.  If vouchers are to be issued, then the natural collector of the money, as the last speaker said, would be the mother. In the country, the mother is generally recognised as the budgetary head of the family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that in a moment.  Deputy Larkin spoke feelingly as to the position of the mother in the family, the way the children look up to her, and the way she looks after <Col N="592" /> the children.  I agree with the Deputy. I could not put the matter as feelingly as he did, as I am not a father myself. Whatever good is in the children is generally obtained from the teaching of the mother.  In the country, she is looked upon as the teacher of the children and their provider.  She has, as a rule, more interest in the children's welfare than the father has.  Deputy Ryan spoke of beggars.  I do not say that the Irish are, as a rule, beggars, but has any Deputy received many supplications on behalf of hungry families from the fathers of these families?  Many approaches have been made to me on behalf of poor families, and in every case the approach was made by the mother, who came up sometimes in the darkness of the night because she did not want her neighbours to know her position.  The father may have the same feelings, but he has not the moral courage of the mother, who takes steps to provide for the children.  I think that most people in rural Ireland will agree that the mother would be the best custodian of the small dole we are providing for the children.  Deputy Norton said that the Minister had made provision in this connection.  Deputy Dillon referred to the dangerous provision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>But if he does not and if he is a &ldquo;bad hat&rdquo;?  Some mothers are, of course, &ldquo;bad hats&rdquo;, but, if we were to take a census, I think the fathers would be in the majority in that respect.</P>

      <P>The Minister has a protecting clause, that if representations <Col N="593" /> are made that the father is not a proper person to receive this money, it can be given to the mother.  Deputy Dillon says that that power should be exercised very carefully in the country. I agree.  But I say to the Minister that it will be exercised very carefully because, until the man has actually degraded himself, no representations will reach the Minister.  Until the father has reached the stage that the whole parish is agreed that he should not be allowed to receive the money, no representations will reach the Minister. That would be the stage at which the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children would be entitled to take action.  When the father is a moderately bad &ldquo;hat&rdquo; there will be no approach to the Minister.  Having listened to the debate, I would throw my weight in on behalf of the mothers, while making no aspersion on the fathers, generally.  If a census were taken in rural Ireland, the majority would vote for the mother receiving whatever benefit is given under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious matter.  It is generally recognised that the family is the most important organisation in the country.  If we were by law to do anything to interfere with that organisation, the result would be seriously dangerous.  The father is recognised by the Church and everybody else as the head of the family and if we, by an act of this House, lower his dignity in any way the time may come when he might be inclined to say that, as the family is receiving an allowance of 2/6 or 5/-, they might do their best to live on that.  His responsibility would become less and less.  Payment direct to the father is the first and foremost thing.  There is machinery here to decide whether he is utilising that money properly or not. That machinery can be used and its use would not mean the lowering of the dignity of the majority of fathers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we say here that the fathers are not fit to have this 2/6 or 5/-, as it is <Col N="594" /> suspected they may use it for drink or for some other incorrect purpose, we are lowering the dignity of the head of the family.  That would tend to break up family life and the moment we set off on that expedition we will do irreparable damage.  There are ample ways under the Bill of discovering whether a father is capable or safe to handle this money.  I am quite sure the Minister has experience enough in the administration of rationing schemes to find out the best means of doing that, without doing any great damage to the dignity of the father. The law at present recognises the father as responsible, and the moment we say that he is not the responsible individual, we do very serious damage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Reilly says that the suggested amendment is lowering the dignity of the father. Would he not consider, for a change, raising the dignity of the mother? That seems to be the principle embodied in this amendment and one I wish to call attention to.  As far as I can see, it is not a question as to whether the mothers or the fathers are the more responsible persons or whether more damage may be done by the fathers than by the mothers; it is merely a question, as the Minister says, of bringing in a new definition into the Bill as to who is head of the family.  The law recognises the father as the head because he is the bread-winner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the British law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our law, too&mdash;it may be British or Irish, but it still exists.  As we all know, the responsible persons, in the majority of cases, so far as the children are concerned, are the mothers.  All the income brought in by the father is brought in as the result of his duty when he takes on a certain responsibility. He has a variety of possibilities, in our particular way of life, of going out and earning a livelihood for himself and the family; and it is quite right that he should have the duty and responsibility of maintaining the family.  But the key, the anchor <Col N="595" /> and the bedrock of the family is not the father but the mother, even in the best families where the father is carrying out all his duties and responsibilities. It is basically the mother who should receive the first consideration, because she is the person who has the care of the children.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies seem to take a superficial view of this point because within the Bill there is a provision which enables the Minister, in exceptional cases, to make payment to the mother instead of to the father.  Deputies seem to think that everything is rectified by that, but that is not the case. Everyone knows well that there are many families where it would be impossible for the investigating officers or anyone else to prove that the father is not carrying out his duties to his family in a legal manner; although within the family he may not be carrying out his duties as a father.  I do not wish to go into details of those cases as it may appear that I am weighting the balance against the father.  In many families the income is brought in by the father and he decides how much of it he will allocate to the upkeep of the family.  On ordinary lawful grounds, no objection can be made to that, but that man as a father may not be carrying out his responsibility according to the means he has available.</P>
      <P>From that point of view, and from the point of view that we are dealing here with a measure that is intended specifically for the benefit of the children, because of the burden the children place upon the family, I consider that the mother comes closest to the children.  She has the problem week by week of dealing with whatever money is handed over by the father, whether it is large or small, whether it is the rightful amount or not.  The money this State is about to provide should be added to the money she receives for the care of the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have many forms of social legislation, we have a Constitution and we have various views and principles as to the family; but never yet have we recognised the rôle of the woman and the mother in the family and given <Col N="596" /> her due credit.  I think it would be a good departure in this instance if we recognised&mdash;whatever may be the legal rights of the father and whatever his standing in relation to the family and society as a whole&mdash;that the mother is the bedrock of the family.  I think that recognition is a long time overdue and that we should enshrine that principle in this Bill.  It will not affect the other measures the Minister has referred to and the legal position will still be there.  In so far as the welfare of the children is concerned, the primary person to whom this money should be paid is the mother.  The other provisions which remain in the Bill and which allow the Minister to adjust the payment according to the circumstances of the case can be used in the case of mothers who are neglecting their duty.  The mothers are connected so much with the family that we should recognise that the foundation of a family is essentially the mother and the children for whom she cares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I wish to make.  The Minister comes from a Department which administers money to persons entitled to draw it by statute, principally through insurance.  He does not like to interrupt that.  That is part and parcel of the whole meaning of the Department, so far as the work of social administration is concerned. The second point is that the Minister says his proposal is that the father should receive the payment.  There is nothing in the Bill disclosing the fact that the father is entitled to it: whoever is maintaining the children is the person who has the right to make the claim.  If the mother brings in 21/- a week as against 20/- brought in by the father, the mother would be the person to make the claim.  The Bill is neutral in so far as it applies to either the father or the mother making the claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephMeighan" hpid="Mr. Meighan Mr. Meighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, the very fact of this Bill being called a Children's Allowances Bill is reason enough why the payments should be made to the mother.  Everybody will agree that during childhood the mother <Col N="597" /> is the person who has most to do with the children.  From the very day they are born until they are 14 and 15 years, she is constantly in touch with them. In the West of Ireland and all through rural Ireland, it is the recognised rule that the mothers do the shopping and provide the food and clothing for the children.  If this is really a Children's Allowances Bill, that is reason enough for the allowance being paid to the parent who is responsible and who provides these things.  Apart from that, I think such payment would be a gesture that is due to the good mothers of the country.  The Dáil should decree that this allowance be paid to them for the reasons I have stated.  That is not alone my view, but the view of my Party, representing the various constituencies throughout rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>When I was dealing with this matter last night, I pointed out that the rights that are in this Bill, and that apparently are being objected to, are similar to the rights in other Bills concerning local authorities, such as county councils.  If a county committee of agriculture at any period did not carry out its duties the law would prevent the Minister from dissolving that committee until he first <Col N="598" /> dissolved the county council.  That was the Minister's difficulty.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broderick must be a very innocent man, or else he does not read any paper&mdash;and I cannot believe either.  Last night he said he saw no reason for this provision in the Bill; that every county committee he knew of was doing its duty.  But Deputy Broderick is also aware that for five or six years the county committee of agriculture in Cork was definitely composed of one political party and it devoted nine-tenths of its time to an endeavour to prevent the operation of the tillage Order in Cork County.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Only some of it.  When I was dealing with that matter some time ago, I produced an advertisement, published in the <i>Cork Examiner,</i> advocating the growing of wheat.  Side by side with that advertisement was a leading article which pointed out to the farmers the foolishness of growing wheat.  Now, what was the position taken up by the county committee of agriculture?  They were carrying out the schemes sent down to them in connection with the growing of wheat, but each Saturday a special reporter from the <i>Irish Independent</i> was sent down to write a special article for the <i>Sunday Independent</i> relating to a motion by a member of the county committee against the growing of wheat and the carrying out of tillage operations in the county.  That went on Saturday after Saturday; there were meetings of the county committee, and the special articles were disseminated in the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> together with a few articles from some gentleman&mdash;I think they called him Ben Mayo.  They were like something one would expect from Deputy Dillon, and they appeared in the same paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think a committee that persisted in carrying out that policy month after month during a period of emergency such as we have experienced since 1939, was acting in the best interests of the county.  The county committee is supposed to be composed of experienced agriculturists, men who <Col N="599" /> are prepared to give advice and assistance and carry out agricultural schemes.  I think it is rather ridiculous to have a county committee, on the one hand, carrying out those schemes and, on the other hand, endeavouring at meeting after meeting to prevent those schemes being carried out.  That is what happened in this instance.  I quite admit there were some members of the committee, such as Deputy Halliden, who did not agree with that policy and who endeavoured in the best way they could to prevent that game being carried on.  Nevertheless, that continued for five or six years. One section of the representatives of the ratepayers was excluded, was completely kept off the committee, and the committee was in the hands of one set of individuals who were using it for propaganda purposes.  In a case like that I think the Minister would be quite justified in abolishing such a committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that there was deliberate propaganda.  On the one hand, the committee is disbursing public money for the purpose of carrying out schemes and, on the <Col N="600" /> other hand, they are turning the committee into a medium of propaganda for the purpose of preventing these schemes bearing fruit.  Such a committee, in my opinion at any rate, should be dissolved.  I made several appeals to the Minister in that connection during the period when that propaganda was proceeding.  I saw the harm that committee was endeavouring to do throughout Cork County.  Thank God, the farmers of Cork did not take their advice, or the advice contained in the articles in the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> written by the special reporter sent down to report the meetings, or by the gentleman who styled himself Ben Mayo, and who used to write like Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>I submit that there is nothing in this section which differs in any way from the law as it is under the Local Government Act.  That Act gives power to the Minister for Local Government to dissolve a county council, board of health or board of assistance. The non-insertion of this section in this Bill would put the Minister for Agriculture in a very awkward position because if a county committee of agriculture refused to carry out the proposals or schemes put before it, and that it was its duty to carry out, the Minister could not dissolve it without first dissolving the county council, which is not his responsibility. I think I have given sufficient reasons to show that there should be power to dissolve a county committee of agriculture that is not prepared to do its duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other county committees of agriculture besides the Cork Committee of Agriculture.  I do not see why we should have that sort <Col N="601" /> of stuff imposed on us.  We are discussing this section in a general way and are not concerned with the affairs of the Cork County Committee in particular. The Minister admitted last night that this matter did require consideration. I hope that, having slept on it since, he is now prepared to meet the House.  We have tried to meet him, but last night he appeared to be adamant in his refusal to budge even an inch.  Possibly, on more mature consideration, he may now be prepared to do something.  The Minister has not made any case for the section or attempted to justify its inclusion in the Bill.  The only attempt that he made to justify its inclusion was in his statement that this section would be in line with similar provisions to be found in the Local Government Act and in the Vocational Education Bill now before the Dáil.  He said that the three Ministers concerned, as a result of the consultations they had before the introduction of the Local Government Act of 1941, agreed that the legislation governing these matters should be brought into line.</P>
      <P>I do not think that there is any analogy at all between the responsibilities of a county council and a county committee of agriculture.  As Deputy Broderick pointed out last night, it is the county council that has the responsibility of finding all the finances required for the various services in a county.  It has to provide the money needed for the relief of the destitute.  It has to provide hospital treatment for those unable to make that provision for themselves, and it has to look after all the social services. If a county council fails to do any of these things, it may be a very serious matter for individuals in a particular county.  Therefore I say there is no analogy between the two.  In the case of the county committees of agriculture the Minister for Agriculture definitely holds the whip hand because the schemes administered by those committees are financed up to 50 per cent. by way of grants out of State funds. That puts the Minister in the position of being able to withhold payment of those grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be invidious, of course, for <Col N="602" /> the Minister to name any particular committee but, when pressed yesterday, he had to admit that in the past no county committee of agriculture had given him trouble.  Deputy MacEoin rightly pointed out that all those committees have shown their anxiety to help and co-operate in the present food drive, that they have welcomed the Minister personally and his principal officials, and that they have never failed, when called upon to do so, to make all necessary arrangements for an expansion of food production in the country.  Surely it is not desirable now, in view of all that, to introduce anything that may cause friction or difficulty.  The Minister expressed the view that he hoped that what had been said by Deputy MacEoin would not create any clash between any committee and his Department. In my view, if there is anything that is going to cause friction or a clash of interest between those committees and the Minister's Department, it is the Minister's action in introducing this contentious section.  I think it is a most indiscreet thing to do.  It is most unfair in view of the co-operation that the Minister has got from those committees.  The Minister could not, even in a general way, make any charge of dereliction of duty, of failure or of improper conduct against any of those committees of agriculture. I think that he ought to reconsider this matter.  We, as I have said, have tried to meet him, but he was not prepared to do that.  We are definitely opposed to the section, and if the Minister persists in his attitude we shall have to challenge a division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister should adopt such an attitude towards the county committees of agriculture. As a member of the Waterford County Council and of the Waterford County Committee of Agriculture, I am in a position to say that the members of that committee do all they possibly can to improve agriculture.  They have introduced prize schemes, and in other ways have tried to improve agriculture.  If the Minister is now going to hold this weapon over their heads, the members may well <Col N="603" /> ask themselves why they should be giving their time and assistance to the promotion of agriculture through the committees on which they serve.  I can say that those members give unselfish service.  I think it is very unfair, in view of the amount of time and attention that they give to public business, that they should be treated in this way.  In addition to the members of the county council who are members of those committees, you have other men selected to act on them. They also give of their best, and try in every way to help the instructors employed by the committees.  They go out of their way to help them in their work.  In view of all that, I think it is very unfair that this weapon should be held over the members of those committees who have rendered such good service to the country and to agriculture. As Deputy Hughes has pointed out, the members of the county committees were only too happy to meet the Minister and his responsible officials when they were touring the country to encourage the people to provide food for the nation.  In view of all that, I think that the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that if anything could convince the Minister of the unwisdom of including this section in the Bill, it should be the speech delivered by Deputy Corry.  Deputy Corry advocated that any county committee of agriculture that expressed views contrary to those held by the Government should be abolished.  If a county committee of agriculture is to be suppressed because its views are not in agreement with Governmental policy, then such a committee could be of no earthly use.  There are, and always will be, differences in regard to agricultural policy.  There have been violent differences about it during the past ten years, differences which have been very detrimental to the interests of agriculture.  It is only right that every committee should be free to express its views and to get the widest possible publicity for them, even if those views are as foolish as Deputy <Col N="604" /> Corry has represented the views of the Cork County Committee to be.</P>
      <P>Another ground upon which he suggested that these committees should be abolished is that, in one case in Cork, a committee was formed of persons drawn entirely from one section on the county council.  There was nothing contrary to law in the formation of a committee on these lines.  It may not have been wise to have done so, but it was quite in accordance with the law, and the Cork County Council was quite entitled to form a committee on these lines, if they so desired.  They have a precedent for doing so in the fact that the Executive Committee of this House is drawn entirely from one Party, even though that Party is a minority in the House.  Having heard Deputy Corry's speech and having had brought to his notice, in very eloquent and forceful language, the extent to which this power to abolish county committees can be used, I think the Minister will see that it is better that this section should not be embodied in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The debate on this section is rather surprising.  One would imagine that a very big question was to be decided on it.  I do not know how Deputies can work themselves up so much over a matter like this&mdash;a power which always existed but which had to be exercised in an indirect way. The power always existed, in that, by removing a county council, the county committee went with it, if the county committee had done anything wrong, or had not been carrying out its duties; but surely if the power is to exist at all, it should be possible to exercise it without suppressing a county council which might be carrying out its duties properly.  When such powers were given over and over again in all the Local Government Acts, why did not Deputies at that time put forward an amendment to provide that if a county council were abolished, the county committee should carry on, if there were the same feeling about the matter as there is now?  I am bringing in an amending Bill, and I want to keep this power.  I see no reason for surrendering it, which is quite different from the argument which is put up, <Col N="605" /> as to why I am looking for this power. I see no reason to surrender it, and no case has been made for my doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I say it is unreasonable to expect that, if we want to get at a county committee, we must adopt the roundabout method of suppressing the county council.  That is the present law.  Why should we not get at the county committee for not doing its business and allow the county council to carry on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to talk about this from the angle of democracy, let us do so.  I said here yesterday, and I say again, that in other countries nothing has done so much to destroy democracy as that sort of talk about democratic control and about nobody interfering.  If there is a democratic body which is not doing its duty, let somebody get rid of it and put somebody in its place who will do the work. Surely nothing will do so much to harm democracy in this country as our being put in a position in which we cannot interfere with people who are not doing their duty properly.  I have nothing but admiration for the county committees; I have nothing but admiration for the men in this House, every one of them, and for the people of this country; but does any good citizen object if we bring in a measure to deal with law breakers?  I do not want to use the word &ldquo;criminals&rdquo; because it is not applicable, but if we bring in a law providing penalties for breaches of the law, does any good citizen object?  Surely he does not say that it is a slur on us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument put up in that respect is the most ridiculous argument I ever heard and the worst of it is that it is put up by all sides of the House, that the bringing in of a section like this is a slur on the committees.  It is no slur on any committee to say that if a county committee is not doing its duty properly, something must be <Col N="606" /> done about it, and I am quite sure that no decent county committee will object, because they all feel it is meant for the other fellow.  As it happens, they are quite right in that feeling, because it is not meant for any of the county committees as these committees are now discharging their functions.  We must have the power to deal with them if anything goes wrong.</P>
    <P>I have stated over and over again that there is no intention of suppressing a committee because its members disagree with Government policy. Does any Deputy think that the Minister could get away with that, if he tried it?  Does any Deputy think the Dáil will be silent if I suppress a committee because it criticises the Government?  Surely I or any Minister would need a better case for dissolving a local authority than the fact that it was criticising the Government. The Minister must have a case he can stand over, and must be able to show clearly that the particular body was not carrying out its duties and not giving to the farmers in their area the benefits to which these farmers are entitled.</P>
    <P>It is only in cases like that that the Minister can act, and, if he has to act in these circumstances, why must we adopt the roundabout method of suppressing the county council first, or why must a county council, which may be a good county council, be suppressed in order to get at a county committee?  That is the power we have at present, and we are merely asking for power to get directly at a county committee, if it is not doing its duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice, from long experience of the Minister, that when he becomes very vigorous in reply to a debate, it is always a sure sign that he is defending a very weak case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, but I think no one was ever put in the position of having to defend so weak a case as this.  We have opposed this measure <Col N="607" /> entirely on the ground that it is unnecessary; that it is, if you like, unnecessarily provocative, and seeks to provide insurances for which there is no necessity at all.  The Minister has paid tribute to present and past county committees, and the records of his Department, since the establishment of these committees of agriculture, cannot show that there was ever any committee which did not carry out its duties properly.  Why, then, should the Minister seek mandatory powers over them?</P>
      <P>In my statement last night, I devoted a good deal of time to trying to show that there was no analogy between the Department of Agriculture and other Departments in the exercise of this power.  I do not propose to go over the same ground, but these committees are purely voluntary bodies, composed of people who come from all sides of the county to administer, in their own interests, schemes put up by the Government for the betterment of their interest in life, the agricultural industry. Why should they not act wholeheartedly with the Government in their own interests and in the interests of the people they represent?  The Minister talks about democracy.  I do not intend to say much on it, but I think experience all over the world has shown that there can be no greater dictatorship than dictatorship in the form of democracy.  Have a care that we are not tending in that direction in this county.  Public opinion cannot be ruthlessly suppressed all the time under any form of government.  It can revolt. Possibly it is held down by terror under dictatorial government, but it is not held down under democratic governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our statements, we confined ourselves to the one issue, that it was unnecessary to have these powers.  The only person who would appear to justify any doubting suspicion in the mind of the country was Deputy Corry, who said the Minister should have power to suppress lawful criticism.  We never attempted to say any such thing, and we never thought the Minister would do any such thing.  We have not <Col N="608" /> opposed it on the ground of any potential danger of that kind, but on the ground that there is no necessity for these powers.</P>
    <P>We ask the Minister even now, considering the constitution, the record and the activities of these agricultural committees, to withdraw the section. These committees are working under different circumstances in different parts of the country.  They are all doing their own business.  They feel that the moneys put up by the local authority and the central authority are intended for the betterment of their own interests.  Surely common-sense people will not be so insane as not to avail themselves of the moneys put up. Between the contribution of the Department and the contribution from the Cork County Council, something like £80,000 is put up every year in that county in the interests of the agricultural community, who have their representatives on the committee.  Are they to throw that money away for nothing?  There has not been a single argument put in favour of this section that could be sustained by facts.  It is in the best interests of everybody that the Minister should withdraw the section.  If the Minister does not withdraw it, I shall have to challenge a division on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

I do not know that the Deputy was so enthusiastic about a division last night.  I suppose he feels that they are more secure to-night.  We are inclined to be helpful in this matter.  On the Minister's own admission, there is no necessity for this section.  There is no analogy between the application of this dictatorial clause in the case of other Departments and its application in this case.  These county committees do not come under the same heading.  In the whole record of these county committees the Minister has never had any occasion to find fault with any of their activities.  On these grounds I ask the Minister to withdraw the section.</P>

      <P>I must say that, prior to hearing Deputy Corry, my sympathies were more or less in favour of the Minister's point of view and of the inclusion of the section in the Bill.  But, in view of Deputy Corry's attitude and what is in his mind, I think the Minister, in order to safeguard himself, would be well-advised to let the present difficulty remain, as, if the Minister is in possession of the power that he looks for in Section 5 of the Bill, he will find himself bombarded by the Deputy Corrys and others of the same mentality throughout the country to exercise this power, because these people do not like the politics of a county committee of agriculture.  That is Deputy Corry's plain, open and candid point of view.  He does not like, or did not like, the politics of a particular committee of agriculture in County Cork and therefore he did everything in his power to try to get that committee suppressed.  He will be in a far stronger position to do that if the Minister has the power to do so without first dissolving the county council, including Deputy Corry.  The Minister would be in a stronger position if he were able to tell Deputy Corry: &ldquo;If I am to get at the county committee of agriculture, I will have to suppress you and the rest of the county council.&rdquo;  I think the Minister would be well advised to reconsider the matter.</P>
      <P>Normally, I am mostly in favour of provisions of this kind.  I am in favour of them with regard to county councils, where county councils are obviously refusing to do their job.  I am in favour of giving the Minister power to suppress such a county council and to appoint commissioners.  But, in the case like this, where power is already there, even though it has to be exercised indirectly through suppression, first of all, of the county council, I think that, in view of the mentality that has been shown here, the Minister should allow that difficulty to remain in his path before he would be in a position to suppress a county committee of agriculture.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to delay the House, but certain things which were not in them seem to have been <Col N="610" /> read into my statements by Deputies who have spoken.  Each Deputy in turn contended&mdash;and I give them the credit of saying that they were serious in their contentions&mdash;that they were anxious about the food drive.  I say that in a time of emergency any body of men who set out to prevent food being grown for the people of the nation should be suppressed.  I have no apologies to make for saying that.</P>
      <P>Members of the old Cork Committee of Agriculture were personal friends of mine, apart from politics.  Still, when I saw the county committee being prostituted as a propaganda platform for the prevention of the growing of the necessary food for this nation in a time of emergency&mdash;and that was done in that county committee for a number of years&mdash;I certainly saw no reason why that county committee should be allowed to be used for that purpose.</P>
      <P>What is the point put up by Deputies who have spoken?  They know that the Minister has the power of suppressing a county committee of agriculture without this section.  The only difference is that, in order to suppress a county committee of agriculture, he must also suppress the parent body, which, perhaps, is doing its duty faithfully and well.  The Minister has to go a roundabout way by suppressing the county council, not because that county council has done something wrong, but because the county committee of agriculture has done something wrong.  I know that the majority of the members of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture are doing their duty faithfully and well.  But I do say that at one period that county committee of agriculture was used by one individual as a propaganda platform.  There were notable exceptions, however.  Members of that county committee realised the harm that was being done by that committee being used as a propaganda platform to help the enemies of this country in their endeavour to starve this country into submission in a time of emergency. That was being done, and was being done deliberately over a number of years.  That was the reason for my attitude in regard to that county committee. It was not because of any difference in politics.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Minister's spirited defence of this section a few minutes ago and I gather his case is that he wishes to have a short cut.  Without suppressing the parent body, the county council, he wishes to have powers under this particular section to suppress and discontinue the activities of a county committee of agriculture.  What I would like to ask the Minister is this&mdash;does he think that in this particular section he is taking to himself, as a member <Col N="612" /> of the Executive, any greater powers than the Minister for Local Government would have under the local government code?  I would like to know whether or not the Minister has explored the position from that point of view.  As I interpret the Minister's remarks, the reason for this section is that he wants a short cut and that he is not seeking to take powers under this section with regard to county committees of agriculture that do not already exist with regard to county councils.</P>

Is it exactly the same section, has it exactly the same effect, having regard to the existing code?  I am not referring to any particular statute.  I would like to know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We put it to the Minister last night that, if the House was prepared to grant this power of dissolving county committees, one thing we objected to in the provisions set out here is the extension of bureaucratic control.  We do not want that. The Minister has made provision for the selection of another committee and when he was asked to agree to an amendment that he should go back, and request the county council to nominate a new body, he anticipated the difficulty that, once any suppression had occurred, it might affect the <Col N="613" /> parent body.  Has the Minister attempted to give us any alternative? Should not the Minister have brought in some proposal to the effect that individuals could be elected because of particular qualifications?  There is no reason why we should not have an election in the event of a Minister having to dissolve a county committee. He could bring in a proposal that, for instance, you would give the people an opportunity of electing persons because of their particular valuation; that there would be groups, divided according to valuation; that persons of £10 to £15 valuation would be selected to form one group and that they would select a candidate, or candidates; that another group of persons of £20 to £30 valuation would select another candidate, or candidates, and so on, up to £100 valuation. That would give the people an opportunity in their own county of electing a new body.  The Minister should be convinced from the attitude of the whole House last night that strong exception is taken to this provision because, in the event of a county committee having to be suppressed, there is the possibility, almost the certainty, that there will be bureaucratic control.  Cannot the Minister make some effort to provide an alternative, to leave the power in the hands of the people?</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out that the Minister has the whip hand there.  In any case, in the event of a body being dissolved and the grants not being forthcoming, the county as a whole will lose considerably financially.  It is not likely that if any difficulty arose as far as the county council was concerned, it would permeate through the county.  If the Minister were prepared to bring in a provision such as I have suggested, whereby an election could be held to elect a committee or a democratic body, I believe the House would be inclined to meet the Minister on it. Is the Minister prepared to consider that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Hughes, one wonders if there are any words in the English language more abused in this country than the words <Col N="614" />&ldquo;democracy&rdquo; and &ldquo;bureaucratic control&rdquo;.  These are stock words of Deputy Hughes, used in every argument put forward by him.  Under this section of this Bill the Minister proposes to bring the law as regards county committees into line with the law that exists in respect of county councils, urban councils and all other elected authorities in the country. That is simply all.  On the Second Reading of this Bill Deputy Hughes said that there was nothing in the Bill that any committee of agriculture who were properly doing their duty could object to or were afraid of.  I want to echo that statement.  There is nothing in Section 5 of this Bill that any committee of agriculture or any member of any committee of agriculture need be afraid of.  The provision exists in respect of county councils. Deputy Hughes as a member of a county council, or any other Deputy in this House, is not one bit afraid of or has any objection to that provision because he knows quite well that, so long as the county councils are doing their duty normally and properly, they never will be suppressed.  They know that quite well and every member of every local authority in the country knows it.  It is utter nonsense to submit that the same law should not operate with regard to committees of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Committees of agriculture are composed of workers, farmers, small farmers and other types of people. They are not confined to any one group of persons, any group of large farmers, or any group of persons who believe that they should be outside the law all the time.  Every type is represented on the committees of agriculture and they are as democratic as any group that Deputy Hughes purports to speak for here.  Deputy Hughes does not represent all the views of all the members of all the committees of agriculture in this country, in any way.  No county council or urban council and no other local authority has been suppressed in this country without good reason.  Deputy Hughes knows that quite well.  He knows also that no Minister for Agriculture in the future, whether it is Deputy Hughes, Deputy <Col N="615" /> Corish, Deputy Cogan or any other person, will dare suppress a committee of agriculture unless there is very sound and adequate reason for it.  That is all that the Minister is asking for in this Bill.  He is asking for the same provision as exists in regard to county councillors.  No county councillor who is a member of this House ever fears the provision of the Local Government Act in that respect.  They know that, and Deputy Broderick knows it, as chairman and member of a county council over a long number of years. He knows the provisions are there. But, it was not necessary to have those provisions in the Local Government Act to make Deputy Broderick do his duty properly.  He has carried out his duty as a county councillor on all occasions, not because of the provisions in any Act of Parliament, but because of good citizenship, and for that reason alone.  He is not a bit afraid of those provisions.  Neither would he be afraid, if he were a member of a committee of agriculture, of the provisions in this section of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to say, Sir, that certain statements that have been made here in the House, to the effect that the Cork County Committee of Agriculture had hampered the production of food, are not true.  To show that such statements are not correct, I might point out that at the beginning of this emergency the Minister for Agriculture went down to Cork, was met by the members of the county committee of agriculture, and was assured by all the members of that committee that they would give all the help that they could in the production of food for our people.  I myself come from a part of that county, where the farmers have tilled almost as much land as was tilled during the last 100 years, and the farmers there are doing all that they can to produce food for our people.  Accordingly, I think that the Minister has been very badly advised when he proposes to take power out of the hands of the people who have been dealing with this matter for so many years, and putting that power into the hands of an official.  I think the Minister is very badly advised in going back to the system which was introduced here in or about 1924.  I think that Deputy Corry stated here that there was one particular man who was interfering with food production in the Cork County Committee of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I want to protest against the attempt by Deputy Hughes and other speakers to convey the impression that the Minister is attempting to prevent the members of these committees from doing their duty and that he is trying to take the control of these matters away from democratic institutions and to hand it over to a kind of bureaucratic administration. This is not an attempt to deprive these committees of control over the work which they are in a position to do, any more than it is an attempt to deprive representatives of county councils of control over their work.  Definitely, this measure is designed to put out of office county committees who deliberately refuse to do their duty, so far as the people who elected them are concerned.  If, for instance, the county committee of agriculture in Deputy Hughes's purse-proud county refuses to do its duty, would Deputy Hughes agree that that committee should be left in control of the affairs of his county?  I hardly think he would.  If a committee of agriculture in, say, County Cork, refuses to perform its duty, would Deputies here, representing Cork, say <Col N="619" /> that the members of that committee should not be deprived of office? Would they agree that the people in the district concerned should be left under the control of such a committee? I do not think they would.  I am quite sure that they would not agree to leave the affairs of their county in the control of such a bureaucratic committee.</P>
      <P>All that the Minister is seeking is power, in the case of a county committee of agriculture which deliberately refuses to do its duty, to remove such a committee, and I think that, in such a case, the Minister would be conferring a benefit on the community by the removal of such a committee.  The whole thing is that, under present circumstances, the Minister has not the power to dissolve those committees, and I think that, in the steps which he proposes to take, he is actually going about the matter in a really democratic way.  That is why I say that there is no reason whatever for trying to create this false atmosphere, to the effect that this is going to mean autocratic control, when, actually, it is going to lead to a more democratic system.  There has been a lot of talk by chatterboxes in the House here to-day, trying to create that false atmosphere and to suggest that this is going to lead to autocratic control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of being called a chatterbox, in reference to what I am going to say, I should like to ask Deputy O Cléirigh, when he talks about one of these committees refusing to do its duty, who is to determine whether or not it is doing its duty?  I do not think it would be easy to get anybody on any side of this House to accept the viewpoint that has been put forward by Deputy O Cléirigh.  He may sneer at the viewpoints that have been put forward by Deputies in this House, but I think it will be agreed that every Bill that has been introduced by the present Government, in connection with the administration of public bodies, has been shown to be absolutely autocratic in its tendency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen reminded us that the <Col N="620" /> section we are now discussing is enshrined in the Local Government Act.  As one of those who voted against such a section being included in that Act, I am on pretty strong ground in opposing this section.  The present Minister may not use it in a manner which would be prejudicial to the interest of a committee, or a particular county but, at any time, there might be a Minister here who, from the point of view of political bias, would scrap a county committee of agriculture.  If a committee does not do its duty, is it not obvious that the people whom it represents should be permitted to determine whether it had or had not done its duty?  The views of Deputy Hughes in that connection are worthy of recognition.  A committee of agriculture is usually composed of eight representatives of a county council, and eight outsiders, and if it were found that such a committee was doing something which would be detrimental to the interests of a county from the agricultural point of view, a county council should be permitted to intervene and to put other members on the agricultural committee.</P>
    <P>There are almost three times as many members on a county council as on a committee of agriculture, and for that reason the suggestion made by Deputy Hughes is a wise one.  Deputies in the Farmers' Party pointed out that a committee of agriculture is one on which experts are wanted, and that, in the main, it is composed of farmers who are alive to the situation that confronts their industry, and to the needs of the people in an area.  It would be found that such a committee would not often go against the best interests of the people they represented.  Above all committees, I think this is the one committee which should not be interfered with by the Minister.  It was pointed out in many speeches made yesterday that the Minister for Agriculture, and other Ministers, have addressed county committees of agriculture and found every one of them doing what they were asked to do to have the Minister's present policy implemented. Consequently, I cannot <Col N="621" /> see the necessity for a section of this kind.  The Minister said that the section might never be applied.  I suggest that it should never be applied, as there will never be any reason for applying it.  Then why take such power?  Why visualise a situation in which the Government will step in to compel the elected representatives of <Col N="622" /> the people to do something which they believe the people do not want?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2) and substitute therefor the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister may, after having satisfied himself that a suspension has been made by a county committee on frivolous grounds, terminate such suspension or having caused an inquiry to be held under Section 24 of the Principal Act as amended by this Act terminate such suspension and every such suspension shall continue until so terminated.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of this section states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may terminate a suspension under this section and every such suspension shall continue until so terminated.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If a county committee decides that it is necessary to suspend an officer, whether the charges are serious or not, the Minister has full power to terminate that suspension.  I am simply proposing that he shall terminate such a suspension only after he has satisfied himself that the charges upon which the suspension was made were frivolous.</P>

      <P>The only thing I can say to the Deputy is that he is providing for a very obvious case.  It is quite obvious that the Minister would act in the way the Deputy suggests in any case.  I do not know whether the Deputy's wording would add very much to the section.  I suppose if the Minister had any reason for re-instating an officer suspended by a committee, as the Deputy fears, he would say: &ldquo;The charge is frivolous and I am re-instating this officer.&rdquo;  I do not think that the wording proposed by the Deputy would help in any way but if he thinks that it is necessary to strengthen the section, I shall look into it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's power to remove the suspension is not qualified in any way.  The charge against <Col N="624" /> the suspended officer might be serious from the point of view of the committee but the Minister could terminate the suspension and the committee would have no redress.  Once a suspension is made by a county committee, we want it to be understood that there will be an inquiry and that the Minister will not, except in very exceptional cases, constitute himself the inquiry.</P>

      <P>The Minister might have drafted the section in this way: &ldquo;The Minister, having satisfied himself that the charges against the officer were refuted or answered, may terminate a suspension.&rdquo;  As it stands, it would appear that whether the official was competent or incompetent, neglectful of or attentive to his duties, the Minister has power, notwithstanding any complaint, to reinstate him. There are no grounds indicated as to how the Minister would exercise the power of removal of suspension and I think there should be some indication of that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 16, at the end of the section, to add the following words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that where the determination of the service of an officer is carried out by order of the Minister under the preceding three sections for reasons other than for neglect, inattention to the duties of his office or misconduct, the terms of the officer's superannuation will not <Col N="625" /> be less favourable than he enjoyed prior to the operation of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I move this amendment so that adequate compensation may be granted to those officials who took office under the scheme and who were of opinion that they had a fairly good assurance that they would be adequately remunerated for the number of years they served and adequately superannuated on retirement.  Under the section as it stands, if these officials are found unsatisfactory or fail to comply with the requirements which the Minister deems necessary, he will terminate their employment.  The Minister will, I am sure, admit that it is unfair to conclude a contract by terminating it on one side only.  He is aware that a contract is an agreement between two parties.  He is taking power to conclude the contract in this case when, in his opinion, the other contracting party is not carrying out the functions of the office to his satisfaction. It is necessary that, if the holder of the office is not carrying out his duties, the Minister should have the right to terminate his employment, but I put down this amendment so that the holders of these offices will not suffer by reason of the fact that their period of office is shorter than it would have been if this Bill had not been introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain what the law is at present because it may have escaped the notice of some Deputies.  The law dealing with these superannuation cases is contained in the Local Government Act, 1925.  Section 44 of that Act states that a local body shall, with the consent of the Minister, grant to a pensionable officer who has attained the age of 65 years and has at least 25 years' service or who becomes incapable of discharging the duty of his office by reason of permanent infirmity of mind or body or of old age, an annual allowance up to two-thirds of his salary.  These are generous terms.  Sub-section (2) of that section says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A local body shall, with the consent of the Minister, grant to a pensionable officer in their employment <Col N="626" /> and who has at least ten years' service, and</P>
    <P>(a) who is removed from his office for a cause other than misconduct or incapacity....</P>
    <P>an annual allowance....not greater than two-thirds of his yearly salary and emoluments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that, if an Order is made under Section 8 with regard to age limit, and if Section 11 is passed&mdash;that is to say, if the Act is applied to existing officers&mdash;and if they have more than ten years' service, the local authority can grant them up to two-thirds of their salary, which is more than generous when compared with the treatment of officers in the Government service.  The word used there is &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  The local authority may grant less.  But sub-section (6) of Section 44 of the Local Government Act, 1925, states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If an officer of a local body is aggrieved by the neglect or refusal of the local body to grant him an allowance or gratuity under this section, or with the amount of any allowance or gratuity granted him by the local body, he may within six months of his ceasing to hold his office appeal to the Minister, who may thereupon grant to such officer any allowance or gratuity which in his opinion should have been granted to such officer by the local body under this section and such officer shall thereupon be entitled to receive such an allowance or gratuity from the local body.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position is very fully dealt with there and I think that it is better to leave things as they are.  I do not think that the suggested amendment would in any way alter the position because, if an officer has up to ten years' service and if he is compelled to retire by an order of this kind, he is entitled to two-thirds of his retiring salary.  If granted less than two-thirds, he can appeal to the Minister, but the Minister, in that case, will be the Minister for Local Government.  If I were making an Order under Section 8, Section 11 having been applied, and if I found that the local authority was <Col N="627" /> not treating the officer as well as I thought he should be treated, I would confer with the Minister for Local Government with a view to his using his powers under that sub-section (6) to revise the superannuation granted by the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If things worked out exactly as the Minister says, there would be no amendment down.  If the existing laws were administered in the spirit which the Minister outlined, there would be no amendment down and no objection to the section.  These paragraphs in the Local Government Act are permissive paragraphs.  They depend on the sanction of the Minister. In practice, how do they work out?  It may not be known to the Minister, except in his capacity as a man in the street, that the two-thirds figure is a maximum and that, time and again, public boards have begged to have years added to an official's service so as to bring him near the two-thirds.  In no case that I am aware of has sanction for that been granted.  The Minister's interpretation would satisfy the House, but he points out that it is another Department which will deal with the officer when the question of pension arises. Two-thirds is the maximum pension and, to get the two-thirds, one must have the maximum service&mdash;40 years. That is how the Local Government Act is administered.  I invite the Minister to get in touch with his colleague and ascertain if there is one case since the passing of that Act where as many as seven years have been added.  I venture to say&mdash;I am not standing pat on this&mdash;that not a single officer has got the two-thirds pension since the passing of that Act who had not the full 40 years' service. If we pass this section without amendment and the Minister washes his hands of responsibility because another Department deals with pension questions, then we are taking an undue risk with regard to the future of certain officers who may have given excellent service.  It has to be remembered that precedents have a certain amount of importance.  The only precedent that has been pointed out to us in this <Col N="628" /> Bill, and its first cousin, the Vocational Education Bill, is the precedent of the Act of 1932.  There are other precedents, and other precedents that were fairer to the person deprived of office.  It was the established custom in this country that, where a man was deprived of office for reasons other than misconduct, etc., where the terms of his contract were interfered with by legislation so that he could not reach the full pensionable service, very special and very generous provisions were made.  In this case, these men are being lumped together and brought under the terms of the Local Government Act and it is being laid down that they must go at 65.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I may, be wrong, but I am assuming it is 65, irrespective of their physical fitness, mental alertness and suitability.  When these men joined the service there was no such telescoping condition.  They may have joined at the age of 40 and, if they were reasonably fit and reasonably youthful, they had an estimated service of 30 years and could reckon their minimum rights as being 30-sixtieths. Now they are pushed out at 65 and it is reasonable that some compensatory provision should be made for the interference with contract.  There is no argument about the conditions under which they joined when they took up service, which were that their payment would be so much and that they could serve until they were incapable of carrying out their duties, through physical or mental incapacity.  Now the conditions of service are being worsened and the length of service is being shortened, so some special provision should be made in such cases.  As I said on the other Bill, a man is as old as his arteries: some men of 65 are as youthful and efficient in every way as other men of 50; some men reach 70 and are as fit as any of us, either as teachers or anything else.</P>

      <P>In the case of a secretary of a committee of agriculture <Col N="629" /> who has been working for a number of years with the Department before being transferred to the committee, apparently he must go out at 65, as that will be the reckoned age. I would like to know whether the number of years he worked for the Department before he was appointed as an officer of the committee will be counted when he is qualifying for his pension.  If that is not done there will be a definite hardship.  The man who has worked for 15 years with the Department and becomes an officer of one of these committees must retire at 65, before he has 25 years' service there to enable him to qualify for the full pension.  Under the Bill, I am afraid he will get no recognition at all for his service with the Department. He may have worked for 50 years between the committee and the Department of Agriculture, without qualifying for the maximum pension. Would the Minister add a certain number of years to the service in such a case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <P>I think some special provision is necessary to cover this case and that what Deputy O'Higgins has said represents the facts so far as any application for added service to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is concerned.  Any Deputy with experience of serving on a local authority and dealing with applications for pensions by servants of that authority, knows that where representations were made to the local authority and they added service, it was not sanctioned.  I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that the precedent is established there and that if it is left simply to the section in the Local Government Act which the Minister has read out, it will be governed by that and the precedent already established there will be applicable in those cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister probably knows that there are particular men who first of all went to the College of Science, 30 or 40 years ago, before they were 21 and had a good deal of practical experience in farming before being taken on.  In fact, the older men in the service of local authorities at present who <Col N="630" /> went to the College of Science at 21 started out with several years' experience over the officers in other positions under local authorities.  I know a case similar to that mentioned by Deputy Donnellan, where a man was in a temporary capacity under the Department of Agriculture for four or five years and then got a permanent appointment under a local authority. That man next year would have 35 years' service.  He will be 65 years of age and, if 65 is the age fixed by the Minister, that man will have to resign next year.  He is mentally as active as ever and is quite as capable as ever to advise the farmers, though he is not able to ride a bicycle as he could 20 or 30 years ago.  He is still short five or six years of the 40 years' maximum service, so he will be £55 short of his maximum pension.  That would more than pay his rent and is a serious matter for him.  He never anticipated that he would get a knock like this, as he is quite capable of going on for another four or five years.  I hope that the Minister will ensure in this Bill that men who have given good service for many years and whose services have been appreciated by the farming community will get proper compensation. Every farmer who has been associated with them will be more than anxious to see that they get ample compensation for the services rendered over that period.</P>
    <P>Everyone would be sorry to see them dealt with harshly, and there is a danger of men in that position being harshly treated if special provision is not made to ensure that they will be protected and that service will be added in these cases where they are compelled to resign and where a contract that was duly entered into and executed is to be determined by the action of this House.</P>

      <P>No employee, official or otherwise, of the committees of agriculture has applied to me or, to my knowledge, to any member of my Party, to look after his interests in this case.  It is entirely on the merits of Sections 8, 9, 10 and 11 that we are putting up this case.  We let Sections 8, 9 and 10 go through.  We <Col N="631" /> said we would concede to the Minister the right to fix the retiring age.  We conceded the Minister's right to fix the standard of efficiency, but in connection with the fixation of years there is unquestionably an interference with the original terms of appointment.  If we were told it would be 70 years, there might be some grounds for it, because we have that age laid down in certain Acts for certain people.  In Section 8 (4) it is stated that certain sections of an Act will apply and a person will be deemed &ldquo;to have become incapable of discharging the duties of the office&rdquo;. An official may be quite capable, but yet he is put out at a certain age&mdash;the Minister can fix it at 60 years or 70 years; there is no question of interfering with his prerogative.</P>
      <P>The question of putting out an official, whether or not he is capable of discharging his duties, has been raised. Our contention is that while you have a perfect right to discharge an official under a regulation, nevertheless, that official should not lose the rights he had prior to the making of this regulation. It is not a concession; it is simply seeking what is due.  In Section 9 there is the phrase &ldquo;or is otherwise unfit to hold such office&rdquo;.  The same thing applies there with regard to the right of this person.  What the Minister has told us with regard to the Act of 1925 has been dealt with by Deputy O'Higgins.  The almost invariable rule with regard to superannuation in recent years is simply to give the number of years service&mdash;no addition.</P>
      <P>I can quite see the Minister's difficulty in a case of this sort in having a different code for officials of the Department of Agriculture.  But he is bringing in a new law and is interfering with the rights that were there, and it is not unreasonable to suggest that in those cases the persons concerned should not be placed in a less favourable position for superannuation purposes than they were before these changes take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In all these cases where we discuss retiral ages we must take cognisance of the interim period <Col N="632" /> between the passing of an old age and the coming into being of a new age in relation to these offices.  We on this side of the House are in favour of a retiral age.  We do not want officials to remain in harness until they drop dead, but we want proper safeguards. We consider it correct and reasonable that a man, after performing services for the State, should be relieved of his office under certain conditions and with proper safeguards as to his pension. We do not want officers to remain in their positions so long that they act as a detriment to the younger men of the best type entering the service with prospects of promotion. We do not want it to be held that these older men are barring their way. Under the new order, if this measure comes into operation, the young men will understand quite well that a retiring age has been fixed.  They will understand the age limits&mdash;it may be 65 or some age around that period&mdash;but they will understand when they enter the service at what period they are expected to retire.  That is a correct procedure and we have nothing against it.</P>
      <P>In regard to the older officers, who represent a generation that is dying out, there should be a temporary measure.  Perhaps we could have an emergency Order, if we cannot have it under the Bill; perhaps we could have some temporary measure which will safeguard the rights of the older men, in many cases the pioneers of the service, without invalidating the prospects of promotion of the younger men coming in under the new order.  We want to hold a fair balance between the older and the younger men, and it is for that reason that we support the idea that steps should be taken to add years to the service of the older officers in order to enable them to qualify for the maximum pension.  This practice of added years has already been in force.  It is laid down, as I said on another Bill, in a circular from the Department of Local Government.  I quoted that circular, which gives permission to add years.  There is no case made out why this principle should be dropped now, why it should not be put into force uniformly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> It has been held that the intention of the Bill is to bring the conditions of serving officers into a general line with the conditions of service of local government officers.  If that is so, this circular of the Local Government Department, No. G. 15411&mdash;25, should operate in this instance as well and, in justice to the older officers going out, and as an encouragement to the new officers who will know their positions will be safeguarded, the Minister ought to make some provision under the Bill or, by a regulation of the Department, to permit added years to be taken into consideration when the older officers are going out on pension.</P>

      <P>With regard to what Deputy O'Higgins said, I believe it is the practice of local authorities to work on the basis of one-sixtieth for each year of service.  I am not sure if it is the intention to make that the established practice, but there is no doubt under the Act that the local authority or the Minister&mdash;in fact, the Minister in spite of the local authority&mdash;may give two-thirds if the person has 25 years' service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>Under sub-section (2), if an official is removed for a reason other than misconduct or incapacity&mdash; that is, if he is removed under the Order that will be made by me&mdash;and if he has ten years' service, he would be entitled to a pension of two-thirds of the salary he had going out.  That would be very generous.  I think we are all agreed on that.  It appears that the House is generally agreed that the fixing of a retiring age is a reasonable thing to do, provided we safeguard the interests of those who have acted up to this without any age limit being prescribed.  I did ask for a return from the county committees of agriculture.  I do not want to go into minute particulars because if I were to do so it would only identify people.  There are, however, three officers who are over 70 years of age. They are employed on outdoor work. They are doing their work efficiently, <Col N="634" /> considering their age, but the position is that they are supposed to do a good mileage every day on a bicycle.  It would hardly be fair to expect them to do as much as a young person, if put in their place, could.  One of these officers is 71, another is 73, and a third is 75.</P>
      <P>There is, therefore, a necessity to make some Order.  If a person is under 55, when coming in he will have at least ten years' service on reaching 65, if we assume that the age is going to be 65.  Even if people came in at the very advanced age of 55, things could be made right for them under the present law.  There is no doubt about that.  In regard to what Deputy Donnellan said, I do not know of any case where officers went from the Department to the county committees.  There are, of course, many cases of the reverse kind, of officers coming from the county committees to the Department.</P>

As I have said, the law is quite all right, but I admit what Deputy O'Higgins has said, that it is permissive both for the local authority and the Minister.  I did mention the matter to the Minister for Local Government.  I do not say that I got any particular undertaking from him.  I may discuss the matter further with him between now and Report Stage.  Deputies will agree that, as regards these financial matters, superannuation and so on, the county council must have the last word.  Therefore, the Minister for Local Government is as much concerned as I am in cases <Col N="635" /> of superannuation.  It would be very improper for me to put a section into this Bill without having the agreement of the Minister for Local Government who has to deal with the county council which, after all, is the rate-raising body.  It is the body which is primarily concerned with financial provisions of this kind.</P>

      <P>I may say that I have been very much impressed by the Minister's manner in dealing with this.  I think that, as far as he is concerned, he is anxious to do the right thing towards these officers.  It is true that it is laid down in the other Bill that the officers concerned can receive two-thirds of a pension, provided that their office is terminated for other reasons than incapacity.  In fact, what is the justification for an age limit? No Minister would be justified in arbitrarily fixing an age limit for compulsory retirement unless he defended that age-fixing by saying &ldquo;incapacity&rdquo;. If the matter is left open as it is now, we must regard it that compulsory retiral at the age of 65 is because of incapacity. That would make it impossible for an officer to get the generous terms outlined.  Will the Minister, on Report Stage, bring in an amendment laying it down that a compulsory retiring age, as defined, will not be regarded as being due to incapacity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the views expressed by Deputies, I am still of the opinion that it is desirable to leave the Bill as it is.  A number of Deputies asked that the children's allowance payable under the Bill should be given to the mother instead of to the father.  Some did so on the grounds that, in certain cases, the father might not be a person who could be trusted to expend the allowance for the benefit of the family. Others did so on the basis of some general social theory extending from the desire to enhance the position of women in the community, and the rather revolutionary view expressed by some other Deputies who, apparently, regard it as a first step towards the economic independence of married women.</P>
      <P>I prefer to deal with it as a practical proposition, and as a practical proposition the provisions in the Bill are best &mdash;that the allowance should be paid to the father unless there is good reason for not paying it to him, or unless the father arranges that it should be paid to the mother or other member of the family.  I think it would be undesirable to start an innovation in social practice in the case of a Bill of this kind. In the majority of cases the father, who is at present maintaining the family, and has full responsibility for their maintenance, will use the added income resulting from this allowance for the benefit of the family in accordance with his own judgement.  As a general rule, I should like to have it established that we should interfere as little as possible with the management of an individual family.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (6) and to insert in lieu thereof the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person entitled to children's allowance shall get no more than that children's allowance during one week provided that the person so entitled has cashed each preceding cheque for children's allowance, but in case and only in case children's allowance payments to which such person is entitled have not been so cashed it shall be lawful to draw 12 such payments to which such person <Col N="639" /> is entitled and no more.  This sub-section is without prejudice to the condition that a person shall not be entitled to the payment of more than one children's allowance during any one week.</P>
    <P>This amendment is not elegantly drawn but it is designed to ensure that, in the event of a person not drawing a children's allowance any week or allowing two weeks' allowance, or any number up to 12 weeks, to go uncashed, the person would be entitled to draw them.  Sub-section (6) reads:</P>
    <P>A person shall not be entitled to payment of more than one children's allowance during any one week.</P>
    <P>That is open to two interpretations, (1) that a person could only draw a single allowance in any one week and (2) that in the event of a person being indisposed or forgetful about drawing an allowance, or wishing to draw five or six weeks' allowance together, it is not possible for that person to draw more than one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the wording of the amendment could be improved and I propose on the Report Stage to change the word &ldquo;during&rdquo; to &ldquo;in respect of.&rdquo;  It is intended that a person shall not be entitled to draw more than one allowance in respect of any one week.  This is a sort of omnibus provision to prevent persons from drawing double what they are entitled to and to meet a possibility which might conceivably arise by persons removing from one area to another.  If a person changes from one area to another he can continue to draw upon the book that he has until that book is exhausted and then he will draw for the balance of the period from a special book issued to him to bring him into line with the other people residing in that area.  Circumstances might arise under which a person would get entitlement to draw an allowance in the area to which he has removed as well as in the area he has left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have tried to prevent a case of that kind occurring by covering the <Col N="640" /> transfer from one area to another.  We think it safer to have an omnibus clause of this kind providing that a person will not be entitled to two allowances in respect of one week.  As I said, I intend to change that word &ldquo;during&rdquo; to &ldquo;in respect of&rdquo;.  In practice, as Section 18 provides, a person can draw up to three months' allowances in one week.  He can accumulate his allowances for three months and then draw the whole lot.  I think that meets Deputy Cosgrave's point, and I will bring in that amendment on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Will this sub-section prevent a person from drawing two allowances?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are provisions governing that.  A lot will depend on the circumstances of the case.  The allowance will continue to be paid to the person who takes charge of the children, but, presumably, in such circumstances there will be an adjustment of the conditions in respect of the families.  We will have to try to deal with this by a general provision. That is provided for in the appropriate section.  Deputies must not think of two allowances as being allowances in respect of two children.  We mean the total sum payable to a household no matter what the number of children may be.  What we want to provide by this is that a person will not be paid twice what he should get.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Surely there is something in Deputy Cogan's point, if the children of deceased parents are transferred to another person already in receipt of a children's allowance.  The children's allowance, I take it, covers all the children in one family.  But, if the children of deceased parents are transferred to that other person, there will then in fact be two children's allowances legally coming into that house, one for the original family and one for the family of the deceased parents.  Will this sub-section prevent that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The children's allowance is the sum total to which the family is entitled, no matter how many children there are.  We provide in Section 33, sub-section (4) for the circumstances referred to by Deputy Cogan, where a person entitled to draw an allowance dies.  In such circumstances, the allowance will continue to be payable to the person who takes charge of the children.  I want to mention sub-section (3) so that I will be entitled to move an amendment on the Report Stage.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney raised a question on the Second Reading on sub-section (3) as to the definition of maintenance. On examination, I think there is a point in Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's remarks and that the terms of sub-section (3) as a whole will have to be re-cast to avoid the possibility of confusion to which he referred.  I, therefore, propose on the Report Stage to bring in an amendment to re-cast sub-section (3) of this section to meet the definition point of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney on the Second Reading.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The whole principle of the Bill, I suggest, is really enshrined in Section 3, and I take it that in discussing <Col N="642" /> the section one can advert to the general structure of the Bill and the principle which is running through this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Which I think is the principle of the whole Bill.  I want again to make an effort to enlist the sympathy of the Minister for certain people who will be excluded from the provisions of the section.  I want to come back to the anomaly which is created by this section, whereby it is possible for a person in receipt of, say, £10 a week, with a family of five children, three under 16, one 16 and one 17, to receive a children's allowance of 2/6 per week, and not to have to subject himself to any rake-off in respect of income-tax.  I want to contrast that position with the position which arises in respect of lowly-paid workers, and, in particular, in respect of agricultural labourers.  Under this Bill at present, as I said, it is possible for a person with £10 a week and three children under 16 to get an allowance. But it is also possible, through the incidence of the ages of the children, that an agricultural worker in receipt of 36/- a week, with five children, two under 16, one 16, and two over 16, will get no allowance.  I suggest that a section which is drawn in such a way as to exclude a lowly-paid agricultural worker, or any other lowly-paid worker, from any benefit, deserves consideration by this House and reconsideration by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, of course, it will be said that that in effect is looking for a means test.  I suggest the section itself is, in fact, imposing a means test, through the incidence of the ages of the children, on a number of lowly-paid workers whom, I think, all Parties in this House would desire to help.  I think if the Government had referred the question of the introduction of children's allowances or family allowances to an all-Party committee, it might have been possible to have done a number of things in connection with the introduction of such a scheme in this State.  We might, on mature <Col N="643" /> consideration, have been able to devise machinery whereby a children's allowances scheme could go hand in hand with a scheme for raising the school-leaving age to 15 or 16 years, and machinery whereby a family would get certain compensation because of the fact that their children were compelled to remain at school until 16 years of age instead of, as at present, being permitted to leave at 14 years of age, when in fact they are not properly educated.</P>
    <P>But, apart from the possible advantages&mdash;and I think they are widespread &mdash;of utilising a Children's Allowance Bill for a purpose of that kind, a purpose which, I suggest, would assist enormously in raising the intellectual standard of our people, we could even in other directions have carried out certain useful reforms, if we had broadened the basis of this Bill and used it for a purpose other than the mere granting of children's allowances, no matter what the circumstances of the family were.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best to make the words fit the thoughts, but I suggest, Sir, that on Section 3 which, as I say, contains the principle of the whole Bill, we are, because of the manner in which the section is drawn, deliberately excluding from participation and benefit large numbers of lowly-paid workers.  I have instanced already the case of agricultural workers and I want to plead with the Minister, even at this stage, to give careful consideration to the section as it is drawn in the hope that the Minister may see his way to devise machinery whereby, if, under Section 3, he is going to permit persons such as I have quoted with, say, £10 per week and five children, to get an allowance of 2/6 per week, he will not, merely by the incidence of the ages of the children, deprive agricultural workers and other lowly paid workers from getting at least the same benefit as the more highly paid person.</P>
      <P>I know, of course, it will be suggested that that is a means test.  To some extent it might be said it is a means test, but I will put it to the Minister that he is imposing a much more rigorous means test by the way in which the section is drawn inasmuch as he is depriving the lowly-paid worker, such as the agricultural worker, from getting benefits under this section although he warned us on Second Reading to remember that, if this Bill is passed in its present form, £2,250,000 will have to be raised by taxation and, as an instance of the widespread character of the taxation to be raised, he mentioned that it would necessitate increased taxes on sugar, I think on tea, on beer and tobacco and increased income tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, Sir, that I am not out of order if I cannot find words to use other than those which were used on the Second Stage.  I think again I am entitled to argue on the section that the Minister is drawing the section too tightly, and I think I am entitled to plead with him to amend it on Report Stage.  That is what I am endeavouring to do by pointing out the blemishes in Section 3 of the Bill as it stands.  As I said, I welcome the principle of this Bill.  I hope to see it extended in due course, but I think there will be a very violent reaction when this Bill is law when it is discovered that an agricultural worker with, as I said, five children of the ages I have indicated, has to pay increased taxes on tobacco, beer, sugar and tea&mdash;if the Government decides to resort to those methods of taxation to finance this Bill&mdash;and here is the irony of the whole thing&mdash;that he will have to pay these increased taxes in order that the person with £10 per week will get 2/6 per week, while he will get nothing at all.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that it is unfair if it works out that way and my fear is that it will work out that way. It is because of that that I think the Minister ought to put on his thinking cap in the next fortnight and come in here on Report Stage and tell us that, having reconsidered the matter, he recognises that if children's allowances are to be paid in the State there is a good case&mdash;I may be expressing a personal view on this matter&mdash;for making sure that these allowances are paid especially to persons who have low wages, in order to help to raise their standard of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Allen should not come to Dublin unless he is prepared to discuss things in Dublin.  This is a deliberative assembly where we are supposed to discuss these matters.  I want to put this consideration to the Minister: There may be a widow with, say, four children, two of whom are under 16 years, one 16 and one 17. That poor widow may to-day be living on a non-contributory rate of widows' and orphans' pension.  That rate, in an urban area, will give her 8/- a week. One would imagine that the State in introducing a Children's Allowances Bill would aim at ensuring that the poor unfortunate widow living on 8/- per week, non-contributory widows' pension, would get something under the Bill.  She has no bread-winner and she has to support four children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill&mdash;believe it or not&mdash; that unfortunate widow will not get even a halfpenny, whereas, as I have pointed out before, the man with a salary of £10 a week is entitled to get an allowance of 2/6.  I hold that these are anomalies and defects in the Bill which we ought to endeavour to repair while there is time to do so, even though we are welcoming the introduction of a scheme of children's allowances. Accordingly, I appeal to the Minister not to force this Bill through the House with this very serious blemish upon it.  I would suggest that even if it meant the hanging-up of the Bill for a certain time, it would be better to do so than to deprive a widow, in the circumstances that I have outlined, from getting children's allowances.  I think, at any rate, that the Bill should not be passed while <Col N="647" /> there is this serious blemish upon it.  Deputy Allen says that there is no means test applied, but is there not a means test applied in the case to which I have referred?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say, Sir, that this is the kind of speech that Deputy Norton will make at cross-roads throughout the country to people who have never read the Bill?  It would appear to me that Deputy Norton himself has not read the Bill, in view of his remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, with regard to speeches at the cross-roads, I do not know that there is any more competent assessor of their value, who could advise me on the matter, than the Minister himself, who has made more cross-road speeches of a corkscrew character than any other member of this House.</P>

      <P>The Minister's crossroad speeches are public property now. Fortunately, they are on record on that paper which has as its motto &ldquo;Truth in the news,&rdquo; and he can scarcely deny the accuracy of statements made in that paper.  However, I want to come back to the provisions of Section 3, instead of talking about cross-road speeches made by the Minister or anybody else.  I want to put it to the Minister that it might be <Col N="648" /> worth while to delay the passage of this Bill until he has a better opportunity of going into all the circumstances that are involved in connection with Section 3.  I think it would be better to leave the matter over until these anomalies that occur under Section 3 can be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy point out what are the anomalies in this connection? It appears to me that the Deputy is suggesting that every family which fails to qualify for children's allowances will be that of a poor widow with four or five children, and that every family that will succeed in getting children's allowances will be that of a family with an income of, say, £1,000 per year.  As I understand it, that is the case that is being put forward by the Deputy.  He apparently thinks that it will be always the poor family that will fail in making a claim for children's allowances, and that it will always be the rich family which will succeed in getting these allowances. I have pointed out already that there is no means test in this Bill, and that the only thing taken into account is the number of children in the family. Whether it is the case of a poor woman or a millionaire, the allowance will be paid on the same basis.  Is that clear to the Deputy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, clear, and daft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the illustration the Deputy gave, of a widow with four children, two of whom are under 16, and the other two are 16 or 17 years of age, as compared with a man with a salary of £1,000 a year getting a family allowance of 5/- a week, because he had two qualified children, is that the blemish that the Deputy is talking about?  If so I can tell him that it does not exist. He may suggest raising the age to 18, but the same kind of thing could happen then also.  If that were done, would not the Deputy come in here and raise the question of extending the age limit still further?  We are proposing here to place this scheme on the basis of the number of children in a family, <Col N="649" /> under 16 years of age, irrespective of means, and the only qualification we make is in regard to the number of children in a family, with the exception of the first two.  The Deputy suggests making the qualification 18 years of age, so long as there are children, in excess of the first two, under 16.  So far as I can determine, however, the adoption of that suggestion would increase the cost of the Bill by something over £500,000.  I should say that if we were prepared to increase the already considerable cost of this Bill by another £500,000 I would prefer to do that by increasing the amount than by raising the age limit.  What we want to do is to increase the income in the case of the larger families.  I tried to stress that point when speaking on the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The main justification for this Bill, and for the imposition of further taxation on the community as a whole, is the fact that need can exist even in the case of families where the bread-winner of the family is employed at what might be called a standard wage in his ordinary occupation.  A person, of course, can be in need because of unemployment, old age, or ill-health, but it must be remembered that people who are in receipt of normal wages can also be in need because of the size of their families, and the purpose behind the introduction of this Bill is to help such families.  The only qualification is that the family must be a large one, with more than two children under 16 years of age, and there is no means test involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever condition may be imposed with regard to the family of an agricultural labourer, that condition is also imposed in regard to the families of other people.  The only exception is in the case of people who belong to the income-tax paying classes, and we are endeavouring to see that there will be no additional advantage in the case of such people, by taking back a corresponding amount under an adjustment of the income-tax code.  So far as this Bill will increase family incomes, it will affect, generally, people who are not in the income-tax paying class and who have <Col N="650" /> not got large families&mdash;that is, families consisting of a large number of children under 16 years of age than the first two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Sir, that this is a proper time for me to mention a difficulty that I have in mind.  Take the case of a poor woman, with four children, let us say, living in a tenement room in the City of Dublin, and who, for the sake of her health, is compelled to send two of her children to live with a relative, such as a married sister.  Is there any provision under the Bill to deal with such a case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (3) of this section defines the circumstances which must be complied with in such a case, but, as I have already informed Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, there will be a further amendment with regard to this matter.  I can say, however, that if the child concerned resides with the person&mdash;a relative, such as a married sister, which the Deputy has suggested, and who is the head of the household, that relative will be entitled to claim the allowance. Actually, there is no condition of parentage or relationship necessary to qualify in such cases.  What is necessary is that the child should reside in the family in respect of which children's allowances are claimed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, with regard to the question of need, every Deputy here, I am sure, knows that there is need in the case of the families of agricultural labourers, and, particularly, in the case of the family of a widow in receipt of a non-contributory pension, or that of a serving soldier who has only the Service allowance. A case was made the other night for serving soldiers.  I say that such cases are entitled to consideration.  It could happen that if there was need in the homes of these three classes mentioned, that they could be left out, while they will have to pay their share of taxation on tobacco, sugar and tea.</P>
      <P>The whole idea of the Government should be to help those in need.  I am satisfied that that is the idea but, in certain cases, there will be hardship, and for that reason I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the matter.  I pointed out on the Second Reading that unless there is consideration given to the second child in the classes mentioned the Bill will not help the most needy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations that will be made under this Bill are more important than the Bill itself.  We have it from the Minister and from other Deputies that some people who should benefit are not very well qualified to do so.  This paragraph reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  A child shall be deemed to be maintained by a person if&mdash;(i) the child lives with, and is in the custody, care and control of, that person, or ....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That must be read in conjunction with another paragraph which requires the Minister to prescribe regulations as to the manner and times at which children's allowances are to be paid. I should like to know if these regulations will be published or laid on the Table on &ldquo;the appointed day.&rdquo; These regulations are of importance to people who may change from one region to another, and who may not be able to fill in the necessary forms. I suggest to the Minister that a simplified form is necessary in respect of such changes.  It is evident that people will change from towns to the cities and from the cities to the towns and for that reason the necessary forms should be simplified.  I ask the Minister to consider whether these <Col N="654" /> regulations could not be published and made available before &ldquo;the appointed day&rdquo; and, if necessary, amended.  There is another important section which prescribes that a person who qualifies must be an Irish citizen, and must have been for two years immediately preceding the qualifying date resident in the State.  There are 100,000 of our people in England and we must assume that some of them will marry English girls.  Take a case where a man serving in a foreign army is killed, leaving a widow and children. The widow may not be an Irish citizen, and would not have been two years resident in this State.  Would it not be a hardship on the widow if she returned to this country with the children, not to be entitled to the allowance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is wrong there, and that the law is that the wife secures the nationality of the husband, unless she elected not to do so.</P>

      <P>If that is made clear I am satisfied.  If a woman marries an Irish citizen, and if that Irish citizen dies, if the widow returns to this country will she be entitled to the benefit set out in the Bill?  I want to be clear about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We inserted this qualification that the person must be an Irish citizen or resident here for some time, because it is necessary for the purposes of this Bill that there should be some stability about the family.  What we want to ensure is that these children's allowances are paid to families which are in fact permanently resident here, and this is an effort to exclude people who are merely in transit from one country to another or are here for a temporary period only.  With regard to the other point raised by Deputy Hogan, concerning the regulations, let me say to the Dáil, that the Department of Industry and Commerce and I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, have no concern other than the concern which other Deputies have, or should have, that is, to ensure that everybody will get the allowance whom the Bill contemplates should get it and that nobody will get the allowance who is not qualified to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole purpose of the regulations should be directed towards that end, that everybody who is entitled to the allowance will get it, and that nobody will get it who is not entitled to it. If the Dáil wants power of control over the regulations, that will slow down considerably the process of implementing it.  I can understand the feeling which Deputies have that all regulations, even quite simple regulations, such as the form of the voucher <Col N="656" /> or the manner of posting it, should be submitted here for consideration; but it is a feeling which, if put into effect, is going to make the whole machinery of the Bill much more cumbersome, and which will slow down its operation.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, judging from experience, that many of the regulations will be amended in detail before they get into final form.  No doubt, it will have to be a piecemeal procedure and they will have to be made known to the public, but I think it is undesirable that they should be subject to the usual procedure which gives to the Dáil a period of time within which it can effect amendment.  Clearly, if that procedure is adopted, action on the regulations cannot be taken until the period has passed because one can never say beforehand that amendment by the Dáil will not be made.  In so far as a Bill of this kind prescribes general principles which everybody wants to get into operation, these regulations which relate to minor matters should be left to the discretion of the administrators so that they can be brought into operation quickly.  If, at any time, a Deputy feels that there is a public grievance created by the application of these regulations, he is entitled to raise the matter by motion or in the usual form on the Estimate for that particular service.</P>
    <P>May I say in relation to the points raised generally, that whatever other form of need exists, the only kind of need we are trying to eliminate by this Bill is the need created in large families due to the size of the family and the inadequacy of the standard income to provide for them, whether derived from a standard wage or from an average farm.  Let me explain that in the case of the widow, to which particular reference was made, the position of a widow with a family of more than average size, a family of three children, in the borough areas after this Bill is passed, will be such that she will be drawing from public funds 25/- per week: that is to say, she will be receiving <Col N="657" /> that amount under the Widows and Orphans Act, under this Act and under the food voucher scheme.  The unemployed man with a wife and three children will, after this Bill is passed, draw 31/10 from public funds.  These are fairly generous allowances.  I will admit that in present circumstances, with present prices, the allowances do not represent the same purchasing power as in normal times, but on the basis of the standards to which we were accustomed in this country in normal times, it cannot be contended, having regard to the resources available, that they are ungenerous allowances. No doubt there will be other cases of want arising from time to time.  No matter what legislation we enact, no matter how hard we work in the Dáil, other problems will arise in future and will be there for somebody else to adjust.  We cannot hope to create perfection in our time but we are trying in this Bill to provide for one of the most pressing needs.  We are trying to eliminate one cause of want, one cause of need, that which arises in larger families in an economic system based on standard wages.  That is the purpose of the Bill and we should not try to extend its scope to do more than to achieve that end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a statement which I think is far removed from fact, that the purpose and the effect of the Bill are to secure an increase in the income for large families. I do not think that the Bill does that, no matter how the Minister may enshroud himself in make-believe.  As far as this Bill is concerned, three children are considered as constituting the family entitled to an allowance.  You have got the case of a bank manager with three children.</P>

      <P>The company, Cumann Naisiúnta Cuireadorachta agus Tionnsgal (The National Agricultural and Industrial Development Association), being a body of the kind referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 20 of the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908, was, on the 17th January, 1931, granted a licence by the Minister for Industry and Commerce enabling it to be registered with limited liability without the addition of the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; to its name.  As a condition of the granting of the licence the memorandum of the association was required to contain a clause that no alteration should be made in the articles of association without the previous approval of the Minister.  On the 16th May, 1938, there was submitted to me by the association a special resolution, duly passed and confirmed in accordance with Section 69 of the Companies (Consolidation) <Col N="532" /> Act, 1908.  This resolution embodied proposed alterations in the association's articles, which are, it is assumed, the changes to which the Deputy refers.  My approval of the proposed alterations was necessary only because the licence under Section 20 was subject to the condition contained in clause 5 of the memorandum. Being satisfied that the changes proposed in the articles did not in any way affect the conditions under which the licence had been granted, I duly approved thereof.  My powers to inquire into the affairs of a limited company are defined in Section 109 of the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908, but the requirements of that section would have to be satisfied before I could consider any question of intervention.</P>
