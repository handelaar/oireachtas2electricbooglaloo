      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that amongst the decisions reached at the recent Moscow Conference (October 19th&mdash;October 30th) and which have been published in an official document on 1st November, was one which, <i>inter alia</i>, provided that there would be established, at the earliest possible moment, a general international organisation based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving States and open to membership by all such States, large or small, for the maintenance of international peace and security; and if he will state whether he has made diplomatic inquiries in this matter with a view to ensuring that Éire will have representation in this proposed organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the declaration of the conference recognising the necessity of establishng at the earliest practicable date such a general international organisation based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving States and open to membership by all such States, large or small.  When the course of events allows such an organisation to come into being there need be no doubt that this country will, as in the past, be prepared to take its full share in endeavouring to secure international peace and security.  The inquiries suggested by the Deputy would, however, appear to be premature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that this year a considerable amount of potatoes, corn and hay was lost owing to the flooding of the River Moy; and that this flooding could be remedied by the blasting of a bed of rock at Mountfalcon, Ballina, which would lower the level of the river four to six feet, and thereby drain acres of land and save a lot of necessary food; and, if so, if he will take steps to have this work carried out without delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the possible benefits that might result from the removal of the rock <Col N="1683" /> shoal referred to by the Deputy was investigated by the Commissioners of Public Works, and I am advised that no substantial improvement in conditions in the River Moy area could be effected except by the execution of a large scale arterial drainage scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the farmers are discouraged by losses year after year due to the flooding of this particular area, and would it not be possible for him, pending the coming into being of the arterial drainage scheme, to apply some remedy, thereby encouraging the farmers to increase food production and also giving them a safeguard that their labour will not be in vain and that their crops will not be swept away by the flood, which, I am sure, the Parliamentary Secretary is fully aware of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that this area has been inspected as a result of petitions received under the 1925 Drainage Act and we have been advised by the engineers who have examined the place, as I have informed the Deputy.  It is not possible to deal in a piecemeal fashion with such problems as arise in this and other areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. A. Fogarty Mr. A. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will see that a quantity of Irish coal is made available to small millers for the purpose of grinding corn this season, as turf and firewood are not suitable for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in reply to <Col N="1684" /> a similar question on the 27th October I am advised that, in so far as the small millers are concerned, kiln drying of grain before processing is unnecessary, except in the case of oats intended for conversion into oatmeal for human consumption.  I will be prepared to entertain applications for permits to purchase coal for the latter purpose from corn millers in the scheduled turf area but only if it can be satisfactorily established that the use of turf is impracticable.  In the present difficult situation, in respect of coal supplies, permits to purchase coal cannot be granted to millers whose kilns are suitable for the use of turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be correct to say that a very large establishment in Dublin is closing down and that their workers are going to be let off this week owing to lack of coal?  I am referring to Messrs. Jameson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if he is satisfied, particularly in view of the wet season which has passed, that a considerable amount of farmers' wheat which is being sent to small mills for grinding into flour for the farmers own use is not going bad because it is impossible to dry it with the fuel which they have at their disposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It need not go bad.  It could be allowed to go bad by careless handling.  It is not necessary that it should go bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Minister's reply, it was that it is unnecessary to dry wheat before being processed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary to kiln-dry it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>What sort of drying could it get other than kiln drying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Wheat was air-dried in this country for thousands of years very successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, in these mills they have to take in a considerable amount of wheat, more than they are able to <Col N="1685" /> grind at the particular time, and unless they can dry it satisfactorily on the kiln that wheat will go bad, particularly this year when there is such a high percentage of moisture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister further aware that his Department have informed millers that the other satisfactory way of kiln drying it is by burning oats hulls, and will he say from whom he got that information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>From a number of millers who are doing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and by using a mixture of oats hulls and turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that the average moisture content is about 19 per cent., and that for milling wheat into flour it must be 16 per cent and under it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want Deputies to get the impression that I am refusing coal to millers because I want to force them to use some other form of fuel.  The reason is that we have not got the coal.  Our stocks are inadequate to meet all our essential requirements, and any industrialists who can use any other fuel must do so in order to keep the available supplies for those who cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will take the necessary steps to have the kerosene ration for 1944 allocated for the 1st September instead of the 1st October, as October is rather late for its distribution to farmers in the country who are finding it difficult to do their work without some means of lighting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not yet in a position to say what supplies of kerosene may be available for distribution in 1944, and cannot, accordingly, give any indication of the arrangements that may be possible for the distribution of kerosene for domestic use in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the inconvenience caused to farmers who live in rural areas and who depend on this ration of kerosene, particularly in the month of September, which is the harvesting month, when they have to remain in the fields very late in the evening and have to do inside work of great importance when they return to their homes, looking after cattle and pigs?  The housewife has to cook meals and bake bread, and various other things.  I would like the Minister to explain how that is to be done in the dark of the night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the inconvenience caused by the scarcity of kerosene, but I know of no method of distributing kerosene which we have not got.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state what is the reason for the delay in the distribution of the kerosene ration allocated for the 1st October in a number of areas in South Mayo; and if he is aware that <Col N="1687" /> the delay has caused a lot of inconvenience to the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was some delay in the distribution of kerosene in most parts of the country in October, owing to transport difficulties.  Every effort is being made to minimise such delays, but they cannot always be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. D. Spring Mr. D. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that small concerns such as dressmakers, tailors, shoemakers, harnessmakers, etc., in the provincial towns and villages are unable to carry on their business at night owing to the inadequacy of the present kerosene allowance, and whether, in view of the importance to the rural community of the work of these establishments, he will make available to them a special issue of kerosene during the winter months to enable them to carry on their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have accorded the fullest consideration to the question of kerosene requirements for the lighting of workshops of the kinds mentioned by the Deputy, and I regret that, owing to the very limited quantities of the oil available, no special allowance can at present be made for such purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is now in a position to state when a scheme of control for footwear will be put into operation by his Department so that shopkeepers <Col N="1688" /> in Enniscorthy, County Wexford, will get a reasonable supply of strong nailed boots for agricultural workers, and if he is aware that at present not a single pair of heavy nailed boots can be purchased in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that a general scheme of control for the production of footwear will come into operation early in the new year.  One of the main objects of this scheme will be to increase the supply of agricultural boots.  I cannot, however, guarantee any considerable supplies of agricultural boots of the nailed type since hobnails have all to be imported and supplies of them are very short at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a substantial number of clogs being made, but the difficulty in producing clogs arises out of the scarcity of the wire required for the wiring of the clog soles to the uppers.

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that buyers of scrap-iron in country districts, particularly in County Wexford, are considerably handicapped in getting around to collect supplies; and whether, in the interests of local foundries and in view of the national importance of the work, he will grant petrol supply to persons engaged in the business of buying scrap-iron.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that buyers of scrap-iron in County Wexford or other country districts are handicapped in getting around to collect supplies to a greater extent than other commercial interests who normally used road transport in the course of their business and who cannot now, because of the supply position, secure their normal requirements of petrol.  Limited provision has been made for the collection of scrap-iron. Owing to the petrol supply position, it is not possible to increase the facilities at present allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that it would be important to allow a petrol ration to those people who go around to collect scrap iron? If the supplies are not available, local foundries will be closed down.  It is not possible to carry more than half a ton by horse and car.  Small light lorries would be able to do much more.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £913,210 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1944, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Oifig an Aire Puist agus Telegrafa (45 and 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 and 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; Na hAchtanna Telegrafa, 1863 go 1928; Uimh.  14 de 1940 (Ailt 30 agus 31); Uimh.  14 de 1942 (Alt. 23); etc.), agus Seirbhísí áirithe eile atá fé riaradh na hOifige sin.</P>
      <P>That a sum, not exceeding £913,210, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1944, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 and 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 and 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1928; No. 14 of 1940 (Secs. 30 and 31); No. 14 of 1942 (Sec. 23); etc.), and of certain other services administered by that Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated Post Office expenditure for 1943/44 amounts to a total of £2,732,210, representing a net increase of £87,069 on the provision for 1942/43. The gross increase amounts to £134,613, of which £84,793 is due to emergency bonus payments.  The balance, £49,820, is attributable mainly to extra staff provision necessitated by growth of work and substitution of officers on loan to other Departments and on military service; to provision for an extra week's pay (53 pay days in the current year); staff incremental increases: additional payments to contractors for conveyance of mails by road; higher payments to other administrations in respect of air mail correspondence for countries abroad; increased cost in respect of manufacture of stamps, losses by default, etc.; higher provision <Col N="1701" /> in respect of superannuation allowances, etc., etc.  Offsetting the increases there are reductions amounting to £38,536, resulting principally from savings through retirements; reduced expenditure on purchases of stores and uniforms by reason of supply difficulties; greater relief from telephone capital: reduced travelling by engineering officers owing to restrictions caused by emergency conditions, etc.  These reductions, combined with a higher credit (£9,008) in respect of Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;mainly under sub-heads T (5) and T (12)&mdash;make the estimated net increase in expenditure £87,069.</P>
    <P>The financial position of the three main Post Office services&mdash;Postal, Telegraph and Telephone&mdash;on a commercial basis showed a decided improvement at the end of the financial year, 1941-42 (the last year for which commercial accounts are available), as compared with that at the corresponding period of the preceding year.  On the 31st March, 1941, the net deficit on the three services amounted to a total of £155,070, the postal services showing a deficit of £115,257, the telegraphs a deficit of £130,203, and the telephones a surplus of £90,390.  On the 31st March, 1942, the situation had improved as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Postal Service&mdash;Revenue, £1,818,311; expenditure, £1,726,845; surplus, £91,466.  Telegraph Service&mdash;Revenue, £227,194; expenditure, £342,767; deficit, £115,573.  Telephone Service&mdash; Revenue, £753,429; expenditure, £573,264; surplus, £180,165.</P>
    <P>That is to say, the deficit of £155,070 at the end of the financial year 1941, had, at the end of the following year, been converted into a surplus of £156,058.  During 1941-42 revenue on a commercial account basis improved by £386,000.  Of this amount £243,000 approximately, was attributable to the increased postage rates introduced in June, 1941; £38,000 and £105,000 to the greater use of the telegraph and telephone services, respectively, as a result of emergency conditions. Expenditure during 1941-42 increased by £74,800, due to augmented <Col N="1702" /> staff costs; exceptional purchases of stores; additional cost of conveying mails; increased cost of maintenance of the telegraph and telephone systems, etc.  The net result for the year was, as I have indicated, a favourable balance of £156,058.</P>
    <P>For the last financial year&mdash;1942-43&mdash; true revenue, that is actual cash receipts, is estimated at £2,425,000, an increase of £110,000 on the actual revenue for the previous year.  Telegraph and telephone receipts are up by approximately £48,000 and £123,000, respectively, while postal receipts show a drop of approximately £61,000.  So far as can be judged at present revenue during 1943-44 is likely to reach the existing level, but the position in this respect will, of course, be influenced by the nature and extent of any further emergency developments affecting general business activities that may take place.</P>
    <P>Mail services by rail are still on the restricted scale introduced in October, 1941, as a result of the coal situation, although the trains on the whole are now adhering more closely to scheduled running.  The position of the road motor services has, however, altered as a consequence of the acute petrol shortage, which has necessitated large scale conversions to horse transport, with resultant disimprovement in deliveries and despatches in many areas. The matter is, of course, one which is not within the power of the Department to control, and the alternative services which have been arranged are the best that are reasonably practicable.</P>
    <P>The external mail services remain generally unchanged.  The use of air mails to Europe and America for both private and commercial correspondence is growing: the traffic despatched now amounts to approximately 600,000 items a year.  The outgoing airgraph service introduced in March last is being extensively used.</P>
    <P>The telegraph service continues to benefit from emergency traffic, the loss of £115,573 at the end of March, 1942, having fallen to about £73,000 at the corresponding period this year. <Col N="1703" /> Delivered messages during 1942 showed an enormous increase.  As I have, however, said on previous occasions I can see no prospect of any permanent improvement in the financial condition of the telegraphs and, when emergency factors disappear, the normal tendency of the service to decline owing to the growing development of the telephones will, I fear, almost inevitably again manifest itself.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the telephone service which I commented on last year continues and will doubtless continue while the emergency lasts.  Every added limitation of ordinary public facilities&mdash;transport, fuel, supplies, etc. &mdash;seems, by reason, no doubt, of the upset to normal activities, to react immediately on the telephones.  During 1942 local calls totalled 38,550,000, an increase of 1,673,000 on the previous year.  Trunk calls reached 5,500,000, an increase of 534,000.  The increase in the trunk traffic was mainly on internal calls, i.e., calls wholly within Eire.  The continued growth of trunk traffic has naturally affected in some degree the standard of the service, particularly at peak hours.  All possible measures are, however, taken to keep delay to a minimum, but the position is obviously one for which there is no complete remedy.  The difficulties in regard to supplies of engineering construction stores render it quite impossible in present circumstances to provide sufficient additional circuits to cater fully for the increased traffic, even if this traffic were of a normal character instead of being, as it is, largely emergency and non-permanent.</P>
    <P>With the object of improving the position as far as reasonably possible it has been decided, in the interests of telephone users generally, to impose a restriction of duration to six minutes on trunk calls during the busy traffic hours.  In order, however, to minimise inconvenience, operators are given discretion, on request being made, to extend duration on very important calls, but this discretion must, of necessity, be sparingly exercised.  The restriction is not imposed at all during normally slack traffic hours.  I am satisfied that this restriction of duration, <Col N="1704" /> which has been in operation for some months past, so far from causing any general inconvenience tends to facilitate the general public.</P>
    <P>The standard of the local service generally is good.  In Dublin the increased traffic lias unfortunately caused some deterioration in the speed of answering from &ldquo;0,&rdquo;&ldquo;30&rdquo; and &ldquo;31.&rdquo; Everything practicable is done by generous staffing provision to ensure a uniformly satisfactory standard of service, but delay is at times unavoidable, especially at heavy traffic periods, owing to the inability of the equipment to carry the abnormal load. Additional equipment cannot be provided in Crown Alley Exchange, but such difficulties as exist will, it is hoped, disappear when the new exchange in Exchequer Street is opened early next year.</P>
    <P>The standard of answering from telegrams (&ldquo;39&rdquo;) is now, on the whole, very good.  The total number of subscribers' circuits at the end of 1942 was 30,293, an increase of 1,189 on the previous year.  The total number of telephones in use was 48,822, an increase of 1,507.  The number of automatic telephones in the Dublin and Dun Laoghaire areas is 27,109, an increase of 937.  There are now 842 exchanges and 1,503 call offices, including 152 street kiosks.</P>
    <P>For some time past the shortage of engineering stores, to which I have already referred, has necessitated restrictions on the provision of new exchange lines, involving a considerable amount of construction work, particularly in rural areas, and on the provision of extension circuits, bells, etc. As a result of the continued worsening of the supply position, it recently became necessary to extend this restrictive policy and to limit the provision of additional subscribers' lines generally. In giving effect to what is an unavoidable decision, however, everything possible is being done to meet the requirements of essential services &mdash;doctors, hospitals, etc.&mdash;and of emergency services.  In connection with the supply question generally, I may say that, although a considerable reserve of engineering stores&mdash;wire, cable, <Col N="1705" /> etc.&mdash;had been built up prior to the emergency, this reserve is now, mainly owing to the requirements of the emergency services, practically exhausted, and cannot be replaced.  It is necessary, of course, to maintain a minimum reserve for further emergency needs, and this cannot be drawn upon for ordinary requirements.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the adverse position in regard to renewals of supplies of engineering stores, I am glad to say that during the past year it was found possible to keep employment in engineering grades at the same level as during the previous year and every hope is entertained that during the coming year it will be practicable to find work for all existing regular full-time staff. This result has been achieved largely by using again materials that in normal times would have been scrapped, and by adopting methods which, while needing more labour for their execution than the normal standard methods, have enabled considerable economies to be effected in the use of new stores.  Thus, by their resourcefulness in using scrap material, our engineering staff have succeeded in retaining in employment many men who would otherwise have been left unemployed and have thereby done a real national service.  This was in very thorough pursuance of Government policy.</P>
    <P>The heavy pressure experienced in the stores branch in 1940 and 1941, as a result of emergency conditions, continued during 1942 and there seems to-be little prospect of any appreciable easement so long as the emergency lasts.  The difficulties of procuring supplies of articles which must be imported, or for which the raw materials must be imported, have been continuously increasing, according as the control by the British authorities on all forms of industry in Great Britain has become more rigid.  There are now few, if any, industrial products which may be exported from Great Britain without licence and the problem of meeting the stores requirements of the public service here is, accordingly, becoming extremely acute in many respects.</P>
    <P>The total value of contracts placed <Col N="1706" /> by the stores branch during 1942 amounted to £1,624,580, which represents a falling off of about 15 per cent.  on the figures for the previous year, due to the difficulties of the supply position.  In some instances, where quotations were received from firms in Great Britain, they contained so many qualifications and restrictions that contracts could not be placed.  The question of obtaining from America supplies of goods unobtainable from Great Britain was considered but, owing to export restrictions in the United States, no useful results accrued.</P>
    <P>Of the total contract expenditure, £1,309,460, or 80 per cent., was in respect of articles manufactured or assembled in Eire.</P>
    <P>The stores branch, too, deserves very special commendation for the energy shown in finding Irish materials and workmanship in substitution for importations from outside the country.  This is work to which the Government attaches considerable importance.</P>
    <P>The destruction of the Post Office factory by fire on the morning of the 4th November, 1942, resulted in the cessation, pending replacement of plant and machinery, of the manufacture of special items of stores for the Department and of many articles required for defence services.  The loss sustained was considerable, the main building having been completely burnt out, with its plant, equipment, stocks of materials and stores, testing apparatus, as well as a large number of telephone switchboards in process of manufacture.</P>
    <P>The problem of re-establishing the factory was energetically taken in hand and it was decided, as a provisional measure, to utilise an adapted warehouse of concrete construction, located in the vicinity of the destroyed building. The stores ordinarily held in the warehouse have been removed to temporary premises elsewhere in the city. Special efforts to procure machines and machine tools in replacement of those destroyed have, notwithstanding the serious difficulties of the times, met with a considerable measure of success. A certain amount of reconditioning of damaged machines has also been found practicable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1707" /> Notwithstanding the practical cessation of the operations of the factory, it is a matter for satisfaction that only two of the male workers had to be discharged as a result of the fire.  The others were retained on salvaging and reconditioning of plant, tools and stores, or on such repair work as did not require the use of machinery, or on work in other branches of the Department.  In the case of the female workers it was, I regret, necessary to pay off 27 out of 35, but a large number of those discharged were merely temporary and would have had to go, in any event, on the completion of the particular job on which they were engaged.  Eight have since been taken on again, making a total of 16 females now in employment.</P>
    <P>I am unable to say when the main operations of the factory are likely to be resumed&mdash;hardly, in any event, earlier than April next.  The difficulties in existing circumstances are obviously considerable.  The matter is, however, receiving very special attention and nothing that is feasible will be left undone to hasten complete restoration.</P>
    <P>The structural alterations necessary for the improvement of the district office at James's Street, Dublin, have been completed.  Other building works of a major character, which would ordinarily be now in progress, cannot on account of shortage of materials, be proceeded with until emergency conditions have come to an end.</P>
    <P>The position of the Savings Bank shows continued improvement.  The number of depositors increased by 35,600 during 1942.  The ordinary deposits for the year amounted to £5,037,600, and the withdrawals to £2,280,300, these figures being greater than the figures for the preceding year by £1,391,000 and £115,400, respectively. The net increase in the balance remaining invested at the close of 1942 was £2,757,300, exclusive of interest earned during the year, which amounted to approximately £380,800.</P>
    <P>In addition to the ordinary deposits, a sum of £686,970 was deposited, by way of investment, in respect of moneys received by the Minister for Finance <Col N="1708" /> for the credit of Trustee Savings Banks under Section 31 of the Finance Act, 1940, bringing the total so invested since the 21st November, 1940, up to £1,311,620.  Of this amount, £31,400 was withdrawn by the banks during the period, leaving the net amount invested at the end of 1942, £1,280,220.  The interest credited to the banks in respect of the investments amounted to approximately £33,300.</P>
    <P>In concluding this statement, I wish to express my appreciation of the efficiency with which the staffs of all grades performed their various duties during the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a few questions. There is an item&mdash;&ldquo;Purchase of Sites, £1,350&rdquo;&mdash;for 1943-44 and 1942-43.  Is this the hoary-headed St. Andrew Street site?  If so, it has been on for a great many years.  The next point is about the conveyance of mails.  I see that the Minister is using the railway, the road, the air and the sea. That is as it should be, but I would like to know if he is envisaging the fact that, after the emergency period, extensive alterations probably will be necessary.  Are there any long-term contracts being entered into for the conveyance of mails, or are they all short-term contracts that can be switched over to the most suitable means of transport?  The Minister has told us that he has switched over, in a lot of cases, to horse-drawn vehicles. The Government are pressing ordinary private traders to use producer gas vehicles, and I do not know if the Minister has any rooted objection to that form of transport.  Perhaps he will tell us why what is sauce for the goose should not be sauce for the gander?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a brief reference to the Post Office Savings Bank.  I have always held that the Post Office ought to give as good service as is given in the ordinary banks and, although the Minister sees difficulties, I do not see why emergency sums cannot be made available, or why the Minister should not try to be as good as his competitors. That is always one of the things that enter into Government <Col N="1709" /> trading&mdash;they seem to think that they can trade only on the terms that they lay down.  In spite of the increase that the Minister indicated in the deposits, I suggest that he would get a better sum of money deposited in the savings bank if he gave the service that the public would like to get from him.</P>
    <P>The next thing to which I would like to refer is the telephone book. We all know there is a shortage of paper and the Post Office very properly tried to cut down the number of books.  I do not know how long the printing, binding and distribution of the telephone book takes&mdash;perhaps the Minister will give us that information&mdash;but between the time the telephone book goes to press and is distributed there must be a substantial number of telephone subscribers enrolled. Would it be possible, as is done in other countries, to attach a fly-leaf setting out the subscribers&mdash;and their numbers&mdash;who have installed telephones in the period to which I have alluded?  Would that be at all feasible?</P>
    <P>Let me now draw the Minister's attention to post office windows.  If you look at a post office window you will observe that it has a distinctive appearance in the sense that there is nothing in it.  Apparently, the Post Office authorities have nothing to buy and nothing to sell.  If the Minister were an ordinary trader and went round the post offices with the eye of a resourceful merchant who is trying to dispose of his wares, the first thing he would do would be to put those wares in his shop window.  The Minister will probably tell me he has nothing to sell.  I suggest he should get samples of the different orders and forms handed out or sold in the post office and display them in the window. I do not see why the appearance could not be given of a post office anxious to do business.  Whatever forms there are should be displayed in the windows.  People requiring money orders or postal orders could study the regulations relating to the purchase of those orders before they go into the office, just in the same way as people, before making a purchase in a trader's establishment, would inspect what he <Col N="1710" /> had in the shop window.  I suggest the Minister could brighten up the post office by displaying his wares in that way and he would remove some of the congestion that often takes place inside the post office by enabling the public to make up their minds what forms they wanted without having to go to the trouble of asking the assistants.  He would avoid much of the inconvenience caused by people finding that they had got the wrong forms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made reference to the very considerable development in the telephone service, and to the enormous increase in local and trunk calls.  I should like to direct his attention to one very unsatisfactory aspect of the telephone service.  I refer to the difficulty of getting calls to places such as Newbridge, Naas, the Curragh Camp, Kilcullen, or&mdash;to take another direction&mdash;Balbriggan.  It is well known that in these areas, which are now military centres, the existing lines are choked.  I do not want to go into the technical aspect, to tell the Minister what the remedy is&mdash;his advisers will give him all the necessary information in that regard&mdash;but, at least, he ought to take some of these places off the dial &ldquo;O&rdquo; position and put them on the ordinary trunk call basis.  If he does that he will relieve the pressure on the dial &ldquo;O&rdquo; position, and in that way obviate the considerable delay which now occurs in connection with telephone calls to these areas.  Recently I had occasion to make a telephone call to Kildare town. I waited for well over an hour, and still I was unable to get through. No purpose would be served by booking a call, because no person could guarantee putting the call through, the line was so clogged up. That is a most unsatisfactory position. I trust the Minister will investigate this matter.  I have heard widespread complaints about the abnormal delay in getting telephone calls through to these places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the state of affairs at the counters in the G.P.O.  I do not know if the Minister goes there, but I may <Col N="1711" /> tell him the position is decidedly unsatisfactory.  Any day one goes there one may see queues at the various counters.  These people naturally become irritated when they are held up for such a long time.  Anyone visiting the place can see it is hopelessly understaffed, that the staff is not sufficient for the volume of work transacted there.  The Minister should seriously consider this matter with a view to providing additional staff at the various counters and thus give the public a better service.  The present position is that a small staff endeavours to cope with a volume of work which is really beyond them, and the result is that many people get themselves involved in counter losses.  Under the Post Office regulations they are liable for the repayment of portion of these counter losses.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be much fairer, in order to help to avoid these counter losses, if he would provide a better service for the public by taking steps to increase the staff at the public counter, and thereby get over the difficulty to which I have adverted.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Estimate that there is provision for a reduction of approximately £12,300 for uniform clothing in respect of the year 1943-44.  I can quite understand certain difficulties arising out of the emergency, but I would like to call the Minister's attention to the very serious problem arising from the shortage of protective clothing, for postmen in all areas, and particularly in exposed areas, necessarily have to equip themselves with protective clothing over the winter period.  Some of these articles of clothing were originally intended to last about two years, but even those responsible for the manufacture of waterproof clothing will tell you that it is a tight fit to get an article of protective clothing, of waterproof material, to last two years if it is worn regularly during inclement weather.  Recently, the Post Office decided that these articles of protective clothing should last four years and not two years.  They might as well have said 44 years as four <Col N="1712" /> years because it is quite impossible for these articles of clothing to last a period of wear of four years.  Already, there are complaints from all parts of the country as regards the difficulty of procuring articles of protective clothing for the outdoor staff.  I know, of course, that some of these difficulties may be unavoidable.  I suggest, however, to the Minister that the issue is one that should be given immediate attention, and that some steps be taken through whatever medium is available to supplement the existing stocks, because unless the Minister can provide an adequate supply of protective clothing for use over the winter period, particularly for use in exposed areas, he is going to get a considerable volume of sickness on the part of the staff with a consequent impairment of the services.</P>
    <P>Some of the postmen concerned in this matter are obliged to cycle distances of 26 miles in a day.  If one contemplates postmen going out through some part of the County Clare, or the conditions to be experienced over a mountain road in the County of Waterford, and cycling a distance of 26 miles on a rainy day, he will get some picture of what these men have to do every day during their period of outdoor work over the whole winter.  One can see that such men not only need protective clothing, but need to have it renewed at sufficient intervals to ensure that it will stand the inclemency of the weather to which they are exposed.  Will the Minister give the House some assurance that, on this matter, the Post Office will be able to get back to the original periods of wear in respect of protective clothing? Otherwise, he is going to have to pay a very nice bill for sick leave, and, unfortunately, many of those who will be affected in that respect will not receive pay from the Post Office during their period of illness.  I trust, therefore, that the Minister will make a very special effort to concentrate attention on this matter because of its importance for all the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>In looking through the Estimate, and of the scales of pay, there is one anomaly that comes to my mind at <Col N="1713" /> once.  From the point of view of pay of Post Office officials, Deputies are aware that post offices are classified as 1, 2 and 3.  Dublin is a class 1 office. Recently Howth was incorporated in the City of Dublin, and is now for all purposes portion of the City of Dublin. When the incorporation took place the Department of Industry and Commerce immediately raised the rates of unemployment assistance benefit in Howth to the Dublin scale.  The Department of Local Government arid Public Health raised the rates of widows' and orphans' pensions' benefit in Howth to the Dublin scale, but the Post Office continues to pay its staffs in Howth on the class 3 scale, although Howth is now as much a part of the City of Dublin as O'Connell Street is. I think that is a very unfair attitude for the Post Office to adopt.  I do not think it can be justified, now that Howth, and some other places like it, have been incorporated in the Dublin area.  If the Department of Local Government and the Department of Industry and Commerce have recognised the necessity for making a change by adjusting the scales for which they have responsibility, then I think the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should make a similar change so far as the Post Office wage rates are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter, and that is the position of quite a substantial number of officers&mdash;temporary postmen they are called&mdash;who are employed on full-time duties.  Their position is that they have had their part-time duties expanded to full-time since 1939.  In the ordinary course of events, they would have been appointed as unestablished postmen, but the Post Office, fearing that some terrific catastrophe was going to overtake us during the emergency, would not appoint those people in an unestablished capacity.  If they were so appointed they would get an increment each year and sick pay when on sick leave.  The Post Office keeps them on as temporary postmen, gives them no increment whatever and no pay during illness.  The only purpose of that is to deprive those people of rights which, normally, would be conceded to them. <Col N="1714" /> We are now in the fifth year of the war, and it docs not look as if we are likely to be involved in the catastrophe that at one time was hazarded.  I think, therefore, that the Post Office might reasonably assume that just as we have got through the last five years without any of those catastrophes overwhelming us, we are also likely to get through the remaining years of the war without any of those evils which were contemplated being visited on the Post Office.  I would like if the Minister would examine the matter with a view to having those people graded as unestablished officers.  If he does that he will be doing what should normally happen and, at the same time, will be recognising the justice of the claim which those men have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters in connection with this service to which I desire to draw attention. In connection with this Estimate, one notices that it very rarely changes from year to year.  It does not show any sign of progress or advance.  The Minister told us to-day that such improvements as have taken place in the period under review&mdash;improvements financial or otherwise&mdash;were almost entirely due to emergency conditions. Will the Minister tell us what efforts, if any, are being made to improve the services?  Are we in this country to reconcile ourselves to the position that, so far as a great number of our citizens are concerned, they are only to have two or three deliveries per week, while other citizens, because they are more luckily located, are to have two or three services per day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton mentioned that on a recent occasion he had to wait over an hour for a telephone call from Dublin to Kildare.  An experience of that kind is so common down the country that we would not make any wonder of it at all.  As a matter of fact, it is a common thing to have to wait from one to three hours when making a trunk call down the country.  It is a usual scene to see a person who has to make a call kicking his heels in a post office from one to three hours. I have had experience of waiting two hours and ten minutes to make a call <Col N="1715" /> to a place only 24 miles distant.  I know parts of the country where if a letter is posted on Friday to a place not more than 20 miles distant, it will not be delivered until the following Wednesday.  Compared with other countries, our telephone service is very primitive, and there is no evidence, from the Minister's statement, that any attempt is being made to improve it.  The telephone service is one in which we should look for improvement and advancement.  The Minister may say, and with a good deal of justification, that it is not possible to do much during the emergency, but I will be anxious to hear if the Department is making any preparation for the post-war period, and whether plans are being thought out for the improvement of the telephone services. In many towns it is impossible to make or receive a telephone call after 7 p.m. Does the Minister think that that is giving service, or that he could pat himself on the back for having a surplus of £180,000, if the people are not getting the facilities to which they are entitled?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that he is doing his job merely by carrying on in the same old way that we have been carrying on for the past 20 years?  I have been listening to the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs for a good many years, and I must confess that I have never seen any change. One year after another it is the same old story that we had to-day.  People who only see a postman twice a week, and for whom the telephone is as far away as it was 30 or 40 years ago, see no evidence of any change.  I hope these matters will receive the immediate attention of the Department, and that they will be remedied as soon as possible&mdash;first of all, postal deliveries in rural areas, and secondly, the telephone service.  These services are unsatisfactory in rural parts.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister cannot contend that the telephone service is satisfactory if people have to wait from one to two hours for a trunk call to a point 30 miles distant.  There is obviously something wrong.  I admit that it is possible to get a call through from <Col N="1716" /> Dublin quickly, but in other places it takes from one to two hours to do so. I know nothing about the technical difficulties and I do not know if they can be remedied now.  I find it hard to believe that they cannot be remedied. It may not be possible to do much during the emergency, but I am satisfied that there could be an improvement in the service if the Minister set about it with the Department. Perhaps the Minister would tell us il any plans have been made for the improvement of the telephone and postal services in the post-war period. By improving these services and by providing for the people facilities which they do not now enjoy, much could be done to absorb some of the unemployed that we will have here when the war ends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to bring to the notice of the Minister the charges made for delivery of telegrams in rural areas.  It is time that the Department, or whoever is responsible, abolished the charges that are now made for the delivery of telegrams.  While that-may be a matter for the Minister for Finance, it should be the policy of the Minister in charge of Posts and Telegraphs to see that people living two, three or four miles from a post office, receive telegrams on the same terms as those living within a mile of it.  A charge of 3d. is made for delivery over one mile and, where people live from four to ten miles distant, it is most unfair to make them pay perhaps 2/- or 2/6 for delivery.  I consider that to be unjust, as citizens are entitled to equal facilities there is no reason why people who live in the country should be penalised to provide facilities for those living in towns.  I believe there is an absolute necessity to improve the telephone facilities.  I have had to wait from threequarters of an hour to an hour in order to make a trunk call. I do not know if the delay is due to the fact that the lines are overloaded. That seems to be the only explanation. The delays that occur are enough to cause heart disease to people waiting to make trunk calls.  Delays of that kind are worse than waiting for trains that do not arrive on time.  It is an old-standing grievance with people in <Col N="1717" /> rural areas to have to pay for delivery charges and I hope that the Minister will have the matter remedied during his term of office.</P>
      <P>The Post Office has been described as the Cinderella of the Departments. I do not believe that.  The remedies that I suggest may cost a couple of thousand pounds, but the money would be well spent if everybody could enjoy the facilities provided on the same terms.  In a case where a death occurs in a family, and where charges for delivery have to be paid on telegrams, the expense sometimes comes to a couple of pounds.  I hope that the telephone service will be linked up with villages along with the electricity supply that has been promised to rural areas.  It is absolutely necessary, if there is to be any development of the Post Office services, that the telephone system should be extended to areas which are at present ten, 15 and 20 miles away from the telephone.  I know that it will cost money and that it cannot be done during the war, but plans should be got ready for the providing of these facilities after the war.</P>
      <P>With regard to the one and two-day deliveries in some rural areas, I think that when the war is over, when men are healthy and money is plentiful, the Post Office should provide an every day delivery all over the country.  We have no objection to the towns having half a dozen deliveries a day, but the people who live in rural areas, and especially at present with transport difficulties as they are, are entitled to an every day delivery.  The position at present is that a letter posted in Dublin to-day may not reach a certain part of County Wexford until next Saturday.  That has been my experience. Only a fortnight ago, I posted a letter here in the House at four or five o'clock in the evening to a place where I know there is an every day delivery, and the letter did not reach that place until two days later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister some time ago about that matter, and about the necessity of having a collection at 8 p.m. in order to connect with the night mails going down the country.  That suggestion was accepted, but, whatever <Col N="1718" /> is wrong, it is not operating properly. Not alone should the Department provide a collection which will connect with the night mails going down the country in the Post Office in the House, but in post offices all over the city.  Under the present arrangement, a letter takes three days to reach its destination&mdash;if the post does not go to-night, it will not arrive down the country until Thursday.  In view of the emergency, and the small number of trains running, there should be more constant collections, especially in the city and town areas.  I stress again the position with regard to the charge for the delivery of telegrams in rural areas, and hope that the Minister will agree to abandon that charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the conditions affecting out-of-the-way rural areas like West Cork and, possibly, Kerry, where, along the seaboard, there are areas practically completely cut away from postal services.  Last week, a Deputy from my constituency asked a question with regard to postal facilities in West Cork.  I have received communications in that connection and have approached officials of the Department time and again with a view to ascertaining whether the position could be remedied.  It is very hard to find a remedy in the present condition of transport, but I still think that a lot could, and should, be done. I think it is possible to do it, even in existing circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a case in point, I may mention that a train leaves Cork at 5 o'clock in the morning, arriving at Skibbereen at 8 or 8.30 a.m.  There is no postal delivery from Skibbereen to the isolated areas in the west where business people living on the seaboard, working under difficulties with regard to securing provisions, and so on, would require a delivery of letters every day.  There is no telephone connection whatever and their only means of communication is a letter or telegram. Some means should be devised by the Minister to enable letters which arrive on that morning train to be delivered to that western seaboard.  I make this plea not alone for that particular <Col N="1719" /> area, but for other areas of the country, because I am certain that the position in other areas is similar. At present it is difficult for business people to get stocks of provisions and poor people who want to get their provisions find that when a shopkeeper gets a letter from his dealer in Cork and replies to it, there is no stuff available. I think the Minister should concentrate on areas like those and arrange for letters to be delivered.  I do not know if it would be difficult to provide a daily delivery, but I think it should be done.</P>
    <P>I dislike referring to isolated cases in particular areas, but I want to draw the Minister's attention to what recently occurred in my area, that is, the closing down of the mail car service from Clonakilty to Roscarbery. I do not know how long that mail car has been running, but it has been running since before I was born.  The mails came into Clonakilty each morning at 6.30 or 7 o'clock, and were then taken in the mail car for delivery to Roscarbery, a distance of eight miles. I understand that the reason for the closing down of that service is that the contractor who contracted to remove the mails to Roscarbery in the morning, and from Roscarbery in the evening, could not keep it going at the contract price.  He appealed to the Department for an increased price because the cost of the upkeep of the horse, car, harness, etc., was double what it was pre-war.  The reply of the Post Office, or the Minister, was to close down the service completely, instead of responding to his demand, and giving him a decent contract price. The position now is that the mails are taken from Clonakilty Junction on to Skibbereen, a distance of 20 miles further on from Roscarbery, arriving there at 8.30 or 9 o'clock, and the mails for Roscarbery brought back by bus the next morning, so that it is an &ldquo;all-round the world for fun&rdquo; business at the moment in that area.</P>
    <P>I make this special plea for Roscarbery, not because it is a very big or thriving place, but because an industry was developed there to a considerable extent&mdash;to an extent greater than any other place in County Cork and <Col N="1720" /> probably in Ireland.  I refer to the export of fowl&mdash;of chickens, turkeys and geese.  The people engaged in that industry had a very important and extensive cross-Channel connection before the war, and they have a very big connection still with other areas at home.  The Christmas season is at hand and how these people are to get their stuff away, I do not know.  The mails are brought in from Roscarbery by bicycle, but how is the young fellow who brings them in on a bicycle to bring in 20, 40 or a couple of hundred chickens or turkeys?  I should like to know what arrangement is being made to provide a service in that case.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Morrissey said, instead of the Department improving as it gets older, like good wine, it is deteriorating and the services disimproving, and cases such as those I have cited are proof of it.  I hope these matters will be remedied and remedied immediately, and that an effort will be made to provide a delivery of letters to these out of the way places.  Surely it is not because of the small cost involved in the appointment of an extra postman or two that the Post Office cannot find ways and means of improving the situation, in view of the present difficult transport conditions? I suggest that they should be able to do it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen spoke of the charge for the delivery of telegrams in rural areas. I am very keen on this question, and I think it most unfair that persons living further than a mile from the post office should be charged 3d. for every extra mile, while, within the mile area, there is a free delivery.  I believe this is a hardy annual on this Estimate. It has come up year after year but nothing has been done.  I hope that as a result of the appeal made to him by Deputy Allen, and which will possibly be made by other Deputies, a level charge will be made for telegrams. I do not see why you should fine or mulct a person because he lives in an out-of-the-way place.  Such a person is suffering enough at present. He does not know anything about the telephone.  He does know something about telegrams.  The telegram is his only way of sending news to his friends <Col N="1721" /> or sending an order for something, and it is unfair to make him pay extra for it.  I ask the Minister to consider these points and see if it is possible under existing conditions to have them remedied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that his approach to these Estimates is all wrong in principle.  In his suave, kindly way, speaking in a tone that was not heard except in certain portions of the House, he explained how happy he was because there was a certain margin of profit. Once you approach this problem of service from the point of view of profit, then it shows that you have got the ordinary shop-keeping type of mind.  I regretted to hear Deputy Dockrell talking about selling goods to the public in the way a shopkeeper would sell them.  I am sure the Minister sees the absurdity of that.  We do not want any of that type of business in a public service.  We do want, of course &mdash;I think it is a generous idea&mdash;to educate the public.  God knows, they want education, because though they might be going into the post office every day for years they will know as much at the beginning as at the end. We are out to educate the public, but the public should be out to educate themselves.  At the same time, we are out to give service to the public.  In what measures are we giving it?  We are giving it to those who will bring in a certain margin of profit to the service and we are ignoring those who would not return a margin of profit&mdash; they are not part of the body politic. Deputies on the Minister's side of the House as well as those on the other side are agreed that we are not giving service.  But we have a margin of profit of £180,000 or thereabouts.  It is a beautiful picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country we have people isolated in small communities and we have got, I suppose, the most crude and primitive form of communication by road, rail and sea of any country in the universe.  We are manufacturing nothing in connection with this particular service.  We do not even attempt to organise our own workshop. At the present moment, when we are <Col N="1722" /> going through a crisis, we have to sit down with our hands in our pockets waiting for somebody outside the State to provide us with the means of communication. Yet we have some of the best technicians in the world in this particular service.  In this matter of communicating through the air or by wire, we have some of the best technicians who know their business.  Yet we are waiting for somebody outside to tell us how to do it.  We cannot even cast a telephone stand.  We have to go to Sweden or the United States for what an ordinary boy in a technical school would be able to turn out.  We have no wire.  Of course we will never have any wire.  We will never have anything at all until we try to understand what we want from the technical point of view.  In the City of Dublin there are thousands of yards of wire suspended in the streets lying idle for the past five or six years.  Of course the Government would never think of taking control of that and running it through a machine.  It is some of the best copper wire that could be made.  Yet people operating in the black market can come to you and tell you: &ldquo;If you want an extension, we will do it for you at a price.' The black market agents are in Dublin at present advertising themselves and making connections, doing what the Post Office cannot do.  It is a peculiar thing that they can get wire.  I suggest that that is a line of thought which the Minister might apply his mind to.</P>
    <P>I want particularly to call attention to what has become one of the jokes of Dublin, and that is the telephone system for courting couples that has been arranged by the Minister, and which is carried on at a very low price. In Clones, I believe, they divide the sexes in their cinema, but the Minister goes out of his way to bring them together, and at a very cheap rate.  There is no time limit to the conversations which they can carry on on the telephone while the rest of the public can stand in queues outside the telephone box waiting for them to finish.  I suggest that it is not a very technical problem to cut off these conversations after a certain number of minutes. <Col N="1723" /> Sometimes you have to stand outside a telephone box for half an hour while some gentleman inside is telephoning to his young lady, or some young lady is communicating with some young gentleman.  I have waited outside a telephone box for 35 minutes while a university student was carrying on a conversation on the telephone with his dearly beloved.  I suppose he paid the usual twopence.  Surely, as in any other, country, they can be automatically cut off.  If they want to have another twopence worth of endearing talk they should pay another twopence. That would make them wake up to the fact that the public have some rights.</P>
    <P>Then half the telephone boxes in Dublin are out of order.  On one occasion I wanted to make a telephone call in Baggot Street to get a person removed to a hospital, but the telephone was broken.  I went on to Waterloo Road, but the telephone there was also broken.  Then I went to Ballsbridge, I put my 2d. in the box, and I got 10d. back.  It is the greatest joke in the world.  As to the rural areas, every village in Ireland ought to have a telephone box, as there is in the United States and Canada, where you have party wires. There is no difficulty in getting four or eight branches on a party wire.  I suggest to the Minister that he should send out engineers to inspect the call-boxes in the-Dublin area.</P>
    <P>As to communications, we have only a limited train service due to certain difficulties which we cannot get over. Why cannot we use an air service for the carriage of mails?  What would it cost?  There is a sum of £180,000 there. What about using it to purchase some machines and starting an air service? In Cork they have a municipal airport. Why not construct one in Waterford, Limerick and other places and have a service continually running?  We have some of the best air pilots in the world. Why not get them to fly light machines carrying mails?  What difficulty is there in doing it?  None whatever, only stupidity, and lack of initiative.  Look at the training it would be when you do develop that service, as you will have to develop it, because no nation <Col N="1724" /> is going to carry fast mail by rail or by water after the war.  I suggest that it would cost very little.  There are some machines available.  We have ten or 12 machines which came down by accident which could be turned into carriers of mails.  I think we have also one or two Douglas machines lying idle.  We have a very up-to-date group of men who are engaged in that particular activity.  Why not employ them by spending this £180,000?</P>
    <P>I also want to call attention to what is the most important factor&mdash;the people who carry on this service.  If there is a bunch of slaves in any country in the world, it is those who carry on the work under the Minister's directions both inside and outside the Post Office.  At present postmen have got a very important job.  Many of them are carrying around a lot of money; they are entrusted with very valuable property. What do they get by way of appreciation of their services?  As public servants they come under certain regulations.  But why should they be treated separately and distinctly from ordinary industrial workers? Surely, a postman in Dublin has as many calls upon him from a family point of view as a man working in the dockyard, or on a railway.  The Minister responsible for the control of the railways was good enough to make a generous gesture a week or two ago, and not only broke the law, but went out of his way to break the law, by giving labourers an increase of 5/- in their wages and a bonus of 8/-.  I want to thank him for it.  If that Department can do it, why cannot the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs return to these men some part of the money they have made by their services to the community?  Surely, they are entitled to some return.  Auxiliary postmen, and men on the staff, are not getting fair play.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether these men are not worthy of a measure of appreciation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton has made it clear that the contract of service with these men is being violated.  It was understood that they were to get overcoats every two years.  The Minister claims that he cannot get the cloth.  I admit that there is a certain amount of truth <Col N="1725" /> in that.  There is a limit to the amount of cloth available for this particular type of coat.  But if we cannot get one kind of cloth, we can get another.  If the ordinary commercial shops have the type of cloth required to protect these men, why cannot the Minister go in and seize that, in the interests of these servants of the State?  Is there anything more miserable for a man than to be wet for four or five hours? I understand some of these men still do a certain amount of sorting.  They go into a depôt where the temperature is probably 82 to 90 degrees and then go out into an atmosphere of 61 degrees.  The men are not getting the boots or the overcoats and oilskins to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>In connection with certain other public servants, the responsible Minister gave power to give money in lieu of clothing.  The Joint Board of Grangegorman gave the employees a certain amount of money to buy boots, when the board could not buy them. Why not do the same with the Post Office servants?  I bought a coat a few days ago.  If I can buy it, why cannot these men who are doing a more important job than I am also buy them? These men have to do long walks in the City of Dublin and, in the rural areas, they have to cycle perhaps 26 miles, badly clothed.  The Minister should have some sense of responsibility. It is not a question of the sick pay involved.  It is the question of men's health being broken and their families deprived of their services at too early an age as a result of lack of attention.  It is all very well for a smug supervising officer in a nicely furnished office.  When these matters come before him, he turns them down as not being within the regulations.  I remember one time going to a particular office to an officer who has since passed to his rest.  I was putting a certain case to him.  In his smug official way he jeered at the complaints of these under-paid men.  If I were an official of such a Department I would be only too eager to do everything possible to help and protect my fellow-workers who, although they would be getting less wages, would be doing more useful work.  I suggest to the Minister <Col N="1726" /> that that is a matter which requires attention.  The responsibility lies with you.  If you take £180,000 and measure it against men's health, I say you must take the responsibility for their lives and their health.  Look at it from that point of view.</P>

      <P>I did mention the Minister, with all due respect.  In any case, I will correct myself under your guidance. I suggest, through the Chair, that the Minister should accept his responsibility, and I think every member of the Government should take the same measure of responsibility, for the position that they are making a big profit at the expense of men's health. That is a position that does not commend itself to the people of this country.  They do not want a profit made at the expense of the lives of these men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether or not I can get information as to the number of additional officers employed in connection with the paying out of postal orders from a country adjacent to our own.  I am told that men engaged on this work are particularly harassed by the inflow at certain periods&mdash;the weekends&mdash;of very large amounts.  I do not think that section is adequately staffed and I suggest that additional staff should be engaged.  I understand that some £80,000 is cashed here between Friday and Monday.  I understand the officers get a certain amount of overtime but I do not think it is a question <Col N="1727" /> of overtime; it is a question of their health.  Like Deputy Norton, I do not know how these men stand the strain in the head office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, said he was an hour and a half in the post office, waiting to get a telegram through, and that he almost lost his temper.  It is interesting to find any member of the Fianna Fáil Party losing his temper.  They have nothing else to lose.  Why did he not ring the Minister and say: &ldquo;Look here, I am an hour and a half waiting here.  You are paying me at the rate of £10 a week and I am being held up and cannot do anything for it.  I suggest you get somebody in here to assist.&rdquo; Would not that be the practical thing to do?  Oh, no.  He will make his little demur to-day but when the Whip tells him to walk down the Lobby and to condone every offence of the Minister he will walk very quietly and very meekly, I suggest that he should walk into another Lobby.  I hope a vote is taken on this Estimate so that we may express our resentment at making £180,000 profit while not giving service to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDavidLooney" hpid="Mr. Looney Mr. Looney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Looney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to one important matter&mdash;that is, the great lack of telephone facilities for people who have been transferred to building schemes outside the city of Cork.  I have one particular place in mind at the moment, that is, Spangle Hill and Gurranebraher, in County Cork.  The scheme was finished two years ago, and there are about 2,000 inhabitants living two miles from the nearest telephone. I wish to draw the Minister's attention to his grave responsibility.  Very often it may be a matter of life and death to have telephone facilities.  The Minister will realise that speed is very important in getting an ambulance or doctor. These people have made application to the Cork County Council, and the Minister makes the excuse that he has not got the equipment.  I am thinking that provision should have been made, two or three years ago, to deal with this matter, and I hope that the Minister will give more consideration than, apparently, <Col N="1728" /> he has given, to dealing with this.  For instance, I should like to call to the Minister's attention that there is a sub-post office in Ringaskiddy, County Cork, in which there are no telephone facilities for the general public.  It is a seaside village, and the people concerned are at least three or four miles from the nearest telephone exchange.  I think that that is a terrible condition of affairs, and I hope that the Minister will take steps to give to-these people the facilities to which they are entitled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not take much time, as I do not wish to delay the House, but I should like to ask the Minister to see that some part of the £180,000 profit made by the Post Office should be devoted to helping out PostOffice workers who are struggling along on very small pay, and especially to those who, prior to the war, went out of the Post Office service on very small pensions.  As a result of the rise in the cost of living, these pensions give them very little upon which to exist. I think that, in view of the increased profits made by the Post Office, some of these profits should go to those who earned them.  We hear of men in the Post Office service drawing less than £3 a week.  Now, I only know of one body of men who are worse paid than they are, and that is the lock-keepers on the Grand Canal.  I appeal, therefore, to the Minister, to apply some of this profit of £180,000 for the benefit of those people who went out previous to the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where the profit, to which some Deputies have alluded, comes in, or to what purpose it has been applied, when we are asked to vote this sum.  The Minister, in presenting his Estimate, referred to the question of seconding officers of his Department to other Departments. Now, I take very strong exception to that practice, because I think that no businessman will agree to it.  Whatever costs are incurred in one Department ought to be properly accounted for in that Department, according to my belief, and I think that this practice of seconding officials from one Department to another, and putting <Col N="1729" /> down their salaries and expenses to the account of the former Department, is very misleading.  One can understand that, at the start of the emergency, certain officers or officials should be given on loan from one Department to the other, but three or four years have passed, and I do not think it is fair to this particular Department, with which we are now concerned, that the expenses incurred in paying the officers serving in another Department should be charged to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I really think that the Minister should bring that matter to the attention of the Government.  I feel that he should not stand for it, and that neither should the House stand for it.</P>
      <P>One thing that must be remembered is that, in connection with a neighbouring country, all moneys spent in connection with every Department have to be properly accounted for under the proper heading, and I do not think that the system we have been following in that regard, for the past three or four years, can be justified.  While a good deal of criticism that has been levelled at post office administration generally in this country, might be justified, one must bear in mind that we are living in a period of emergency; that there is difficulty in regard to shortages of supplies in regard to transport, and also other difficulties which are due to the emergency.  We must bow to these undoubted difficulties, but I am sure that the House has been pleased to be informed that there is likely to be a further development of the telephone service in this country. Of course, we are all aware that telephone service in this country, generally, is on a very much lower level than in other countries, and that an extension of that service would be a great asset to our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that was mentioned by Deputies in this connection&mdash;and I do not think it would hamper the activities of the Department to make such a provision&mdash;was the provision of telephone kiosks in the towns and villages of this country for the convenience of country people who want to get in touch, over the telephone, with their friends, after the ordinary hours.  I <Col N="1730" /> understand that these people find it impossible to do so now, because, according to my information, it is not permissible for the Civic Guards at present to book an originating call.  As I understand the situation, the Civic Guards can receive a call, originating somewhere else, but there is now a difficulty in originating a call from a Civic Guard station down the country. If that difficulty arises so far as the Department of Justice is concerned, then I think that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should make some arrangement, so far as is possible, for the provision of telephone kiosks in towns and villages throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have also heard complaints recently about the long delay in receiving trunk calls&mdash;particularly in the districts to which Deputy Norton has referred: that is, districts where the military are concentrated.  I may say that I have had experience of that myself.  It seems that the military get priority over other citizens in this question of making trunk calls.  Now, I do not think there is any justification at present in giving our Defence Forces priority over other citizens where the ordinary commercial transactions of the country are concerned. If we were in imminent danger, of course, one could quite understand that the military must get priority in the matter of telephonic or any other kind of communication, but it seems to me that the priority that is being given to the military at present can be, and is being, abused, and that the general public are suffering as a result.  Sometimes, a businessman has to wait patiently because a young fellow happens to be on the wire over a trivial matter&mdash;something in the nature of what Deputy Larkin has already described to the House.  I do not think that that is good enough, and I do not think that there should be any question of priority in the matter of such a service at the present time.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to say that, from my own experience, and from what I have heard from other people, it is much easier to book a trunk call from a private telephone than from a public post office.  According to what I hear&mdash;and, indeed, from <Col N="1731" /> my own experience&mdash;it takes much longer to get the reply from a trunk call made through a public call-office than from a call made from a private house.  That may seem to be rather peculiar, but experience has shown to me that that is the position, and I do not think that it should be so.  It would appear to me that, if any preferential treatment is to be given in this matter, it ought to be given to the ordinary people who have to go to the public call-office rather than to the private subscriber who can wait more conveniently in his own house for the call to come through.  I think that preference, if there is any, should be given to the person who has to travel four, five or six miles to the nearest village or town, and who then has to wait patiently for his call to come through.  I think that such a man has, at least, as just and equal a claim, at all events, as the private subscriber and, in my opinion, such a person ought to be given preferential treatment, because he may not be able to get the service he wants at the moment.  Now, the Minister knows that, as a result of the present lack of certain other facilities, due to the emergency, there has been a substantial increase in the demand for extra telephone services.  That, of course, is due to the fact that we have not, at the moment, the facilities for communication that we had before the emergency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin has referred to the party-wire system which we had in operation a few years ago to a very large extent.  It has been dropped. There was some objection to the system, apparently, because of the possibility of neighbours listening in to one's conversation.  It was, and is, I think, a very useful and cheap method of providing telephone facilities for people in country districts, especially to do business of a type about which they do not mind people hearing.  It was an advantage to men in the cattle trade, for instance, men anxious to arrange business matters quickly.  I do not know that it was wise to drop the system because it did give a cheap service <Col N="1732" /> and was a distinct advantage to people such as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to a number of districts in which the delivery of letters is very slow.  In some districts there are only two deliveries in the week.  This is a public service for which public moneys have to be voted and there is no reason why one district should get preferential treatment over another.</P>
    <P>It is not fair that people living in remote districts should be penalised because of their geographical position. I suppose it is true that there may not be the same urgency about the business of people living in these districts as about that of people living in the bigger towns and villages, but, nevertheless, some effort should be made to give them a better service, if possible, at the present time.  I do not want to be unreasonable in my criticism so far as delays in delivery are concerned, because I know that transport facilities are restricted, and that there is a very definite limitation to the mileage which can be covered, due to the acute shortage of petrol.  We have, I suppose, to be thankful for small mercies, and for the fact that delays are not more serious.  In conclusion, I would join with other Deputies in appealing to the Minister to endeavour to improve the telephone facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">

      <P>There are just a few matters to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  One is a matter to which Deputy Norton has already referred&mdash;namely, the question of the clogging of lines.  Deputy Norton referred in particular to Balbriggan, a town in which there are three or four fairly large industries.  As far as I am aware, there are only two direct lines to that town, and I have had experience of them in two capacities.  In one instance, very often we found ourselves in the position that both lines were being used by the military.  The result was that on a couple of occasions people attempting to do business were cut off in the middle of a trunk call&mdash; very often, because of the nature of their business, a trunk call from the other side.  I think the Minister should do something to try to increase the <Col N="1733" /> number of lines serving that town, because it is a town whose trade is dependent to a large extent on adequate telephone facilities.  Deputy Norton has mentioned the fact that the lines are clogged completely on occasions by the military.  I suggest that one line should be left all the time available for civilian use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Another matter that calls for attention is the question of an earlier delivery of letters to certain parts of County Dublin.  There are certain areas which are only six or eight miles from the city such as Castleknock, Templeogue, Clonsilla and similar places and the deliveries are just as late there as in remote country districts.  While in the case of remote country districts, lack of transport facilities may serve as an excuse, in the districts to which I refer a slight alteration in the time of delivery would make it far more convenient for business people and others who have to leave home at a certain hour in the morning to come in to town.  If they do not receive their letters before leaving home it is unlikely that they will get them until the next day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention may be the responsibility, in part at least, of his colleague the Minister for Agriculture, but it is of fairly recent occurrence.  I refer to the fact that parcels containing food, either tinned food or cooked food, which were posted for England were confiscated after a couple of days.  The particular case which I have in mind occurred in Dun Laoghaire and I can give the Minister the details should he require them. The individual concerned posted the parcel on Monday and on Friday received word that the parcel had been confiscated.  Not being aware of the existence of an Order prohibiting the posting of such food, this person made inquiry at the Post Office and was told that the Order prohibiting the export of such articles only came to the office on Wednesday.  So far as that individual is concerned the Order, therefore, had retrospective effect.  That is a <Col N="1734" /> thing that should not happen.  It may be that the Order was issued on that particular Monday&mdash;it was the 25th October&mdash;but so far as these individuals were concerned it had retrospective effect because they did not know of it nor did the people in the post office at which it was posted until after the article had been confiscated.  In certain cases these were registered parcels, so that the people concerned suffered a double loss.  They suffered the loss of the perishable goods which the parcels contained and also the loss of the registration fee.  I think the Minister should make inquiries and, if he likes, I will give him particulars of a case.  It may be unavoidable that the Order should have arrived late, but the people should not be placed at a loss.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to the question of clothing for postmen.  I know numerous cases where postmen have been part-time and are now whole-time and are still working in their own clothes.  In inclement weather this causes a certain amount of hardship and I am quite certain that, if the Minister looks into it, some provision could be made to lessen it.  I would be glad if he would look into these few points, particularly the clogging of lines by the military in the town mentioned, causing a certain amount of dislocation as far as commercial interests are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain references have been made to the lack of staff at the General Post Office and the general air almost of sleepiness which seems to pervade that building.  I am a very regular customer there and it seems to me that, instead of being regarded as a General Post Office, it could at times be regarded as a mausoleum for the statue of Cuchulainn which is so prominent on the main floor.  At times one might as well be in a mausoleum, for all the information or guidance one can get.  It is quite true that the General Post Office is understaffed: anyone attending there on Thursdays or Fridays would realise that.  There are long queues of women and children waiting to be paid money orders from England and one can realise that, not only is the place understaffed <Col N="1735" /> but the men must be driven almost to nervous prostration on account of the nervous strain.  Women, with hungry young children around them, are waiting there maybe up to an hour and that long endless queue is still going on.  It is quite correct that at times there has been a uniformed officer on the floor of the building to give information, but when one realises that within three or four weeks that floor will be a seething mass of human beings almost like cattle in pens, it is obvious that it is unthinkable to try to find a small-sized man in a dark uniform, even if one knew he was the sole source of information.  I was aware for many years that this man was placed there for the information of customers, but it was almost a physical impossibility to see him.</P>
      <P>In regard to getting any guidance from the single designations&mdash;postal orders, money orders, stamps, etc.&mdash;no one seems to realise that, added to those, the booths deal with an endless variety of services.  I remember going to get a dog licence.  It may be that I was stupid, but I thought that where stamps were issued would be the right place.  Instead of that, it was where postal orders are issued, and only after going around several booths did I finally discover the right place.  I was well able to put up with the delay and inconvenience.  I saw, however, one old woman trying to get a money order.  By mistake, she got into the queue for the postal orders.  The queue happened to be made up of ten or 12 people, and it took seven or eight minutes to get to the top of the queue.  When she reached the booth, of course, she was told that she was at the wrong booth and would have to go to the money order one.  Then she queued up in the queue of which I was a member.  It was made up of 12 or 15 people and after threequarters of an hour she finally reached the booth where the money orders were issued, to discover then that she could not get a money order until she had filled up a form.  She had to go back again to the table to obtain the form, fill it up and then tail on to the end of the queue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> It seems to me that to talk about service or the making of profit in the Post Office is largely inducing a degree of humour.  The Post Office is there neither to give service nor to make profit.  It would be very simple to put up, in the main entrance hallway to the G.P.O., a statement of the various counters and the various forms of service provided at each counter for the customers.  That would give, under the heading &ldquo;stamps&rdquo;, postal stamps, unemployment and national health stamps, the various prepaid stamped cards, etc.  Then a person would not have to wander round in a daze from booth to booth to find the particular service catered for at each booth.</P>
    <P>Secondly, at the booths themselves, surely there could be more information than the bare statement at present given.  There may be three or four different services provided at a particular booth.  It is not a question of extra expense but one of ordinary intelligence and, as I was reminded here, of courtesy.  The courtesy is there with the attendant behind the counter, but one cannot expect any attendant to be courteous when he has to deal with five or six times the normal number of people.  Anyone who knows the ordinary technique of an office knows that it is most tiring and nerve-racking to be turning continually from one job to another&mdash;issuing postal orders, dog licences, etc.&mdash;all the time passing back and forth and, in addition, the ever-present responsibility of keeping a check on money, in case one may be called to account at the end of the day.  When dealing with money and the public, the attendants have to be particularly careful.</P>
    <P>I suggest that these forms of information should be made available. It may be even worth the Minister's trouble to have a central information desk in the G.P.O.  There is a central desk there for writing telegrams but, as far as I can see, the only purpose for which it is used is that of writing letters, as you could never get near it to write a telegram.  It could easily be turned into a central information desk, with one or two people, not only to tell where the services are given at the counters but to advise the ordinary <Col N="1737" /> people on their particular postal problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin has told us that it is not the duty of the Post Office to educate the public, but the duty of the public to educate themselves.  I must be still uneducated in that regard, as I have been trying for several years, and am still in ignorance of some of the services&mdash;and I do not suppose I am any more stupid than the average member of the House.  It is quite true that the Post Office is not looking for customers.  They do not want to give service.  In regard to the ordinary postman, the ordinary man behind the counter and the ordinary temporary postman, they are in contact with the public and, so far as is within their small measure of liberty, they try to be courteous and to give service.  But those who sit behind desks and decide where men shall be put in a booth in the General Post Office and which booths should be empty, do not seem to have much consideration for the public.</P>
    <P>At times, you will see a booth open for service and then the curtains&mdash; with which everyone is familiar&mdash;are opened about six inches.  Hidden behind the curtains is the attendant. I do not know whether he is afraid of the public or not, but it would not be very much harm if the curtains were opened further to throw a little light on the proceedings.  It is very discouraging to persons who are not used to dealing with public officials, to find that the curtain is half drawn.  They are not quite sure whether or not to intrude upon the gentleman behind the counter, who is writing up some return or dealing with some other problem.  I have watched people standing for quite a while, hesitant to disturb the attendant, not knowing whether the booth was open for business or not.</P>
    <P>On the question of the delivery of mails by air, as the Minister for Defence is in the House now, it should be no harm to support the plea made here.  We have a number of aeroplanes in this country&mdash;I do not suppose I dare mention how many, or I may be brought before the Minister for Justice &mdash;and it is also true that officers who <Col N="1738" /> are designated as pilots have to perform a certain number of hours' duty in the air, in order to retain their wings.  Surely, there is no more valuable form of training for air navigation or night flying than the delivery of mails?  The backbone of many of the heavy bomber services now throughout the world was formed on the basis of civil transportation before the war, especially in America, where the famous epic stories of mail planes journeying through storms were utilised in the cinema for the entertainment of the public.  Nevertheless, they had a very strong basis in fact, in the sense that, if you have to keep to schedule, you find means and ways of doing it. Even if the mails were to be flown by aeroplane and dropped by parachute, where not practicable otherwise, it would be an additional service for the isolated country districts, and certainly would not interfere with the training of our Air Force, while it would put those aeroplanes to some useful purpose.</P>
    <P>Many country Deputies seem to be worried about telephones.  I do not make many trunk calls, but occasionally I find it necessary to make local calls.  It is quite true that practically every telephone&mdash;when one desires to use the telephone from the city to some outlying area&mdash;is occupied. There is also the fact that the outlying areas of large towns and cities &mdash;Deputy Looney referred to this matter also&mdash;are not adequately supplied with telephone booths.  Take Crumlin, as an example.  I do not believe there is a telephone booth included in the scheme there.  On occasions when people fall sick in an area such as Crumlin it may mean walking a mile or a mile and a half searching for a telephone.  Those people do not know where the nearest telephone may be, whether in a house or in a shop, and very often they have to travel to the other end of the area or go to the police barracks in order to use the telephone.</P>
    <P>If we can have five or six telephone booths around O'Connell Bridge to facilitate people anxious to carry on some polite conversation, surely we can erect at least one telephone which would be an actual necessity in some <Col N="1739" /> of the new housing areas.  In such places a telephone is sometimes an absolute necessity, when people rush out to summon medical aid and when, perhaps, it may be a matter of life or death.  If you go to the G.P.O., the very heart of the industry, and you want to make a local call, you may have to wait three-quarters of an hour in a small room where there are at least 20 telephones, before you can make your call.  I earnestly suggest that there should be greater facilities given to the people in these new housing areas on the outskirts of the city in the matter of a telephone service. Booths should be erected in the centre of the housing area, so that they will be available for emergency calls, particularly at night.</P>
    <P>During the debate reference was made to the need for protective clothing, and it was suggested that if the Minister denies this protective clothing to the men, it is a breach of contract. We should be accustomed now to breaches of contract, not only on the part of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, but on the part of most of the Ministers.  Have they all kept their word or bond in respect of the ordinary employees of their Departments? It is quite true it would be a breach of contract not to supply these men with clothing as part of their emoluments.  Not only the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, but other Ministers, have broken a far more serious contract in respect of the wages of their employees when they stabilised the bonus at 185 and denied the workers the rights and privileges to which they were entitled.  Taking the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as one instance, why should the men employed in that Department be treated worse than men engaged in other forms of public service?  They have received, it is true, a certain limited form of bonus, but the amount paid to them is far below what is being paid to their workers by good employers in the country; as a matter of fact, it is not equal to 50 per cent. of the total bonuses paid in many undertakings since the war commenced.</P>
    <P>I will draw your attention to what <Col N="1740" /> was done only the other day by one of the imperialistic concerns that we are always complaining about here, and that the Minister and his associates were so determined to deprive of their power in this country in the years gone by.  This concern is now paying its workers a bonus of over £1 a week, in addition to the basic wage.  The Department might well follow such an excellent example, but instead of doing so they have stabilised the bonus at 185 and given the workers only a very slight addition, an addition that would be, I suppose, considerably less than 6 or 7 per cent.  On the other hand, they have raised the cost of postal and telephone services considerably. The Minister cannot say that he had to increase postal and telephone services because of increased wages.  In this case the very reverse applies.  We are paying more to the Department and they are not giving much consideration to the employees. In justice to these men and women, who give such good service, their miserable conditions should be improved. They are receiving miserable wages, wages far below the recognised standard of good wages.  They should be given some relief from the standstill Order.</P>
    <P>May I suggest that if Ministers have some difficulty in making their statements here <i>extempore</i> and find it necessary to prepare their speeches beforehand, they might be able to supply Deputies with copies?  If those statements can be supplied to the Press, why could they not be supplied to Deputies?  I should like to point out that it is rather difficult to follow a statement such as the Minister read out, a statement which was really a mass of figures.  If we had that statement in advance, it would have been very helpful.  I observed that none of the reporters took notes of the speech&mdash;they must have had the report supplied them.  Why could not Deputies also be supplied with the statement?  If we had it in advance we could listen with more enjoyment to the Minister reading it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the long <Col N="1741" /> delay that occurs in arranging trunk calls from South Kerry.  I have heard some Deputies saying that often it takes an hour or two to get a trunk call.  It is my experience in South Kerry that if you desire to get a trunk call, say, from Caherciveen to Dublin or Cork, it may take five or six hours before it is possible to make the call. I do not know why there should be such a long delay.  I am sure it is not the fault of the local postal officials, as they are usually most courteous and efficient.  I have made inquiries repeatedly and I have been informed there are numbers of priority calls.  I suppose, as there are military stations at Valentia and Waterville, it is the military who are responsible for these calls, and they are getting the priority. Of course, it is essential they should at the present time, but all the same I think these calls might be limited to six minutes.  If they were, then private subscribers would get a chance of putting their calls through.</P>
      <P>Caherciveen is a very important fishing station, perhaps one of the most important along the south coast, and the merchants there, through necessity, must telephone Cork, Dublin and cross-Channel markets.  They complain that, owing to the long delays over telephone calls, they have to cancel them and this interferes considerably with their business.  The merchants of Caherciveen order ice from the Cork merchants.  They are unable, on many occasions, to get the ice because they cannot get telephone calls through to Cork before the train leaves that city., This is a very serious matter for the fish merchants, and I think the Minister should see to it that the telephone calls to the Cork ice companies should receive some form of priority.</P>

      <P>Many questions have been raised with reference to the working of the various branches of the Department and, in accordance with the usual practice, Deputies have taken advantage of the opportunity to draw attention to complaints, which are normally made to postal officials all over the country.  When the Estimate is being considered, the Minister has to bear the burden of <Col N="1742" /> complaints which usually come through official channels, and he has to try to deal with them in the House.  With regard to any that I am not able to deal with now, they will be on the records and we will have them examined. That, I think, is the best way of dealing with them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell raised a question with regard to the amount of money devoted to the purchase of sites.  That money has nothing to do with the St. Andrew Street site.  It has been purchased, and we are only waiting until the emergency is over in order to commence the work of building there.  Of course, that also applies to other big building undertakings.  The amount provided in the sub-head to which the Deputy refers is a &ldquo;carry forward&rdquo; from the previous year and is in respect of premises at Sandwith Street, the site of which will be utilised in connection with the erection of a new sorting office.  Two houses occupied by tenants on the site have now been surrendered and the conveyance of the premises to the Department is in course of preparation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked about a great many contracts.  A very heavy task was imposed on the Department when it had to change from motors to horse vehicles.  The change was made with great success all over the country. Certain inconveniences were caused, but, on the other hand, a certain amount of advantage came out of the change, illustrating the truth of the old saying &ldquo;it is an ill wind that does nobody good.&rdquo; A number of people were employed, who otherwise would not have been employed, in connection with horses, the provision of harness, cars and so on.  The contracts are short term contracts, and wherever it is necessary, when the war is over, we will give the most improved services possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to our banking transactions.  That really is a question more for the Department of Finance than for the Post Office. I do not know exactly what the Deputy would desire us to do.  The facilities at present provided enable people to withdraw money on demand up to £3 on the presentation of their <Col N="1743" /> books and on the filling up of the required forms.  Beyond that, I do not know that we are called upon to enter into competition with the ordinary banking system.  The telephone book is now only published every nine months.  That is due to reasons of economy, and because of the difficulty of procuring paper during the emergency. We try our best to keep it up to date, and in present circumstances I do not think it is reasonable to ask for anything more than that.  I do not think that the practice of Post Offices in any country that I know of is to try to compete with the shops in showing their wares in the windows.  There are other ways, I think, in which people can be informed of the various forms that exist.  The number of forms is enormous.  If they were to be spread all over the windows in the Post Offices through the country, it would certainly add very much to the labour of the ordinary sub-postmasters.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton raised several questions, one in particular with regard to the staffing of the counter at the General Post Office.  I may say that, arising out of representations which have been made, I have had the staffing arrangements at the General Post Office counter specially examined.  I find that in general the existing staffing is adequate, but that at peak hours pressure at times arises from the exceptional volume of emergency business that is now being transacted.  The position is one which can only be remedied by the provision of additional counter accommodation, and it has, accordingly, been decided to open five new counter positions, suitably staffed, on the Prince's Street side of the building to which all emergency payment work, and particularly telegraph money orders, will be transferred. The necessary structural alterations are in progress, and the new arrangements will, it is expected, be brought into operation within the next few weeks.  I think they will be <Col N="1744" /> found to provide a satisfactory solution of any difficulties hitherto experienced. I think that even Deputy Larkin (junior), will find it easier in future to get his dog licence than he has found it hitherto.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton also raised the question of wages paid in Howth.  The scales of wages in Howth have been carefully examined and, of course, it depends on the number of the units of work in the office as to the fixing and grading of the post office and the scales of wages.  No case has been established for any change in the existing scales of wages.</P>
      <P>A further question raised by the Deputy was the upgrading and full-time establishment positions of temporary officers acting on full-time postmen's duties.  With regard to the filling of posts by unestablished postmen, the Department has had difficulty in recommending the advancement of temporary full-time postmen to full-time unestablished rank by reason of doubts as to the continued need for the maintenance of the duties owing to emergency conditions.  The practicability of advancement of the officers concerned has not been improved by the very serious restrictions of train and mail services which have taken place by reason of the unsatisfactory coal and petrol situation.  There is no assurance that even the present curtailed road and transport services will not be further reduced, and in the circumstances it would be quite impossible for the Department to recommend upgrading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position with regard to protective clothing&mdash;waterproof clothing&mdash;to which Deputy Norton referred, is under constant review, and is a source of great anxiety to us.  It is, however, a matter over which we have no effective control.  The general supplies' position has worsened, and the Department of Supplies has intimated that material sufficient to meet only a fraction of the normal requirements will probably be available.  In the circumstances it has been found necessary to extend appreciably the period of wear of waterproof, rubber, oilskins, garment capes and leggings.  This necessarily applies to garments already <Col N="1745" /> in use as well as to new issues.  It may be possible, in the case of officers whose duties lie in exceptionally exposed localities, to afford special treatment, but no assurance as to this can be given.  The restrictions imposed by the Minister for Supplies to meet emergency conditions apply generally. The Post Office, in conjunction with the Department of Supplies, have done everything reasonably possible to meet the situation, but the difficulties are insuperable in present conditions and the restrictions imposed are inevitable.</P>
    <P>The difficulties with regard to trunk calls from Kilcullen, Newbridge and Balbriggan, which the Deputy said was due to overloading, we shall have looked into, and see if any improvement can be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy D. Morrissey referred to the number of services in the week: that in certain areas there were only two or three services per week, whereas in the cities you have so many services per day.  Of course, that is justified by the money position in populous areas.  We cannot give the same service in an area where the volume of business is extremely small.  Out of about 4,000 posts throughout the country, only 1,700 have less than a 6-day service.  In view of the economies which are at present necessary, an increase in frequency cannot be made.  Deputy Allen and other Deputies suggested that a great improvement could be made in the whole of the postal and telephone services. Considerable improvements have already been made in the telephone service, especially by my predecessor, and when the emergency arose during my period, an enormous increase took place in the laying of telephone lines. Further developments must wait until after the war when, obviously, there must be considerable development of postal services in all parts.  That is not a matter upon which I could now come to any definite conclusion.  It would have to be left until later, because it requires very careful consideration. I should mention that a scheme between this Department and the Board of Works, has gone through all stages.  It will cost about £70,000 and will mean the laying of concrete <Col N="1746" /> pipes for carrying underground cables. These cables will go from the larger centres of population.  The pipes are actually being constructed in Ireland. When certain chemical processes take place it will be possible to put down the cables.  The labour content on that work will represent almost 70 per cent. of the cost.  The pipes will be left in that position until it is possible to get the cables when the emergency ends.  Deputy Allen raised a question about the collection of letters in the city at night.  There is a collection from all boxes in Dublin at 8.30 and a collection from certain special boxes at 10.30.  I will look into the question to see if it is possible to improve the collection of letters in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>I will have the matter carefully examined so as to bring the hours as close as possible to the hours of departure of mails.  Deputy Allen also referred to the porterage charge on telegrams.  Representations are regularly made to the Department about these charges.  Prior to the 1st July, 1936, the charge was 6d. for each mile over one mile, when it was reduced to 3d. for the first mile.  That concession involved a substantial loss.  The additional cost of delivery free within two miles is estimated to cost £2,500, and if extended to three miles £4,000.  The amount collected yearly on porterage over one mile is £4,800.  It should be remembered that there is a deficit of £73,000 yearly on the telegraph service.</P>

      <P>If they pay for them.  It is really a question of taxation.  A question was raised by Deputy Larkin as to whether the Department should or should not make a profit.  In normal times, when the strain on the public purse is not heavy, I think it would be <Col N="1747" /> an ideal thing that these services should just pay for themselves and no more.  In abnormal times we must have regard to the calls on the community as a whole, and if the Department can make a contribution to the very heavy taxation that has to be raised, that is something that we should not object to.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donovan dealt with the Clonakilty-Rosscarbery mail service.  Tenders for that service were invited in June and a suitable contractor was not forthcoming at reasonable cost.  The existing alternative arrangements for service via Skibbereen were the best that could be adopted in the circumstances.  While morning delivery at Rosscarbery is now about one and a half hours later than <Col N="1748" /> formerly the afternoon dispatch at 2.30 p.m. is maintained and an additional dispatch to Skibbereen at 8.50 p.m. has been provided.  The latter dispatch secures connection with the 8 a.m. train to Skibbereen next morning.  If there are in fact any disadvantages arising out of a later morning delivery the additional evening dispatch should compensate for them. I may state that if a contract could be arranged on reasonable terms I am quite willing to restore the mail car service to and from Clonakilty, but in such event the evening dispatch to Skibbereen now afforded would necessarily cease.  The Deputy referred to the Christmas traffic for dispatch of fowl.  There is no difficulty about inwards parcels at Rosscarbery.  They are conveyed by bus from Skibbereen. As regards outgoing traffic, if the cyclist postman from Clonakilty cannot carry the parcels they are dispatched by the evening bus.  During the Christmas period that traffic in fowl is probably abnormally heavy and the Department would in the ordinary course make special arrangements for that traffic to go by car to Clonakilty.  These questions have been raised by Deputies on all sides.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, that question has been under constant consideration.  Deputy Larkin mentioned that he knew where a good deal of wire could be secured.  If the Deputy would let us into the secret of where the wire is we will be glad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall look into it. With regard to kiosks, it is unfortunate that they are damaged from time to time, but when we get word that any kiosk has been damaged, we set about getting it mended as soon as possible.  There is a certain amount of vandalism going on.  I may say that <Col N="1749" /> we propose to establish an automatic cut-out in respect of those conversations to which the Deputy referred.  It will be put into operation, and it will mean that these conversations will be cut out after six minutes, so that the Deputy will get his turn.  Deputy Byrne raised a question as to increasing pensions.  The increasing of pensions is, of course, not a matter for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, but for the Department of Finance, which deals with all these questions of pensions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes referred to the seconding of officers to other Departments. That has arisen out of the emergency.  Farmers are not usually the people who ask us to spend more money upon officials, and I think it will appeal to Deputy Hughes to learn that it is in the interests of economy that officers have been seconded to other Departments.  So long as the emergency remains, I am afraid that arrangement will have to continue.  It is not at all satisfactory from a Departmental point of view, because we have lost some of our very valuable officers.  We are, however, looking forward to the time when we shall get them back, but, while the emergency lasts, we have to be satisfied with the arrangement.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin referred to the installation of party wires in rural districts. That was tried, but apparently people in this country so object to anybody else overhearing their conversations that it was a complete failure.  Nobody would take it up.</P>

      <P>With regard to the parcels which were held up within the <Col N="1750" /> past few weeks and about which there was considerable complaint, we had complaints from Deputies of all Parties in that connection.  Deputy Liam Cosgrave particularly referred to it to-day.  These parcels have since been returned to the senders, but the prohibitions against the export of the particular parcels which were held up have been in force for a long time, so that it was on their own responsibility that these people sent these parcels.</P>

Reference was also made to kiosks in the Kimmage and Crumlin areas.  The same answer applies to that matter.  If we can be warned as quickly as possible when vandalism takes place, we would try to have the kiosks repaired, but I suppose <Col N="1751" /> it will require a considerable amount of education before vandalism of this kind can be checked.

I do not think, however, that these answers are answers which we welcome. I think the Minister should have taken time to consider the points. It is all very well for his permanent secretary to tell him these things, but the opinions expressed are those of the permanent secretary, and not the Minister's.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £26,280 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1944, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí eile i dtaobh Fóirleatha Nea-Shreangaigh (Uimh. 45 de 1926).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum, not exceeding £26,280, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which <Col N="1752" /> will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1944, for Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926).</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the Broadcasting Service for the current financial year, 1943-44, amounts to £78,880, a net increase of £8,773 on the provision for last year.  The main increase is under sub-head A and amounts to £6,725. This is due principally to the additional cost of the orchestra, for the augmentation of which I have already secured the authority of the Dáil in connection with the Supplementary Broadcasting Estimate presented on 26th November last; also to the filling of the directorship; to staff incremental increases; to provision for increased bonus and for an additional week's wages (53 pay days in the current year); etc.  There is an increase of £2,388 under sub-head B, due almost wholly to extra provision for artists' fees, establishment of a radio choir, etc.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E shows a decrease of £230 due to economies in power consumption, called for by emergency conditions. There is a decrease of £240 under sub-head F, the result of the curtailment of maintenance and renewal works by reason of difficulties in obtaining replacement stores.  The variations under the other sub-heads are of a minor character not calling for comment.</P>
    <P>Revenue from wireless licences in the financial year ended 31st March last amounted to approximately £106,000, and from advertisements, etc. to approximately £2,500, a total of £108,500.  This represents a decrease of about £2,900 on the revenue for the previous year caused by a drop in the number of licences held by listeners.</P>
    <P>The total number of licences on 31st March last was 167,671, a decrease of 6,879 on the figures for the corresponding date in 1942.  The current figure is 168,236.  Although the decrease in the number of licences is to be regretted, it is not altogether surprising considering the general circumstances of the times. In this connection I am glad to be able <Col N="1753" /> to report that many persons whose sets had been inoperable through inability to obtain batteries have responded to the advice which I gave last year that they should arrange for storage of their sets with wireless dealers or traders or other licence holders while the battery difficulty continues.  The arrangement has been mutually advantageous: it has relieved the owners of inoperable sets of all liability in regard to the taking out of licences and it has obviated the necessity for legal proceedings by the Department against defaulters.  I anticipate that revenue during the current year is not likely to. exceed a total of £104,700.  The estimated total expenditure in the current year, including expenditure by other Departments on services rendered to broadcasting amounts to £109,295.  The estimated deficit is, of course, the result of the fall in licences, the additional outlay in the augmented orchestra and on the provision for artists' fees, etc., the circumstances in relation to which I explained broadly when submitting the Supplementary Estimate in November last.  Further, we take no credit in our receipts for services rendered to other Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The station orchestra has been increased from 28 to 40.  Some little time may elapse before the full advantage of this increase will be felt, but since the augmentation there has been a noticeable improvement in the range, as well as in the quality of the musical programmes performed.</P>
    <P>The radio choir to which I have already referred was selected early this year.  It consists of 24 members and remuneration is on an engagement basis.  Its first broadcast was given in June last under the baton of Sir Hugh Roberton, the well-known conductor of the Glasgow Orpheus Choir, to whom we are under a deep debt of gratitude for advice and co-operation in selecting the choir, in giving it its first training and in many other ways.  At present the choir is being used in programmes of miscellaneous part-songs, but after a time when it has had more experience and practice in functioning as a unit it is intended to use it for the production of operas, choral and orchestral <Col N="1754" /> works and other special performances.</P>
    <P>During the year the policy of giving; in public, fortnightly symphony concerts with the Radio Eireann orchestra, augmented by players from outside the station, was continued with noteworthy success.  In the period from October to March ten such concerts were given in the Mansion House, Dublin, and in April the final concert of the 1942-43 season was given in the Gaiety Theatre.  The concerts in the Mansion House were packed to capacity and the demand for tickets for the final concert in the Gaiety Theatre was so great that it was found necessary to arrange for a repeat performance in the Mansion House on the following night.  The success attending these concerts, which in the first instance were undertaken with some trepidation, was most gratifying and points to a keen public interest in good music.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are probably aware, the accommodation in the Mansion House was inadequate for the large audiences desiring to attend these concerts, and we decided to procure accommodation elsewhere.  Our concerts are, therefore, being given during the current season on Sunday afternoons in the Capitol Theatre which is capable of housing close on 2,000.  The two concerts already held show that the public interest is definitely being maintained&mdash;there was not, in fact, sufficient accommodation for all who desired to attend the first concert of the season.  In this connection, I feel that a special word of praise is due to the orchestra for its hard work during the year.  I do not wish to single out any one section for mention.  There has been a notable improvement in all sections, and to their efforts largely&mdash;and to the efforts of the conductor&mdash;are due the entertainment and education made available to the general public through these symphony concerts.</P>
    <P>In order to develop the art of music in this country, it is not sufficient merely to give a lead in Dublin, the capital city, and expect the country will follow.  The country clearly <Col N="1755" /> should make its own effort.  If it does not do so, there can be no sound indication of the general direction of the Irish musical genius, and decisions as to policy in regard to programme building, must, as a result, be arbitrary and therefore liable to error in the long run.  Music making in the country is of as great importance as music making in Dublin, especially where the need is so pressing for the expansion of cultural activities.</P>
    <P>With this in mind, a policy has been developed of encouraging musical organisations in places outside Dublin to arrange series of concerts of good music, and employ the best artists available in the country.  Radio Eireann agreed to relay a portion of each of these concerts at a specially increased fee.  As a result, concerts were given by the Waterford Music Club, the University Graduates' Club, Cork, the Sligo Operatic Society, the Limerick Music Club, the Wexford Theatre Guild, and in Galway.  Also, in collaboration with Radio Eireann, the Keating Branch of the Gaelic League organised two choral and instrumental concerts in the Gresham Hotel, Dublin.</P>
    <P>In the studio were given series of informative and educational programmes. All the orchestral instruments were featured in a series in which the history of the evolution of each instrument was given, together with a short recital showing its capabilities and an indication of its place in the orchestra.  During the winter of 1942-43, and again recently, we had a series of choral broadcasts by the Glasgow Orpheus Choir.  The choir was under its conductor, Sir Hugh Roberton, who gave a short lecture with each recital.  Several broadcasts were devoted to the work of Bunting in collecting and noting our traditional airs, and a special series is again being devoted to his life work in this, his centenary year.  Fifteen lectures, illustrated by the Radio Eireann Orchestra, and by gramophone records, were given on the appreciation of good music.  These were directed especially to children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1756" /> All the best writers of Lieder were represented by series of programmes and several broadcasts were devoted to those songs of Thomas Moore which have been somewhat neglected in recent years.</P>
    <P>During the year the Dublin Operatic Society and the Dublin Grand Opera Society were assisted by members of the Radio Eireann Orchestra and selected items from their productions were broadcast.  Other musical organisations whose performances were broadcast include the Musical Art Society, the Dublin String Orchestra, the Dublin Orchestral Players, and the University Arts Society, Cork, the Cork Municipal School of Music Choir and Orchestra, the Newry Light Orchestra, etc.</P>
    <P>Due prominence in the programme was given to broadcasts of Irish traditional music.  The broadcasts were on much the same lines as the previous year, namely, programmes of dance music by selected ceilidhe bands, monthly broadcasts of pipe bands, and various other programmes devoted exclusively to the singing and playing of Irish airs.  The principal difficulty in the preparation of these programmes continues to be the dearth of suitable material&mdash;new compositions, new arrangements, published music, etc. We propose to improve this position somewhat in the present year by utilising the grant of money now available to commission the composition of pieces of music and the arrangement of Irish airs for dance programmes and for special features.  But this improvement, if it is to be sound, must be slow, because we must be careful that the work selected for performance in the Station shall be a good example to others.</P>
    <P>In the matter of recruitment of new talent it had been found, over a long period, that a great deal of time was spent in giving auditions to singers and instrumentalists whose standard of performance was much below any acceptable standard.  It was decided, therefore, to require applicants for audition to furnish a recommendation from a teacher of music; in other words, to produce some evidence of training.  It is hoped that this will <Col N="1757" /> enable us to limit auditions to those who are likely to produce suitable programme material, and also that the new policy in the matter of auditions will have the effect of bringing it home to aspirants to a musical reputation that talent by itself is not enough, but that assiduous study is necessary if the artist is to reach the level of performance which a nation-wide audience is entitled to expect.  It is feared that hitherto many young artists have been inclined to look for assistance to the Broadcasting Station during the early stages of their careers, and to seek engagements with the object of applying the fees to tuition expenses or for the sake of the advertisement. Occasionally, too, societies, choral and other, look to the Broadcasting Station for engagements in order to keep the members together.  While broadcasting is most anxious to give all possible assistance to every musical activity in the country, I would like to press the point that our cultural reputation is judged by what we radiate and that the only sound reason for seeking to broadcast is the feeling that the broadcaster has something good and worthy of inclusion in a national programme.</P>
    <P>Broadcast talks and discussions covered all aspects of the national life and literature.  In the course of the year we brought to the microphone scholars, writers, actors, journalists, clerics, sportsmen, globe-trotters, doctors, lawyers, agriculturists&mdash;in short, some out of every class of Irish men and visitors to Ireland.</P>
    <P>As one of the many and varied activities of the talks department in 1942-43, fresh efforts were made to make the best use of broadcasting in connection with the national agricultural effort. In collaboration with the Department of Agriculture there was broadcast an interesting series of talks by experts in the various branches of agriculture. Talks of a similar nature have been resumed in the current season.</P>
    <P>As to programmes in Irish, the guiding principle in the broadcasting of Irish is that it should proceed as if Irish were the vernacular of the whole country.  In practice, this means that anything of interest to Irish people, <Col N="1758" /> whether it is or is not normally spoken of or written about in Irish, should be considered proper material for the programmes. The subjects thus ranged from the national movement and personal reminiscences of great nationalists to first-aid, travel, Irish scientists, books of the revival, orchestral music and local history.</P>
    <P>Those who are not strong in Irish will find some of the programmes between the hours of 6 and 6.40 p.m. for young people very helpful&mdash;notably &ldquo;Question Time&rdquo; and a feature of which the English title would be &ldquo;At Home and Abroad&rdquo;.  We contemplate broadcasting in the near future a series of stories in simple Irish which will, it is hoped, be of some help to learners, or to those who have been getting out of touch with the language and wish to brush up their knowledge.</P>
    <P>So far as propaganda for Irish is concerned, every opportunity is given and will be given to leaders of the various movements&mdash;Gaelic League, Dáil Uladh, Oireachtas, etc., to broadcast to the people in Irish or in English.  We are hoping that it may be possible at an early date to broadcast in English a short series of talks on language movements in other countries where there is or was a two-language problem, but of course there is no country with a position exactly similar to ours.  We also hope, as soon as suitable arrangements can be made, to devote about five minutes daily to the broadcast in English of excerpts from writings and speeches of importance dealing with the language question. This will be in the nature of an experiment to be reviewed after a period of a few months.</P>
    <P>Radio plays and dramatisations occupied 139 hours of programme time in 1942.  These were mainly station productions written specially for radio. The presentation by the Abbey Players and the Longford Players of plays which had been successful on the stage created unusual interest among listeners and evoked much praise, especially in the case of country listeners who live at such distances from the cities that they have not the opportunity of seeing these plays in the theatre.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1759" /> The position with regard to variety programmes remains much as it was. We cannot disguise the fact that there is no considerable body of professional variety talent in this country and that what is available to the broadcasting service is merely a small amount of very mixed talent, mostly amateur, and generally below the desirable standard of merit.  Our only hope of improvement in this branch of the programmes lies in the development of a distinctively Irish brand of variety entertainment and no amount of money can force the pace of such development. Every effort is made, of course, to encourage the talent that is available and to direct it along lines which, we feel, will make for its improvement.</P>
    <P>There is from time to time an amount of criticism in the newspapers of wireless programmes and of the broadcasting service.  The criticism has been, for the most part, of the kind which is usually produced by loose thinking, or which comes from people who are not regular listeners and are therefore not well informed.  Criticism of this sort is of no help to anybody and is more likely to confuse and mislead the public than to help them to form reasonable judgments.  Constructive criticism and suggestions from people who listen to the programmes and know what has been and is being broadcast is always welcome and is, in fact, of great assistance to those who have to build them. It will always be difficult to gauge with any accuracy the extent to which listeners approve and disapprove.  While every item has its quota of listeners, it very rarely happens that a producer succeeds in pleasing everybody, if such an achievement is possible at all.  It is for this reason that we have appealed from time to time to listeners to try to listen only to the broadcasts they think they will like and to regard the others as being meant for other listeners, whose tastes differ from their own.  A marked contrast exists between city and country&mdash;and, of course, we must appeal to all.  Broadcasting, of course, has the widest and most mixed audience and it is not surprising, therefore, that programmes which are to stand any chance of a favourable reception must be of a varied character <Col N="1760" /> containing, as far as possible, items which will appeal to each different taste.  The problem of the programme-planner is to keep this fact in mind and, at the same time, to see to it that his programmes keep up to a certain intellectual level and contain all the ingredients which are desirable in a great national undertaking.</P>
    <P>It remains for me finally to remind our critics of one very important consideration, namely, that there must necessarily be a definite policy covering the work of the station, and that we must always remember the responsibility of those in charge to ensure a high standard of entertainment, which will not be overridden by influences which are foreign to sound public taste.  Whilst a wide variety of tastes must be allowed for, at the same time those responsible must bear in mind that national broadcasting involves heavy expenditure, and that no time must be wasted on what is silly, trivial, or degrading.  A national station is on the air for the world to criticise, and Irish culture will be judged by its output.  I have much more faith in the possibility of fostering a really all-round good taste in public entertainment than many of our critics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. W.T. Cosgrave Mr. W.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House whether or not he has had under examination the present wave-length that we have here, and whether or not it is a satisfactory one; and, if not, whether there is a possibility of its being altered?  Secondly, will he tell the House whether or not the present site of the broadcasting station is the most suitable one?  I am taking it from the statement he has read out to us that there is a certain vested interest growing up in the broadcasting station, and that possibly there would be an objection to leaving it for some other premises.  The information that is available to me&mdash; and the opinion has been expressed to me by many people&mdash;is that it is an unsuitable site, and that, in consequence, the programmes from it have not as good a sound, and consequently are not capable of as good reception as they would be if we were on a better wave-length or if the station were <Col N="1761" /> in a better position.  I would like an assurance from the Minister with regard to the selection of the musicians that he has referred to, that it has been done by experts, without favour, and that the best musicians available have been appointed.</P>
      <P>From the concluding portion of the Minister's remarks one would gather that he has a very exalted opinion of his own conception of Irish culture. He has not given the people of this country very many harp recitals during the year.  I referred to that matter in the case of his predecessor some years ago.  We were promised more but, after a short time, we had, I should say, perhaps less than formerly. The Minister has referred to the qualities of the programmes.  I hope the quality is good.  I do not pose as an expert but it does strike me that some of the other programmes that one hears may be a little better.</P>
      <P>With regard to announcers, I have not heard, I think, a single announcer here of whom one could say that he had an Irish voice.  If you take Dublin as an example, Dublin has no accent of its own.  The Dublin accent is a mixture of two or more of the accents of the entire 32 counties.  Dublin has no distinctive accent.  There is an accent peculiar to Galway, Clare, Kerry and Cork.  There is, perhaps, less character in the accent peculiar to the Minister's own constituency than there is in the accent of any other counties to which I have referred. It also has a certain conglomerate quality.  There is not the same musical quality or character about that accent as there is about the others, and I have never heard a single one of the broadcasting announcers with one of those voices to which I have referred.  Is it possible that there is not a single announcer to be found in County Galway, County Kerry, or County Cork, with a voice which could be recognised as a distinctively Irish voice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say with regard to the general national outlook of the features presented over our national broadcasting system that it appears to me that our programmes <Col N="1762" /> seem, rather, to be looking backward than forward.  It appears to me that there is something of the attitude of the submerged tenth&mdash;a kind of inferiority complex&mdash;so far as our wireless broadcasting is concerned.  I believe that we ought to be looking forward rather than backward, and that, instead of stressing the mistakes that may have been made in the past, we ought to look towards the future and try to educate our people into having a real national feeling that we ought to be proud of our history instead of being ashamed of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with 100 per cent. of Deputy Cosgrave's remarks. The question of accents has always appeared to me to be debatable. Dublin, Cork, and many other counties claim to speak the best English. I claim that Tipperary speaks the best English.  As a matter of fact, I have not heard one really Irish accent over Radio Éireann, bar one&mdash; who came in last year&mdash;and I understand he was a Limerick man.  Of course, I know that people from Aberdeen and other parts of Scotland, as well as certain parts of England, claim to use the best English accent, but I still maintain that we, in Tipperary, can claim to speak the best English and with the best accent.  I lived here in Dublin for many years, during which I met people from all over the country, and it was my experience that the Tipperary accent was most easily understood.  Of course, I quite understand that certain people, in County Cork, let us say, can afford to send their sons to Oxford or other English colleges and universities and that, when these young men come home, it would be very hard to understand what they are saying.  Naturally, that would apply to other counties also, but in my view the Irish <i>blás</i>, as we call it in Tipperary&mdash;Anglicised&mdash;is conspicuous by its absence so far as many of the speakers over Radio Éireann are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a few suggestions to the Minister in this connection. I congratulate him on the appointment of Mr. Brennan as Director of Radio Eireann.  Mr. Brennan is a <Col N="1763" /> good friend of mine, and was one of the best Gaelic footballers and step-dancers that ever appeared in this country.  He is not a member of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, but I suggest to the Minister that an examination ought to be held at intervals, in connection with the selection of announcers over Radio Éireann for Gaelic games, and that half a dozen of the best speakers should be selected in sequence&mdash;candidates being invited to compete from all over Ireland.  Undoubtedly, the principal Gaelic games are well announced over Radio Éireann, but I would impress on the Minister the urgent necessity of getting those who participated in past All-Ireland hurling or football finals to broadcast while it is yet possible to find such a player&mdash;even going back as far as 1887.  Even gramophone records of these early All-Ireland finals would be invaluable, if they could be procured.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that a very interesting feature would be a broadcast of the All-Ireland hurling and football finals from 1887 to 1943&mdash; 55 hurling finals and 55 football finals &mdash;all of which are completed except the final of 1888, which was left unfinished owing to the Gaelic invasion of America in that year, and which lay between Tipperary and Kilkenny in both hurling and football.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a possibility of a player from each winning team coming forth to broadcast.  Only within the past year, the captain of the 1889 All-Ireland football champions, Mr. Gil. Kavanagh, of far-famed Bohercrowe, Tipperary, died.  I was speaking to him a few days before his death&mdash;I hope that it did not hasten his death &mdash;with regard to this matter of a weekly broadcast by members of former winning teams in All-Ireland hurling and football games, and we felt that the programme could be got over in, approximately, one year. What a treat that would be for Ireland at home as well as for the Gaels the world over, and I think that <Col N="1764" /> my native county, Tipperary, with 12 hurling and four football championships, would be close to the top.  I think we could supply a player from each team, even back to the first winners: Thurles, Tipperary in 1887.</P>
    <P>Our games are not foreign.  They are neither Saxon nor Italian, but kindly Irish of the Irish&mdash;hurling being the world's greatest game, and Gaelic football a good second.  Out of the 55 All-Ireland champion football teams, we can supply two speakers from the House, namely, Deputy Donnellan, who captained the Galway team to win, two All-Ireland finals, and Deputy Spring&mdash;who, I am sorry to see, is not here at the moment&mdash;who captained the Kerry team in one All-Ireland final.  We have our Director of Radio Éireann, who holds All-Ireland medals for Dublin, and whose voice we would all like to hear on the air.  I think that, in asking for the services of any of these people, they would only regard it as a labour of love.</P>
    <P>Now, that accounts for five finals in football out of 55, so I think I have given you the nucleus of a programme. To come back again to this question of accents, as I said before, it appears to me that the Tipperary people have the best accent, but it also appears to me that a good deal of the Oxfordised-Rathmines Haw-haw accent has been introduced here in recent years.  Now, I do not know whether some people may think that their accent might be improved by crossing the Channel, but I would like to urge on the Minister that the native accent should be preserved and that, wherever gramophone records exist of statements made by former players on the old championship teams, these records should be preserved for future use on Radio Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate we are discussing at the moment is not concerned with a very large amount of money, as compared with other Estimates, but it is a very important one because it is dealing with what, I submit, is a most important service.  Now, while I have not very much complaint to make with regard to the manner in which broadcasts are made, I do think that the scope of our <Col N="1765" /> programmes is not broad enough.  I have mentioned this on previous occasions.  In all countries except our own it would seem that wireless broadcasting is regarded as being necessary for certain purposes.  In other countries it is regarded as being necessary for the purpose of introducing three features: first of all, propaganda; secondly, information; and, thirdly, enjoyment or recreation.</P>
      <P>Now, in connection with our wireless service in this country, there seems to be, first of all, a complete absence of propaganda with regard to this country.  Every other country in the world&mdash;I do not care whether belligerent or neutral in this war&mdash;is using its wireless service for the purpose of advertising itself.  In the new world it is hoped to create, whatever kind of world it will be, if we remain silent, if we do not put our wares on the table or do not put forward our point of view, we are going to be entirely forgotten.  I do not think that our broadcasts ever reach the ears of any listener in this world outside persons who understand English or Irish.  We do not have, as I submit we should have, regular broadcasts to countries abroad in their different languages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is not quite within the sphere of this discussion to mention the political aspect of such broadcasts. Year after year, I have emphasised the necessity for putting before the public opinion of the world the great grievance that exists in this country with regard to Partition.  I have repeated it so often that I shall not dwell on it now, but I do say that there is an equally important matter to which our broadcasting service might be devoted, that is, that it should act as a sort of stationary commercial agent for the purpose of letting the peoples of the world know the goods which we have to sell or which we shall have to sell and the trade in which we can engage. Every other country does that, but for some reason we do not; I do not know why.  Our broadcasting service is kept for the sole purpose, as far as I can see, of a little Government propaganda or else for the purpose of entertainment. I do not think I need elaborate <Col N="1766" /> on the necessity for some propaganda, for political or trade purposes.</P>
    <P>Again, our station is closed down for many hours during the day.  I do not think that is right.  We would not take up the time which is now devoted to broadcasting for entertainment if the service were used for propaganda purposes during the period at which the station is now closed.  I think this time might be utilised to tell other countries in French, German, Spanish and other languages that we have a country, that we have a life of our own, so that they will know something about us and that we shall not be forgotten in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Another purpose for which broadcasting might be used more extensively is the dissemination of information. We are turning out laws in this country at the rate of two or three a day, sometimes more.  You go to bed at night and you find when you wake up in the morning that if you do something that you did the day before, you will be breaking some law that has been passed overnight.  I think the broadcasting service should be used for the purpose of informing people of the-vital changes in the law that take place almost every day as a result of decrees under the Emergency Powers Act.  It is difficult enough for lawyers to understand these changes, in fact it is almost impossible to keep track of them in the mass of literature in which such laws are contained, but for ordinary lay people it is a hopeless task. Generally speaking, the public should be put on notice of these laws as they are issued.  The laws should be explained in simple language over the wireless as they are issued, and the people should be told how they affect their lives and businesses in different ways.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of entertainment. I should like to congratulate the Minister on the fact that, as I think, there has been a distinct improvement from year to year under his guidance in the entertainment given, but I quarrel with the Minister on the fact that we hear all too often: &ldquo;Radio Éireann is now closing down until to-morrow.&rdquo;  I often feel like shouting out on such occasions, particularly <Col N="1767" /> on Sunday afternoons: &ldquo;Why close down?&rdquo; The whole cry at present is to draw our people back to the land, to make life on the land pleasant and endurable for those who think it is not and who want to leave the land. There are long periods during the day at present when we get no entertainment from our own station.  It is particularly difficult at present to get many other stations as a result of the jamming that goes on, sometimes accidental but often deliberate, as a result of the war situation.  Therefore, as I say, when I hear the announcement: &ldquo;Radio Éireann is now closing down,&rdquo; I feel like asking: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Wireless broadcasting from the point of view of entertainment is much more necessary for the people living in remote country districts than for people living in cities and towns.  It can exercise a very big influence on the lives of people in the country, and I think the longer our station is kept open the better for these people.  Why should the system be that there is just a programme between 6.30 and 10.30 and at no other time?  Why should the country people be regimented into seeking their amusement over the air just at any time the station selects?  Now that there is a little money to spare on the operation of this service, I think it might be usefully expended on giving more employment in the station to artists and others so that the station might be kept open for a longer period.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I have one complaint of a local nature to make and I think that every Wexford Deputy will agree with me.  Deputy Cosgrave touched on the question of a change of wave-length and I certainly think there is something wrong with our present wave-length, so far as County Wexford is concerned.  Near the town of Gorey where I live&mdash;I am sure Deputy Alien has the same experience&mdash;I cannot hear the Irish news because of interference.  It is getting worse every day.  There seems to be some sort of jamming going on.  I do not know whether I am using the correct technical term but even here in Dublin it can be heard to a lesser extent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> In Wexford, however, one has frequently to turn away from the Irish station because one cannot hear the broadcast.  I should like to say in fairness to the Minister that when a person in very humble circumstances in my district made a complaint about the jamming, within what I considered a very reasonable time an investigator called on that person for the purpose of inquiring into the matter. Eventually the man got in touch with me and I had an interview with him. He explained his difficulties and, so far as I could gather as a result of my conversation with him, there is no remedy in the view of the officials concerned.  I suppose it is as a result of the war, but unless there is a great change made in the wave-length to cut out the disturbance, I and most of my constituents will be unable to hear the Irish programme, particularly the news.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>In successive years I have offered the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs criticism which I think he should accept.  He has asked for constructive criticism, and, in each year, I have said to the Minister: &ldquo;If you pay for the best, you will get the best.&rdquo;  There is no use in our trying to fool ourselves, despite the fact that the Minister comes in with a fine tone throughout his Estimate.  We know that wireless broadcasting has not advanced very much here since its introduction in 1926.  I have had intimate association with the station since that year.  I was one of the first writers for the microphone in this country.  I appeared in the old station in Denmark Street, and I know that the conditions of broadcasting here have not changed very much.  The reason for that is, as I have said elsewhere, that a parsimonious policy has left Radio Éireann little better than an amateur concert hall.  That is the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has done a very good job, indeed, in giving us a first-rate orchestra, and I think we cannot shower sufficient praise on him for that.  However, I wonder if any member of this House considers £5 a week sufficient for a first-rate male performer in an orchestra, or £4 for a <Col N="1769" /> lady performer.  I do not think so, and I think that that is one of the first things the Minister should look into. He should see that the orchestra&mdash; which is good and is composed of the best musicians we can get&mdash;is paid commensurate with its ability.  I am sorry, however, that the orchestra was not composed solely of Irish nationals. While the Minister is to be congratulated on giving us a first-rate orchestra, I cannot see that he is to be congratulated on any other aspect of Radio Éireann.  The same position applies to musicians, vocalists, playwrights and actors&mdash;the fees have not improved in any respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about a dearth of talent and about the discovery of new talent.  This country is literally teeming with artistic ability, but Radio Éireann does not seek it out. There are competent singers, actors and musicians, but if they want to broadcast here they have to go with cap in hand, so to speak.  The Director and the Minister know this as well as I do.  There is a panel of people who have broadcast from time to time since the inception of the service, but the fees that they are paid are most unattractive.  What is the use of talking about the encouragement of new talent, when we do not pay the good talent that we have already?</P>
    <P>So far as play production is concerned, I think that practically all plays from the station suffer from hasty production and bad acting.  I have suggested in the past to the Minister that there should be at Radio Éireann a proper repertory company and not what is there at present. Practically every aspect of Radio Éireann at present is a sort of hobby for people who have good jobs or other occupations, while there is no place for the whole-time professional, whose engagement I would encourage to make our station first-rate and comparable with any other station in England or on the Continent.  Plays suffer from bad acting, because of the pursuance of a system that existed there&mdash;and still exists, to a certain extent&mdash;of giving a producer&mdash;and an amateur producer, at that&mdash;a certain <Col N="1770" /> figure to produce a play for an hour. He gets £8, say, and has to pay the actors out of it.  It is the most natural thing on earth for the producer to try to get as much as possible for himself.  I know Abbey actors who have played in Radio Éireann for as low as 10/6 and 15/-.  I do not think that is good enough.  A repertory company should be formed there and the members should be given a minimum weekly wage or a monthly contract. I suggest, also, that a professional producer be engaged: if a man can be got who knows both Irish and English, well and good; if not, there should be a producer for the Irish language and one for the English language.</P>
    <P>So far as auditions are concerned, for new actors coming on, I may say there are many actors here, well known to the Director and to the Minister, and it is a very simple matter to get in touch with them.  If we cannot employ a repertory company, a panel of actors should be formed, such as existed in the Belfast B.B.C. Station.  The minimum rate there for a man who went on for the first time in his first play was £2 10s. 0d.  I know that as a fact. In regard to the programmes, I have always criticised them on the ground that we are not paying for the best and so cannot expect the best.  The Minister may say, in reply, that he has not got the money, although he is in perfect sympathy with W.A.A.M.A.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned here that Radio Éireann should not be altogether a profit-making institution, that it should not be sending large amounts into the Central Exchequer year after year.  It will not do so this year, I am told, though I did not get the figure rightly when the Minister was reading it.  The Appropriation Accounts show that the amount transferred from Radio Eireann into the Central Fund in 1938-39 was £49,179 15s. 5d.; in 1939-40, £55,679 7s. 9d.: in 1940-41, £62,352 8s. 8d., and in 1941-42, £50,074 15s. 6d.  That shows an average profit of, roughly, £50,000 per year for those four years.  Surely, some of that money should have been sent back to improve the broadcasting service of the country?  After all, broadcasting is a <Col N="1771" /> very important thing.  I think it can do an immense amount of good within the country, and, as Deputy Sir John Esmonde said, it can have a very vital influence on our relations with outside countries.</P>
    <P>Of the money which comes in from wireless licence fees, a certain amount &mdash;a miserable amount&mdash;is spent on daily programmes.  The increase in the figure for the cost of daily programmes for the current year&mdash;£2,388&mdash;only means £1 an hour, when you work it out.  What can you do with that?  The Minister said that the majority of that is going in connection with the new radio choir, so what hope is there for the vocalists, the musicians, the authors or the actors?</P>
    <P>I felt this year that I would not say anything at all on this Estimate.  For the last four or five years I have bean speaking here, interviewing the Minister with representatives of W.A.A.M.A. and putting our case before him.  We get very sympathetic consideration, but sympathetic consideration is of very little use to people who have to work really hard.  There is the conception in this country and elsewhere that writers, actors and musicians are not workers, in the same sense as other workers.  I hold that they are.  They work very hard indeed, and they are not given remuneration commensurate with their ability; they are not paid anything like a living wage for their work by Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>So far as a dearth of variety talent is concerned, I may not be very fond of variety, but I think the best answer to that is that the cine-theatrical managers of Dublin have found, during the emergency period, that there is very good variety talent in this country. They are very glad to have that variety talent, and they have never done better box-office business than since this war broke out.  If the Minister or the Director of Radio Éireann want to look for variety talent, they will get it.  In the course of social functions here, we have all heard excellent singers and musicians; everywhere we go through the city and the county we hear excellent performers. They never get a chance in Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1772" /> It has been stressed here by Deputies that country performers very seldom get a chance on Radio Éireann.  They are offered a miserable fee of £1 or £2 for performing and out of that they are expected to pay their hotel bills and travelling expenses.  Of course, the amount they receive would never cover such expenses.  The Minister should bring this matter to the notice of the Government and give them some idea of what has been happening in the matter of wireless broadcasting.  It seems to me that wireless broadcasting assumes an importance on one day in the year, and that is the day when the Estimate is presented to the House.</P>

      <P>I am glad to follow Deputy McCann in this debate.  This is an issue in which I wish to join with him.  I think it is the most blackguardly machinery I have ever had to deal with.  At one time I was engaged as an artiste on the radio and I was paid what I demanded.  It is a bit better than it was.  Oh, what a dark little passage it was to get into that inner sanctum, and how they all gathered together to protect themselves! A little light has been thrown into that dark box, into the shelter.</P>
      <P>What a joke it is to think that Radio Éireann is the expression of the national consciousness, and the spiritual ebullitions of this country! Outside the few people who get their living by it, and the political organisation that uses it, what is the opinion of the world?  Go into any country in Europe, and they look on Radio Éireann simply as a joke.  Go to adjacent countries and it is regarded as a joke&mdash;when you can hear it.  Go to northern London&mdash; there you cannot hear it.  You may hear it at Newcastle or Portsmouth, but in Lancashire you cannot get a good Radio Éireann reception.</P>

In every other country in the world radio propaganda is carried on morning, noon and night, and people arc constantly seeking how to develop wireless, how to broaden it, how to improve it generally.  Here we are in a little shell; we may emerge in a small way, but we feel it is too cold and back we go again. Surely there are men and women in this country who have some knowledge of this form of communication.  What reception do they get from the conservative type of mind at the top?  I say that if the machinery we have is not equal to the occasion, scrap it.  God knows, it is about time that that machine was scrapped.</P>
    <P>When I went there to do a talk, one gentleman got the document, read it, and wanted to strike out a passage. &ldquo;Strike out nothing,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Either I talk to that script or I do not.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we cannot do it this way.&rdquo;&ldquo;That is all right with me,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I will scrap it for you.&rdquo;  Why should some types of men, such as we have in this country in certain censorship departments, endeavour to control the minds of men and women here?  Surely, some opportunity should be given to our people to express themselves, to tell the world what they think.  They dare not do that in Radio Éireann.  There are some people who would lose their immortal souls if that type of thing were allowed.  It would not do to have an individual saying something not quite in line with the Department in Merrion Street or the department in that little box.  If any man tried to do that, he might be cut off.</P>
    <P>No, they will not allow liberty of thought.  This is the one country where you cannot think.  We know how many persons are lying in jail simply because they wanted to express themselves, simply because they thought.  Radio Éireann will take care that you will not do anything unless you conform to their lines.  I would not care what a man or woman said, and I would not mind where they came from.  If you have ideals that <Col N="1774" /> are healthy and clean, surely the other fellow's ideals are not going to alter your mind or your convictions?  If you are not big enough to absorb the expressions of thought of the modern world, what kind of person are you? Arc you entitled to live at all?  Here you must get in a little box and act under the directions of other people.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCann suggests that these great artists we have cannot get an opportunity of expressing themselves. When I see some of these so-called variety artistes, I get a sour feeling in my stomach.  I do not know how anyone allows them to get into public life.  But there is talent in this country.  It is there, but it is not allowed to function.  It has to &ldquo;conform&rdquo;, and any people who &ldquo;conform&rdquo; without making a protest are not worth listening to.  Unfortunately, that is the type of mind we have to put up with.  The radio is the medium of conveying thought, and it should be over and above all that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>A friend of mine had a contract on the radio.  It was he who introduced what was called buying time.  He carried on a rather good programme and introduced good music.  Admittedly, it was the best thing done in this country.  A certain group of people got into power and they thought it would be a good idea to get a monopoly in this connection.  They broke the contract, which was handed to some of their friends.  I suppose someone had the idea that a person might buy time and say something that the radio people might not like.  Why should we not buy time when there is plenty of idle time every day and night in the week, all through the year?  Why cannot our people listen-in to the forms of entertainment they like? Why are they not allowed to know what the world is doing?  Oh, no, you must listen to what some little gentleman here thinks you ought to hear.</P>
    <P>I am as keen on the question of national culture as any man in the country.  If I were able to play football now I suppose I would be playing national football, but why should not the man who plays soccer have the right to put his case over the radio? <Col N="1775" /> I do not think there is any game equal to hurling.  I have played most games, baseball and every other.  I participated in them both inside, and outside of jail.  I even played a game of golf once.  I cannot understand this narrowness. If people believe in soccer, why should they not be allowed to express their views on it?  If you cannot do that over Radio Éireann, then I think the only thing is to get another machine that will enable one to do it. What advantage is there in denying the right to men and women to express their convictions and their culture?  If their convictions and culture are better than those of other people, then they are going to predominate.  Why deny them the right to convince you that theirs are better than yours?  Why all this tribulation of spirit and narrowness of view&mdash;narrowness which amounts to this: &ldquo;If I cannot do what I like then the other fellow will not be allowed to do what he likes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to the plays that have been given over Radio Éireann, I have noticed a lot of bad diction and bad timing.  The people taking part in them should be here in the Dáil.  One of the ways, I suggest, of educating our people would be to bring the microphone into the Dáil so that they might get an opportunity of knowing the different types we have here.  Deputy O'Donnell said that the only way to get the right atmosphere of Ireland was to get the cultural tones of Tipperary. There are all kinds of tones in this country.  My point is that the man in Rathmines or &ldquo;Rawthmines&rdquo; may have a better knowledge of sound values than the best man in Tipperary. Because of a certain mechanical arrangement, my voice, for example, may come over the radio as that of a good shouter, but the speech of another man with a weak voice may come over with a clear bell-like sound. No one, of course, could attempt to interfere with the mechanical arrangement of the radio except the engineers.</P>
    <P>In every county in Ireland you get different sound values.  If I were in a room and heard a number of men speaking, I could tell in a few minutes <Col N="1776" /> the county from which each came.  As regards sound values, there are difficulties in the matter of terminology and the phraseology used, plus certain other things.  The County Down man and the County Antrim man live quite close to one another, and yet there is a difference in their voices. Each expresses the beauty of the life he lives.  Is it not a wonderful thing to hear certain people on the continent speaking over the radio?  Their voices come over quite clearly, and even though one may not know the Italian language, is it not beautiful to hear it spoken?  I know a little Spanish myself, and when I hear a native of that country speaking over the radio I can almost tell the province he comes from.  It is the same with the German language.  I do not like it, not because of its Government. Is it not wonderful also to hear the Polish and Slav languages over the radio?  One can appreciate their beauty, even though one does not understand what is being said.  I once listened to a great poet who could not speak English, but the language he used was so beautiful I could understand him.  It is the same with the Irish language.  It is a pleasure to listen to when you hear a good speaker.  Unfortunately, I cannot speak the language myself.  My father was Spanish.  My sons ought to be Irish speakers.  They were educated by Patrick Pearse in one of the best schools in Ireland.  It may be due to a lack of intelligence in their father that he cannot speak Irish.  I wish to heavens I could speak it.  If I could, I would speak it and let some of you know what I think about you.</P>
    <P>There is a man in Dublin who is second to none as an Irish speaker.  I want to tell the Minister that he is not the man who was given a certain office. In my opinion, he is a better Irish scholar than some people who have been put in high office.  I knew Patrick Pearse and Thomas Ashe, both great Irishmen, but the man I speak of&mdash; Micheál Ó Maoláin&mdash;is one of the best Irish scholars in the country.  Deputy McCann talked about people getting £3 a week for their services from Radio Éireann.  Micheál Ó Maoláin had £1 a week.  I see some people <Col N="1777" /> shake their heads at that, but I understand that is all he got.  Will anybody who has heard Micheál Ó Maoláin over the radio deny that nothing could be more beautiful to listen to than his Irish speech?  Yet he was thrown out, even though he was getting only a miserable £1 a week.  He was too Irish for them.  I challenge anyone to deny that.  Thirty years ago, in an organisation which I belonged to, I engaged him to teach Irish.  We always had an Irish teacher in that organisation.  I know MacDonagh personally.  He is a wonderful man and ought to have control. My objection to all this is that I believe the whole atmosphere of the place is wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken one step forward, and I hope he will go further. I want to congratulate him on the radio orchestra and choir.  I think that was a great idea and that both are beautiful to listen to.  It is the best thing that has been done in connection with the radio service for a very long time.  Deputy McCann mentioned that there was a profit of £50,000.  Why should there be a profit when you are not doing the job?  Speaking of the orchestra, the members of it should be occupied all the time because any person who is a good musician lives his music all the time.  The same applies to the choir.  Their services should not be counted merely in the time occupied in giving a performance but should include the periods spent in preparing for these choir performances.  It is not the particular half-hour during which these men or women perform that matters, it is the time they have been preparing that matters.  It must be remembered that a poet is not made by the couple of lines he writes but must have been living those lines long before they were written.  We cannot expect men and women of talent to undertake work of an artistic character unless we provide them with superior comforts.  Give them the right to live and command recognition.  To offer £5 a week for front rank performers is an insult.</P>
    <P>Take instruments like the oboe, the violin or the 'cello, and consider how long those who play them have to devote to mastering them.  To offer <Col N="1778" /> them £5 a week is an insult.  We had two performances by a Belgian quartette in Dublin this week, and I am just wondering what terms they got for their visit.  I undertake to say that they got more for a few hours than artists in Dublin would get in a month.  What is the good of talking about a sense of dignity if it is not acted up to?</P>
    <P>I listened in to some of the musical items that were broadcast from the Dublin station and it was a joy to note the excellence of these performances. Tributes have recently been paid to the work of Sir William Rowan Hamilton. What is being done to popularise the work of that great Dublin composer, Balfe?  I was in Germany in 1932 and I found that Balfe's work was well known there.  He was recognised as a master in his sphere.  Generally speaking, I think the present-Minister has taken a step forward in broadcasting. I want to encourage him, and for that reason I hope he will do better things.  No Party in this House will say anything to him for doing so. There should not be any haggling about a few pounds.  Money should not go back to the Central Fund.  I urge the Minister not to bother about the Central Fund and not to worry if he is brought before the committee that deals with finances.  He should tell that committee that he was going to do his work and that in order to do so he would take any steps that he considered proper.  I should like to see Radio Eireann better known throughout the world and its programmes recognised, because that would be a tremendous contribution in Ireland's favour.  At the present time some of our best scholars and artists are not getting a living here.  Why not get them on the air to tell other countries what we are doing here?  Some day we will have to sit down at the same table with Russia and to give back some property that was taken, because Russia will be the predominant power in Europe.</P>
    <P>I was once arrested in Poland and when taken to the police depôt I told them I was from Ireland.  Strange as it may seem, they never heard of Ireland, although Poland is a country <Col N="1779" /> with which we have associations.  I was personally associated with the revolutionary movement there, yet the police in a Polish city did not know anything about Ireland.  They thought we Irish were British.  It is the same in other portions of the Continent.  When I was in Germany they thought Ireland was part of the British Empire.  Some people may think so.  I do not.  When I was in Norway I was asked why we called ourselves &ldquo;Irish&rdquo;.  When Norway was under Denmark Danish was the official language, but the Norwegians retained their own language. We are the only nation that did not retain our language.  We have not lost it, and I believe that the few who retain Irish and speak it will make the rest of our people learn it in the course of years.</P>
    <P>Other nations went through the same persecution as we in Ireland went through and did not give in.  I hope we will fight to restore the national language. If we are to give expression to the views of our people let us not copy the methods of a second rate empire. Let us have pride in our own country. I urge on the Minister greater use of the radio to strengthen the convictions of our people and to let the world know that the Irish nation is undefeated and indivisible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been following year by year the programmes in Radio Éireann, and as one who has followed them with a certain amount of critical interest I admit the continued improvement that has taken place.  Quality has been improved and there is greater variety.  It has been admitted on all sides that the Minister has taken a keen interest in the welfare of the station and that, with the limited means at his disposal and the difficulties with which he has to contend in present circumstances, he has done a tremendous amount of good.  In all the circumstances, both he and the staff deserve the congratulations of the House.  I have been pressing the Minister to give us more of these programmes. Everybody admits that it is a great pity that Radio Éireann closes down after a very short afternoon programme and again after a short evening <Col N="1780" /> programme, but we have been told that financial circumstances preclude longer performances.  As a result of questions on the previous Vote it was admitted that the Department acts as an agent for other Departments without remuneration, and I suggest that some arrangement should be made to get payment for such services, which could be used to provide extra broadcasting hours for the public.  That seems to be only fair.  If in present circumstances a good deal of time has to be given to the broadcasting of information about new Orders arising out of the emergency, the Minister should be able to recover from other Departments credit for services rendered, as the remuneration received could be used to provide extra broadcasting hours for the public and, if possible, extra remuneration for the talent employed by the station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that on occasions one can hear outside street noises coming through with the programme.  There seems to be a defect in the station, as a result of which, when windows are opened, one can hear outside noises.  I have often heard boys shouting the late editions of the papers during a programme, and I suggest that the matter be examined from a technical point of view.  There may be something in what Deputy Cosgrave suggests, that the station has outlived its usefulness and that the time has arrived when we ought to consider whether we should not get more suitable premises and do more justice to the station's broadcasts. I have already mentioned to the Minister that, in connection with the value of the station from the national point of view, the time has come when the records used for the playing of the National Anthem should be scrapped and the National Anthem played in a much improved manner.  I remember being at the Theatre Royal recently when the National Anthem was played in a most inspiring manner.  I think that anybody who heard it rendered on that occasion felt, for the first time, really proud of his National Anthem. It was played then with brass instruments, blended with pipes and the organ, and I begged the Minister at the time to go there and hear it, and <Col N="1781" /> see whether arrangements could not be made to have a record taken of that rendering of the National Anthem.</P>
    <P>I am told that there are some technical difficulties, that a record lasts only for a certain space of time, but from the point of view of the way in which the broadcast of our National Anthem is heard abroad, a great improvement can be made.  It is quite true that while the Minister has to have regard, as a general rule, to what listeners at home want to hear, it must also be remembered that our station is listened to abroad.  There are difficulties even in Éire in getting good reception of our station, and there are areas abroad where good reception is not obtained, but there are other places abroad where the station is listened to with great interest.  When I was in a neighbouring country not so very long ago, I was told by a number of people that the news as given from Radio Éireann is looked forward to with interest by people in that country, because, while they get the news in a perfectly neutral way, they get all the news. That indicates that our station is listened to.</P>
    <P>I heard a Deputy suggest that we had not got a proper wave-length, and that the existing wave-length should be changed.  Anybody who has studied this matter knows that the wave-length of a radio station has to be agreed on at what is called an international convention.  These international conventions are not held now, and I suppose that, in war conditions, other people are broadcasting almost on our wave-length, and consequently anything we may do here will not improve the situation.  We might move our wave-length into somebody else's wave-length, and get even worse confusion than we have on occasions in parts of the country.  Further, there are a variety of wave-lengths, long, medium, and short, all of which serve different technical purposes.</P>
    <P>So far as this country is concerned, I think the Minister and his staff deserve to be highly congratulated on the excellent opportunities we now get for listening to very excellent symphony concerts, and to very beautiful renderings of opera during the season. We have also a choir and a certain <Col N="1782" /> amount of variety entertainment, and, generally speaking, the licence holder who pays his 12/6 per year is, in my opinion, getting much better value than he ever got before.  I will admit that we are far from being perfect. Many improvements and developments remain to be carried out, but we must remember that in present circumstances it is impossible to get the apparatus to build a new station.  We must also remember that in the last four or five years developments have taken place in the radio world, and when we come to instal new or additional plant, we must have regard to those developments.</P>
    <P>Before the war broke out, certain developments had taken place in regard to television.  One does not know how far it will have developed, and to what extent and how soon it will become available to the general public when the war is over; but I hope that the technical staff is keeping itself well informed of all these developments, and that, side by side with the improvements in relation to programmes, and so on, which the Minister is introducing, when we have an opportunity of getting back in normal times to developing radio services for ourselves, and for the outside world, to the extent of whatever value it might have for this country, we shall take into account the latest developments at the disposal of the world.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record that any time I had occasion&mdash;and I am sure it is the experience of every Deputy&mdash; to write or speak to the Minister in regard to the station, I have always found a willingness to listen and every effort made to try to meet whatever complaints were made.  There may be a lot in what Deputy McCann says about certain artists not getting good salaries and so forth, but, speaking, as I am trying to speak, on behalf of the person who pays the piper, the licence holder who wants value for his 12/6, I can say that he shows a greater satisfaction with the station, but also expresses a wish for an extension of the afternoon programme of records and, if possible, the opening of the station from 1 o'clock or 1.30 until 11 p.m. without a break.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the director on the improvement that has been made in the programmes within the past 12 months.  Of course, a great deal yet remains to be done, but there is one thing for which he deserves great credit, and that is in connection with the lunchtime concerts. Up to a few months ago we had to listen to nothing but crooning and jazzing every day for two hours.  If <Col N="1784" /> that had continued, I am quite satisfied that we would have very little music in this country within the next generation. I should also like to impress on the Minister the necessity for extending the hours of broadcasting.  If he cannot see his way to extend the lunchtime concerts on week days, I do not think it is too much to ask that we should have extended afternoon programmes on Sundays, especially in the winter time.  People are wont to sit at home in the afternoons after their lunch and, if they want to listen-in to a radio programme, they have no alternative but to tune-in to British or other stations.  I think that it is not too much to ask that from 2.30 p.m. until 6 p.m., the hour at which the station now reopens, there should be a continuous performance of good Irish music or good music from any country.</P>
      <P>A couple of years ago we asked the Minister to let us have the news earlier on Sundays.  As a result, he has given us news at 6.40 in the evening.  I would suggest that we should have that news at 1.45 or 1.40, the same as on week days.  Some years ago I also drew the attention of the Minister to the fact that the reception from Radio Éireann in Wexford was extremely bad.  I want to tell him now that it was never worse than it is at the present time.  Apart from the fact that there is a shrill whistling noise coming through&mdash;I understand that it is coming through in various parts of Ireland&mdash;it is absolutely impossible to get any reception in Wexford town from Radio Éireann, especially on Sunday nights.  Question Time on Sunday nights is a very interesting item and many people like to listen to it.  For the last few Sundays I have endeavoured to listen-in to it, but I could not hear a single word. Not one word of Question Time can be heard distinctly in Wexford town.  At 10.50 last Sunday night I tried to hear Seán Ó, Ceallacháin's talk on Gaelic sports, but not one word could I hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I raised this matter some years ago in the Dáil the Minister was good enough to send somebody to Wexford to find out what the cause was.  I do not know what the cause was, but I do know that there was an improvement immediately afterwards. <Col N="1785" /> But it was never so bad as it is at the present time.  Surely there must be some reason for that.  It is not too much to ask, when people are paying their licence fees year after year, that some attention should be paid to complaints that I know have been sent to the Minister's Department in connection with this matter.  I do hope that the Minister will make a serious effort within a very short time so that the people in that particular area will get the radio reception to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>For the last two or three years I have tried to induce the Minister to let us have the Irish news before the other news.  In the British news at 6 o'clock we hear all about the war. Of course we do not hear the other side, but we get a little of that from Radio Éireann.  But sometimes we have to listen for 20 minutes to Radio Éireann giving a re-hash of what we have heard in the British news at 6 o'clock, while we cannot hear some important Irish news which we want to hear until the war news is finished. Surely the Irish news should be given first.  We hear the headings of the news and we may be told that there is some important announcement to be made, perhaps on behalf of some Government Department which we, as members of the Dáil, are interested in. We may be unable to wait for 20 minutes while Radio Éireann is rehashing what we heard in the British news at 6 o'clock.  Why is it we cannot have the Irish news first?  Surely there is nothing against that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin and Deputy McCann referred to the fees paid to actors and actresses, and I wish to join in the protest made by these Deputies. Those two Deputies I am sure are mostly concerned with Dublin actors and actresses.  But, when you compare their position with that of people who have to come up from the country for an audition or to take part in a programme, I think it will be found that the Dublin actors and actresses are &ldquo;in clover&rdquo; by comparison.  The fees given to provincial artists who come to Dublin, especially in present circumstances when fares are so high and it is impossible for them to get <Col N="1786" /> back for a couple of days, are absolutely inadequate.  I suggest to the Minister that he should get somebody who understands the situation, who realises what these people have to go through in order to perfect themselves to take part in a Radio Éireann programme, to examine into this question and try to give those people a decent fee.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCann suggested that there should be a permanent company of actors and actresses attached to Radio Éireann.  I suggest to Deputy McCann that that might not be altogether a success.  I think we would get tired of listening to the same people night after night and week after week.  I also think that, if that were brought about, Dublin would have a monopoly of the whole thing and that provincial artists would not get an opportunity at all.</P>
    <P>I agree, however, that there should be some actors and actresses permanently attached to Radio Eireann. So far as variety entertainments are concerned, I have heard some of these supposed variety artists through the medium of Radio Eireann, and I would be ashamed to say that some of them belonged to this country.  Some of them have been trying to ape British comedians who entertain people on the other side of the water who have not the sense of humour that we have, trying to imitate British comedians who would not be listened to on an Irish stage.  I believe that some care should be exercised in the selection of artists of that kind.  We have magnificent artists in this country, magnificent violinists and singers and other artists. I suggest that we are not making an effort to secure the services of these people.  I hope the Minister will pay attention to the few points that have been made by different Deputies. Again I say that we should have the Irish news before we get a re-hash of the English news, and I ask the Minister to pay special attention to the area which I represent, to the people there who are paying for licences and who, night after night, are unable to get any reception from Radio Eireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good deal of discussion on this question <Col N="1787" /> of wireless broadcasting.  I think it has emerged that the general dissatisfaction with our broadcasting which is felt outside this House is echoed by the Deputies within it.  It is easy to say that in regard to such a service each of us has his individual point of view and that wireless broadcasting cannot attempt to cater for each individual taste.  It cannot do that, but it can entertain and it can educate, and I am afraid Radio Eireann is not giving the best entertainment and the best education that it could give to our people.  I regard entertainment and education as the two great functions of wireless broadcasting. That does not seem to be realised by the Government here, and I should like to impress that point on the Minister.</P>
      <P>In the sphere of entertainment what do we do?  With the exception of the radio orchestra, which is very good, and the choir, which is also good, we really have nothing that we can be proud of.  The rest of our programme is like a parish concert.  We get, perhaps, a first-class pianist sandwiched in between, perhaps, an indifferent contralto and a first-class tenor.  Even if the quality of the performance of the three persons were first class, the very fact that the vocal items are included in the programme with the piano solo destroys continuity.  That is a point which does not appear to receive sufficient attention in Radio Eireann.  I do not know how that can be avoided.  It calls for a good deal more planning.</P>
      <P>In connection with planning, I should like to pay a tribute, to the Director of Broadcasting.  He has improved it a great deal but the planning which would be necessary in Radio Eireann is something that no one man could do.  In that connection, I would suggest to the Minister that an advisory council of prominent persons should be formed to assist in this matter.  The programmes from Radio Eireann do not reveal the thought and very careful planning that we would expect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the hours of broadcasting, some Deputies have <Col N="1788" /> referred to the shortness of the period.  I think I am correct in stating that the time occupies about 6½ hours per day.  With all due respect to Deputy Briscoe and his 10/- licence fee&mdash;I was under the impression it was 12/6&mdash;the public are not getting proper value in 6½ hours.  We make no effort to give any broadcasts to the schools during school hours.  Surely it would be possible to do that.  I know there have been individual broadcasts for school children and they have been good but, again, in that connection, there is lack of continuity, they are not followed up.  No child can take up a subject and follow it to its logical conclusion through the radio programme. I am sure we would all like to have continuity in programmes, so that children or adults could take up a particular series on the wireless and follow it to the end.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to dance music.  I hold no brief for jazz music.  Personally, I switch off the radio when it is being broadcast.</P>

      <P>I like dancing but I do not like dance music on the radio.  That is a personal viewpoint and I feel that, being a great lover of classical music, I should put forward the case for those who like dance music.  Such people have been ignored.  That particular type of music is not broadcast now.  These people have paid their 12/6 and they are entitled to their point of view.  I think the action of the authorities in this respect is part of that attitude to which Deputy Larkin referred&mdash; another manifestation of a niggling disposition towards the public.  In all seriousness, I would ask the Minister to look into the question of having an advisory council set up and to make up his mind as to what proportion of time should be devoted to education and what proportion should be devoted to entertainment and not to give the public what I might call bits and snippets of things&mdash;very entertaining for a short time but not getting anybody who is really interested in a subject anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> I know there are and have been very excellent musical broadcasts.  I listened last night with the greatest pleasure to that very fine musician, Dr. Larchet, giving an explanation of next Sunday's radio concert.  It was a very delightful thing to listen to and very well done.  There are other very fine talks&mdash;the horticultural ones, I think, are infinitely better than the talks given on other wireless programmes, which are a great deal more publicised. I should like to see an extension of that type of broadcasting to a whole variety of subjects.  I should like to see the children specially catered for and catered for regularly at a time early in the day.  I do not think the time at which children's talks are given at present is sufficiently early for young children.  In all seriousness, I commend these points to the Minister and I hope he will be able to do something about them.</P>

      <P>I do not want to say very much, but I was interested in hearing Deputy Maurice Dockrell's remarks as to the function of Radio Eireann in regard to his education, or, perhaps, he meant our education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but then it seemed to me that the Deputy was asking the Minister to educate us all, through Radio Éireann, and asking us to go through a kind of State test, so to speak, as to whether we were serving the cause of Cathleen ní Houlihán or not, but it must be remembered that the Minister cannot hope to educate us all into working for all the things that the service of Cathleen ní Houlihán might require.  I quite admit that if I were Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to-morrow, I doubt very much whether Deputy Little would allow me to arrange for his education through the means of Radio Éireann, and for just the same reason I do not see why the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should endeavour to arrange for my education.  There is a very serious problem involved here in this matter of teaching us what our tastes should be.  For instance, I am an ordinary <Col N="1790" /> country publican, but I have no doubt that my taste, as regards music or other matters, is as good as that of anybody else, and I do not want my taste with regard to musical or other matters to be raised or depressed by anything that the Minister or his Department may decree.  The business of education is a very serious matter, and I have seen no evidence, either from Radio Éireann, the B.B.C., the N.B.C., or the C.B.C. to show that the items they broadcast are of very much educational value.</P>
      <P>I can always listen-in to the broadcasts of any of these Radio corporations, and if I do not like one broadcast, thanks be to God, I can turn it off and turn on to another, and I am sure that that applies to everybody else in this country.  I must say, however, that, as a rule, the programmes supplied by Radio Éireann are of a deplorably mediocre character, but we must remember that we are suffering under certain very great difficulties at the moment, and also that we suffer under difficulties, even in normal times, to which other countries are not subject. It is true to say that it is rather difficult for Radio Éireann to supply, for every one of the 365 days of the year, different and entertaining items for every day in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite admit that there are great difficulties involved, but I often wonder whether something could not be done to make for a greater variety in our programmes.  For instance, I often wonder whether any use has been made, or could be made, of the annual prize-winning concert at the Feis Ceoil.  It has seemed to me, listening to these annual prize-winning concerts, that there is a surplus of first-class talent available, but I have never seen any attempt made to have that talent assembled for the purposes of Radio Éireann.  No doubt, it is gratifying enough for these artists to have attained outstanding achievements at the Feis Ceoil, but one would imagine that Radio Éireann would be on the <i>qui vive</i> to give these artists a chance to broadcast over our wireless.  In that way, I think it would be possible to build up three or four excellent programmes of sufficient length for the <Col N="1791" /> purposes of Radio Éireann.  Apart from the prize-winners at the Feis, there are also the people who get second, third and fourth place, and, very often, it puzzles the judges to decide which of the candidates should be awarded a prize.  Now, I do not know that I have ever heard of anybody in Radio Éireann introducing to their audience a singer or musician who had been a runner-up at the Feis, and surely there must be an abundance of material there to provide for a number of concerts.  I cannot recall ever having heard anything of that sort being done.</P>
    <P>Now, if there is any doubt in anybody's mind about the ability, of our Radio Éireann Orchestra&mdash;about which I have no doubt, because I think they can compare very favourably with any other orchestra that has broadcast&mdash;I think it would be dispelled as a result of their recent performance of the Dvorak Concerto, with the assistance of a lady guest pianist.  That performance was given by our own Radio Éireann Orchestra, and it certainly could be compared with anything that could be given by the B.B.C.  Now, I am sure that there is quite a number of orchestras in this country which could perform concerto music very efficiently, and I think it is an ignorant outrage on the part of Radio Éireann that those who want to hear such music should be debarred from hearing it, or on the other hand, that those who want to hear dance music or, if you like, &ldquo;jazz&rdquo; music, should be debarred from hearing it.  I must confess that I like dance music.  I am not addicted to what is called &ldquo;swing&rdquo; music, because I cannot understand it, but I am quite prepared to admit that if one could understand it, it might prove to have very excellent characteristics.</P>
    <P>Why, then, should not the public be afforded an opportunity of listening to such music, if they wish to do so? It is on a par with asking why the public should not be allowed to listen to classical symphonic music if they wish to listen to it.  I can imagine, for instance, that our grandmothers, on seeing paintings by Van Gogh, <Col N="1792" /> would have considered them an outrage. I think it was Ruskin who described Whistler's paintings as the throwing of a paint-pot at a wall, and if our Minister for Posts and Telegraphs were alive at that time, and had the same views as Mr. Ruskin, he would have ordered all of Whistler's paintings to be thrown into the Thames, because that is more or less what Ruskin advocated at that time but at the same time it must be remembered that in those days, those who wanted to adore at the shrine of Whistler, or at the shrine of Landseer, were allowed to do so, while those who wished to adore at other shrines were also allowed to do so.  Quite possibly, in a few years' time, public opinion in this country may change again with regard to these matters, but our Minister for Posts and Telegraphs evidently takes the view that because he or his advisers do not like &ldquo;swing&rdquo; music, or because the seagreen, incorruptible followers of Cathleen ní Houlihán do not like &ldquo;swing&rdquo; music and are prepared to put up with the endless caterwaulings of certain céilidhe bands, other people must put up with it.  Why should I not be allowed to listen to &ldquo;swing&rdquo; music, if I wish to do so, or why should I not be allowed to listen to céilidhe band music, if I wish to do so?  I think it is just ignorant narrow-minded bigotry, on the part of those who want to hear one type of music, to deny the opportunity to others to hear a different type of music which, admittedly, may not have a very wide appeal.  I think that this eternal broadcasting of céilidhe band music is a great hardship because, to those of us who do not appreciate it, in the absence of the dance itself, it is a tedium.  However, nobody, finding céilidhe band music to be a tedium in the absence of the dance itself, would complain about it, if other forms of music were combined with it. If a type of music, which some people do not like, is broadcast on one or two nights of the week, they can turn it off and wait for the night when the other type of music would be broadcast. On the other hand, those who want céilidhe band music can turn off the other type of music and wait for <Col N="1793" /> the nights on which their own type of music will be broadcast, but it is ridiculous to thrust the one type of music down our throats all the time, particularly in view of the fact that other and higher forms of Irish music are rejected.</P>
    <P>The best traditional Irish music, in my opinion, came from the Belfast radio station.  I called the attention of the director of our station to that, and asked whether or not the services of the lady concerned in those Belfast broadcasts could be availed of here.  I think he answered that he was inquiring into the matter, but I do not know what happened as a result.  I think it is only very rarely that you hear good traditional Irish music through Radio Éireann, but good exponents of that type of music are available, however rare they may be, and I think the services of such people should be availed of by our Department.</P>
    <P>Now, bearing in mind the difficulties that our director has to face as a result of the low fees that are paid to artistes, surely we ought to develop some kind of reciprocal arrangements with the B.B.C.  There is no use in our saying that in this country, at any conceivable date, we can hope to have the services of a symphonic orchestra or of great artistes such as the B.B.C. can command, and it is highly unlikely that we can bring here great artistes of international reputation, simply because their fees would be quite beyond our capacity to pay.  But it does seem highly likely that on occasions of great broadcasts from the B.B.C., we should be able to get them by overhead wire and relay them from Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>I remember, just before the war, Toscanini conducted the Nine Symphonies of Beethoven in London.  So far as I know, not a single one of them was relayed to this country, and they were undoubtedly amongst the greatest performances of these Nine Symphonies given in this century.  There are many other foreign and domestic artistes to whom the people would like to listen here.  I do not know whether other Deputies have the same experience as I have, but since the war I have found that no British station is clearly audible in this country.  They <Col N="1794" /> all tend to become distorted.  There are many broadcasts which people would like to hear, and which could conveniently be relayed to this country.  In this way, by turning to Radio Éireann, you could get your home programme and anything outstanding in the British programme.  I do not know whether we would have broadcasts here which the B.B.C. would care to have relayed, but I have no doubt, if such were available, a similar arrangement could be made by Radio Éireann to give to the B.B.C. whatever we had.  I suppose money is a nominal consideration in all these matters.  Am I not correct in saying that the present situation is that Radio Éireann is getting more in licences than it is expending?  Is Radio Éireann still costing the taxpayer something?</P>

      <P>If the Government want to establish a monopoly in radio, I think there is a great deal to be said for that course, but then they ought to recognise that they are not entitled to seek a profit out of it, and if the income is not sufficient to provide programmes of a proper standard, then the taxes should be made liable for any further expenditure necessary.  If the Government is not prepared to help from the Exchequer they ought to leave it to private enterprise to provide programmes.  I would prefer that the community should provide the programme rather than that the service should be left to private enterprise as is done in the United States, but the Government, because of the fact that we do leave it to them, should not labour under the delusion that they are entitled to give us mediocre programmes and to say in their defence: &ldquo;Oh, well, that is all we can afford from the income we get.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Corish refer to the desirability of providing Irish news first and then the world news subsequently. I think there is a good deal to be said for that.  The news given out in Radio Éireann is very largely a recapitulation of the information <Col N="1795" /> available from the B.B.C.  That is, of course, inevitable, coming as it does at a later time, but it does seem reasonable, if there is any matter of local interest, that we should get it first and then get the Irish version of world affairs thereafter.  I, however, do not listen very often when the opportunity is afforded me, to the news broadcast at 10 o'clock.  I should be interested to hear from the Minister if there is any improvement in the fantastic propaganda partiality that used to disfigure that broadcast. For a very long time it was used as a cheap publicity service for the purpose of suggesting that Fianna Fáil Ministers were marvels and that all that they said in this House was all that was worth broadcasting to the country.  When any member of the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party or of the Independent group spoke their observations were practically ignored, but any member of the Fianna Fáil Party who said anything, however imbecile, was reported exhaustively. The grosser imbecilities were studiously eliminated from the report, of course, so that the speaker was made to appear intelligible to the country. I have no objection to that service for members of the Fianna Fáil Party provided the intelligent members of the House were honestly reported, but that they certainly were not.  I should be interested to hear if there has been any improvement along these lines.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the last thing I want to say, that my experience of how things can be twisted by the method in which they are presented to the public makes me extremely chary of suggestions that Radio Éireann should undertake our education.  Mind you, I do not think in honesty that you could ever say of the Radio Éireann news service that it ever said what was untrue&mdash;it is always too careful for that&mdash;but it managed to present the truth in such a form that anyone listening to it would go away believing a lie.  That is a very subtle and dangerous thing to do.  When I say that, I am referring to those reports of the proceedings in Dáil Éireann.  They were insidious; they were dishonest; <Col N="1796" /> they were time-serving and, I believe, drafted for the purpose of making Fianna Fáil propaganda by members of the Radio Éireann staff who would be better employed doing their work honestly.  Whether the Minister directly influenced them to do that, I am not in a position to say.  Certain it is that he was gravely remiss in not rebuking them very sternly for their grave failure to edit reports honestly and fairly.  Whether his sluggard conscience has been stirred since the last time this Estimate was discussed in the House I am not in a position to say. If it has, well and good; but if it has not, it is time something was done about it.  That very ability to pervert the truth in order to deceive, to pervert the truth in order to mislead, to pervert the truth in order to corrupt, should put us all on our guard lest we be carried away by some specious proposal that the education of the public should be entrusted to Radio Éireann. It is a most unsuitable body to undertake the task.</P>
    <P>If the mature population of this country stands in need of education, then I prefer to leave it to our universities and the Churches to which we belong&mdash;the Protestant Church or the Catholic Church.  I have no desire to commit it into the hands of bureaucracy or of the Government because I am entirely satisfied, from my experience of Governmental efforts in that direction, that far from seeking to educate, they will seek to corrupt; far from seeking to illuminate the public mind they will seek to obscure; far from seeking to communicate the truth they will seek to withhold it.  All these activities are the very negation of education and can very skilfully mislead an innocent people.  I do not want Radio Eireann to educate me or anybody else; I want them to entertain me, to give me news and information of which I can be the best judge.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as meaning that I deprecate such talks as that on horticulture to which Deputy Dockrell referred.  I am glad to be able to say that the standard of that allocution is as good as anything we could get from Britain or anywhere else.  I do think it would be a most <Col N="1797" /> useful thing if some of our scientists would deliver disquisitions or discourses of that character in connection with farming problems.  For instance, if somebody would deliver a discourse at the present time as to why slugs and worms are eating potatoes, as they never eat them before, or why they eat Kerrs Pinks in preference to Golden Wonders, that would be something which we would all appreciate from Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>If some of our distinguished scientists in agriculture would give us a discourse at present on how best to abate red rust on the top of oats, he would discharge a very useful service, because very few people seem to know that the only way to get rid of it is to eliminate the buckthorn.  We badly need someone in Radio Eireann to tell us what the buckthorn is, and if we could get some practical men to give information of that kind and educate us in that way it would be a very useful service.  I do not regard it as education&mdash;at least, the furthest I would be prepared to go would be to describe it as technical education.  If Radio Éireann would impart some technical education to the men on current agricultural problems, and teach the women a few supplementary dishes with which to adorn our tables, and household tricks to make our homes more comfortable, let the education stop there.  When that is done, they should turn to entertainment and the other functions proper to Radio Eireann, and if they discharge them with reasonable competence there will be very little complaint in Dáil Éireann or anywhere else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Dockrell that the main functions of Radio Eireann should be to educate us and to entertain us.  I put education definitely first.  There is a wonderful opportunity in the hands of our people to provide the adult population with increased education on all subjects, and I would like to point out what has been done in the last century, in Denmark, for example.  An economic miracle was performed there in the adult education of the Danish people.  They were inspired, first of all, with a patriotic feeling, to grapple <Col N="1798" /> with the economic problems which faced them.  As a result of the intensive adult education which was provided, they were able to surmount the most difficult economic problems that ever faced a nation in living memory. If the promoters of that education had at their disposal such a service as Radio Eireann, would they not have willingly, thankfully, availed of it? Would they not have saved a considerable amount of organisation and work in providing teachers in the schools throughout the length and breadth of the country?</P>
      <P>We have here an opportunity to provide adult education for our people through Radio Eireann.  Much has been said about providing education for children, but I think they are getting all the education they are able to deal with.  We are spending over £5,000,000 on primary and secondary education and we have a huge army of teachers of every kind, quite sufficient to cater for the needs of our children.  But for adult education we have no service whatever which could compare in economy and efficiency with Radio Eireann, if it were properly directed towards that object.</P>
      <P>I do not share the fears of Deputy Dillon.  I think it is quite possible and reasonable to expect that the Directors of Radio Éireann are capable of providing something similar to what was provided in Denmark in the last century&mdash;that is, an education which raises the moral tone of the people, gives them an interest in national culture, and at the same time the technical knowledge which Deputy Dillon appears to applaud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Dillon, I have not got that superiority complex which inspires me with the idea that I know everything.  I have never pretended that I know everything.  I am sufficiently humble to go to any school, if I have the time, and learn the subject taught.  If I were a citizen of Denmark in the last century, I would have been only too happy to attend the folk schools which were provided and learn Danish singing, history <Col N="1799" /> and the technical subjects taught there.  If I had the time, I would be quite willing to imbibe similar knowledge from Radio Eireann, if more courses were provided.</P>
      <P>One of the disadvantages of educational broadcasts is that the listeners are not organised, for example, in classes to listen.  If we had some kind of co-operation between Radio Éireann and an organisation such as Muintir na Tíre, which would provide classes of listeners in every rural area, and if we had each week an educational broadcast, varied over the subjects I have mentioned, paying particular attention to technical knowledge on horticulture and agriculture, while at the same time imparting some cultural knowledge, it would be an ideal arrangement and would make for a definite improvement in our programmes. I realise that the Minister is handicapped to a certain extent, inasmuch as we have to endeavour in our programmes to advance the Irish language. For people who do not know the Irish language, the amount of listening time which they are able to enjoy from Radio Éireann may be curtailed; but we cannot do anything about that.  The only remedy would be to extend the time for broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing we should do: we should brighten our programmes somewhat. The Minister referred to the dearth of variety artistes in this country. There seems to be, not only a dearth but a complete absence of variety.  There is a definite demand for brighter and lighter programmes. Much has been said about cultural entertainment and classical music, but the average citizen likes to have a little of the lighter and brighter entertainment, when he is tired after his daily toil.  Radio Eireann appears to be absolutely incapable of providing that type of entertainment.  It would appear as if we had completely lost our sense of humour.  Very rarely do we hear any jokes on the Irish radio programme, and when we do, they are either of a vulgar type or are offensive. I know it is very hard to make a joke, except at your own expense, without hurting someone's feelings.  It is particularly <Col N="1800" /> hard for an institution such as Radio Éireann, which is public property, to indulge in any light amusement or comedies of any kind.  I fully appreciate the Minister's difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some comments have been made upon the various types of accent used by our announcers.  One thing I should like to refer to is the exaggeration of the accents of the different counties.  It is quite all right to get the natural accent of the different counties, but when you exaggerate it, as they usually do in Radio Éireann&mdash;we have the Cork and the Northern accents exaggerated&mdash;it becomes very tiring on the nerves. Another tiresome thing is listening to the same voices in all dramatisations. It appears as if the same artistes are taking part in all these dramatisations, because they use the same tone of voice and it is extremely tiring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as news is concerned, I think there are a few things wrong.  One is, as other Deputies have pointed out, the Irish news should definitely come first.  We should get a little more Irish news and a little less of the re-hash of war news.  I think the majority of people who want to hear war news prefer to hear it direct from the different belligerent nations.  They get it full-blooded and wholeheartedly from them, instead of the milk and water re-hash from our station&mdash;which is necessary, of course.  But I think it is not necessary for our station to <Col N="1801" /> give long lists of planes shot down, ships sunk, or tanks shot up.  That is not news at all; it is merely propaganda padded out for the various official reports from the belligerent States.  I think that definitely should be cut out in our programme.  What we would like to hear is any item of home news.  That should be given full publicity from our station, instead of confining the news altogether to war happenings.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is the end of the news, and I am now going to give you greyhound racing results.&rdquo; These are words which I think grate harshly on the ears of our people night after night.  I do not see why we should broadcast from our station greyhound racing results. No intelligent person wants to hear them.</P>

      <P>Rinneadh tagairt do chraoladh cainnt na dTeachtaí sa Dáil.  Isé mo thuairim nach ceart í chraoladh chor ar bith.  Is minic a bhíonn cainnt na Dála ar siúl ar an radio ar feadh fiche no triocha nóimeat agus, do réir mar a chloisim daoine ag cur síos air, cuireann sé déistean ortha, go mórmhór nuair a chuimhníonn siad go bhfeicfe siad uilig é ar na nuachtáin lá ar n-a bhárach.  Ar ndóigh, dá mbeadh aon scéal ón Dáil a bheadh tábhachtach thar an gcoiteann, ba mhaith leis an lucht éisteachta é chloisteáil, ach ní hiondual go mbíonn aon rud ar siúl nach bhféadfadh fanacht le na páipéiríbh.</P>
      <P>I dtaobh labhairt na Gaedhilge ar an radio, ba mhaith liom a rá nar cheart ach na cainnteoirí is fearr a leigint ag cainnt ann.  I ngnáthchúrsaíbh agus caidrimh an tsaoil tá fáilte agam i gcomhnaí roimh chineál ar bith Gaedhilge dá dhonacht é&mdash; b'fhearr liom é ná an Béarla dá fheabhas.  Tá Béarlóirí breághtha sa Tigh seo, agus díreach ar an adhbhar sin labhruigheann siad an iomarca agus líonann siad leabhra na dTuarascbhál le cainnt a thasbáineann nach bhfuil aon stuaim intleachta faoi leith aca seachas fonn cainnte, agus is furasta a aithint go bhféadfaí a gcuid tuairimí a nochtadh sa deichiú cuid den am.  Dá labhróchadh na Teachtaí i nGaedhilge ní thárlódh sé sin, go fóilleach ar chuma ar bith.  Tá meas agam ar dhroch-Ghaedhilge ó na daoinibh nach bhfuil leigheas aca air, ach ní gá é a leigint ar an radio mar tá togha na gcainnteoirí le fáil de chuile chanúint.  Agus is mian liom a admháil go gcuireann sé glionndar croidhe orm a bheith ag éisteacht le cuid den chainnt Ghaedhealach a bhionn ar an radio agus ní hé an chuid is lugha de ach oiread.  Is mór agus is iongantach an feabhas atá tagaithe ar an radio le na bliantaibh, agus is &ldquo;le mo theangan i mo phluic&rdquo; beagnach a dhéanfainn aon chainnt cháinteach ina thaobh.</P>

Ach tá seanchaidhthe ann atá i ndon snas agus spéisiúlacht agus craiceann neachoitianta a chur ar gach a n-abruigheann siad, dá shimplí é.

      <P>The Minister pointed out that one of the difficulties that presented itself to him and those in control of broadcasting was the number of people of very dissimilar tastes that they had to cater for.  I agree with the Minister that that is a problem to be faced and met, but one way of meeting it is not by saying, &ldquo;I am going to decide what tastes best in everybody's mouth.&rdquo;  Taking the middle portion of the Minister's statement with the end portion, the former faced up to the fact that there are people with dissimilar tastes and views, and that it was the function of those responsible for a broadcasting entertainment programme to please all as best they could, and entertain all as best they could.  But the Minister wound up by laying down the law that only one particular class of taste had to be catered for.  I disagree with that.  I agree heartily with the views put forward by Deputy Dillon as far as the lighter <Col N="1804" /> side of the programme goes.  If some people like jazz music and others prefer ceilidhe music, why not have a bit of both?  It is unreasonable for a Department such as the Minister's to decide exactly what type of music people will get, irrespective of taste, and what type of music they will not get.  The air hovering in and around this country belongs to the whole lot of us. It is not the monopoly, or the private preserve, of any Government Department, or political Party, and the programmes that come to us over the air, provided at the expense of all the taxpayers, should cater for all the peculiar views and tastes of these various taxpayers.</P>
      <P>On the whole, I think that the Department is to be congratulated.  I am not a wireless fan.  I rarely listen in except to hear the news, or a broadcast of a football match, or a race meeting or something of that kind.  I know a great many people who, a year or two ago, were very critical, and expressed the very great and general dissatisfaction that prevailed with regard to our broadcasting effort.  Since then these same people have, on the whole, become very appreciative of the improved programmes and better entertainment now given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, my interest in broadcasting as an individual confines itself to switching on the wireless at certain hours of the day for news items, and it is on that particular aspect that I want to address the Minister.  We have certain hours in our programme devoted to news.  Well, I think that is a thing that we are not given at all.  I think that no attempt has been made to build up any news service.  I am not talking of news in the broad world sense.  I am just talking of news&mdash;and of the bigger events of the day&mdash;in our own little island.  Open the columns of a newspaper any morning&mdash;leaving out the external news&mdash;and you will find in them plenty of interesting items of news, of events that happened in this country.  What item of news did any of us ever get over Radio Eireann?  I believe that not the slightest attempt has ever been made to give us, in the evening, a summary of the news events of the day, irrespective of racing results <Col N="1805" /> and greyhound results, which Deputy Cogan objects to.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the proceedings of this House, which meets two or three days a week for a portion of the year.  If people are not interested in this Parliament of ours they should be made interested in it, but the attempt to give the public anything like a reasonable tabloid picture of the proceedings here is a glaring distortion. I do not know that I am correct in criticising or blaming the Minister's Department for that.  I suspect that what happens is this: a bulletin is passed on by the Government Publicity Department and Radio Eireann broadcasts what it gets, but whatever Department is responsible for the preparation of the nightly report on the Dáil proceedings, the thing is a disgrace and an abomination.  Radio Eireann, any more than the Army, the police force, or the judiciary, is not the private property of any political Party, and if the Minister is to use the broadcasting station in the interests of the country he will utilise it in order to try to build up respect for the great institutions of this State, one of which is the Parliament of the country. If, through the medium of Radio Eireann, the masses of the people, young and old, are to be convinced that this is not a deliberative Assembly: that it is merely an assembly of so many people who sit down each day and listen to the views of Ministers and then go home, that, I suggest, is doing a national disservice.</P>
    <P>I listen to the news of the B.B.C. as well as to the news of our home station. I have listened to the summarised versions given over the B.B.C. of the activities of the House of Commons. They indicate that when a subject is introduced for debate in the House of Commons a reasonable length of time is given to the Minister introducing the subject.  About half that time is given to the leaders of other Parties in Parliament who have expressed their views, so that any Englishman or Englishwoman listening in night after night can say to himself or herself: &ldquo;The House of Parliament is worth while; every subject brought before it is examined inside out and upside <Col N="1806" /> down, and it is an Assembly that we have a right to be proud of and to retain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What happens here?  Radio Eireann comes on in the evening and gives news of what happened in Dáil Eireann.  We may hear that Deputy Little orated about the work of the Post Office, about his own work, and about his predecessor's work, but there is no mention of views expressed by the leader of the Labour Party, or the views of the leaders of the Farmers' or Fine Gael Parties.  If there is, it is in the proportion of one to a hundred. I can speak on this question with a certain amount of knowledge.  I heard this point raised year after year, but I never added my voice to those of others, for this reason, that it was not until the Dáil started to rise at 9 p.m. that I had an opportunity of listening in to the 10 o'clock news on the day this House was sitting.  Lately when I go home early I turn on the news just to see what kind of a picture I get of proceedings that I witnessed here during the afternoon.  It is a foul piece of lying propaganda, unjust to the Parliament, unjust to Deputies.  In the end it is unfair to people who trust Government institutions, and a big organisation like Radio Eireann, to give them a fair and a reasonable picture of what has happened in an important Assembly such as this.</P>
    <P>With regard to other forms of news, I suggest to the Minister that events in which our people would be interested happen every day, the kind of events that we see in our daily papers next morning, such as a big action in the courts, the verdict and damages assessed, or an important discussion at some county council, perhaps some sporting fixture, an accident or 101 items that we read in the newspaper the following morning.  Is any effort ever made to provide a news service? If I turn on the news service to-night I venture to say that four-fifths of the time devoted to ordinary news will be taken up with war bulletins of the different belligerents, and that the remaining time will be taken up with racing and greyhound results.  I do not agree with Deputy Cogan that these results should not be given.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> Leaving out the higher aspect of the question, horse-racing and greyhound-racing have both become industries of immense importance, and as a vast amount of money is represented by these two industries the more people we get interested in them the better. Leaving that aside I do not agree with the Deputy's views that it showed some kind of mental deterioration for a person to have a bob on a dog or a bob on a horse.  Any time that I believe I have information that is good I put whatever I have in my pocket on a greyhound or on a horse. Unfortunately my information is generally very bad, but I do not regard my attitude as any evidence of mental deterioration.  Let us face up to this fact, that if a good dog comes from Kerry or Tipperary a large number of people in these counties will have their pounds or their bobs, and even their tanners, on these dogs, and they will be anxious to hear that night how the dogs fared and incidentally how they themselves fared.  It would be unreasonable to let them wait for the result until next day's newspapers. That would be setting out our faces entirely against progress.  At the time of the Battle of Waterloo we are told that the public got the result some 18 days later.  In these days, surely we would not expect to take that as an example to follow.  Let the people get the news at the proper time.</P>
    <P>Every country is progressing in every way and we have to keep astride of the times.  It is a question of speed.  If we can give our people news earlier this year than the station gave it ten years ago, that is what they are paying for, and that is what the service is entitled to provide.  I am not against the giving of dog-racing and horse-racing results.  Tens of thousands of people are interested in dog-racing and horse-racing.  By all means give them the results but while doing so try to cater for all tastes. We get wonderful broadcasts of big Gaelic matches held in Dublin on Sundays. Inter-provincial rugby matches are held on Saturdays, in which large numbers of people are interested, but there are no broadcasts of these <Col N="1808" /> matches or of rugby cup matches. Thousands of people are also interested in soccer matches.  Are there ever broadcasts of these matches?  As far as my experience goes we get broadcasts of international rugby matches.</P>
    <P>If these matches take place on the same day as Gaelic or hurling matches I would say that, as the great majority of our people are interested in Gaelic and hurling matches, the others should go by the board.  Let the supporters of Gaelic football listen to their matches when they are played on Sundays.  When other football matches are played on Saturdays, there is no conflict and one has not to be squeezed to provide for the other.  I should like to have more broadcasts of sporting events and county sports.  I should also like to hear a running commentary on sporting events over the Irish radio every time a record is broken, whether in connection with soccer, rugby, cricket or gaelic.  I want to have the minds of the people taken away from the worries and irritations of modern life and to get them interested in sporting events.  It is extraordinary how a good broadcaster can interest people in games, even in games they have never witnessed or whose rules they are not familiar with.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a much broader foundation under Radio Eireann in the field of sports and in the field of news, and I should like the narrow, bigoted, prejudiced, partisan type of report that goes out of the proceedings of this Assembly to be entirely abolished and replaced by, say, the type of report that a good newspaperman would give if he were asked to write a short paragraph of the proceedings in Dáil Eireann to-day.  Any one of them would do it.  The Minister, being a Minister, would get by far the greatest amount of space, but the views of other Parties would at least be published. That is not asking for much. I should like to see more and more people rallying round and supporting ventures such as our Broadcasting Station and I should like to see suspicion and distrust completely removed. <Col N="1809" /> I should like it to get all the confidence of all the people, so that there would be no sparring and so that whatever suggestions are made would be made in a helpful frame of mind and so that the people themselves would be assured not only of fair treatment but of a true outline of events here, far and away removed from the spirit of Party benches or Party clubrooms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins, as well as other Deputies, has complained about the news service, and I think there is ground for saying that the news service is by no means satisfactory. If you know the facts, however, you know why the service is unsatisfactory. I understand the position to be that that section of the broadcasting service is starved for staff and that in fact, while any of the three or four daily newspapers will send four people to the Dáil to report the proceedings, in order to make sure that proper time is allowed to procure a good report, Radio Eireann sends one reporter, who is expected to write an account of what happened, race back to the station, and try to link up what he has got with whatever else is in the station.  With the Dáil adjourning at 9 o'clock and the news coming on at 10.10 p.m., one can quite easily see that a satisfactory news service cannot be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bad as the news service is, the conditions of the people who produce the news are even worse.  The National Union of Journalists recently drew to my attention the fact that there was on the staff of the broadcasting station a journalist&mdash;employed there for a few years&mdash;who asked for holidays.  He was told that he could not get any, and that if he wanted holidays, he would have to take them at his own expense. Fancy a State broadcasting station saying to a journalist on its staff: &ldquo;If you want holidays, you must take them at your own expense.&rdquo;  The State has passed legislation to provide holidays for other classes of workers. Bank holidays must be paid for and they are entitled to annual holidays as well; but in the case of this particular reporter, when he asked for holidays, he was told: &ldquo;Take <Col N="1810" /> them at your own expense.  So far as the broadcasting service is concerned, you will get none.&rdquo;  Could the Minister justify such a situation?</P>
    <P>This person had the temerity to wonder what would happen if he went sick and he was told: &ldquo;If you get sick, it is your own business.  We will pay you nothing, so just do not get sick.  Keep as well as you can on what we pay you. You will get no holidays to keep you from getting sick, and if you do get sick, you will get sick at your own expense.&rdquo; The Minister cannot justify a condition of affairs like that.  I understand that the National Union of Journalists have asked the Minister to receive a deputation to discuss the matter.  Perhaps the Minister's recent absence prevented the deputation from being received, but I am sure the Minister cannot have any sympathy with such conditions.  I hope he will agree to see the deputation from the National Union of Journalists, and that, as a result of the discussion, he will take steps to remedy this most unsatisfactory position which cannot possibly be justified in any circumstances, and which ought to have no place in the set-up of a State broadcasting institution.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins and others have rightly complained about the news service.  What purports to be a news service at night is simply a Fianna Fáil broadcast.  Whatever the station may be called&mdash;it may be called Radio Eireann during the day&mdash;it is certainly Radio Fianna Fáil at 10 o'clock at night.  It certainly changes its name then.  Nobody could hope to pretend that the news bulletin at night is an impartial bulletin.  It is absolutely naked Fianna Fáil propaganda.  Anything a Minister says is broadcast, and one would imagine that there were no people in the Dáil but Ministers.  Anybody in the Gallery could see that it was not possible to get a Minister to sit in the House, except when his own particular business was on, but if the public are to judge the Dáil by the news broadcast&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I withdraw the reference, Sir.  The point I want to make is that anybody listening to the news at night will get the impression that the only people in the House are Ministers. In fact, that is not so, as we know, but the news is dressed up in such a biassed and distorted way that it is, as I say, nothing more than a Fianna Fail broadcast.  I do not know who is finally responsible for dressing up the news or for passing the news bulletin which goes over.  I do not know if the Minister ever takes the trouble to look at the bulletin or whether he is ever consulted in the matter, but at all events he has a very heavy responsibility.  He is a Fianna Fáil Minister and he knows that the broadcasting service is a national broadcasting service, an institution which belongs not to any one political Party but to all political Parties.  The Minister has thrown on him the very special responsibility of ensuring that the utmost impartiality guides the dissemination of news from our national broadcasting system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has heard these complaints this year and in previous years, and I am sorry to say that the news <Col N="1812" /> service shows no tendency to improve in this respect.  Some steps should be taken by the Minister to remedy the situation which is complained about by every Party, except his Party, because every Party except his own knows that it is not fairly treated in the matter.  There was at one time a broadcasting advisory committee which I think used to do useful work. I do not think it functions now, but some consideration ought to be given to the desirability of re-creating that committee.  It was a committee which might deal with a matter of that kind. If there were such a committee and if it were, as it originally was, representative of different groups and different points of view, I think we could be sure of getting a much more impartial news service than we are getting from Radio Eireann to-day.</P>
