      <P>As I have indicated in replies to recent similar questions, I cannot, in the present difficult circumstances in regard to coal supplies, see my way to make coal available generally to commission millers for the drying of grain. The only exception is in the case of <Col N="1948" /> the grinding of oats into oatmeal for human consumption where it is satisfactorily established that the use of turf is impracticable.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that there is any unusual quantity of wet grain this season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate that the present soap ration is inadequate, and that the washing of infants' clothing may require more than the individual ration, the position should be eased for most families by the pooling of family supplies.  Soap-making materials are at present so scarce that it is only with difficulty that the present ration allowance can be maintained. Consideration of any proposal involving increased distribution must, of necessity be deferred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicates that he is aware that additional soap is required for washing children's clothes.  Is he also aware that, in many cases, such clothes are not sent to the laundries, as are clothes for adults, and that it is also impossible to use cheap soap substitutes, as in the case of clothes for adults, because their use would cause skin trouble?  Further, is he aware that, <Col N="1949" /> for some years, there has been a widespread outbreak of gastro-enteritis and that it is essential that children's clothes should be frequently washed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Sack merchants are at liberty to sell or hire potato sacks to any person whose business necessarily requires the use of potato sacks.  I have not heard of the discrepancy in prices to which the Deputy refers. There should be no such discrepancy, as farmers who wish to supply potatoes to wholesale or retail merchants are not prevented from hiring sacks for <Col N="1950" /> the purpose from the licensed sack merchants.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in Kildare the price at a selling station offered by one potato factor was £8 10s., the rail fare being 6s. 8d., and that another merchant offered £10 5s. per ton?  There must be some lack of control of sack distribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The quantity of potatoes required to meet the needs of the non-agricultural community is roughly estimated at 200,000 tons a year.  (b) Final particulárs of potato yields in 1943 are not yet available but the total production of potatoes in that year is provisionally estimated at about 3,000,000 tons. The Deputy will appreciate that the greater part of the potato crop is retained by farmers for family requirements, seed purposes and stock feeding and that the marketable surplus is, accordingly, not large in relation to the total production.  It is not feasible to estimate the amount of the marketable surplus in respect of the 1943 crop but it is considered that, on the whole, sufficient potatoes should be available to meet the needs of the non-agricultural population as well as of the agricultural community.  (c) As indicated in my reply to the question asked by <Col N="1952" /> the Deputy on 21st October, 1943, measures are being adopted with a view to ensuring an adequate supply of potatoes at reasonable prices for urban consumers during the coming season.</P>

In regard to the second part, it is not proposed to release the <i>Annual</i> for publication, as it contravenes the Emergency Powers Order, 1939.  It contains much more than quotations from historical records; it attempts to destroy the unity which Tone sought to establish and to justify the use of violence against the State established by the Irish people under the Constitution freely enacted by them, and freely changeable at their will; it does this at a time when it was never more necessary for Irishmen not to dissipate their energy in internecine strife, but to stand shoulder to shoulder in disciplined comradeship in order to defend the national territory which has been liberated, and to hold it as an earnest of the re-union of all our territory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures whether he is aware that about a year ago members of the Air-Raid Warden Service of Dublin were officially informed that arrangements were being made to see that those who badly needed cycle tyres would be supplied with them (at the full retail price) on certification by the group wardens that the members applying used their bicycles in connection with their A.R.P. duties and that the tyres were badly worn; that very many applications were made under this arrangement, and that no tyres have yet been issued; and if, in view of the fact that applicants for tyres did not, on account of this promise, endeavour to get tyres through other channels, he will see that they will be immediately supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is not as indicated in the first part of the Deputy's question.  More than a year ago unsuccessful efforts were made to secure a special allocation of cycle tyres and tubes for A.R.P. service personnel.  The Department of Defence were advised that the members of the Cycle Traders' Association were willing to co-operate to ensure that, as far as possible, the limited supplies of tyres and tubes which they receive would be distributed to those persons most urgently in need of them.  The City Manager was advised accordingly and was asked to have lists prepared of the names and addresses of A.R.P. personnel who required bicycle tyres together with an indication of the result of the approaches made by the personnel to their local cycle traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the receipt of these lists, renewed efforts were made to secure a special allocation.  These efforts were again unsuccessful.  In this connection, I would invite the Deputy's attention to the reply given in the Dáil by the Minister for Supplies on the 6th May <Col N="1956" /> last in regard to tyres for personnel of the various emergency services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredPByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne (Junior) Mr. Byrne (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>The gist of the Minister's reply seems to be that a promise was made that efforts would be made to get those tyres.  If that is the case, why did official information go right through the service that tyres would, in fact, be given and why was the impression given that they were available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No promise was made that the tyres would be given.  Every effort was made to secure the tyres. Unfortunately, the Minister for Supplies has not a sufficient number of tyres within the country to give them to everybody who needs them, even those who need them very badly.</P>

That situation has continued for the past year and wardens have been waiting for the tyres.  They made no effort to get the tyres elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The question appears to refer to the lands of Dangan, on the Lawless estate, Record No. S.4314, County Kildare.  The Land Commission are aware of the tillage conditions on this estate, and they have already reseeded with grass seed mixture portion of the land which it was considered should be restored to grass.  Any further reseeding that may be necessary during the current year will be done.  As a division scheme for these lands has not yet been prepared, it is not possible at present to state when allotment will take place.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach will be discussed to-day.  It has, by tradition, become the occasion for a discussion of Government policy generally.  As, however, the sub-heads comprising the Estimate do not provide a guide to the matters that may be discussed, advance notice should be given of matters to be raised in order that the Taoiseach may be in a position to reply, and also in order that the Chair can effectively direct the course of the debate.  Parties have complied with the request made by the Chair and notice has been given of ten subjects for this discussion.  Even allowing for the fact that some of these tend to dovetail with one another, this is, obviously, far too many and would make for an unwieldy, rambling debate.  Several of the proposed topics <Col N="1958" /> seem to offend against the rule which prohibits the reopening of the debate on individual Minister's Estimates, thus:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) Post-war development of agriculture (Fine Gael):</P>
      <P>(b) Conditions of Agricultural workers (Labour): and</P>
      <P>(c) Low agricultural income and absence of sound agricultural development policy (Farmers);</P>
      <P>are the particular, and statutory, concern of the Minister for Agriculture and should not be raised here except as aspects of a wider subject; otherwise discussion would inevitably be a duplication of the debate on the Vote for Agriculture&mdash;which is not permissible.</P>
      <P>The question of the establishment of a Ministry for the production of feeding stuffs for animals (Fine Gael) is scarcely a suitable topic for discussion on this Estimate, asking, as it does, for decision on a specific point. At best, it could only be put in as a suggestion while dealing with a major subject.</P>
      <P>This leaves four of the topics, of which notice has been given, that might be regarded as definitely suitable, namely.</P>
      <P>No. 1.&mdash;The present cost of living and its effect on the economic position of people dependent on low wages or social service payments (Fine Gael and J. Larkin, Junior);</P>
      <P>and allied to this is:</P>
      <P>No. 2.&mdash;Social policy of the Government (Labour);</P>
      <P>No. 3.&mdash;Post-war reconstruction plans (Labour); this could include general aspects of post-war development of agriculture;</P>
      <P>No. 4.&mdash;Contribution to post-war Europe through the Red Cross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Number 4 may be ruled out of consideration as the matter may be discussed to-day on an additional Estimate 74.  If the House were willing, Government policy and plans for post-war reconstruction might be discussed <Col N="1959" /> on, say, the Second Stage of the Appropriation Bill.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £10,850 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith an bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1944, chun Oifig Thaighde Eolaíochta Ré na Prainne, maraon le Deontas-i-gCabhair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1961" /> That a sum not exceeding £10,850 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1944, for the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>A sum of £22,000 has already been granted to meet the expenses of the bureau by means of Votes on Account. The total provision for this year is £32,850 as compared with £24,500 last year.  The increase in the total Estimate is due to the additional amount (£7,850) of the Grant-in-Aid provided under sub-head B and the provision under sub-head A of an additional £500 as honoraria for the members of the bureau.  The increase in the Grant-in-Aid is due mainly to additional outlay in connection with certain investigations, in particular those on fuel, iron and steel, fertilisers, explosives and adhesives.</P>
    <P>The work of the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau is now in its third year.  In moving previous Estimates, I indicated that the main purpose for which the Bureau was set up was to investigate technical problems of industry arising from the emergency. I have outlined the method of work of the Bureau and have given an account of the problems which were being investigated and the principal results obtained.  Successful results have been obtained in certain aspects of some of the investigations which I have previously mentioned.  Other investigations have been successfully concluded, while some have been discontinued because they did not seem likely to yield promising results, or for other reasons.</P>
    <P>The retort plant at Turraun, for producing turf charcoal suitable for use in producer gas plants, has been completed and put into operation.  A yield of about 14 tons per week of high-grade charcoal is being obtained.  As it is not considered possible, under present circumstances, to obtain the materials necessary for the production of turf charcoal in large retorts, a satisfactory technique for the production on a large scale of charcoal in pits <Col N="1962" /> and kilns has also been developed, and will be used if an increased output of turf charcoal is required to meet the needs of producer plants.  The work on substitute fuels for use in gas works led to suggestions adopted by the Dublin Gas Company for modifications in their water gas plant.  An investigation into the catalytic enrichment of town gas established that the possibilities of development in this direction during the emergency were not sufficiently hopeful to merit continuance of the work.  The Bureau's work on producers assisted in conclusions being reached in regard to the minimum requirements in the design of producer plants.  Tests carried out on a locally-manufactured producer for use with uncarbonised wood or turf indicate that down-draught producers of the type tested will prove satisfactory with raw turf, particularly for short distance transport.  The effect of storage of turf has been studied by the sampling of the large ricks in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Medium-scale experiments on the production of iron by electro deposition, and the manufacture of ferro-silicon, have been successfully concluded. The results of these investigations have been recorded, and the processes will be held in reserve for development should the supply position worsen.  The manufacture of carbon electrodes for use in electric are furnaces has been satisfactorily developed, and production is being carried out by the company which collaborated in the research.  The Bureau has produced, on a medium scale, lead oxide for use in batteries, and has had separators of Irish timber made by a commercial firm.  Both components have been tested in batteries on the road with encouraging results.  Experiments have been completed which show the feasibility of making concrete lintel beams, without reinforcement, for building purposes.</P>
    <P>Success has been achieved in the manufacture of phosphorus and phosphorus sesquisulphide.  The recovery of sulphur from spent oxide was successfully developed on a medium scale, but the economic and technical factors involved do not justify development at present.  Irish Alcohol Factories, Ltd., <Col N="1963" /> have been successfully operating the plant designed by the bureau for the production of formalin.  Arrangements were made between commercial concerns in regard to the erection of a plant for the manufacture of aluminium sulphate, required for paper manufacture, following successful experiments carried out under the bureau's auspices.</P>
    <P>Investigations on the technical aspects of ensuring certain medical supplies have been completed.  Digitalis produced from Irish-grown plants was standardised and tested clinically, and its manufacture has been undertaken by an Irish firm.  All the equipment for invert sugar saline has been acquired by a commercial firm. Pharmaceutical glycerine of high quality was produced on the large scale by a commercial concern, with the help of the Bureau's staff.</P>
    <P>The survey of marine algæ has been taken over by the Industrial Research Council.  The Bureau's work on this problem was chiefly connected with obtaining algæ suitable for use as a substitute for agar agar.  A commercial firm is now in a position to manufacture agar of high quality.  Zinc has been successfully reclaimed on the laboratory scale from disused dry batteries.</P>
    <P>Many problems in regard to adhesives have been successfully examined.  These include casein adhesives, a rubber adhesive for boot manufacture, a mucilage from waste carob seeds, and glue for match manufacture. A process for the manufacture of a substitute insulating tape has been developed by the Bureau and is being worked commercially.  Other firms undertook the commercial operation of processes developed by the bureau for the manufacture of flypaper, and the production of a substitute for imported engraving glue.</P>
    <P>Methods for the production of acetone, which has many manufacturing uses, were developed, and will be held in reserve against a fresh deterioration in the supply position.  Experimental work was carried out in regard to the production of carbon black.  Activated <Col N="1964" /> charcoal was also produced on an experimental scale.</P>
    <P>The Bureau has continued to work in close co-operation with Government Department.  For example&mdash;the Department of Industry and Commerce concluded, following an examination of the matter with the assistance of the Bureau, that it would not be possible to produce fish oil at an economic price in any general way.</P>
    <P>A number of other problems have been successfully investigated, of which a few examples may be mentioned: the provision of substitute wool oil, the production of yeast from home materials, the preparation of fatty acids for use in the manufacture of polishes and the production of insecticides from offal tobacco.</P>
    <P>I have now given an account of the principal investigations recently completed by the Bureau.  The main part of the work in hand relates to various aspects of the fuel problem.  As I mentioned, the plant at Turraun for the production of turf charcoal has been put into operation.  Experimental work on the by-products of carbonisation and a general study of the carbonisation process will be continued in connection with this plant.  This work will prove of value in the study of the production of gas from peat.</P>
    <P>The Bureau's work on producers continues, and attention is being devoted to down-draught producers for use with uncarbonised wood or turf.  An experimental producer of this type, based on the most promising of the continental designs, has been constructed and is undergoing tests.  The results to date indicate that the continental type of plant is unlikely to be suitable in this country during the emergency in any general way.  An investigation on the use of turf for automatic stoking in medium-sized boiler installations is being hampered by difficulties in obtaining fuel of suitable size.  Results to date show that turf of suitable size could be burned in standard automatic stokers without great difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Bureau's emergency plant for the production of compressed ammonia is being maintained in working order-Many <Col N="1965" /> problems relating to the use of adhesives in industry are still under examination.  The production of phosphorus and phosphorus sesquisulphide continues.</P>
    <P>The Bureau has a considerable amount of work in progress in connection with the production of explosives. Preliminary work has been completed in regard to the production of chlorates, and investigations with a view to production on a larger scale have been commenced.</P>
    <P>Experiments have been carried out on the production of an improved fertiliser from Clare phosphate, and tests of the product are in progress.  The Bureau co-operated in large-scale experiments carried out by a commercial firm on the use of Avoca pyrites for the manufacture of sulphuric acid, which is required in the production of superphosphate.  Encouraging results have been obtained and the experiments are being continued.</P>
    <P>The possibilities of the commercial production of plates and oxide for battery manufacture are being explored following successful experiments.</P>
    <P>Geophysical surveys for iron and nickel ores are in progress in collaboration with the Geological Survey.  The possibilities of the collection of scrap alloy steels for re-use were examined by the Department of Industry and Commerce, with the assistance of the bureau, and methods of spectrographic analysis necessary for the classification of the collected material are being developed by the Bureau.</P>
    <P>An amplifier for increasing the power of short-wave broadcasting has been designed, constructed and installed at Athlone.  Tests have been made on a limited scale, but there are considerable technical difficulties which still require to be investigated.</P>
    <P>A number of other miscellaneous problems were dealt with by the bureau by experimental work or by the provision of digests of literature or information from personal knowledge.</P>
    <P>A large part of the Bureau's work would not have been possible without the close co-operation and assistance <Col N="1966" /> offered by outside bodies.  The Government and the Bureau are thankful to the professors and laboratory staffs of the universities who co-operated wholeheartedly with the work of the bureau, and to the many industrial firms and private persons who assisted in the solution of problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening as attentively as I could to the statement, I caught the reference to digitalis and glycerine, but I did not catch the name of a third item which the Minister said was being produced economically. When replying, perhaps, the Minister would say how those problems arise in the first instance.  Do applications come from business people to have certain items examined, or from Government Departments? Could he also give us some idea regarding the experiments that have been carried out?  Can he say if they have been successful from the point of view of their economy?  It would be highly desirable if a body such as this, or some body in the State, would conduct experiments and research into various matters affecting industry and science.  Our understanding of this particular Department was that it was to aid and assist, to some extent, in providing substitutes for the needs arising out of the war emergency.  I think that we are entitled to ask the Minister if he is satisfied in regard to the considerable sums of money that have been expended up to date.  I take it that these sums, together with the present Estimate, run into about £100,000.  That figure represents fairly heavy expenditure, and we would like to know if something of value has been achieved in return for it.  Nobody would object to expenditure of this sort if we were getting value for it. We would even be prepared to go as <Col N="1967" /> far as saying that we do not want immediate value, but we would like to know if the expenditure is even approaching something which will be of advantage.</P>
      <P>One matter that was referred to in the course of the statement was the provision of insecticide.  Would the Minister tell us if the manufacture of that is proceeding to any great extent, and to what extent it is proving valuable?  As regards a matter that is in some way parallel to it, will he say if there has been any examination of the problem of dealing with vermin &mdash; mice and rats &mdash; or whether the extension of cereal-growing in the country would be likely to occasion the spread of vermin?  My information is that a very good corrective was Rodine, which was manufactured in Liverpool and is not now available.  Some complaints have reached me from different parts of the country with regard to the spread of rats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all welcome the development of research. It seems to me that we should not regard the development of research as being merely an emergency feature of our economic life.  I feel that if we develop along the lines indicated by Deputy Cosgrave, of having some understanding as to what our expenditure ought to be as well as on the practical application of the results achieved, it is possible that the House would be prepared to give further financial assistance.  What I have in mind is that not merely should this bureau be an emergency aid to industry and the form of our economic life, but that it should be something more: a utilisation of the young trained minds that we are developing year after year and exporting to other countries.  I have in mind one young man who left this country some years ago because he was unable to get employment here. To-day, he is the chief metallurgical chemist in one of the great metal combines in England.  If other young men who are associated with a project like this could be exploited, from the point of view of their mental development and training, I think it could be of <Col N="1968" /> great benefit to the country.  If this particular aspect of the Emergency Scientific Bureau is to be considered further.  I think some indication should be given to the House of the success that the Bureau has made in its studies, not merely on the theoretical but on the practical side.  It would be important if some information could be given as to the actual results achieved in the field of manufacture from the point of view of practical development.</P>
      <P>There is one thing especially that we should bear in mind.  It is quite possible that, in the case of a Bureau such as this, quite valuable improvements and discoveries have been made, some of considerable commercial value.  Can we be told what is the relationship between the Bureau and the commercial undertaking that submits to it some particular line for investigation, and as a result of which something valuable for that particular manufacturing concern or industry is obtained? Is there any financial contribution on the basis of the improvements put forward as a result of the studies of the bureau, or are these merely handed over for the private benefit of the industry concerned?  I think that in this Bureau we have got the basis of something that we required in this country, especially during the last ten or 12 years.  Over a period in our history we have held the belief that we had here wider economic sources of life than those which were being developed.  If only we utilise the trained minds that we are developing here year after year, we may yet be able to prove the soundness of our beliefs in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in entire agreement with Deputy Larkin when, as I gather, he suggests that this Emergency Research Bureau might be given a somewhat more permanent status than appears to be envisaged.  I think that post-war opportunities will have to be sought for the establishment of industries in this country which will stand upon their own legs and make a profit.  In order to give point to the suggestion that a bureau of this character should be given permanent status I would suggest to the Taoiseach <Col N="1969" /> that one line of inquiry which, apparently, the Bureau has already embarked upon, has immense potentialities. The Taoiseach referred to digitalis. The whole range of therapeutic drugs offers a field of development for this country for which, I suggest, we have peculiar advantages for certain branches at least.  The trend of medical therapeutics is veering towards sera and glandular preparations.  We are peculiarly and advantageously placed in the live-stock industry.  You will find there the basis of what I believe to be a very considerable industry calling for a high degree of skilled specialisation.  If we could develop that here, I think that would naturally develop gradually a better preparation of medicinal drugs from the raw materials readily available to us already.  As that developed it would become quite easy to grow a variety of other raw materials, which could be used in the drug trade, thus providing a very valuable crop for farmers and promoting a very valuable industry. The reason why we cannot hope for the development of such an industry, unless the Research Bureau is encouraged to press forward along that line, is that I doubt very much if any group of industrialists would put up the money to conduct the preliminary research work and for such an enterprise. I believe if the Research Bureau did the ground-work that subsequently capitalists would be found to exploit it, that a reasonable reciprocal arrangement would be entered into, and the Bureau recouped for any expenditure it might have incurred in undertaking preliminary research work.  All I have said in regard to the therapeutic drug trade could doubtless be applied to a number of other industries of a similar kind, but it is inexpedient at this time to go through the whole list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other item I wish to refer to in reference to the research bureau is where they are engaged on investigations on the potentialities of turf. How soon are we going to face the truth about turf?  The truth about turf is that as a domestic fuel for those living adjacent to the bog it is incomparable, but for all other purposes it <Col N="1970" /> is worth sweet damn all.  Everyone knows that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be remembered that the Minister spoke at length on the energetic measures the research council were taking to develop turf as a motor fuel, and to make it available for a variety of other things on which they are spending a lot of good money. Everybody knows that this is part of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures redspot.  He has got turf on the brain.  He has a bee in his bonnet about turf, and so long as that bee continues to buzz we are all going to be made believe that it can do everything from feeding chickens to running aeroplanes.  The truth is that it is a most excellent fuel for those who use it for domestic purposes near the bog, and indeed for those who use it as a fuel for certain industrial needs near bogs, or within a radius of 20 miles, but outside that it can serve no useful purpose whatever.  It may be that we are going to have this described as a sort of burnt offering to the second greatest industry in the country, which the Minister for Industry and Commerce forecast in 1935. Deputies will remember the time when it was stated we were to have 120,000 men engaged.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the question whether the bureau ought to go on spending money and occupying scientists' time in trying to discover if aeroplanes can be run on turf.  I <Col N="1971" /> say that they cannot.  Any commonsense man knows that.  If the lines of research being pursued are manifestly and notoriously abortive, I think this is an occasion to warn the Minister that anxious as we are to co-operate in any line of research on which the bureau embarks, there are limits beyond which the House should not be expected to go.  In speaking trenchantly on the subject of turf development, I would not wish it to be thought that the Minister is being unduly rebuked for embarking on an experiment which is going to turn out abortive. Naturally many of the experiments undertaken by the bureau will turn out to be abortive.  That is their job. They are expected to try a wide variety of things and we know that seven out of ten probably will lead nowhere but, if we get three out of ten that lead to permanent results, that will be ample compensation for the money spent.</P>
      <P>I understood the Leader of the Opposition to say that £100,000 had been spent and he wanted to know if we got value for it.  We would not mind if we get value.  I say definitely that if the Taoiseach was constrained to say that the only result got by the expenditure of £100,000 was a sufficient supply of something required here it would be well spent.  If we had to say that 70 per cent. of the experiments had failed I would say that nobody would blame him for that.  On the contrary, it is enterprise to venture boldly on anything that shows permanency and would be eminently justified by the circumstances under which it was undertaken.  Nobody will be unduly critical of failure in connection with the bureau, but I think honesty demands that we should be critical of what is manifestly cod, and the further expenditure of large sums of private money, through this or any other bureau, on the attempt to use turf for purposes for which it will never be effectively used is in my opinion cod and very much political cod.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be possible to clarify the public mind, but I wish, beforehand, to warn the public.  It may take one <Col N="1972" /> or two years to show them that it is cod, but someone has to bell the cat first and I now bell turf.  Deputies will all in two years' time be jumping up to congratulate themselves on discovering that the whole thing was cod. If I hammer sense into their heads in two years I shall consider that I have done my job.  This is the first blow in the campaign.  The use of turf for domestic fuel or as a fuel to fire industrial boilers in the neighbourhood of bogs is good economy and good sense, but the use of turf for other purposes is all cod.  I say that now. Deputies will all say so in two years. I am hoping that there will be some saving of public money as a result of the modest bell that I am tying around the cat's neck.  I am trusting that all will combine finally and that the cat will be choked as well as this grotesque project in connection with turf.</P>

      <P>I hope before it concludes its operations the Scientific Research Bureau will find a vaccine to cure Deputy Dillon of his strange form of modesty.  Quite obviously it is necessary to produce it if we are not going to be subjected to ceaseless lectures on economic matters from the Deputy.  I suggest that the Minister should take no notice of what the Deputy said about turf research. Deputy Dillon apparently considers that the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures has a bee in his bonnet.  Maybe he has, but Deputy Dillon must have hives in his bonnet and elsewhere.  After all we have to recognise that this is a relatively undeveloped country and, so far as we have been able to discover, we have not that abundant supply of materials which has made for industrial and commercial greatness elsewhere.  It was claimed in the days of trial and tribulation that we had an abundance of raw material which was deliberately withheld from us by alien hands and alien practices.  Perhaps a realisation of events in the cooler times through which we are now passing has damped the ardour of many who thought we had an abundance of these essential raw materials for high-class secondary <Col N="1973" /> development.  I think it is now recognised that we have not that abundance of raw materials which it was at one time believed we had.  The land is still our greatest source of wealth and turf comes from the land.  If we have, therefore, any type of raw material, whether turf or minerals, capable of being converted into manufactured goods, the expenditure of any reasonable sum of money which we spend on exploiting whatever potentialities turf has, or whatever potentialities such minerals as we have may possess for manufacturing purposes, is well worth while.  The sum of money we are asked to vote is a trivial sum, having regard to the possibilities which might flow from a successful scientific investigation of our raw material.  Turf is not such an enemy of the Irish people as Deputy Dillon would have us believe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know him long enough, but I still have not plumbed him.  I suggest to the Minister that turf is one of the natural resources of the country, and, in so far as we can burn it, we ought to try to burn it, consistent with being able to produce it at a price the people can pay.  In an emergency such as that through which we are passing, we have no choice of what is good or best.  We have simply to use whatever materials are available, and turf has been a very valuable commodity in the past few years.  I do not, however, want to enter into a discussion on the burning value of turf compared with coal or timber.  What I suggest to the Minister is that, realising we have an <Col N="1974" /> abundance of turf, and that it may produce for us, on research, methods of production which are not available to us to-day, there ought to be no haggling about spending money upon scientific research of that kind.</P>
      <P>With Deputy Larkin I agree that this research bureau should not be merely an emergency research bureau.  If any country in the world needs to develop its resources, this country does.  We have a relatively undeveloped country from the industrial point of view.  Our secondary industries, in the main, as this war has shown, are compelled to rely very extensively on raw materials from outside and, therefore, any money spent on scientific research which will produce native raw materials for use in our secondary industries is, in my opinion, money well spent.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach what is the relationship between the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau and the Industrial Research Council, which is carried on the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Examining the details of the expenditure of the Industrial Research Council, one gets the impression that it covers somewhat the same field as the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau.  Maybe it does not; maybe the work is more departmentalised than appears from listening to the Taoiseach's speech and examining details of that body's expenditure; but if these bodies are covering relatively the same field, there surely is a case for amalgamating them, and creating a permanent research bureau of a kind likely to give us lasting results.</P>
      <P>If there is any portion of Deputy Dillon's speech with which I agree, it is that portion in which he suggests: &ldquo;Go ahead and get success.  Try to get success, no matter what research is involved, and no matter what sum is spent, having regard to reasonable expenditure.&rdquo; If the Research Bureau fails in a number of respects, well and good.  It will at least burst bubbles, or we may get from it permanent results of a character which may in the course of time have very beneficial results for industry and agriculture.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my voice to the voices of other speakers who suggested that this bureau should be a permanent feature of our organisation.  I quite understand that investigations at present being carried on by that bureau arise out of certain shortages of raw materials and other commodities which were bound to arise in this country, but with the advance of science and with the secrets which the various belligerents now have with regard to the use to which many commodities can be put under chemical action and which will be released when the war is over, I think it is generally recognised by modern scientists that there is a very big future &mdash; I think the Taoiseach, in his statement, used the word &ldquo;adhesives&rdquo;&mdash; for synthetic products produced from various minerals, plant life and so forth.  I should like to see this bureau directing its attention, in particular, to those classes of plant life which will grow in this country, and which, treated chemically, can form the basis of future raw materials for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give the Taoiseach one example of which I have personal knowledge. There were grown in this country up to 30 years ago very large quantities of artichokes.  The artichoke tuber formed part of the material put into a synthetic rubber manufactured before the last war.  That is only one example of the uses to which our plant life can be put.  Considerable advances have been made during the past few years and there is certainly no doubt that when these secrets, commercial and chemical, which the belligerents now have are released after the war and when the general public get the benefit of them, it will be discovered that there is a vast field in this country for growing certain forms of plants which can be used as the basis of various synthetic products.  From that point of view, a permanent bureau of this kind would be a very important feature of our economic life and would help us to provide ready-grown raw material either for use in our own industries&mdash; and the growing of it would be an industry in itself &mdash; or for export.  For that reason, I welcome the existence, <Col N="1976" /> due to the emergency, of this bureau and hope it will become a permanent feature of our organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with those who have suggested that this bureau should be a permanent institution. One of the real weaknesses of our economic position is not that we have a vast exportable surplus, but that there is a very large range of essential materials which we cannot and have not been able to produce in the past.  This country, for its size, has been rather unfortunate in its deposits of essential minerals.  This disadvantage has operated against us for years, and it might not be too much to hope that, with the advance of science, we may overcome that disadvantage to a certain extent.  Many essential materials required for industry are now being developed from vegetation and plants of various kinds through the operations of science, and it may open up for this country in the future a field which will put us in a less disadvantageous position in regard to essential raw materials for industry. It is essential that the best brains that are being turned out from our schools and colleges &mdash; and there is no doubt that we are turning out brains equal to those of any nation in the world capable of dealing with scientific matters&mdash;should be directed towards intensive investigation within this country rather than that they should be forced to emigrate and to devote their services to the advancement of other nations.  There is, I think, a very wide field for development both during the emergency and afterwards. I believe that we can and that we must endeavour to reduce to some extent our dependence upon external resources for the more essential needs of industry, transport, and our economic life generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most important developments which could be made by science in this country is the production of electrical current to take the place to a considerable extent of imported fuel, oils, coal and other such materials.  I disagree with Deputy Dillon in this connection and I think there is certainly a future for turf development. <Col N="1977" /> I think that the main future of turf development will lie in the direction of supplementing the production of electricity from water power and other forms of power.  Steps were to be taken in regard to the development of this form of power, but they were held up owing to the emergency.  There is an opportunity for a Department such as this to investigate the plans and the methods by which it was intended to develop turf for the generation of electricity and to perfect them so that they may be used to the very best advantage.  It is also desirable that further investigation should take place in regard to the best and most economic utilisation of water power, tide power and other sources of power which could be harnessed for the production of electricity.  We must realise that there is an essential weakness in our national economy inasmuch as we are short of fuel, and electricity offers the most feasible substitute.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we have a wide field for the development of producer gas plant of every kind which would assist us in coping with our transport problems.  This also must not be regarded as merely an emergency measure because, as I said, the sources of wealth which have made other nations great, such as oil wells, coal deposits, and various other things which have contributed to the wealth of nations, may tend to be dissipated by use and substitutes will have to be found eventually for them.  Therefore it is necessary that our scientists should be working full time on something which would permanently and definitely take the place of these materials.</P>
    <P>There is also need for a thorough investigation in regard to the provision of preventives and cures for the various diseases which attack both plant and animal life in this country.  There is no doubt that our food supplies are very largely affected as a result of various crop diseases.  Potato diseases, for example, were very serious this year and are becoming more serious every year.  It would appear as if the diseases attacking the crop were more prevalent in recent years than in the <Col N="1978" /> past.  We have also diseases attacking cereal crops.  The scientific department ought to be able to find preventives for these diseases.</P>
    <P>There is also a recent development which will be of interest to this country as an agricultural country and that is a new method of propagating the potato crop while retaining its food value.  I have seen it stated that the eyes of potatoes can be taken out and a crop produced from them.  That also suggests a line of investigation, because there is no doubt that providing seed for each successive crop of potatoes does eat very largely into the quantity produced, and if any developments can taken place along these lines they will be very welcome.  I think this particular Department has the support and goodwill of every Deputy and it is to be hoped that it will pursue its work on a permanent basis and that it will draw to its aid all the best brains that are available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach in introducing this Vote seemed to give it a certain air of unreality.  Perhaps when he looks into it further he will try to come to more definite conclusions on some of the matters upon which he touched.  He spoke about the use of turf for producer gas.  I do not know how far he will confirm what I say, but the general idea is that it is dearer and bulkier than the ordinary charcoal manufactured from wood.  That is the real acid test &mdash; the price and the performance&mdash;and he ought to be able to tell us if it has advanced beyond the experimental stage.  That is the test by which it will stand or fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some speakers have touched upon many of the new products that have come into being as a result of the war, and which will probably take their appropriate place in the post-war economy.  Some of them will probably elbow out some of the metals, and others will give wood a run for its money.  Although I think there are hundreds of them, they can be grouped under the heading of plastic compounds&mdash;thermo-plastics and other kinds of plastics.  Of course, we have <Col N="1979" /> casein here at our doors, but that, while it has certain advantages, has also disadvantages.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach how far this Department would be justified in investigating to what extent they could produce raw material for four of the plastic compounds.  I suggest to him phenol, methylmethalacrite, phenol formaldehyde, and urea formaldehyde.  While these do not by any means exhaust the number of thermo-plastic compounds, they would at least focus the investigations on an enormous field which will have to be supplied after the war when raw materials have been found for coping with other difficulties.  But the first question is: Can we provide any of those raw materials and manufacture them at a price at which they can be disposed of?  I do not suggest that the Taoiseach can answer these questions when replying, but perhaps they may be looked into.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Leader of the principal Opposition that in the case of a technical report of this sort it would be desirable that copies should be given at least to the leaders of Parties in advance so that they would have time to study it.  In fact, it would probably be a better practice if we could give them well in advance so that notice could be given to the Minister who would be in charge of the Estimate and if any particular points were raised&mdash;because they are all highly technical &mdash; full information could be obtained and would be available here for the debate.  I will take a note of it and suggest that that will be the practice that will be followed in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing in regard to this Estimate is to remember that we are dealing with an organisation which was deliberately set up to deal with emergency problems, not long-term problems, but ones of immediate urgency, that needed solution quickly.  We had already an organisation supposed to examine long-term problems, that is, the Industrial Research Council. Deputies will remember that when I proposed the setting up of the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau.  I indicated <Col N="1980" /> that the Minister had been considering the reorganisation of the Industrial Research Council on what appeared to be a better scheme, the idea being to use as far as possible our scientific resources here for the investigation of problems, which would enable better processes to be introduced, particularly in regard to articles where we had raw materials at home. That remains to be done.  But the particular Estimate that we are dealing with is for the Emergency Bureau dealing with problems that have arisen because of the emergency and the solution of which was urgent because of the emergency.</P>
    <P>I think that some of the criticism, and even some of the suggestions about the future, would not have been made, probably, if that was clearly realised&mdash; that we have in existence, and intend to have in the future, a research body in which we will have our scientists at work, so as to improve generally the economic possibilities here.  It was suggested, I think, by Deputy Larkin, that in addition to helping us to make the best use of raw materials and improving processes, et cetera, industrial research also is making use at home of the scientific brains of our own people. That is true.  As a matter of fact, in this particular case, a number of engineers and some chemists, physicists and technologists, and so on, are being employed by the Bureau during the present time.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, in all these cases, a limit and one of the difficulties about any research organisation set up by the State is that, if they are to work, they must be taken largely on trust. One cannot judge by means of an annual report of the value of the work that has been done by an organisation of that kind.  They have to be given a considerable amount of freedom.  In fact, I do not think it would be possible for the present Bureau to work at all if it were restricted in its operation by the close financial control that is associated generally with Government enterprises.  Of course, we have the duty to see that we get the best possible value for the money that is expended.  That is the trouble.  How do you know when you are getting <Col N="1981" /> good value?  You cannot know it immediately.  Sometimes the negative results that are reached are more important even than the positive results.  They save you from wasting time and energy working along a certain direction when it can be definitely proved to you that there is no point in moving in that direction, that it is bound not to give you any effective or useful results.  So that it is very difficult, in defending the expenditure of money on an organisation of this sort, to prove to anybody who wanted to doubt it, that you were really getting good value for your money. The list of successful things that have been done is the only test that I can give at the moment though, as I have indicated, it would be a very unsatisfactory test.  I think there has been a list of successes achieved sufficient to let us feel that, in the present time, we have, through the existence of this Bureau, been able to lighten some of the difficulties which the emergency has brought upon us.</P>
    <P>Naturally, in an organisation of this kind, when giving it work we take the most pressing problems first.  One of the principal problems involved here was the question of transport.  The matter of transport was one of our greatest difficulties, and I think that, in a time like the present, we should not take a standard as to whether prices are competitive or not.  There are certain things which we could not get at the present time at any price. If these things could be procured at home, then we could estimate their value in a sort of absolute way, but, as things are, we have nothing with which to compare them.  Deputy Dockrell, for instance, suggests that the acid test is the price at which such commodities can be produced and sold here, but take, for instance, the cost of the production of turf charcoal: if we can produce more of that type of fuel, then we can get more buyers and, therefore, so far as the use of turf charcoal is concerned.  I think I am right in saying that the trouble is that we cannot produce as much of it as could be used, and the price is affected in that way.  Whether in peace times, when producer plants may go out of <Col N="1982" /> use and when petrol is again a competitor, we shall have a different set of conditions, is a matter for conjecture. Undoubtedly, however, whilst it is always an advantage to procure, as far as possible, the raw materials at home, and to have the finished products of these raw materials manufactured at home&mdash;not alone because it is to the economic advantage of our own people to have these resources developed in peace times, but also with regard to providing a margin of safety for times of emergency &mdash; nevertheless, there is obviously a limit to the extent to which you can go in that direction. For instance, it might be found that the cost of producing these things here at home would be so great that, in fact, it might not be wise &mdash; taking the broadest view &mdash; in the national interests, to proceed along these particular lines.</P>
    <P>Deputies on different sides of the House may differ as to where you should draw the line in this connection. Deputy Dillon, for instance, might draw the line at a very different point from where I should draw it.  But I think &mdash; and I am sure the Deputy will agree with me &mdash; that the line would have to be drawn somewhere, and that there would be a point, in regard to price, beyond which it would be unwise for us to go.  However, I do not think that that questions arises here.  The fact is that the Bureau has given its attention to the development of things that were not available hitherto except from outside the country.  That was the chief concern of the Bureau, and they were not so much concerned as to whether these things could be produced at such a price as people were prepared to pay for them.  Deputy Dillon says that turf is only useful as a domestic fuel and, perhaps, for certain commercial plants, in the neighbourhood of the bogs.  I admit that that is the first place from which to start.  That is only commonsense, and I quite agree with the Deputy's contention, but I am sure that the Deputy would not deny that if we were able to produce turf charcoal economically, and if it could be made available for other purposes it would be our duty to go on and develop its possibilities as far as we could.  For <Col N="1983" /> instance, I understand that, for the first time, in Turraun, as a result of the installation of the retort there, there will be an opportunity for examination into particular aspects of the various by-products of turf &mdash; an examination which has never been made before &mdash; and I think the Deputy will admit that we ought to pursue these investigations to the end there, if it is possible to do so, with a view to allowing us to see what use can be made of the various by-products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Taoiseach for a moment to inquire whether the Turraun investigation comprises an investigation into the possibility of extracting tar from turf, because, of course, if we could get domestic supplies of tar, we could have an opportunity of developing a very wide sphere of secondary industries in this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure about that.  I understand that this was a question of a complete examination into various gases, and so on.  My information was that the examination had not been carried to completion so far, and I think we ought to avail of this unique opportunity of pursuing these investigations to completion now.  I understand that the retort is turning out something like 14 tons a week of turf charcoal.  That, of course, is a very small amount from the point of view of consumption, but the idea was, that when the investigations were finally completed, and if they proved to be successful, this matter would be handed over to the Turf Development Board, or some body such as that, for development on general lines, but we are continuing on with this, so that the investigations of the Bureau may be completed.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that that was not the intention <Col N="1984" /> of my remarks in this regard. Now, with regard to a number of these processes that have been developed, and a number of the investigations that have been undertaken, I myself cannot give any information, except along the general terms of the report, but I should be glad, if any Deputy wishes to put questions as a result of the publication of this report, if he would make use of the procedure of Parliamentary questions to elicit information, and I shall be happy to give as complete an answer as I can give in reply to such questions.  I do not think that any good result would be achieved if I were to try to deal with problems of a technical or scientific nature now, since I have not the necessary technical or scientific knowledge which would enable me to deal with these matters now.  However, as I have said, if Deputies wish to raise any questions on the report, I shall be very happy to procure replies for them.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of insecticides, I am told that they are being prepared to the extent that the supplies of offal tobacco permit, and I am also informed that, in the matter of the destruction of vermin, the Bureau have helped manufacturers to arrange for the manufacture of rat poison by locating places where supplies could be obtained.  Of course, I do not know whether sufficient supplies would be available to meet the demand, but my information is that the Bureau have helped manufacturers to that extent. In the matter of whether the members of the Bureau are examining therapeutic agencies of various kinds, it must be borne in mind that there is also a medical research body who are engaged on medical research, and that there has been a certain development there.  In fact, with regard to the treatment of tuberculosis, a suggestion came from a member of the Bureau regarding the investigation of certain drugs and compounds which would be useful in the treatment of that disease, and there was the suggestion that an examination should be pursued in that direction.  That also is now attached to the Medical Research Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as diseases of potatoes, and <Col N="1985" /> so on, are concerned, we have, in the college at Glasnevin, a scientific department where investigations of various kinds are carried on.  If there were to be a development along those lines, I think that somehow it would be better to co-ordinate our various agricultural experiments, and have them undertaken there, instead of taking such problems into our present Bureau.  I have a list here of some of the people engaged in these investigations. They include five engineers, some assistant engineers, a botanist and a technologist, all of whom are employed by the Bureau.</P>
    <P>I was asked a question by, I think, Deputy Larkin as to what arrangements were made to deal with the possibility of the handing over to a commercial firm, for purposes of exploitation, of the results of discoveries following on investigations by the Bureau.  That is a matter which has given me a certain amount of concern, but up to the present we have not had any particular case where development on a large scale was involved. Up to the present, where experiments or investigations have been undertaken at the instance of a particular firm, and where they have been successful and are going to be developed by the firm, the practice has been to charge the firm what seems a reasonable fee, representing a portion of the amount that it costs the Bureau to perform the investigation.  It is quite clear that if we were working in normal times and bigger results were being achieved, which would mean exploitation by a firm, a question would arise whether, after undertaking the investigation, you would make the results generally available to anybody who cared to use them, whether you would let competition play its part, seeing that public money had been used to carry on the investigation, and whether you would publish your results and let anybody who cared carry on the development.</P>
    <P>Another view might be taken.  Let us suppose that a particular instrument or a particular process was developed which was going to be of <Col N="1986" /> extreme value and that it was thought that some of the money that had been spent on its investigation might be recovered from its exploitation, clearly there is a case in which some scheme would have to be worked out by which the patent rights would be vested in the State or in somebody representing the State.  It is a matter that has given me, personally, a good deal of concern but so far we have not had any case where it was felt that any undue advantage was given to a particular firm by the State's activities. I take it that is the Deputy's wish, that he was anxious to safeguard the interests of the State.  Perhaps that is not the case he wished to bring forward, but he struck that note in my mind, because that is a thing which I was considering.  If, as a result of the expenditure of State money, the money of the community, certain processes are developed, even though the community is going to benefit from exploitation of these processes by a particular firm, at the same time one would not like to think that a particular firm was going to get an undue advantage as a result of that.  If we are to have the Scientific Research Bureau as a permanent institution we shall have to devise some scheme by which patent rights will be vested either in the Bureau or in the State.</P>
    <P>Some arrangements will have to be made, if investigations are undertaken for particular firms, by which they will at least have to pay for such investigations, if they are successful, so that the community as a whole will get fair value for the money spent.  If there is no monopoly in question and you publish your results, everybody can compete for the right to exploit them.  That is one way out of the difficulty.  One particular firm may, however, be better equipped for carrying out the processes than another.  I do not think you can prevent that.  If you publish the results everybody will know about them.  I am just expressing my thoughts on the matter as they occur to me.  I agree that some definite scheme will have to be evolved to ensure that if, as a result of State action, certain inventions are brought about or certain processes developed, the community should <Col N="1987" /> benefit to the full and not any particular group or individual.  I do not know if I have answered all the points raised but if any Deputy wishes to repeat any of these points I shall be glad to avail of the opportunity to deal with them. I think I have answered all those of which I took a note.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="An Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>An Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Tairgim:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £200,000 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1944, chun Maoluithe ar Ghátar de dheascaibh Chogaidh agus Gorta san Eoraip agus san India (maraon le Deontas-i-gCabhair).</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £200,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1944, for the Alleviation of Distress due to War and Famine in Europe and India (including a Grant-in-Aid).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have been supplied with copies of the Estimate, and they will observe that it is divided into two parts&mdash;(a) Grant-in-Aid to the Irish Red Cross Society, £100,000; and (b) Advances to the Irish Red Cross Society, £100,000.  The Red Cross Society, as Deputies know, was established here a month or two prior to the outbreak of war.  It is affiliated with the International Red Cross whose work is known.  I am sure, to all Deputies, and it is not necessary for me, therefore, to speak in detail about it.  It operates in peace time to alleviate distress, and it is particularly active in endeavouring to alleviate distress caused by war.  Shortly after the establishment of this society here, an effort was made to get it throughly organised throughout the country to meet the situation in which we ourselves were placed.  The possibilities and value of the organisation were made clear, I think, to everybody, and it is an organisation which has the support of all sections of the people. <Col N="1988" /> The work which it has to do in times like the present is tremendous.  If money were available it could do far more work than its present means would enable it to do.</P>
    <P>I have here the proof of a pamphlet which is about to be issued by the Red Cross Society, asking the Irish people to subscribe to its resources to the extent of £500,000.  In asking for that money, it points out the conditions that have already obtained as a result of this war in various parts of the world.  It points out, in particular, the conditions that are likely to obtain in Europe when this war ends.  I feel certain that the appeal which is about to be launched will be responded to very generously by our people.  We have every reason to be thankful to Almighty God for having saved us from the miseries which war has brought upon many other nations at the present time, and I feel that our citizens, acting individually out of their resources, will show their gratitude for that and will make available, as far as possible, funds to enable this organisation to help suffering humanity in any part of the world where the greatest need may arise and in which its help can be most effective.</P>
    <P>It will take some time for this organisation to build up the necessary funds.  Already there is urgent need, so I am coming here to the Dáil, to ask, in the first place, that a sum of £100,000 be given to them, immediately, as a gift from the State&mdash; which, of course, means a gift from the members of the community as a whole. There is an almost immediate need, as I will indicate later, for that sum of money for a special-purpose.  I am asking also that, in advance of the appeal which they are making to private individuals, there be made available a credit on which they can draw if there is urgent need for relief in Europe or anywhere else.  A sum of £100,000 will be needed almost immediately for India.</P>
    <P>It does not require very much imagination to see the misery of countries over which armies have passed. You can picture two armed forces, occupying a long line across a country. <Col N="1989" /> According as one army advances into that country and drives the defenders there back, the unfortunate population in that particular area have to fly before them, leaving their homes and taking only a few belongings with them.  Very soon, they have to discard those few belongings, with the weariness of the march, and, finally, they are left with only what they are wearing. Anybody who read the accounts of the position in Belgium or France at certain periods of this war, knows what a helpless, hopeless mass refugees in that position are.  If you look at the map of the war fronts to-day, you see the territories over which armies have passed and repassed, and you can conceive what must have been the position of the millions of people who inhabited those areas.  I think I saw somewhere a figure of 40,000,000 as the number of people who, in one way or another, in this war have had to leave their homes.</P>
    <P>When armies occupy territory, their immediate concern is the success of their arms.  The ordinary civilian life and civilian organisation is disrupted, its mode of transport is disorganised, or is being used definitely for military purposes, and the transport of the commodities required in ordinary daily life has ceased.  If the movement of armies over the territory takes place in the springtime, no crops can be sown; if it takes place when the crops have been sown, they are often destroyed&mdash;partially, at any rate; and if it takes place during the harvest time, the harvest cannot be reaped.  It is certain that millions have suffered, and that the starvation, hardships and privations of various kinds have ended very often in death.  It is not surprising that there should be conditions of semi-starvation in large parts of Europe, and death by famine to tens of thousands in other parts of Europe. It is very hard to get anything like trustworthy figures, but I understand that tens of thousands have died from starvation&mdash;for example, in Greece.  In other parts of Europe, also, there may have been something of the same kind. In regard to Russia, I have not been able to get satisfactory accounts, but it requires very little imagination and <Col N="1990" /> very little knowledge of war to realise that there must be famine conditions, and the pestilence that follows those conditions, over a very large part of Europe to-day.</P>
    <P>Only yesterday, or the day before, I received a telegram from Calcutta, telling the conditions that obtain there, and asking for substantial financial help.  We know that in Bengal, for example, there are tens of thousands of deaths&mdash;to put it without any exaggeration.  An appeal is being made to us to help.  The Red Cross Society would be the natural organisation to give any national aid that we could give.  The Red Cross Society has given a very small sum already to the Indian Red Cross, and I thought it only right that we should make available for them a reasonably substantial sum that they could send immediately to their aid.</P>
    <P>In cases of starvation, of course, money does not seem to be the most effective thing&mdash;you cannot eat notes, you cannot eat cash&mdash;so one thinks immediately of sending food.  We are not in a position to send food, but our Red Cross Society inquired from the Indian Red Cross whether, if a contribution were made in money, it could be utilised to get food for the starving people there. The reply was that it could.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested&mdash;and I have spoken about this, naturally, to my colleagues in the Government and to some other members of the House&mdash; that we, ourselves, perhaps, could purchase the food and send it or get it sent.  If we were able to do that, there is no doubt that the Indian Red Cross, through its connections, would also be able to get it.  They would also be able to purchase the food, if we could do so, and they would get it, probably, more expeditiously than we would.  Consequently, the purpose of this first £100,000 is to put our Red Cross Society in funds, so that they may make this contribution to relieve the conditions that obtain at the present time in India.  I feel that every member of the House will be in favour of making this contribution.  It is, of course, only a small contribution, <Col N="1991" /> although it is substantial enough from the point of view of our resources.  It can do very little to relieve the misery that obtains but, at any rate, it indicates an effort on our part to do something, the best we can.  I do not believe there will be any opposition to making this sum available.</P>
    <P>We will have other demands.  In this pamphlet that is about to be issued I see a list indicating the help that has already been given to a number of Red Cross Societies in other countries. Included in the list are China and Finland and, following the disaster in Turkey, there have been contributions made.  I do not want to say they were large in amount, but they were as large as the resources available for the Red Cross at the moment would permit.  At the end of this war there will be an appalling situation facing Europe, and we think our Red Cross ought to be in a position in which it will be able to give some substantial aid.  We do not know when an occasion for this may occur. For instance, this particular appeal came rather suddenly; we were not expecting it.  In just the same manner other appeals may come before the Red Cross drive has brought into its funds the sums that will be needed.  It is desirable, therefore, that we should make something available to meet cases of urgency before they get their £500,000, which I hope they will get. Before they do get it, I think it is well that they should have a certain sum made available to their credit from the Exchequer here.</P>
    <P>I feel certain every Deputy will support this Vote.  I hope that there will go out from this House, from all Deputies, an appeal to our people to contribute generously to the funds of the Red Cross, so that this section of that great international humanitarian organisation may be in a position to do its share in relieving distress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. W.T. Cosgrave Mr. W.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is in this country widespread regret and sympathy for the terrible conditions which are, unfortunately, prevalent in India, and I expect it may be taken for granted that there will be unanimous <Col N="1992" /> agreement in the country regarding any useful help that we can give, within our means, towards the alleviation of the awful distress, the suffering and disease which have afflicted the community in Bengal.  In our desire to be of some assistance, it appears to me that it is incumbent upon us to see that this money will effect the purpose we have in mind.  The Red Cross Society in this country is of very recent growth; its members are inexperienced; a few years could not possibly give them that wide range of experience which organisations of much longer standing have.</P>
      <P>It strikes me that the best method by which real assistance can be given in this case is to avail of the good offices of the central organisation of the Red Cross in Geneva.  It may be the Taoiseach has some information regarding the Red Cross in India.  I have none.  It may be much older than our own Red Cross; it may be much more recent.  I know nothing whatever about it, but I think whatever efforts are being made to deal with a catastrophe such as this which has struck India would be better attended to if it were dealt with in a central manner rather than to have a whole series of bodies perhaps rivalling each other, and perhaps in their zeal leaving out of consideration some particular sections of the community. However, that is a matter of detail, but while on it I might say that in my experience of the administration of charitable funds, well meaning benevolence is no criterion of efficiency, or of properly effecting the purpose which is in the consciences of those who so generously subscribe.  People without experience waste money in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second item, I think it is unwise to have it on this Vote.  I did not gather from the Taoiseach that there had been any application from the Irish Red Cross for this money.  I take it that, in a case of this sort, one would at least expect that an application would come from such a body.  Unless I am entirely mistaken, or it may be that I did not hear the Taoiseach correctly, no information with regard to a request of that sort was put before <Col N="1993" /> the House.  The Red Cross in other countries is seperate from the Government, so far as I am aware, and is entirely a philanthropic body, working out its own salvation and not dependent upon, or deriving any of its funds from, the central Government.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is intended to have a departure from that policy here.  In my experience, people usually exercise a greater care over moneys which they have to acquire than over moneys which are showered upon them. In this case we are giving £100,000 and we expect to get repayment.  We ought to be repaid.  We do not expect to arrest members of the Red Cross Society if we are not paid.  It may possibly interfere with the efficient working of that organisation if we now start to spoon-feed it.</P>
    <P>One of the matters I intend to raise briefly on the Taoiseach's Vote is what efforts, if any, are being made to deal with the post-war situation in Europe. Those countries that have been out of the war, the countries that can afford it, owe a duty to humanity.  They should come forward and render some assistance.  I rather think that assistance by way of cash is not altogether what is required; I think what would be more necessary is the provision of essential foods in those places where such provision is urgently required.  I think it would be well to allow the Red Cross itself to work out its own salvation with regard to this matter. The members of that body have undertaken a noble work.  It is onerous work, but we ought to distinguish clearly between what is their work and what the State is going to do.  If it is thought desirable&mdash;and I think it is very desirable; it is almost our duty&mdash; that, at the conclusion of the war, we should be called upon as a State to make our contribution towards the alleviation of distress, of want and of starvation, and to arrest the ravages of disease, and to give medical aid of any sort or kind&mdash;the Red Cross Society is unequal to that onerous duty&mdash;then it is for the State to do that.  I do not think it is right to mix up the two matters.  I think it would be better if a single Vote were put down to deal with the one matter <Col N="1994" /> before us, and leave the other to be dealt with in its normal course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather unusual Estimate, but, of course, we are living in unusual times.  The unusuality of the times is indicated by the fact that practically the entire world is at war now.  A great part of it, perhaps, has been at war for the past few years.  It is quite natural, therefore, that in a circumstance of that kind many parts of the world would be suffering privation, distress and famine, as well as from the equally inevitable consequences of these evils&mdash;pestilence.  I think it was with feelings of horror and profound regret that the people of this nation learned of the catastrophe which is overwhelming India to-day. A very large portion of India occupied by, approximately, 60,000,000 people is in the grip of famine.</P>
      <P>We in this country ought to know what famine means.  The famine of 1847 left a mark on this country and on its people, on its industries and on its development, and that mark is with us to-day, and will probably be passed on to many other generations of Irishmen and women.  But in that famine of 1847 we had, thank God, many friends, some of them far-away friends. I understand that the records of assistance which we got at that time will show that many people then resident in India contributed generously to the relief of famine in the Ireland of 1847. It is India's turn to-day.  We at this distance, are not competent to judge the cause of the famine there or to suggest remedies which are likely to be immediately efficacious.  All we do know is that hunger, which is the enemy of mankind throughout the world, stalks through India to-day. Men, women and children suffer from its evils, and women and children, unfortunately, as is usual, suffer most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this war has demonstrated one thing more than another, it is the interdependent character of nations and of races.  We here in Ireland, thank God, have been spared the horrors of the world war.  We have been spared the privations, the devastation and the relentless desolation which engulf many parts of the world to-day, and I <Col N="1995" /> think that in thanksgiving for the safety which has so far been ours, and recognising that large portions of the world are suffering want and distress to-day, we ought, as a nation, with our well-known love of humanity, show our sympathy with suffering mankind elsewhere by contributing according to our resources to the relief of the destitution which abounds in the world to-day.</P>
    <P>We could, of course, adopt another attitude.  We might take the isolationist attitude and say that India's problems, and the world's problems, in respect of hunger and want, mean nothing to our people here.  That would not be the Irish attitude. Ireland cannot, in the crisis which now confronts the starving millions throughout the world, turn a deaf ear to those pleas of starving and dying men and women in many countries in the world to-day.  I think that with out entering into the details of this Estimate, or the manner in which the money is to be disbursed, our duty as an Irish Legislature is to say definitely that it is in accordance with our concepts of freedom, in accordance with our concepts of Christianity and in accordance with our concepts of human dignity, that we should provide help for the men, women and children who are being mentally and physically crucified by famine in India and in other parts of the world to-day. It is because the Labour Party holds this view about the contribution which Ireland must make, and is in duty bound to make, to the relief of distress throughout the world and to the easement of human burdens, that we support this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a lot has been said on this Estimate both by the Leader of Fine Gael and the Leader of the Labour Party.  Speaking on behalf of the farmers, I want to join with them in saying that we are as anxious as they are that this Vote should go through with as little discussion as possible.  We are a charitable people.  We have God, and God alone, to thank for the fact that our country and perhaps our people are not in the <Col N="1996" /> same position as the peoples of other countries.  Those peoples are in that position through no fault of their own, and it is on that account, and on that account alone, from the national and humanitarian point of view that I expect this House will unanimously agree to this Vote.</P>
      <P>My friend, Deputy Cosgrave, has raised a point about the Red Cross.  I fully agree with the Taoiseach that there is no other way of doing what is being proposed.  I am quite sure that the Minister will see that there is the right type of Red Cross Society in India to administer this money in the way that this House and the Irish people want to see it administered. After all, we could not do what we desire in any other way.  We cannot deal with the Government of India in the matter nor with the Mayor of Calcutta.  It is only through some charitable organisation that this can be done, and the Red Cross is a charitable organisation.</P>
      <P>There is one point that, perhaps, I should not mention, but I feel bound to do so.  We, on this side, feel, as regards sub-head B of the Estimate&mdash; Advances to the Irish Red Cross Society&mdash;that the sum set out is more or less of a loan, and that its repayment is more or less expected.  I want to give this word of warning, that when you give a loan to a charitable organisation it is very hard to get it back.  Speaking for the members on these benches, I think that we should treat sub-head B in the same way as it is proposed to treat sub-head A. Deputy Cosgrave has already made the point, that the Red Cross Society should be allowed to carry on.  We must realise that they want the money. Perhaps the money is required in a hurry.  The Red Cross organisation is out to collect £500,000 in this country, and I hope they will get it.  It is the work of every Irishman to help to get that money.  It is wanted suddenly and, for that reason, I say this £100,000 should be put into the hands of the society immediately, so that they can distribute it, because what is given early and what is given with goodwill is given twice over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1997" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Ireland have in the past been familiar with famine, and we are naturally torn with the desire to go to the aid of those smitten by that disease to the limit of our resources.  Therefore, I echo the confidence expressed by the Taoiseach, by the Leader of the Opposition, and by other Deputies who spoke on this Vote, that this will receive the unanimous approval of the House.  I especially welcome the Taoiseach's animadversion on the fact that relief in the form of money may not be the most effective way to meet the situation that obtains, and that were it in our power to send food or materials we would gladly do so.  Of course, there is the question of transport and distance, so that the surmounting obstacles may best be achieved by the body specially designed for the relief of distress on the spot.  In these circumstances I fully appreciate that money is the only way that we can offer help, and that the sum here provided is commensurate with our resources, or we would wish to send more.  When I come, however, to sub-head B, I do not wish to cavil over the propriety of joining it with the purpose set out in sub-head A.  I feel it incumbent on me to say something, which, perhaps, may not be very acceptable to those who hear it.  I fully appreciate how thankless a task it is for prominent men and women to undertake the organisation of a great relief organisation such as the Red Cross Society in this country.  So long as their efforts meet with success the results will very largely pass unnoticed, but, in so far as their exertions fail to achieve the desired end, abundant publicity will illuminate their failure, and they will be widely called to account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing all that in mind I suggest that if the organisation comes to Dáil Eireann to ask for such a very substantial sum as £100,000, even as a loan, it should be in a position to satisfy the community as a whole that the work they have undertaken to do is being done with maximum efficiency. I am not in a position to judge how far the organising activities of the Irish Red Cross have been attended with success.  I do know that in other <Col N="1998" /> countries where the organisation is longer established, notably the United States of America, it has become a very highly efficient organisation for relief.  I am bound to say, so far as my information goes, the organisation in this country has tended, certainly in many rural areas with which I am familiar, to dwindle away.  Branches have been started with great enthusiasm, considerable numbers have been enrolled, brisk activity has been embarked upon, but in the passage of time the whole thing has wilted slowly away.  It may be different in other parts.  I think we should be clear in our minds as to what future the Red Cross Society has laid out for itself in this country.  Does it intend to be the channel through which this community will feel free to make contributions to neighbouring countries in need, such as we are doing in regard to Bengal, or does it intend to maintain an active organisation throughout the country?</P>
    <P>I should imagine that the maintenance of activity through the country should be the first concern.  If that is so, it would be well if some other occasion were taken to communicate to the country at large what measures of success have attended its efforts so far. Making every allowance for the youth of the movement, and for the special difficulties with which it has had to labour, has the best value that could be expected been secured from the expenditure of whatever money was expended?  While expressing warmest appreciation of the efforts of those who undertook the responsibility of organising the society in this country, and while I desire to emphasise in public that everyone recognises the difficulties with which the organisation had to contend in the early stages, I think the society has reached a stage when it should face boldly the fact that results must be expected if large sums are to be subscribed.</P>
    <P>As there is an appeal for £500,000 for the Irish Red Cross, this would be an appropriate period for a review of the work done and the measure of success that attended its efforts. Might I suggest that in making that report such failure as may have been encountered should not be minimised? <Col N="1999" /> Any failure should be boldly and clearly stated, so that those who have seen failure, and know its dimensions, should learn that the central executive was aware of the failure, and was quite prepared to ventilate it fully, evaluate it calmly.  By recalling frankly what it believed to have been its successes and permanent achievements, public confidence would be strengthened and confirmed and the appeal for this £500,000 would be sped on its way in the most effective possible manner.  I rejoice to think that the Red Cross has been established in this country.  I hope it will develop and have the support of all sections of the community.  I am satisfied that if its executive takes the whole community into its confidence, it will have from the community maximum cooperation. I have no doubt that the men and women who have accepted responsibility for the direction of this movement in the country did not under-estimate the magnitude of the burden they were taking up when they accepted responsibility, and I think most sections of our community will agree that the public character of those who have accepted these burdens is calculated to create confidence in those who looked to them for substantial results in the years to come. Frankness will purchase confidence from the public, and I invite the Red Cross movement in this country, on the eve of their appeal, to give the community at large a general review of their achievements and failures to date, so that we may embark on the new departure with every hope of permanent and enduring success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is anything which justifies one's appreciation of the humanitarian sensibilities of our people, it is the action, too long delayed, may I say, of the Taoiseach to-day.  When I came in here and got this notification that the Government, at last, after many weeks, had risen to an appreciation of the needs of the multitudes of enslaved peoples in British India, I thought that at last there was some justification for their continuance as a Government.  It is a <Col N="2000" /> most gracious gesture.  I do not think this is a fitting time or place to discuss the question of the organisation of the Irish Red Cross Society, its energy or lack of energy, its competence or incompetence, but as one who, for the last few weeks, has been associated with individuals of different opinions in this country in an effort to get even the ear of the public on this matter, I am deeply gratified that the spokesman of the Irish race is sending a word of comfort and making a gesture of help to the enslaved millions in British India.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago, the Trades Council of Dublin, as subscribers to the Red Cross funds, passed a resolution calling upon the Red Cross Society to make a gesture, knowing the limited amount of their funds, to these people. It took them nearly a fortnight to make the gesture&mdash;I suppose, the utmost of their power&mdash;and they sent £2,000 to Calcutta.  The resolution was sent to the Press, but we found there was no room in some of the papers for even that resolution.  Some of them were very careful to censor its format&mdash; references to Calcutta went in but references to where Calcutta lay were not printed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to take advantage of this opportunity to cast reflections upon any nation or upon any Government, but when my friend, Deputy Donnellan, takes to himself some particular honour as being the chosen of God, I say that I think God loves all His children, irrespective of the localities in which they were born or of the nations to which they belong.  Sometimes He chastens some of us and at other times we are not called upon to receive the chastisement we deserve. If there is any nation which has been apathetic and lacking in responsiveness during the purgatorial years since 1939, surely it is this nation.  We have stood apart from and above the struggle, and some time ago when poor unfortunate working-class people were being &ldquo;blitzed&rdquo; in London, the trade union movement, and particularly in Dublin, tried to make a gesture to our comrades who were going through that terrible experience.  We went to the Government and asked them to allow <Col N="2001" /> us to take the children of our own people&mdash;many of them our own blood and of our own nation&mdash;and comfort them in our own homes.  After seven weeks, we got a direct negative from the Government official.  They would not allow us even to bring in our own and give them comfort and sustenance temporarily.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the minds of these men have been changed, and that their hearts have turned to the needs of this great mass of suffering humanity in India.  Two thousand people were dying daily, not in the hospitals, but on the streets of Calcutta, and we gave them no gesture of comfort, but now, after ten weeks when the death rate has gone down.  I understand, to something like 200 a day, from famine and disease, this Government has risen to the occasion.  Do not let us quarrel about the repayment of this £100,000. We cannot measure our love of humanity in terms of pounds, shillings and pence.  It is not worthy of us, and I am glad that the Leader of the Labour Party mentioned, in passing, what some of the people of India did in the way of a gesture in '47, and the early part of '48.  Sometimes we forget what has been done for us in the years past.  I am glad also that Deputy Dillon referred to the Americas, though not, as he might have done, in some eloquent phrase worthy of the project before us.  I cannot, however, understand Deputy Cosgrave's quarrelling about the form of the gesture.  I know that he is just as deeply stirred by the emotional values of the action of the Taoiseach as any of us, but why quarrel to-day about its form or about the competence or incompetence of any organisation?</P>
    <P>Let us all together agree that this has been too long delayed.  We cannot give these people food out of our own store, because we have not got it, because we are subject to the same selfishness on the part of a certain section of our people as those unfortunate victims in Calcutta, Madras, and other parts of British India.  This position is not at all confined to Bengal.  There are three other provinces in a desperate condition.  Yet, there is plenty of food in India, and <Col N="2002" /> we have seen published in the Press the menu of an 11 course dinner to which certain members of the governing classes sat down, while the unfortunate subject people were dying for lack of the pennyworth of rice which in Calcutta would keep a man, his wife and five children.  These people ate all kinds of luscious foods, while bands played, and while unfortunate human beings were dying outside.  In our own country we lack food because of selfishness and narrowness, and because of an unwillingness to labour on the earth which will give us back that abundance of yield which we can gain from it by united and co-ordinated effort.</P>
    <P>The narrowness represented by the governing classes of Bengal and Calcutta is also represented even in this country.  What was done for our countrymen in Donegal when 19 or 20 lives were lost by an unfortunate mischance? Look at the amount subscribed to comfort those who were bereaved.  The day of repentance is due in this country, a day at least for consideration of all our sins of omission and commission, and it would be a good thing if we set apart one day, under the advice of the Government, and called upon this nation to remember&mdash;and, by the way, it is very opportune, as this is a day of remembrance &mdash;the many millions who cast their lives away in 1914-18&mdash;we have the deepest respect for them all, no matter from what nation they came&mdash;and also those of our own people who gave up all they could in the later years.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Taoiseach that he should go further and ask the nation to hold a day of remembrance on which every one of us, to the limit of our means, would subscribe in order to raise this £250,000 in one day.  We can do it if we want to do it.  We know that we cannot send food from here.  But what about utilising our credits in the Argentine, or in some other great grain-growing countries, and sending the grain from there in bottoms chartered there?  Wicked as the people of the world are in their vicious hatred of each other, no Government would stand in the way of allowing ships loaded with grain to <Col N="2003" /> leave those countries which have got a superfluous quantity.  There is any amount of grain to be had in the Argentine.  Why not try and do that directly through our own agent there?</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Taoiseach, notwithstanding my differences with him, that from my knowledge of his activities from boyhood to manhood I think this is one of the noblest gestures he personally has made.  I think everybody is comforted by the fact that he has the approval of the Government behind him.  I put to him the suggestion I have made to ask the nation to set aside a day of remembrance in order to make a contribution to the noblest work that men can undertake.  This effort you are making will put this nation's name amongst the nations of the earth.</P>

      <P>In looking over this Vote, I do not know that it is wise to have the halving arrangement because, as some speakers have said, when an advance of money is made one, at any rate, theoretically looks for it to be repaid.  If we have any reservations, now is the time to mention them.  Nobody would suggest that this sum, substantial though it is for this country, should not be applied to any one of the areas looking for relief from the distress due to war and famine.  If every penny of it were given to India, for instance, no one could say that it was too large a sum to give, having regard to the distress prevailing.  Although, perhaps, one does not like it, I do not see any other way of giving this help except in money, because, although one would like to send the relief in kind&mdash;and that is the way that people want it most&mdash;we have not got the food to spare here and we have not got the ships in which to send it out.  If, for instance, we make a purchase of food for India, we have no guarantee that it will be shipped in time to reach the sufferers.  Presumably, the people on the spot can make the most effective use of the funds at their disposal.  No matter how these funds reach them, I am afraid it is the only way to do it. I remember talking to an old lady who, <Col N="2004" /> during the Famine of '47, distributed bread from a pony to the sufferers-That bread was made from grain which had arrived in ships in the south.  One probably could not cavil if the Red Cross choose to give the whole of this to India.  At the same time, there is the whole of Europe to be considered as well.  The Taoiseach mentioned Greece.  I do not know, just as he does not know, whether the people of Greece are the greatest sufferers, or how you can pretend to put a sort of yard-stick to the distress prevailing. But, when the period of emergency ends and peace comes again, no one would suggest that this appeal will be the only one that will reach us.  I do not know how far the Taoiseach and the Government have considered this matter from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time there is an organisation called the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Do the Taoiseach and the Government intend to stand aloof from that?&mdash;because now is the time to consider what channel we should select.  There is this much to be said about distributing charity&mdash;I call it charity, but I hope that any person who gets it will not think that I mentioned that word in any disparaging way&mdash;that if the people who are distributing relief can get together, the wider the field and the more contacts they have with other people, distributing probably far greater amounts either in money or in kind, the better chance there is of the money reaching the most deserving.  I think it would be a great pity if, through non-co-operation with other nations distributing relief, we found afterwards that our money had not been distributed to the very best advantage.  I think the responsibility is on the Taoiseach and the Government to see if any conditions should be imposed in regard to this grant. Although it could all be sent to India. I would not like someone to say: &ldquo;You sent every penny of your charity to India and you have not a halfpenny left for Europe.&rdquo;  No doubt the Taoiseach will consider that matter.  I do not know whether he can make any pronouncement on that before this <Col N="2005" /> Vote passes, but I put forward the suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is gratifying that every Party in the House is unanimous in making this contribution towards the alleviation of distress in India and other countries.  We do not make this contribution in any spirit of vainglorious condescension.  Having regard to the magnitude of the calamity which has overtaken the people of India, we recognise that this is quite a small contribution.  As the Taoiseach pointed out, it may be as much as we can afford at the moment. But we realise that it is only very little having regard to the magnitude of the problem.  We make this contribution fully realising how much this nation of ours has owed to the generosity of other countries in the past. We make it realising how other nations have contributed towards aiding our people in days of distress and suffering. We make it realising, also, that it may come to our turn again in the future to have occasion to call upon the generosity of other peoples.  No individual can tell what suffering or what calamity may befall him before he passes out of life.  Neither can any nation or community forecast the sufferings or tribulations that may befall them.  We may, by the exercise of prudence and energy, be able to avert the pangs of hunger or famine, but there are other evils attendant upon a major war such as we are passing through, namely, plague and pestilence.  We know that after the last European war this nation was swept by a plague which sent hundreds of our young men and women to early graves and we may anticipate with fear and trembling what may happen when this emergency is over or before it is over.  In the event of such a calamity overcoming this nation, it would be well for us to be able to reflect that, in time of distress for other nations, we came to their aid and, on that basis, can appeal for assistance in our own misfortunes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the contribution embodied in this Vote for the relief of distress in India is justified, and also the advance made to the Red Cross, because we cannot foresee how <Col N="2006" /> soon the funds of the Red Cross may be urgently required to relieve distress in some nation other than India and it is most desirable that funds should be placed at the disposal of that organisation in order to meet an immediate demand.  The war at the moment appears to be rushing to its climax and it is, therefore, only natural to expect distress and suffering, with consequent urgent demands on the resources of the Red Cross organisation in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should speak about the matter to which Deputy Cosgrave referred, namely, the question of the advance.  Before I do so, however, perhaps I should talk more generally about this whole situation as far as we are concerned.  I should prefer by far that aid of this kind, so far as it was at all possible to do it, should come as a result of individual subscriptions by the members of our community to a fund such as this. I believe that that is the right way to do it.  In that way you will have no doubt that those who are contributing are those who are able to contribute. When the Government makes contributions, these contributions have ultimately to come out of taxation and you are, so to speak, forcing people to give their mite without their own will coming directly with it.  If they gave that mite themselves it would be of much more value for the individual and of much more value in general.  Consequently, we postponed taking action of this kind until I felt we could not postpone it any longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Red Cross is going out to ask the individuals of this country who can afford to make subscriptions to give these subscriptions willingly, and even to give it to such a point that it will hurt&mdash;as was the phrase used when we were getting subscriptions for our cause in America&mdash;to give to such an extent that it will really be a sacrifice, and that they will feel that they are doing something of themselves to help this cause.  When we vote money in this particular way we do not have that.  The word &ldquo;gesture&rdquo; has been used here a number of times.  There is that to it. There is a gesture of understanding, showing that the organised community <Col N="2007" /> as represented here has an understanding of the situation.  But, from the point of view of our people generally, I think it would be very much better that the amounts that are contributed should come as a result of voluntary subscriptions by our people.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, this particular Vote has come before the Dáil as a result of a telegram which I got a few days ago.  The telegram was this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Bengal's 60,000,000 in grip of unprecedented tragic famine.  Epidemics exacting heavy tolls in rural areas.  Children, women worst affected.  Mayor's fund rendering medical aid, catering free meals for children diet on extensive scale. Eagerly expect best co-operation to save human lives.  Substantial financial help imperative.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>By whom is it signed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was sent to me signed by the Mayor of Calcutta.  Here was a direct request.  Up to the present the Red Cross have taken action.  As I indicated already, they had asked the Indian Red Cross whether financial aid would be of value to them, in other words, whether they could distribute food if they got financial aid, and they were told that any financial help that was sent would be very gladly received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The message from the Mayor of Calcutta and the reply sent to the Red Cross indicated quite clearly that there was a way in which we could help, because our efforts so far to help in kind have not been, to say the least of it, very satisfactory.  We found it almost impossible.  Although, as Deputy Larkin has pointed out, there are other countries where it could be available, it is not so easy to get it. It is not so easy to get the ships. Therefore, here was a case where we were able to give help.  We were told by the people asking for the help that we could help, and I felt this was a case in which we could take action. I realised that the Red Cross Funds, as they are at present, are such as <Col N="2008" /> made it impossible for them to give anything that would really be substantial. There was only one way in which that substantial aid could be given quickly and that was by coming to the House and asking for a Vote so as to put them in funds.  I think it is the best way.  It is better for us to do any international work we possibly can through the recognised international organisation of the Red Cross, of which our own Red Cross Society is a branch than to be trying to set up <i>ad hoc</i> bodies to do it, or to be seeking to do it by some other organisations.  Therefore, it seemed to me that the only way in which I could reply worthily to that telegram, from the Irish people's point of view, was to come here to the House and ask that a substantial sum should be made immediately available to the Red Cross so that, when needed, it could be sent to the Indian branch of the Red Cross.  That has been established since 1929 and has been recognised by the Central International Red Cross Organisation at Geneva.  It is a part of the international Red Cross organisation, and, in my opinion, it is obvious that the most appropriate body to take charge of and distribute any funds that we might be able to make available would be the Indian Red Cross Society, as they would be in the best position to decide how the money should be allocated. Accordingly, I come to this House, in the first instance, to get this sum of £100,000 so that the Red Cross can get that money to enable them to send it, in answer to that appeal from the people of India.</P>
    <P>I realise, of course, that, perhaps to-morrow, a similar case may arise. We do not know.  There may be other appeals of a similar kind to which we should respond.  Again, the only way in which the Government could deal with such an appeal would be to hand over whatever sums might be available to the Red Cross, and in that case I would have to come to the House, as I have done to-day, and ask for an allocation to be made.  Therefore, the object of the second part here is to put the Red Cross immediately in funds, so that they will be in a position <Col N="2009" /> to deal with situations as they arise, since the funds have been provided already.  That is the reason for the second part here.</P>
    <P>I may say that, even before it was necessary to bring this matter to the attention of the House, I was concerned as to whether we should not have another sum made available for the relief of distress in Europe and other countries.  There is another point to be considered also.  The Red Cross organisation has to plan its activities ahead, and now, at any rate, as far as planning ahead is concerned, they will be able to carry out some of their plans, in the certain knowledge that they have a definite amount of £100,000 which can be availed of the moment it is required.  Actually, I expect that the Red Cross organisation will not ask for that money unless there is an immediate need for it, but the fact that they know that that amount is to their credit will enable them to deal with any emergencies that may arise.  In that connection, however, I hope that nobody in this country will take that as an excuse for not making his personal contribution.  Every one of us has a duty to ourselves, and to humanity, so to speak, in the present situation, and I do hope that this appeal which is going out from the Red Cross will be taken seriously by every person in this country.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I have not the eloquence of Deputy Larkin to enforce that appeal, but I am making it sincerely, and making it with the full responsibility of my position.  I am asking the Irish people, who have been helped in their hours of necessity by other peoples, to make as generous a contribution as they can, so as to make available as quickly as possible this 500,000 pounds which the Red Cross is looking for.  It is true that our own Red Cross is a relatively new organisation, and that organisation has had to be built up during a very difficult period.  At the time that our Red Cross was trying to form its branches and build up a membership, do not forget that we were appealing to all the most active and energetic people in the country to get in, either to the permanent military forces or to the various <Col N="2010" /> auxiliary defence forces, such as the L.D.F., the L.S.F., the A.R.P., or the fire-fighting organisations.  We were appealing to people to join these forces at the same time as we were appealing to people to join the Red Cross.  In other words, at the time that our Red Cross was trying to build itself up the most active and energetic elements of our community were being asked to go into other organisations, and it stands to reason that, under these circumstances, the task of organising the Red Cross was rendered very difficult.  For instance, the men to whom such appeals were made felt that such work as Red Cross work was more suitable for women, and that their business during a time of crisis was to join the fighting forces.  Of course, if that situation had not existed at the time, quite a large number of the people who have been most active in the L.D.F., the L.S.F. or the other military organisations, or even of those who joined the regular Army, would have been most active in the organisation of Red Cross branches in their own particular areas, and I do believe that, under ordinary circumstances, a branch of the Red Cross would have been established in every parish in the country.  As it is, however, looking through this pamphlet&mdash; you will all be able to see it for yourselves and so I do not propose to take up the time of the House by reading it now &mdash; it is quite clear that the Red Cross here have performed a wonderful work of organisation, in view of the circumstances of the time and the difficulties with which they had to contend. They have done a tremendous amount of work in training personnel to meet the sort of danger which threatened our own community here, and that work is still being done.  I am perfectly certain that any suggestions with regard to the improvement of the organisation, or any help that can be given, will be accepted gratefully.</P>
    <P>For instance, take the case of the help that might be given by members of this House.  I do not know to what extent we have helped in the organisation of that body.  Speaking for myself, I have to admit that for every nine times I spoke at meetings in connection with recruiting for the military forces &mdash; whether the Army itself, the <Col N="2011" /> L.D.F., the L.S.F., A.R.P., or allied defence organisations &mdash; I only spoke once, perhaps, on behalf of the Red Cross.  That, of course, was quite natural, because the main point in most of my speeches in public during the crisis, when dealing with these various organisations, was to build up an efficient fighting and defensive force.  That, however, did not mean that I did not fully appreciate the importance of the Red Cross organisation; but when you have only a certain amount of time you, naturally, deal with the point which seems to you to be the most important at the moment, but I do think that if the members of this House would help in getting support and subscriptions for the Red Cross to the same extent as they helped and encouraged other organisations since the emergency, we would have as great a success, so far as the Red Cross is concerned, as we achieved by working together to build up our fighting and defensive organisations.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that, from the national point of view, this Red Cross organisation is the best to which we could entrust such funds as these. With regard to making provision for the post-war period, I am not quite sure that I can see eye to eye with Deputy Cosgrave as to the best way in which our national efforts could be put forward to the best advantage.  It may be very difficult for any Government to build up any other organisation than the Red Cross to do such work, and, after all, it appears to me that it would be better to have the Red Cross organisation already organised and equipped so that they would be able to deal with that work; to depend upon them to as great an extent as possible to see that the funds are properly distributed, and to assist them to whatever extent we are capable of, so that when the time comes they will be able to deal with emergencies as they arise.  I think we should regard the Red Cross, for the present, as the best organisation through which to give help to other countries, not alone now, but even after the war.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> I have considered this question a good deal, and I do believe that, after the war, we will find it exceptionally difficult to make contributions in the way of food.  Food has been suggested as one of the contributions that we could make, but I think that we will find that a very difficult problem.  Nobody can possibly know when this war is going to end until it is practically over.  Then, again, there is the difficulty of building up supplies here of the type that we will find necessary to keep for our own uses.  We know that, in the case of some of the belligerent countries in Europe, an organisation has been formed for the building up of supplies which are to be used for the rehabilitation of Europe after the war. At the present time that organisation is confined to the set of belligerents either allied or associated with them. I think the neutral States as such have no part in that organisation, so that it is difficult in advance to be able to form part of a greater organisation. What we must do is to try to fit ourselves so that, when the war ends, we shall be able to give whatever help we can, and give it in the most effective way.</P>
    <P>It is not easy at all to make plans in advance which will be reasonably satisfactory, and the question of supplying food is going to be extremely difficult.  It has been suggested that we might produce the food ourselves.  I think that would be a slower process than leaving it to a body like the Red Cross in India which will be in touch with the International Red Cross, and with the Red Cross in Britain and America.  With the resources at their disposal they will be able to get these other bodies to act as agents for them, and to make purchases probably much more quickly than we could make purchases individually ourselves.  I should be glad to hear Deputies' views on the type of organisation which they think should be built up.  My own feeling at the moment is that we shall have to depend largely on our own Red Cross in co-operation with the International Red Cross and the various national organisations of the Red Cross as the medium through which we shall be able to give any help we can.  Naturally, I have listened with interest to this discussion, <Col N="2013" /> and I have a very open mind on any suggestions that can be made by Deputies on the opposite benches.</P>
    <P>With regard to our own Red Cross, I have the feeling that up to the present it has suffered to no small extent from want of publicity.  It has done a great deal of work about which very few people know.  I have here a summary of the work that it has done since the war began.  So far, it states, it has not been possible for the Irish Red Cross to do direct relief work for other countries with the exception of sending food to Spain.  It has been able to help distress in these countries through the medium of the International Red Cross through which it has sent contributions from time to time for purposes which were most urgent. These include the relief of distressed civilians in China, Greece and Finland, earthquake sufferers in Turkey, Polish refugees in Hungary, French refugees and also French, German and Yugoslavian prisoners of war.  It has also been able, through the International Red Cross, to help distressed Irish people in the Far East.  That shows that, within its means, it has been alive to the distress that exists in various parts of the world. Of course, its means were limited and the amount it was able to give in any individual case would be regarded by the larger countries, whose resources would be 100 times greater than ours, as not very large.  But in so far as it has been able within its resources to help, it has been energetic and it has been on the look-out to see where the need is greatest.  It is, therefore, getting a training at present which will fit it for the position which we will have to face when the war is over.</P>
    <P>I have told you that the Indian Red Cross is representative of the Indian people and, therefore, I think that, so far as distribution and economy of distribution are concerned, there is no better body to whom we could make the moneys available.  I am very glad &mdash;it is of course only as I expected&mdash; that the members of this House, standing for the Irish people, have voted this money and that not a single word has been said against making this sum available.  I repeat that I <Col N="2014" /> should prefer that the Government had not had to come into this matter at all and that the organisation could rely on voluntary subscriptions.  I agree with Deputy Cosgrave to that extent, that it is far better that it should be left to voluntary subscriptions if that could possibly be done. My only reason for breaking that rule is the urgency of this particular case.</P>

      <P>That a sum, not exceeding £30,500, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1944, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs, and of certain Services administered by that Office (No. 16 of 1924).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate for External Affairs for the current financial year is £98,000 That is an increase of £2,282 compared with 1942-43.  Receipts from fees, etc., however, are estimated at £22,300, an increase of £800 on the estimated receipts for 1942-43.  Actually, there have been no significant increases in staff or expansion of existing services, and the increase of £2,282 is due very largely to normal salary increments and exchange compensation and, in the case of sub-head A of the Vote, to the fact that we are this year obliged to provide in this Vote for the replacement of certain junior staff which other Government Departments have until recently been able to lend to this Department.  Provision for the salaries of this loaned staff was formerly borne on the Votes of their parent Departments, so that we are now providing in this Vote for expenditure <Col N="2015" /> that has hitherto been borne on other Votes.</P>
    <P>When presenting this Estimate last year, I gave the Dáil a fairly full review of the activities of the Department, particularly the activities that have arisen from the war situation and the difficulties in which our citizens abroad have found themselves in consequence. All those activities that have arisen as a result of the war situation continue to take up an appreciable amount of the Department's time and attention.  For instance, remittances totalling the equivalent of approximately £14,000 have been made during the year to a number of our citizens in 12 different European countries. The necessary funds were lodged with the Department by the relatives and friends of the citizens and paid to them through our Legations on the Continent.  Close on 900 individual payments were involved in the cases to which I refer.</P>
    <P>Numerous inquiries affecting the welfare and whereabouts of our citizens all over the world were also dealt with.  Ordinary postal communications with countries abroad are, nowadays, slow and uncertain and, in some cases, non-existent.  Deputies will realise the great comfort it is to people, both here at home and in countries abroad, to be able to get news, even at secondhand, in regard to those who are dear to them.  Wherever possible, the Department, as far as it can, assists such of our citizens as desire to come home. Over 70 &mdash; including a number of priests from Rome &mdash; have come home from the Continent in the past financial year. The difficulties in regard to securing travelling facilities and the necessary visas etc., are very great and have, in fact, of late increased.</P>
    <P>A final aspect of the Department's war-time activities to which Deputies might like me to refer is that of the collection of debts due to firms and individuals in this country from European countries with which the normal banking facilities are no longer available. Since the outbreak of the war, over £8,000 has been collected by the Department in such cases, for close on 60 firms and individuals here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2016" /> As I pointed out last year, much of the ordinary work of the Department is still carried on, despite the war conditions.  One example frequently referred to in the debates on this Estimate is the work in connection with estates of deceased persons abroad.  During the year, the Department handled nearly 800 new estate cases and the amount of money which accrued to Irish beneficiaries was appreciably more than $600,000, of which over $300,000 was distributed to the Irish beneficiaries directly through our Consulates in the United States and the Department.</P>
    <P>Those are the details of the Estimate and of the Department's activities. I do not think that now is the time for anything like a general international survey.  Most of the Deputies have been following events as closely as I have been able to follow them and the general situation is known to all.  What the post-war international political position will be it is too soon to state at this particular time.  Naturally, it is our business to keep as close a watch as we can on developments, with a view to being able to take our part in any post-war international organisation that may be set up for the purpose of securing the maintenance of peace.  Our national wishes in that matter are clear from our actions in the past.  We were ready to join any international organisation which aimed at collective security and the maintenance of peace on the basis of the equality of sovereign right between nations, large and small.  In any such organisation in the future we will, I feel certain, be prepared as a nation once more to take our part.  On another occasion, it may be useful to talk on that particular subject and to give views as to the basis on which such an organisation must be founded if it is to have any hope of achieving this aim.</P>
    <P>Most of us are aware of the faults there were in the League of Nations. We were aware of them long before the present war broke out.  Nobody seemed to be able to find a solution for the obvious difficulties that were there.  Whether such a solution can be got in the future remains to be seen. <Col N="2017" /> The one thing that is certain is that no solution can be found unless the various nations are prepared to make the sacrifices which appear to me&mdash; and, I am sure, to any other Deputies who have been thinking about these matters &mdash; to be absolutely necessary. Apparently before this war, nations were not prepared to make those sacrifices: they wanted the results, without being ready to make the sacrifices. We cannot have it that way; the world cannot have it that way.  If we want peace, if peace is of primary importance, the sacrifices that peace requires will have to be made.</P>
    <P>It would be idle for us to go into a discussion on that matter at the present moment.  However, I was asked a question by Deputy Anthony the other day which seemed to indicate anxiety in that regard, and I want to avail of this occasion to assure every Deputy that, so far as we are concerned, and so far as we are able to direct national policy, our actions will be in the direction of being prepared once more to take our share in any international organisation that may be set up for the maintenance of peace and for national security.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>While, possibly, during the last four years, our votes and our debates in this House in relation to our own internal politics have been of the most outstanding importance, we have now, I think, reached a point where external affairs will take on, possibly, a greater importance and greater meaning.  We have been successful in going through this, in my opinion, major portion of the world conflict.  I am quite convinced that we are now not merely over the half-way mark but so rapidly approaching the determination of the conflict that, like many of the military experts, we may be overwhelmed by events.  While the viewpoint put forward by An Taoiseach may be correct, that it is possibly a little too early to try to formulate our policies and even our machinery to meet the post-war situation, we must take cognisance of the changes that have taken place, and, above all, of the speed of those changes.  We have to realise that the situation we were in some years ago <Col N="2018" /> no longer exists for us.  We have of our own voluntary desire pursued a certain policy &mdash; a policy of neutrality.  Our people as a whole have decided on that policy and have reiterated their decision time after time; but, just as war exacts its cost in flesh and blood and the economic evils of our civilisation, so also does our policy of neutrality call forth problems.  If we do not realise that, and do not take steps to reduce those problems to the smallest dimensions, the price to us in the post-war years may be greater than the price we would have had to pay in the war years if we had not followed the policy of neutrality.  It is time we ceased to put our heads in the sand and to look upon ourselves as living in an outpost here in the western ocean, entirely unconnected with these world changes in events.  We should not think that, because we have a perfectly legitimate right to decide our own national policy and the particular path we want to traverse, that policy of ours will not have its reactions on the minds and thoughts of the people outside our own country.</P>
      <P>We have had many friends in different countries in the world, but I am afraid that our friends may not be as numerous as we might like in the years immediately ahead.  Therefore, while we are quite entitled to stand by our own policy, by our own rights, we must realise that those rights, and our utilisation of them, need some explanation. We must make some attempt to get those people who, in the past, have been our friends, and who, in the future, could well be our friends again, to understand our position.  They may not sympathise with us, but at least they will give us due credit for our earnestness and sincerity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the debate on wireless broadcasting I heard a suggestion from Deputy Esmonde to the effect that our broadcasting station should be utilised to put our point of view before the world.  The Minister's reply was that we are sick to death of propaganda. It seems to me that we are very badly served by the Minister responsible for dealing with that particular form of expression.  Surely now is the time when all our resources, not <Col N="2019" /> only the wireless and Press but even personal contacts, should be availed of.  Now is the time, I suggest, when individuals who, by reason of their outlook, not only in national but also in international affairs, are in a position and have the right to speak to the people of other countries, should utilise our wireless service.  All the forces at our disposal should be utilised to bring this country again to the notice of the civilised world.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that the world is divided into camps and certain nations have been engaged in conflict for the last four years.  Throughout this great conflict there have been certain fundamental issues on which we, as ordinary decent men and women, have different viewpoints.  There are certain issues involved which this, as a democratic country, views from different aspects. In this country we are living in the democratic way; we follow the ordinary, peaceful course normally followed by small nations.  If because of our geographical position, because of our economic and social circumstances, we have decided to follow a certain line in this great conflict, that does not preclude us from considering world-wide issues, issues far greater than any immediately affecting the belligerents. It is on these world-wide issues that we must make ourselves known and understood by those forces which stand for civilisation and for the progress of the ordinary common man.  They must realise that we stand with them and that we are not content to remain an isolated outpost in the ocean following our own narrow, insular life and not desiring to associate ourselves with the wider civilisation outside.</P>
    <P>Many of the links we had in the past have been severed, not deliberately but because of the conditions which have prevailed and the policies which have been followed.  We must try to re-establish ourselves.  We may do so, in the beginning, in a small and humble way; perhaps in certain cases we may do it in haphazard fashion and by roundabout means; but we cannot afford to stay still and wait until the holocaust is over and then expect someone to call us to the conference <Col N="2020" /> table.  Certain rights would seem to have been established by some small nations, rights that will entitle them to a place at the council table when the war is over.  We have not got such a right at the moment, even though we have an historic heritage in relation to our struggles for freedom and an association with such struggles elsewhere. These things are apt to be overlooked, and it is necessary that we should bring ourselves again under the notice of the world.</P>
    <P>I was rather disappointed when the appeal made by Deputy Esmonde was met in that narrow fashion, the Minister merely saying that we are sick to death of propaganda.  Surely everything we formulate and spread abroad, either from this House, through our political Parties, or our cultural and social organisations, and even in our schools, is just propaganda, a system of propagating news and opinions, and all that makes for intellectual development.  But, to take the narrow view that, because propaganda is being abused and turned very often into a hated symbol, we must deny ourselves the use of such a powerful instrument, is typical of one of the most dangerous outlooks that is prevalent to-day.  Some of us are inclined to sit here contentedly and watch the world go by, but I suggest we should take care lest the world may reach a new stage of development and we will be left behind.</P>
    <P>We are a civilised people living in a world which has, for a short period, gone mad; but it will move back again to civilisation.  Civilisation represents life in its highest form and, while the world has been engaged in dreadful conflict, underneath it all a healthy civilised life has existed and that is now endeavouring to struggle through the hard crust that has covered the world during the past four years. Every day that passes, that life is becoming stronger and it has to be nourished, not only by those directly involved in the conflict, but more especially by nations that have been fortunate enough not to have had, except in a very minute degree, a dreadful burden placed upon them. Therefore, they had some opportunity <Col N="2021" /> properly to value the progress and civilisation that are our common heritage.</P>
    <P>I urge that we should start now to make our position clear to other nations.  Apart from the main camps engaged in conflict, there are small countries, many of them inoffensive and democratic in their outlook, and progressive, trying to live their own lives, but they have been overwhelmed by this avalanche.  Whatever may be our feelings with regard to the main conflict, surely every one of us is at one with these individual countries, not only in their suffering, but in their desire to restore their national life and their social and economic institutions. It is most probable that there will be some form of international organisation established after this war.  It will be based on the experience gained in recent years and it will be strengthened by the lessons men have learned in bitterness and suffering. Surely the basis of that organisation, if it is going to be successful, will depend largely on the small units that go to make up civilisation.</P>
    <P>On the previous Vote we expressed a desire to make some contribution to the recovery of the world.  It seems to me that, in addition to the contribution that represents our humanitarian feelings, our contribution of finance and food and medical supplies, we should do something more.  Already in a number of neutral countries people are taking active steps to bring together trained personnel, especially in the medical field, so that immediately facilities offer themselves, even before the termination of actual hostilities, those trained people in medical and social work, and in the various sciences, will be available to be thrown in at the first opportunity to give their services in restoring and building up life in those shattered countries.  That would be even more important than the actual contribution which we could make in food, finance or clothing.</P>
    <P>We have claimed here for many years that in days gone by we were the apostles of western Europe, and brought to those countries civilisation, Christianity and a new way of life.  We <Col N="2022" /> have got to realise that a new epoch is coming in the world, and that our claim to a place in the new State is not going to be automatically granted to us because of what has taken place either in the immediate or the remote past.  I think that to-day and for the future not only countries, but possibly even individuals, are going to be judged on their immediate merits and contributions.  In my view it would be possible, with the actual surplus that we have in this country of trained minds, especially in the medical profession, either through the Red Cross or some other form, to organise groups of those men and women &mdash; doctors, nurses and people trained in social work of various forms &mdash; and give them charge of the duties that they will be expected to perform if they have already decided in their minds the lines on which they could operate.  In that way they would be ready, at the earliest possible moment, to give their contribution to this tremendous task confronting the world.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made reference to a conference that is being organised among one group of belligerents.  It seems to me, as I have said, that he has the feeling that we should wait to be asked.  I do not want to force upon the House or upon anybody else my own personal views of what is going to be the outcome of the present holocaust.  I think that to every thinking man the end is quite clear even now.  The end may come so quickly that we may be overwhelmed.  We have got to view it from the point of view, no matter how indifferent we may be about it, that we cannot wait and sit back to be asked.</P>
    <P>I think there is in the reports of that conference an indication that there may be a way in which we could bring ourselves back again to the notice of the peoples of eastern and western Europe, and find ourselves again associated with those with whom we have many common ties.  I agree that at the moment it is an awkward time to raise this question of policy.  There is very strong pressure from many parts of the House as to the means we should adopt in regard to our post-war policy.  On the question of external <Col N="2023" /> policy, we cannot afford to lose time, or wait to see how events will turn out. The shaping of events can already be plainly seen.  It does not require any deep student of foreign affairs to know what the main lines of that development may be.  There may be various small changes, but the main lines of the development for at least our generation are already quite clear.  We have got to decide how we are going to align ourselves with them.</P>
    <P>In this Vote some 14 of our representatives abroad are listed.  Of these, two are accredited to countries within the British Commonwealth of Nations, five in various cities of the United States, four are accredited to neutral countries, two to countries within the Axis and there are representatives to one or two others.  I realise that the basis of this representation is contained in our trading and economic relations with those countries, and of the need there is to give service to our nationals abroad.  There is one very significant omission to which I have already drawn the notice of the House, and that is that we have not got contact with one country which, on a previous occasion, we went out of our way to establish contact with when we ourselves were looking for friends. That is the Soviet Union.  I do not know why that is so.  Possibly, we may have our own views as to its political, social and economic system, or we may feel disturbed in our minds about having any association with it.  But there are many things that we disagree with in the world, both in the countries where we have representatives, and in the countries where we have none.  We cannot afford any longer to lack this contact with a nation that, apart altogether from its political system or its economic or social system, does represent not merely one-sixth of the world in geographical extent and nearly one-tenth of the world's people, and, that so far as recent years show, represents one of the most vital and powerful forces in the human race.</P>
    <P>I would submit that, while it may be difficult at the moment that our Government should approach this <Col N="2024" /> problem and should understand what the point of view of ordinary contacts is between groups in the civilised world &mdash; contacts with forces which are shaping and making our future destiny in the world &mdash; it is time we realised that insularity and intolerance are just as much a crime on our side as it may be on the side of those whom we condemn.</P>
    <P>It is time, I think, to revaluate our position and make ourselves known in the world.  It is very interesting to recall that a number of those countries which during recent years have been held up as pillars of wisdom, countries whom we were not only to follow in the world of external affairs but even in their system of internal affairs, have made some changes.  Whether their changes in foreign policy commend themselves to many people who have advocated their particular way of life here I do not know, but their views on internal policy can be very well tested by the opportunist changes that have taken place in foreign policy.  It is very interesting for us to reflect on the opportunism manifested among many of those countries in Europe.  In their ordinary social and economic systems they have been more or less opportunist, trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.</P>

      <P>I hope Deputy Larkin will not take it amiss when I compliment him on what I think those who agree and disagree with him must admit was a remarkable contribution to the debate in this House, remarkable not only for its courage, but for its obvious honesty of conviction, and the calm deliberation that characterised it.  I say that though I find myself in profound disagreement with him about a matter he mentioned.  I salute his courage and honesty.  I refer to what he said on the matter of having diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. I do not think that we should have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.  I do not think that, to borrow Deputy Larkin's own term, we should join in the ranks of those nations who run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.  This is a Catholic and a Christian country.  We proscribe no man's faith.  Anyone who desires to serve <Col N="2025" /> God according to his conscience is free to do so in this country.  I believe that in Germany and in Russia no man is free to render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's and to God the things that are God's.  I would have diplomatic relations with neither, whatever the cost materially or ideologically.  I would have diplomatic relations with neither one nor the other of those nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy or anybody else can carry conviction to my mind that religion is not proscribed in the Soviet Union, I will be in favour of establishing diplomatic relations with them.  I do not care whether a nation is authoritarian, socialist, or anything else within its own jurisdiction. That is the business of its own people, but all men have the right to render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's and to God the things that are God's, and no Christian man or woman can stand indifferently by while that right is denied to his fellow-man in any part of the world.</P>
      <P>It may not be possible to go directly to the aid of the individuals victimised, but it is, at least, possible for a small State of this kind to lend its moral weight, and to protest against such tyranny.  The proper way, it seems to me, for a Christian country to do that is to declare that it will have no contact with States or Governments that persecute the faith.  I have said before that all I ask from civil government is freedom for its citizens to render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and unto God the things that are God's, if they want to render them.  I do not expect civil Governments to make people good, but I do demand that civil Governments, wherever they are, should leave men free to do their duty by God, if they so desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rejoice in the impending destruction of Nazism in Germany.  I pray for the ultimate ruin and disappearance of Marxism and materialistic communism in Russia, and in every other State which has been contaminated by contact with it.  The United Nations, <Col N="2026" /> thank God, are winning this war without us.  I had no hesitation in saying since the beginning of this war that I had no doubt where our duty lay.  I believe that our duty was to render to the United Nations the same help and assistance that Portugal has given recently. I would have wished to do it from the very commencement of the struggle.  Deputy Larkin stated that our people, apparently, took a different view.  That was their sovereign right, but it was my duty to define my point of view in this House.  It was also my duty to accept the decision of the people but acceptance of that decision does not impose the duty of assent.  I dissent from that decision.  I think it was wrong.  I think it is wrong, and that for all time it will be recorded against us that it was a mistake.  But I do not know that the issue is now as live as it was last year, the year before, and the year before that, because the United Nations are winning this war without our help.  I thank God for it.</P>
    <P>In discussing our policy on the Vote for External Affairs I ask myself, what guiding line has our Minister for External Affairs in the things he does? I am informed that the policy of this country is one of indifferent neutrality. I solemnly protest against the offensive imputation that we Irish do not know of any difference between Nazi Germany and the United States of America.  I do not believe that is true.  I believe the vast bulk of our people recognise in the people of the United States of America a community peculiarly sympathetic to all we believe in, a community we would be proud to claim as our friends, a people on whom we were never ashamed to lean in the past, and whom, on different occasions, we promised to support if adversity ever came upon them.  I remember that when the Taoiseach was leaving the United States in 1921 he drafted a valedictory message, the concluding passage of which stated that he need not assure the American people of the gratitude of the Irish people for the assistance they had vouchsafed him, nor need he assure them that if the occasion should ever arise they would never turn to us in vain for help. <Col N="2027" /> What did the Taoiseach mean when he penned those words?</P>

I know that there are old grudges that could be used to stir up our people against Great Britain, and to make them foolishly desire that anyone could win the war as long as England was defeated.  The United States of America have been our friends at all times.  Does the Labour Party want the Nazis to win the war?

      <P>I want to direct attention to this fact, that, in pursuit of this extraordinary doctrine that we stand indifferently neutral between the Axis, on the one side, and the United Nations, on the other, we have taken up the position that although the Axis, to our certain knowledge have dropped on our territory parachutists who were concerned to carry on sabotage and other improper activities within our dominion, although they have landed on our shores persons dispatched here, by their own admission, by the Germany Army to carry out sabotage work, albeit they were subsequently captured by our forces, although they have dropped bombs upon our territory, although they have sunk our ships and although they have machine-gunned, notoriously, the men sailing in our ships, of contenting ourselves with mild diplomatic protests.  When they came in great force on two separate occasions to &ldquo;blitz&rdquo; Belfast, we expressed our sympathy with our fellow-countrymen in Belfast.  We dispatched aid to them, but by implication suggested that, inasmuch as Belfast had chosen to make herself belligerent, there was no reason to complain if the Germans came and bombed them heavily.  That is the attitude we take up to Germany.</P>

So far as international usage goes, whatever we may choose to affirm, the separation of Northern Ireland from Ireland is internationally <Col N="2030" /> recognised, and, in pursuit of that recognition, the United States of America lands troops in Northern Ireland.  That is made the occasion for a vigorous and strident protest, not only through the usual diplomatic channels, but addressed to the Press and public by the Taoiseach.

      <P>On the contrary, the most cautiously worded diplomatic protests were presented through diplomatic channels.  When Parliamentary Questions were asked, the facts were vouchsafed only after considerable effort on the part of those who put down these questions to extract them from the Taoiseach.  That is certainly a fact, but the Taoiseach knows perfectly well that, on the occasion of American troops landing in Northern Ireland, manifestoes were issued.</P>

      <P>Whoever cares to listen I am going to talk so long as I have the right and the ability to talk. I want to make that clear and I want it made clear to the world where we stand.  Are our sympathies with the United Nations in this struggle or are they not?  Portugal, whose example is continually quoted in this House, stood neutral throughout four years of the war, but the moment a request was made to her by her own ally, Great Britain, who, remember, has not raised a finger for Portugal for 150 years, she placed her territory at the disposition of Great Britain to enable Great Britain to combat the U-boats operating from German bases.  She did not ask Germany's leave.  She said that she recognised that Great Britain was her old friend, and, when Great Britain was in danger, she had no hesitation in making clear where she was going to take her stand.  It may have been a bit late when she made up her mind to do it, but it will be remembered to Portugal, and when the time of post-war settlement comes, Portugal will be entitled to say: &ldquo;We were in no doubt, in times of danger, as to where our sympathies lay, and we were not afraid to tell the world <Col N="2032" /> and those who threatened us that we would act accordingly even if we were to be made pay for it, and told them to do their worst.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let us leave out Great Britain, on account of our old battles with her. Let us acknowledge that our people might be blinded by the deep sense of grievance under which they labour <i>vis-á-vis</i> Great Britain.  Is our relationship with the United States of America not as cordial, not as close, not as earnest as that of Portugal with Great Britain?  I have no hesitation in saying it is.  I am convinced that our people are as deeply sympathetic and as devoted to the welfare of the United States of America as Portugal is to that of Great Britain.  I have no hesitation in saying that they are far more so.  There has been talk of propaganda. Do Deputies realise that the picture being presented to the mass of the American people is that we are indifferent to them, that our position is that we do not care what becomes of them, that, as between Germany, and the United States of America, we stand evenly neutral?</P>
      <P>What I am trying to induce our Government and our people to do is, whatever means they adopt, to get it over to the American people, while the war is still on, that that is not the kind of neutrality in which we are engaged, that, although strategic reasons or material reasons make it unavoidable for us to stand neutral, our hearts are deeply with them, and if it were possible for us to help them, we should be glad to do so, because, remember, when the time of armistice comes, we cannot do that.  The moment the danger is passed, the moment we are free to say those things, without bringing any consequences upon ourselves, our lips are sealed.  We dare not attempt to say them then, because if we did, there would be enemies to be found who would say: &ldquo;When there was danger, you had not much to say&mdash;you were mighty neutral; but now that the war is over and we have won, you want to clamber on the band wagon.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Surely we must have friends?  Surely this country does not look forward to living in a world without friends of any kind, to cutting ourselves off absolutely and turning our backs on those who believed they were our friends?  Now, I can quite conceive the Taoiseach getting up and saying: &ldquo;We have leant backwards in order to avoid hurting feelings on either side. We have tried to steer an absolutely straight course between them, and to do nothing that could give offence to the most susceptible person in Great Britain or the United States of America.&rdquo;  But let us face facts.  Let us take our own personal experience. If we are engaged in a conflict, if we are in a tight corner, and a complete stranger looks at the state we are in and passes by, we may say: &ldquo;That fellow was not much good,&rdquo; but we have no particular grudge against him. Then, somebody whom we think is our neighbour and our friend, the best friend we have got, comes walking down the street and we immediately begin to think: &ldquo;Here he is coming, thanks be to God; we must redouble our efforts to hold out until our friend comes to our help.&rdquo;  But, to our consternation, we perceive that the friend walks by, expressing no opinion as to who should win the battle, but with exactly the same mien as the complete stranger.  Could that friend conceivably meet us on the morrow and say: &ldquo;You have no complaint against me. I took no side.  I did not intervene.  I did not indicate that I had any sympathy with your enemies?&rdquo; Surely we would reply: &ldquo;We expected more than that.  When we saw you coming, we thought our peril was over and that you would come to our aid.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may say that that is unreasonable, that it is asking too much. Is not human nature the same in Ireland as in America, and the same in America as in Ireland?  If, during the British oppression of this country, my father, the present Taoiseach, or the Leader of the Opposition had gone to America and had been met by the American people with the declaration: &ldquo;We are neutral.  We would not like <Col N="2034" /> to express a view one way or the other. Get on with the fight.  We will not help the British.  Of course, we need not tell you, at the same time, that we will not identify ourselves too closely with you,&rdquo; would we not bitterly resent it?  Do you remember the sick horror we experienced when President Harding announced that he would not take sides in the issues between the Irish and the English, in the course of his last presidential campaign?</P>
    <P>Do you remember how we thought that policy belied the true feelings of the people in America and how, despite that declaration, we did not hesitate to approach the people directly and found in the people tried friends whose intervention the Taoiseach well knows played no small part in securing the Treaty for our people and the independence and sovereignty that flowed therefrom?  I do not want to suggest to anyone that the Taoiseach is indifferent to that or that he denies that.  I do not want to suggest to anybody that the Taoiseach is pro-German or anti-American, or that he has any grudge against America.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach always gets impatient when anyone crosses him.  We should make allowance for that.  If you agree with the Taoiseach, everything is lovely in the garden.  If you disagree, he is convinced that you are <i>mala fide.</i>  I make allowance for that.  I can assure the Taoiseach and this House that my sole purpose in public life at the present time is to prevent the development of relations <Col N="2035" /> between us and the Americans on the one hand, and the Commonwealth of Nations on the other hand, which will prove disastrous for our people.  How can the Taoiseach be obsessed with the idea that I, who have stood in the public life of this country for closer relations with the Commonwealth of Nations and with America ever since I had a voice to speak, am now concerned to poison the relations between us?  How will that serve the cause I have consistently stood for?  I have been denounced by every member of the Taoiseach's Party as being pro-British. I have been denounced by every member of the Taoiseach's Party for preferring the interests of the United States of America to my own country's.</P>
      <P>How could that conceivably be consistent with a desire to poison the relations between my country and the United States?  One of the things that keeps me in public life at present is the desire to contribute in some measure to the joining of our people closer to the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong for the Taoiseach to try to persuade Deputies that there is only one view about the consequences of the policy he has pursued.  I suppose that in embarking on the policy he has pursued and in recommending it to the Irish people he did what he believed was best.  But I think the consequences of his policy will prove disastrous for our people.  The disaster that I foresee I shall describe clearly and explicitly.  The disaster I foresee is estrangement between our people and the American people and between our people and the people of Great Britain.  There is time yet to take some measure to soften the asperity of the feelings that may be growing in the several places.  There is nothing I will not do to help in softening that asperity.  We will not soften it by sticking our heads in the sand and saying that that asperity does not exist.  It does exist and it is growing, and the reason is that these people, rightly or wrongly&mdash;let us not canvass that now&mdash;expected that we would be enthusiastically sympathetic to them. They expected that the sympathy of <Col N="2036" /> our people would be unequivocal and whole-hearted.  But they were disappointed to discover that our national policy was one of indifferent neutrality.</P>
    <P>It is true that when America came into the war the Taoiseach said in O'Connell Street that our attitude during this war would be one of friendly neutrality.  Actions speak louder than words.  There is no use in saying that any policy is going to be one of friendly neutrality if, on the following morning, you pretend not to recognise the man to whom you said it, if you take good care to appear with the American Minister on your left arm and the German Minister on your right arm.  If you tell him that your attitude will be one of friendly neutrality, he will say: &ldquo;We have seen the neutrality, now let us see the friendliness.  Where is the friendliness? What is the difference between friendly neutrality and the other kind? So far as I can see, there has been none at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties of enforcing the policy of neutrality, but I ask Deputies to realise the dangers.  This is the kind of thing neutrality draws us into.  Recently, a film from America was submitted to our censor and the censor informed the American distributors that he could not allow pictures of American soldiers in action to be shown in this country.  That picture was put out.  Then a picture was submitted showing soldiers in training. He said that our neutrality forbade us to permit the display of that picture and that picture was put out. Then there was a &ldquo;March of Time&rdquo; film showing the training of chaplains of the Jewish, Protestant and Catholic communions before going to the war. That picture was put out on the ground that our neutrality demanded that it should be suppressed.  Then there was a picture submitted and, in the preliminary display of the list of characters and the name of the director and so forth, there was in one quarter of the background a picture of the Stars and Stripes with a picture of the President of the United States super-imposed on it, and because that appeared it was suppressed.  I can understand the attitude of the Taoiseach or the Minister for the Co-ordination <Col N="2037" /> of Defensive Measures.  He may say: &ldquo;I would not mind a bit showing that, but if it is shown an incident may occur.&rdquo; But look at it from the other side of the picture. The people of the United States of America are informed in due course that that has taken place here, that we have forbidden the reproduction on a cinema screen in Ireland of a picture of the Stars and Stripes and the President of the United States of America.  They are not going to stop to inquire into the reasons as to how and why that was done.  They feel that this is an outrage.  They ask themselves: Is it conceivably possible that the Stars and Stripes can no longer be seen in Eire?  Could we conceive a situation in which the Green, White and Orange of Eire would be prohibited in a parade on 5th Avenue?  They say to themselves: &ldquo;Could we ever imagine an occasion on which Winston Churchill could tell us to pull down the Irish flag if we chose to fly it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, we are not a big nation and we cannot defy people as readily as they can, but what I am trying to drive home to this House is that where you are dealing in foreign affairs you cannot expect to be dealing exclusively with people who are your bosom friends and who will interpret all your actions in the most favourable possible way to you.  You have to think of the consequences of your action being examined at their face value without any concessions being made to your special difficulties.  You have to ask yourself: &ldquo;What impression is it going to create in the United States of America, if it becomes publicised that the Stars and Stripes will not be allowed to fly in Eire?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know, and I suppose Deputies on all sides of this House know, that to 99.9 per cent. of the Irish people the sight of the Stars and Stripes flying anywhere is a welcome sight, a sight which they regard almost as gladly as the sight of our own flag flying.  We know the peculiar devious mind of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures; we know the peculiar devious mind of the Taoiseach, and when these astonishing ukases are made, we can wind our way through <Col N="2038" /> these labyrinths to the queer purpose for which they were originally thought up.  But people outside do not know them and what I apprehend is that at the end of this war we will find ourselves with no friends on the Continent of Europe, very few friends in Great Britain, very few friends or, to put it in another way, a great many enemies in the United States of America, and the rest of the Commonwealth saying: &ldquo;We are damned if we are going to allow Ireland to have the benefit of the Commonwealth association when she was not prepared to share its peril.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There are Deputies in this House who have worked harder to get rid of Partition, in silence and in secret, than those who are continually blathering about it in public ever did.  It is not to-day or yesterday that I have been trying to get rid of Partition, and it is not to-day or tomorrow that I or those associated with me will stop working for that end.  I am trying to warn our people against the consequences of the course of action they at present pursue.  I know it is not popular to be telling people that the course of action they are pursuing involves danger and grave consequences for our own people, but there is no use trying to avoid these dangers by denying their existence.  I want to bring home to the people of the United Kingdom, to the people of the Dominions of the Commonwealth and to the people of the United States of America that, whatever the appearances may be, our people are on their side; the bulk of our people are in sympathy with them; their welfare, their deliverance from danger, is the anxious solicitude of the Irish people and, though in this hour we may not be associated in what they regard as the common purpose of defending freedom and democracy in the world, in spirit we are with them and, in the post-war situation, would be desirous of co-operating with them and would be glad to help them in the tasks that lie ahead.  I warn Deputies that unless measures are taken to bring that home to these peoples, the present trend of their thought is away from us and we are in danger of creating enemies for ourselves whose enmity will be extremely inconvenient when we stand badly in need of friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation in inviting the Taoiseach, although he suggests that it may not be expedient to contemplate such matters now, to think for a moment of post-war affairs.  I believe in the sovereign independence of this State.  I, and all belonging to me, have been fighting for that for many a long day.  But I invite Deputies to consider this fact: This is a poor country, standing alone.  It has very limited resources, and I am suggesting to Deputies of this House that the <Col N="2040" /> very development of social services in the post-war world is going to constitute a serious menace to the independence of this country.  If we were situated in the mid-Atlantic, where the Azores are, we could carry on as an isolated unit without reference to circumstances in large rich countries in other parts of the world.  But we are not.  We are living within two hours' steam-boat travel and ten minutes' air-travel of the United Kingdom, which is one of the wealthiest countries in the world.  There is going to be an immensely high standard of social services in that country after the war.  There is going to be a rate of wages far higher than this country can afford if we stand in isolation and the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth belong to some association in which the United States of America and other democratic countries take part.  Suppose we stand in isolation, I foresee the serious danger that the superior standard of living which will be available in the United Kingdom will draw away most of our young people, who will go to England to earn their living and enjoy the better conditions they can get there than the wealth of this country will be in a position to offer them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I say to our people now that our concern, in order to secure and maintain the independence of Ireland, should be to collaborate with some combination of sovereign States which would enable us to partake in such a measure of prosperity as that combination of States can secure for itself.  I foresee that the United States of America and the British Commonwealth of Nations will enter into some such federation in the post-war world&mdash;&ldquo;federation&rdquo; may be too rigid a word &mdash;but some kind of association for the exchange of reciprocal advantages.  I implore Deputies of this House to awake to the necessity of securing for the Irish nation a position of equality with these other great associations of nations in that federation, whatever it may be, because I believe that if we fail to secure it, it will be virtually impossible to maintain the sovereign independence of this State.  Unless we can maintain the sovereign independence of this State, the generation <Col N="2041" /> to which we belong will become accursed in our history.  Without taking prudent foresight now, we will put that sovereign independence in desperate jeopardy.</P>
    <P>I believe that self-sufficiency means isolationism and the consequences I have outlined.  Therefore, I say that we have got to ask ourselves now, is it our intention post-war to collaborate in whatever association the United States of America and the British Commonwealth of Nations may combine in?  I agree that if there is no such collaboration, different problems may arise for us, but if there is such collaboration between these two great powers, are we going to share in it, and, if we are going to share in it, what steps do we propose to take to ensure that we will be afforded an opportunity of doing so?</P>
    <P>I make that request for and on behalf of the maintenance of sovereign independence in this country.  I have never made any disguise of the fact that I believed in the membership of the Commonwealth of Nations for this country, and I believe in it still.  If the Commonwealth of Nations had not existed, I would have tried to bring one into existence so that this country might have the advantage and protection resulting from association with a group of other sovereign and co-equal States.  I still believe that it is to the best advantage of Ireland, and of the ultimate unity of Ireland, that we should be members of the Commonwealth of Nations.  I foresaw at the time that the only alternative to refusing to being a co-operating member of the Commonwealth of Nations would be the ruin of this country. I foresaw that if we were not willing to co-operate with the United States of America or with the British Commonwealth of Nations, it might mean ruin for this country at the end of the war, and I asked the Government, in shaping their foreign policy, to try to appreciate what the consequences of their action might be.  I think that it is still not too late to remedy what has happened.</P>
    <P>As I say, there was a time when I held that it would have been good policy to abandon our attitude of neutrality, and that we should have thrown <Col N="2042" /> all our resources into the fight on behalf of the anti-Nazi forces, but I admit that if we were to abandon our policy of neutrality now, when it seems that the Axis forces are likely to be defeated, it would amount to trying to get on the band wagon after the battle was won.  When this war started, I quite admit that there was danger so far as this country was concerned, and that I wanted this country to prepare itself as against the Axis powers.</P>
    <P>My point was that, if Germany should declare war on us, even if we were neutral, we could have afforded the same accommodation which has been afforded by Portugal now.  At the time when I advocated that, a vast amount of peril was present so far as our country was concerned, but I certainly could not advocate such a policy now, when 90 per cent. of that peril has passed.  That being no longer available to us and, indeed, being now excluded from us, I appeal to Deputies to try to estimate, so far as they can, the consequences that may arise as a result of the policy of neutrality that we have pursued.  I urge on all Deputies in this House the necessity of bringing home to the United States of America and to Great Britain that whatever misunderstandings may have separated us in the last few years, since the war started, there is no use in denying the advantages that we have had as a result of our policy of neutrality&mdash; which, doubtlessly, were very good&mdash; and that we have got to seek now, for the protection and advantage of our own country, the friendship of peoples, such as those of the United States of America and of the British Commonwealth of Nations who may feel that, in their hour of danger, we betrayed them.  We may think that the attitude of these nations is unjust, but that is the attitude that will be taken by the world generally, so far as our policy of neutrality is concerned, and the attitude of the world generally is not so docile as that of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party where their Leader is concerned.</P>

      <P>No, I am not saying that, but I am urging on Deputies of this House the necessity of securing for our people the friendship of the United States of America and the British Commonwealth of Nations, if we hope to preserve our sovereign independence. I say that with regard to post-war conditions, in order to preserve the sovereign independence of this country, and to secure its ultimate unity, we shall have to secure the friendship of the United States of America and of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I am only trying to show the perils that beset us, and I am urging upon Dáil Eireann the necessity for recovering the friendship and goodwill we have lost, as a result of our attitude in this war, before it is too late.  I think that we still have time to remedy those mistakes, and, in that connection, I want to repudiate the suggestion that was made by the Taoiseach, to the effect that anything I have said here to-day has been said with the design of embittering the relations between our people and those of the United States of America. I do not think that the Taoiseach believes that himself.  In my opinion, it is just one of those cantankerous, vicious things that he says when he wants to score a point off an opponent.</P>

      <P>At any rate, I know what the Taoiseach's statement is calculated to convey to the public at large.  I do not care what the Taoiseach says about me to the people of this country.  I am quite prepared to stand before the people of this country, and to stand over any statements that I make either in this House or outside.  Long before the Taoiseach or the Fianna Fáil Party came into power in this country, my people were advocating the cause of our country, and advocating that the cause of this country would be better served by closer co-operation with the United States of America and the British people.  The best interests of this country, in my opinion, will not be <Col N="2044" /> served by statements which might give rise to bitterness and hatred as between ourselves and the United States of America or the British Commonwealth of Nations, but by close and cordial relations with the peoples of these countries, and I am quite prepared to put my name and reputation on record as saying that I believe that 90 per cent. of our people have nothing but feelings of the warmest friendship and regard for the people of the United States of America and of the British Commonwealth of Nations, whatever outside appearances may convey.  I say that the vast majority of our people, in their hearts, desire that the United States of America and the British Commonwealth of Nations should win this war and do not want to see them beaten by Germany.  I admit that everything I do or say in public life is designed to combine the interests of our country with those of the people of the United States of America and of the British people. I have always stood for that.  That has been my record, and I glory in that record.  I here and now proclaim, through this House, to the people of this country, that that is what I stand for and what I will always stand for so long as I can get a sufficient number of votes to enable me to represent my constituents in the Dáil.  I proclaim that I am pro-American, and I believe that at least 90 per cent. of our people are also pro-American and want to see them win in this war.  I think I could guarantee that at least 90 per cent. of our people want to see America win this war, and I also want to see Great Britain and the Commonwealth come out of this emergency safe, sound and unconquered, and Nazi Germany defeated.  If anyone wants to question me about my reasons for that attitude, I shall be glad to repeat the statement whether inside or outside this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what I stand for.  It is what I have always stood for, and I hope to God that the people of this country will come eventually to realise the aim which, I believe, the vast majority of our people wish to achieve, and that is, a lasting friendship between our people and those of the United States of America and the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Notwithstanding <Col N="2045" /> the policy of neutrality that we have pursued, and which to some extent has antagonised the peoples of these countries, I think that there is still time to remedy the position, and I think that the Dáil should now take steps towards the realisation of that end because, if steps are not taken immediately to remedy the situation, it seems to me that the independence and sovereignty of this nation will be imperilled when this war is over.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just delivered the mischievous and misleading speech to which we have listened claims that he is the only straightforward politician in this country and the only man, in his own opinion, who can properly interpret the views of the Irish people during this emergency period.  If I am not far wrong, I think that after he delivered a speech of the same kind in this House on a former occasion his friends, whether with or without his knowledge, saw to it that a full report of his speech on that occasion was circulated in America, for the purpose, no doubt, of misleading the people there with regard to the attitude of the majority of the members of this House and of the overwhelming majority of the people of this country. He claims to be the most straightforward politician in this country.  Incidentally, he describes me as the greatest &ldquo;wobbler&rdquo; in the Labour Party.  I do not mind the Deputy using such phrases about me, but I should like to call the attention of the House to certain facts, so far as Deputy Dillon is concerned.  At the commencement of the emergency in this country, an appeal was made by the Leader of the Government for the unity of our people on the question of neutrality.  That policy was expounded in College Green at one of the greatest meetings that was ever held in this country.  Deputy Dillon sat on the platform on that occasion and subscribed consciously, I am certain, to the policy of neutrality which he knew and then believed to be the policy of the Irish people.  Deputy Cosgrave, shortly after that, nominated Deputy Dillon as one of his representatives on the body now known as the Defence Conference. That body was set up for the <Col N="2046" /> sole purpose&mdash;and nobody was more conscious of its duties and responsibilities than Deputy Dillon&mdash;of implementing the policy of neutrality, to advise and help the Government as to how they could maintain the national policy of neutrality.</P>

I think that speech is bound to cause mischief and misunderstanding even amongst the Irish in America and it is regrettable that an educated and cultured man such as Deputy Dillon should deem it his public duty to get up and deliver such an oration.  He said on the one hand that he accepted the viewpoint of the Irish people on this question of neutrality and then he proceeded to try to prove that the majority of the Irish people are wrong in that attitude. I did not intend to intervene in this debate were it not that I cannot allow to pass unchallenged the statement that a certain Power deliberately planned to send planes over here to inflict death and destruction on the Irish people, and not alone that, but that they planned the invasion of this country.  The Deputy said that when all that was done the Government here made only a mild protest to the country concerned.  Have you no information as a Deputy of this House that not alone is that not a fact, that the Government not alone protested&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is that not a fact?  I think it is quite unfair for Deputy Dillon to allege that only a mild protest was made on that occasion.  I think it is a terrible thing for Deputy Dillon&mdash;of course I cannot express myself in the same eloquent and plausible language as he used&mdash;to insinuate, as he did in his speech, that although the Government expressed their sympathy with the victims of the Belfast blitz, in effect the Government said: &ldquo;It served you damn well right.&rdquo;  That is an entire misrepresentation of the attitude taken up by every Deputy and every Party in this House except Deputy Dillon.  His speech is bound to do terrible mischief at the present time and I protest as strongly as I <Col N="2048" /> can, although the Deputy may call me a &ldquo;wobbler&rdquo; against the anti-Irish speech which Deputy Dillon delivered in this House this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>A debate on foreign affairs invariably gives any irresponsible member of the House an opportunity of doing untold harm to this country's position abroad.  When we consider how desperately delicate is the international situation at the present time, the many dangers that confront our people as far as external affairs are concerned, we cannot but deplore the speech made by Deputy Dillon.  I suggested by way of intervention that it would be better if a debate on foreign affairs did not take place in public session of this House. At various critical junctures in their affairs, the Parliaments of other countries have private sessions for the purpose of dealing with matters, the reports of which, if published abroad, might do injury to these countries.  I am rather surprised that such a course of action was not adopted in regard to this debate.  Deputy Dillon has in the most vehement manner protested his friendship for the United Nations and his desire to promote goodwill between this country and these nations but does any one dare to think or suggest for one moment that the speech he has delivered to-night is going to promote good relations between this country and the United Nations?  Is it not deliberately intended to promote the worst possible relations between this country and America?  Is it not deliberately calculated, if you like, to exalt the personality of Deputy Dillon, to show that he is the one man in this country who is right and to denounce the people of the entire nation for the course of action which they have taken in this war?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 2nd September, 1939, we met here in this House and we unanimously decided that we were going to pursue a policy of neutrality.  We never regretted that course.  We believed in taking that action that we were adopting the course that was best designed to promote the interests of this country, and nothing that has happened since can change that view.  I believe that, if we take the longest <Col N="2049" /> possible view of the situation, we shall be convinced that the action which we have taken was a wise and prudent one.  We have escaped the worst consequences of physical involvement in this conflict.  We may have to suffer disadvantages after the emergency by reason of the course we have taken, but, in the long run, the independence, the separateness of this country, and the permanent security of this country as an independent nation, will be enhanced by the course of action which we decided to take when the emergency arose.  Deputy Dillon, I believe, has managed with his peculiar smartness to impale himself on the horns of a dilemma.  He has told us that he desires the destruction of Nazism, and he also desires the destruction of Communism. Yet he is prepared to plunge this country into war on behalf of one side as against the other.  If his attitude were hostility both to Communism and Nazism, would not the prudent course that would suggest itself to him be to abstain from intervention at all?  I believe it is foolishness for people to talk like Deputy Dillon about intervention.  This is a war of great and mighty Powers, and a little nation such as ours has no place in it.  We are only a baby Power, and the wise course for a baby Power is to act like a baby and like an innocent, and make no noise.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Government have considered the question of going on the air and stating our views.  I believe that we would make a very grave mistake in doing so at a time like this.  The people who are actually engaged in war have their nerves strained to the one task of prosecuting that war to a successful conclusion.  They do not want to hear on the air the viewpoints of neutral States and might resent even more our line of propaganda, no matter how well intended, and it might do more harm to our national interests than our complete silence would.  I believe that the only course to adopt is to endeavour to show our goodwill towards the peoples who are actually suffering.  There are people in every nation who are suffering intensely and, if we show them our real sympathy and are prepared to help them on any and every occasion the opportunity <Col N="2050" /> offers, we will be doing more to promote the welfare of this country than would any attempt at propaganda on the air.</P>

      <P>I would like to put one or two matters before the Taoiseach for his serious consideration.  I wish to impress on him the evil results that flow from the ignorant and stupid kind of censorship that exists at present in our country.  Even uninformed persons and persons with no newspaper or publicity training of any character would not make the blunders that are now having a serious effect on foreign opinion in regard to our own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the case of a Sunday newspaper circulating in this country, <Col N="2051" /> to which several publicists were invited to contribute articles regarding our neutrality.  I suppose that we take our neutrality for granted and that it is understood.  Arrangements had been made for the pros and cons to be published in the journal, but what was the result?  We had articles printed in favour of getting into the war and when the time came for a reply an article was almost printed when it was held up by the censor here.  Another article, alleged to have been written by a fairly well-known journalist in this country&mdash;who, I have good reason to know, did not write the article at all&mdash; was published.  In other words, the censor allows one side to be published and not the other.  I would like the Taoiseach to look into that matter and have it rectified.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that it is a common thing for newspapers to go to press at a certain hour, yet sometimes the censor stops material and then releases it half an hour after the paper has gone to press.</P>

      <P>I intervene in this debate only to record my dissent from the views expressed by Deputy Dillon, lest it might be thought, by silence in the House, that this Legislature would be giving approbation to the wild anti-Irish views he has expressed in the course of his speech this evening. Deputy Dillon ought to know, unless he is politically blind, that neutrality is the unanimous policy of the people of this country.  The many monster parades which have been held throughout the country, at which the policy of neutrality was affirmed and re-affirmed, ought to convince him that, so far as <Col N="2052" /> eudeavouring to involve us in the war is concerned, he is crying in the wilderness and has no moral authority whatever to speak for the overwhelming mass of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of the Defence Conference since it was first inaugurated. I disclose no secrets when I say that the three Parties represented on it&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour&mdash;have pursued a most cautious and most prudent policy of neutrality.  Every care was exercised by that Defence Conference, in tendering advice to the Government, to be scrupulously fair and honest and to be exactingly impartial in the pursuit of the policy of neutrality in this crisis. It is not unnatural, of course, that as the war progressed, and as the area of belligerency extended, and as new nations were thrown into the vortex of war, realising they have different interests from the interests they had when neutral, they should endeavour to involve us in war.  The strange part of the whole thing is that, with the exception of the countries originally involved in the war, most of the others became involved only when their liberties were invaded, when their towns and cities were over-run by armed forces.  They went into the maelstrom of war only when it was impossible to maintain their neutrality. We desire, like them, to maintain the neutrality which they once prized and highly valued, and, if the occasion should arise that our country is invaded, then&mdash;and only then&mdash;like these other countries, ought we to involve ourselves in war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, in view of Deputy Dillon's mischievous speech, that all Parties should avail of this opportunity to reaffirm our adherence to a policy of strict neutrality in the present world conflict.  Deputy Dillon ought to know by now that he does not speak for the Irish people.  He knows this nation is passing through a crisis such as never beset it before, and, if Deputy Dillon will not give the nation the benefit of his talents in advocating a policy of neutrality, then at least he ought to stay quiet and stop his deliberate efforts to sabotage the external policy of the country.  I have <Col N="2053" /> listened to speeches by Deputy Dillon on many occasions, here and elsewhere.  Such speeches can be designed only to misrepresent our point of view in America, Great Britain, Germany and other countries.</P>
    <P>A small country like ours wants friends, not enemies.  We will retain friends only to the extent that we act as friends with those who are undergoing the horrors and the pangs of war.  So far we have endeavoured, by our policy of neutrality, to maintain our friendships with all those countries with which we were at peace in 1939 and, whether this war be long or short, the obvious policy for the Irish nation to pursue is a policy of friendship with all and enmity with none.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand what purpose Deputy Dillon seeks to achieve by his vehement and malicious speeches, all designed, in a passionate and insane way, to involve us in a war in which no Irish interest would be served by our participation.  I can only imagine that Deputy Dillon does that to pander to friendships and policies which are neither Irish in conception nor Irish in operation.  Ireland did not cause this war; she was not consulted about the commencement of the war, nor about the issues upon which this war is being fought.  Ireland's interests do not lie in involvement in war.  We are a small, a relatively defenceless people, with no territorial aims, with no Imperial designs on other lands or other peoples, with no aspirations to commercial greatness or economic prowess calculated to injure any other country.  Our interests, after long years of bondage, lie in pursuing the paths of peace.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon ill serves this nation when, following its release after 700 years of bondage, he wants to involve us in a war not calculated to serve Irish interests, but to serve foreign friendships and foreign policies.  One would imagine that a gentleman with such heroic and martial views as Deputy Dillon would scarcely be content to waste himself in a country at peace.  But, while he is enjoying the benefits of neutrality, while he is missing the air-raid alarms, while he is not listening to the crashing bombs and thundering guns, Deputy Dillon <Col N="2054" /> parades himself here in all his martial glory and tells the people that this country ought to involve itself in war. Deputy Dillon is bursting to go to war; he is bursting to suffer the hardships and privations which the soldiers of various nations are suffering.  There is nothing to prevent the Deputy going to war; there was nothing to prevent him joining the armed forces of his friends at any time since 1939, but he prefers to be like the little boy who gets behind the half-door and puts out his tongue at the young friend with whom he has just had a quarrel. Deputy Dillon prefers to come here, in a country which enjoys peace and neutrality and the benefits flowing therefrom, to advise everybody else to send their sons or brothers or relatives out to fight battles from which Deputy Dillon is particularly careful to keep a long distance away.</P>
    <P>We are probably now at a fairly advanced stage in this war.  If we come through it we will do so only because of God's guidance and the prudence and caution of all Parties here.  Deputy Dillon's contribution to our escape from this holocaust is one which ought not to be forgotten by the Irish people.  They ought to realise that during the years of war, when we were engaged in endeavouring to preserve the hearths of our people from devastation, Deputy Dillon was the one man in this legislative Assembly who stood up and, while preferring comfort and smugness and complacency himself, was willing to endeavour to make this country a shambles and the homes of our people scenes of ruin and devastation&mdash;scenes characteristic of those countries which have been visited by Armageddon.</P>
    <P>I think this Vote will have served one useful purpose if, through the machinery of the House and the agency of the Press, we avail of this opportunity to reaffirm at the commencement of the fifth year of the war our determination to pursue a policy of neutrality, to emphasise that that determination is as green and vigorous as in the first days of the war, that so long as this awful conflict lasts, we desire to be the friends of all who are engaged in the war and that we hope, when the bells of peace ring <Col N="2055" /> again, we will be able to extend the hand of friendship to those suffering nations to whom for so many years we always extended the hand of friendship.</P>

      <P>In the interest of fair play, in the first place, and, in the second place, in order to demonstrate that this is a deliberative Assembly, where representatives of the people assemble not, as in a ballet, to sing the praises of any particular prima donna, but as representatives of the people charged with the responsibility of expressing their views, I protest most emphatically against the vicious attack that has been made on Deputy James Dillon. He stands alone in this House and he stands alone here because he expressed views which were not in conformity with the views held by any of the Parties in the House.  That is the position.  That is why he is alone. But, because he expresses those views, that is no justification for any Deputy, particularly the Leader of a Party, to represent his statement as a malicious statement, sabotaging the country, sabotaging the national interests of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people in this country who would bravely face machine-guns but are afraid to face facts.  That was first pointed out in this debate in the very eloquent address that we had from the inside of the Labour Party. The view expressed was that we are only poltroons if we do not face up to the fact that, in addition to war demanding a price, peace also demands a price; that neutrality also has its price, that we should begin to face up to the fact that there is a price to be paid for neutrality, and that that price need not necessarily be total estrangement from all the nations of the world and absolute isolation.  As far as I got the gist of Deputy Dillon's utterances, they were, in the main, in step with that utterance which came from the Labour Benches: that we have got to make our contacts, to endeavour to keep old friends; that in times of trouble friends are valuable, and that no person or no nation could have too many friends: that, whereas, <Col N="2056" /> we are a sovereign people this Parliament, as an absolutely free and independent Parliament, had a perfect right to decide on a policy of neutrality.</P>
    <P>That was what Deputy Dillon stated: that we could be neutral and still friendly with old friends; that we could be neutral and sympathise with old friends in adversity in the course of a very terrible war.  That is the spirit that was advocated to-night by Deputy Dillon: that in our hour of trial and tribulation, that in every struggle this country went through, whether it was war, famine or poverty, the voice of Ireland's leaders went out to the United States of America, that the big-hearted Irish in America never turned the deaf ear, but always came to our aid; that there should not be a rift in the old-time friendships between the little motherland and the great land populated to a great extent by her sons, and that we should begin to explain, as best we could, through all the channels available to our friends out there and our friends elsewhere, that neutrality did not mean that we were not in sympathy with them in their struggle.</P>
    <P>Those were the views expressed by Deputy Dillon, Irish views and patriotic views expressed by a man who, by virtue of his own standing and ability, and of the grand traditions that are behind his name, is as much entitled&mdash;and more so&mdash;to express his views as most of us in this Assembly.</P>
    <P>I think it is unfortunate that, without any previous notice, a debate of this kind should have been turned into a wrangle for or against neutrality.  I think I am echoing what is in the minds of Deputies in many Parties when I say that if any Deputy stood up here as a public representative to voice the opinions he holds, he would be beneath contempt if he failed to do so.  The fact that his views might not coincide with the views of the vast majority either here or outside is no justification for referring to him as a malicious saboteur.  That was never his stand in Irish public life.  Let us be in agreement or disagreement with him.  His public attitude was always dictated by a conscience palpitating in the best interests of this country.  We <Col N="2057" /> cannot, as Deputy Larkin said, gloss round an awkward corner: that there is a short-term policy and a long-term policy, and that taking the long-term view of the policy of neutrality we will only come up against the awkward reactions at the time when the price will have to be paid.</P>
    <P>It should be the interest of all Parties to see that it is not the very biggest but the very smallest price: that through every possible contact we have we will want to let the world know that our policy was directed by our smallness, our weakness and our poverty, by our isolated position and our military helplessness: that when in the interests of our own country we declared for a policy of neutrality it did not mean that we were careless of the sufferings and the sacrifices of our kith and kin, that it did not mean that we had not views of our own as to what was at stake in this mighty contest and gigantic war, and did not mean that we did not sympathise with the side that was in line with the national stand, aspirations and friendly contacts that go right back through the centuries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin made a statement which I would like to correct, at least from my conception of our joint responsibilities.  He said, in the course of his remarks, that the Defence Conference was brought into being for the purpose of supporting and administering the policy of neutrality.  According to my conception, the Party originally responsible for the body that is now known as the Defence Conference was this Party here.  It will not be contested, I think, that questions of policy were completely ruled out at the Defence Conference.  They were not in order at it, and quite properly so. The Defence Conference was instituted for the purpose of getting the joint influence of all Parties in this House, so as to get together the very maximum of strength to defend this country and support whatever policy was decided on by this Parliament, whether it was neutrality or war.  The Defence Conference could not presume to lay down or to dictate policy.  Neither could it say what the policy of this Assembly should be from month to month or year to year, so that quite properly <Col N="2058" /> all questions of policy were ruled out from the duties and responsibilities of the Defence Conference.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin may have a different conception from what I had of what the functions of that body were.  I must say that my function as a Deputy inside or outside the Defence Conference was to urge on this Parliament whatever course appeared to be in the national interest from time to time.  I may be wrong or I may even have got an incorrect impression of what was contained in the Deputy's remarks. Before I spoke I told Deputy Davin that I would have to correct the statement from my point of view.</P>
    <P>I got up in the first place, as one Deputy, to protest against the attack made on an Independent Deputy, because he expressed his views.  I want to put it to the Taoiseach, to all Parties, and to every Independent Deputy that if we do not regard this Parliament as a deliberative Assembly. where elected representatives can come together to express their views, and if we condemn a Deputy for expressing views merely because we disagree with them, then we are the people who are engaged in national sabotage, because nothing could do more damage to a State.  One of the greatest institutions in this or any other State is the Parliament of the people.  Those who went before us, away back through the pages of history, struggled and bled that some day, if not in their time, then in our time, this little country would have a Parliament of its own where elected representatives of the Irish people would assemble and voice their views, no matter who agreed or disagreed.  If the day ever dawns when a majority here, even an overwhelming majority, attempts to gag any individual Deputy who for expressing his own views is denounced as a malicious saboteur then the malicious sabotage will be the responsibility of that majority and not of the individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with very great reluctance I intervene in the discussion, having on a former occasion expressed, perhaps rather severely, my views upon the policy of the country, which is still the accepted policy&mdash; neutrality.  A decision was taken in a <Col N="2059" /> solemn hour.  It appeared to us at that time to be a policy which would get almost general support.  We have had, in our long history, perhaps sufficient examples of our national integrity being weakened and torn asunder by dissension and discrepancies in the hour of peril.  During the past four years the Government has certainly no cause of complaint with the manner in which it was treated in the difficult times through which we have passed. It is not because of the Government itself that they got such treatment.  It was because of a patriotic conception on the part of the different political units in the State that they got it.  It may be that popular opinion was strained to take up the attitude it did take up on neutrality at the time, by reason of the division between North and South, and the fact that, while that was there, no other policy could possibly get, practically, the unanimous support that would be required to have it passed as public policy.  It may be, perhaps, wise that we should focus attention upon that, not for the purpose of antagonising opinion inside or outside this country, but merely to state the self-evident fact that, while that boundary line remains, it is a political impossibility to approach the consideration of international affairs with an unbiassed mind.  It is regrettable that that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the pains of my life is that people and political Parties here find difficulty in approaching any problem, whether national or international, without being obsessed with what is called the past history of this country. What is important for us is present history and the future.  That is our responsibility. The past is gone and done with.  It is our problem to shape the present, and to map out a broader future for our country than the pages of history disclose.  I regret I did not hear the whole of the case that was put by a member of the House.  The parts I heard were put in this form, a criticism of the Minister which, I presume, members of the House are still entitled to indulge in, and then the really important point which was explained much more clearly than I could do it, by Deputy O'Higgins.  We have <Col N="2060" /> to consider what is going to happen when this whole business, this war fever, has left the world, and we have to settle down.  If we want friends, it is not unreasonable for a member of this House to get a fair hearing.</P>
    <P>The three speeches I heard following that of Deputy Dillon appeared to me to be almost hysterical.  Deputy Dillon may have imparted a certain amount of passion into his speech.  As far as I could gather, he wanted to have better relations with our friends across the water, if we can call them such, and with those who have been friends of ours for centuries, the Americans.  It may have been unwise to criticise one or two of the belligerents.  There is a great disparity in years between Deputy Dillon and myself.  Perhaps I would not display the same indifference to international affairs or be as candid as he was.  But there is no earthly reason why we should not listen in silence to his speech.</P>
    <P>We took a decision on neutrality upon a solemn occasion.  It was an occasion upon which two great Powers thought it was their duty to intervene on behalf of one of the great Powers of Europe which had been attacked. The slogan at the time, if my recollection is correct, was a declaration of war against aggression.  The British people and the British Commonwealth of Nations, apart from ourselves, entered into that war for the purpose of preventing aggression.  I am speaking without criticising anybody, but merely stating a fact when I say that from the day that war commenced down to this present hour, no other country entered into the conflict, except when attacked, so that any country which came into the war after that period came in to defend itself. We have very many more contacts with one of the two sides in this war than we have with the other, and it is not without significance that there are perhaps, on one side, at the present moment something like 200,000 of our people, almost 20 divisions.  When we consider America&mdash;speaking only for myself&mdash;I can say that I have more blood relations in the American Army than I have relations of both sexes and all ages in this country.  We could not <Col N="2061" /> be indifferent in circumstances of that sort.</P>
    <P>So far as my observations here on a previous day are concerned, if there was any lack of interest shown in the conflict, I should like to correct it, to that extent, at any rate&mdash;that we are not indifferent by any means to our friends, and, so far as I know, have no enmity towards those on the other side.  Surely a point of view such as that can be put in this House.  It is not unreasonable.  It is one of the things which appear to me to be open for the consideration of those who will take part in any peace arrangements when the war comes to an end.  Under no conceivable set of circumstances, does it appear to me that we could have entered into this conflict.  I think the concluding portions of Deputy Dillon's speech made that perfectly clear, so far as the events of the last few months are concerned.  He made no case whatever for entering into the conflict.</P>
    <P>Why is it that people, in discussing a matter in the calm atmosphere of this House, cannot at least pay attention to what a Deputy said?  It may be that I paid more attention to that particular part of his speech than to any other, but that that statement was made there is no doubt, and that it was a statesmanlike statement, I must admit.  He saw no case whatever for our going into this war now, and we are told by certain people that he wanted to sabotage the State and precipitate us into the war.  In my view, it would be much better, until this Parliament grows up, until these two Parties disappear out of public life, if international affairs were not discussed here, and, in the interests of the advancement of this country, the sooner that happens, the better.  If we have matters to discuss here, the main consideration is the advancement of the country and not the interests of political parties.  So far as the events of the last four years are concerned, the Ministerial Bench opposite, the Government, has no cause for complaint regarding any action taken or any statement made from this side. We are all of us in duty bound to seek the best interests of our own country. In my view, for what it is worth, the <Col N="2062" /> interests of this country depend more on the work we are going to put into the building up of our country, both now and after the war, than on any friendship we shall get from any country in any part of the world or the combined friendship of the whole lot of them.  The sooner we realise that the better&mdash;that we have to depend upon ourselves, on our own work and on what we are capable of doing, and that while we wish to live at peace with everybody, we are no greater than any other people.  Many of them have far greater achievements to their credit than we have; many of them who have had as short, or almost as short, a period, did better work during their time than we have done.  We have to remedy that.  That is our problem for the future, and perhaps if we bent our energies towards trying to achieve it and thought less of politics, it might be in the best interests of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been quite a considerable volume of opinion expressed here on the question of neutrality, and I think that, despite Deputy Dillon's assurances as to his attitude and his desires in this matter, this country will maintain its present policy of neutrality; but, it may be as well, particularly in view of Deputy Dillon's opinions, to re-examine the question of neutrality and the basis of this policy.  As a new member, it may be a little difficult to criticise one of the veterans of the House, but it appeared to me, and I am sure to others, that despite the boisterousness of Deputy Dillon, there was a lack of policy.  There were self-contradictions in his statements, and, even if he were, as he boasted he is, a friend of the United Nations, his attitude in the House would certainly ill serve their cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the one hand, Deputy Dillon saw fit to condemn very vigorously, and in fact to damn, not only the Soviet Union, but all nations which were contaminated by contact with it, to use his own words, and, on the other, he prayed for the success of the United Nations, every one of which is contaminated by the same contact with the Soviet Union.  Here, then, is a self-contradiction.  That is no policy for a State such as Ireland, and little <Col N="2063" /> heed, therefore, can be given to the views expressed by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon thinks that it is too late to get on to the band wagon and therefore he does not now suggest that there should be active participation by this State in the hostilities that are going on in the world.  But he did state that, when it was not too late, when there was danger to be faced, and when there were calamities to be endured, it was his policy then to advocate that this country should take steps in alliance with these nations. His main concern appeared to be that we would stand well in the eyes of the American public.  He stated that his policy was: &ldquo;Our hearts beat for you and we are only neutral because we are obliged to do so.&rdquo;  If that is an attitude which he thinks will impress the American public, he little knows that public or he is very much deceived.  I think it was old Abe Lincoln who first made use in politics of the good old slogan that honesty is the best policy.  That is not an honest policy, that is not the reason why we are neutral, that is not a policy which would impress any State or any people in any great nation.  Deputy Dillon, I think, will be discovered finally to be the one who is doing the least service to the American cause as well as to the Irish cause, because it appears to me that he understands little about either the American viewpoint on the present conflict, in so far as it relates to Ireland, and less does he understand the Irish viewpoint on this question, no matter how long his family have been established in this country.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason I think that we should re-examine the question of neutrality.  We should have it clarified in terms that will make it clearly understood, not only in our own country but abroad, where this understanding will be of value when the war is over.  We know, we have experience even in this House, that there is a section in this country which is opposed to neutrality.  There is another section, on the other hand, who glorify neutrality and swing to the other extreme of the pendulum and make neutrality into a fundamental principle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2064" /> It is not a fundamental principle of Irish politics that neutrality is something that must be glorified and must stand above everything else.  To give expression to these views, either one or the other, or even to intermediate ones&mdash;and there are many views on neutrality&mdash;might connote in some minds that the person giving such expression to them stands for these views.  But all I want to do here is merely to pose the question, to show what views are in existence, and to ask consideration of them so that we may, in our own minds as well as in the minds of our friends, clarify this whole issue.</P>
    <P>It might be as well in fact, particularly as we have had such announcements from Deputy Dillon as to his personal politics, that I shall preface my remarks by saying that I am not pro-German and I am not pro-British. I am still a believer in the sentiments which were so well expressed in the poster displayed by my father over Liberty Hall.  I still believe that the correct sentiments for an Irishman are to proclaim that he is pro-Irish and that his first interests are his own country and the well-being of the people of that country.  That is the only fundamental principle, and it is only with a recognition of that fundamental principle that we can understand this question of neutrality.  It is only because we do understand that fundamental principle that the Labour Party is in favour of neutrality and for no other reason.</P>
    <P>The fundamental principle for this country is to obtain the independence of the whole country, to extend the independence that we have, to obtain sovereignty over the whole of this country.  Until that is done, until that is completed, there is no possibility that any reasonable man can see of any other attitude on the part of this country but neutrality.  That is why I said that neutrality is not a fundamental principle.  It is a policy that has arisen out of the present set of circumstances.  Given an independent country and a set of circumstances different from the present circumstances, there is no reason to imagine that an Irish Government could not quite correctly depart from any question of neutrality.  They would certainly, <Col N="2065" /> with every mark of correctitude, take up a policy different from neutrality.  But we are not neutral because we are in dread of aerial bombardment or because we fear the terrors of an invasion or any such reason as that.</P>
    <P>We can point to the fact, as has often been stated, that 100,000 of our people have engaged in the war industries of Great Britain; not to make political capital out of it, but just as a statement of fact that shows quite definitely and distinctly that the Irish people, even though we may not wish them to do so, even though we deplore and regret that they do so, are not afraid of the terrors of war.  I think, too, just as a mere statement of fact&mdash; not to boast of it, but rather, perhaps, to decry it&mdash;that we could show that there is a greater percentage of Irishmen from the South of Ireland enrolled in the army of Britain, one of the belligerent Powers, than from the loyal North of this country.  That shows that Irishmen have not yet lost their militancy, that they are not afraid to engage in war.  It is merely a statement of fact.  It is a statement made just to bring back to our minds the fact that cowardice is no ingredient of neutrality&mdash;an allegation often levelled at the Irish, particularly at the present time, which, I think, is well worth refuting.</P>
    <P>On this point I would certainly in every way second the remarks of Deputy Larkin in reference to the question of propaganda; propaganda by every possible means, propaganda for a proper understanding of the question of neutrality in foreign countries, particularly in Great Britain.  Not that we want to curry favour with any of them.  We want friends, undoubtedly; everyone wants friends, every nation wants friends. The basis of friendship is understanding, and most of the anti-Irish propaganda, most of the anti-Irish feeling and lack of sympathy with us, particularly in Great Britain, is due very largely to a lack of understanding.  We require patience and perseverance to remove this, and the only way it can be removed is by an honest delineation and explanation of the whole question of neutrality, and not by any dishonest <Col N="2066" /> subterfuge such as has been suggested by Deputy Dillon as a means, perhaps, of obtaining for us friends and sympathy in America.  I think that in America amongst the Irish and amongst the Irish-Americans, particularly in the political Parties and labour unions, there are quite powerful people and personalities who understand more clearly the reasons for Irish neutrality than does Deputy Dillon, and who support the Irish attitude on neutrality for the very good grounds on which it is supported by reasonable people in every country &mdash;and for no other reason.</P>
    <P>We have heard about Portugal, and we have been told that, after four years, Portuguese neutrality was suddenly modified, and, as a result of representations made by Great Britain, that Portugal gave Great Britain access to some islands in the Azores to protect her Atlantic fleet.  Deputy Dillon, in making this statement, did not stress the fact that it took Portugal four years to remember that clause in the treaty which was 150 years old, and to come to the assistance of its old friend.  It never, perhaps, struck him, in arguing from that, that he wished Ireland to take up a similar type of neutrality, that by no conceivable amount of imagination could he designate Ireland as Great Britain's old friend.  This was, I think, one of the main weaknesses in that portion of Deputy Dillon's argument.  Realising, as he did, that there were serious differences, historical, traditional and otherwise, between these countries, on the basis of his own argument, on the basis of the facts as they were outlined, there could be no analogy whatsoever between the question of our attitude to neutrality and our type of neutrality and the Portuguese type of neutrality.</P>
    <P>Of course, this war has shown that neutrality is a very flexible term. There are different types of neutrality. There is the Portuguese type which we have mentioned.  There is the Swedish type, which bowed before what was considered the invincible might of an empire, and gave passage through that country where that invincibility was considered to be a fact, but when that invincibility declined, the Swedes took <Col N="2067" /> care to modify once more their neutrality, and refused to accede to the continuation of that facility for that power.</P>
    <P>The Irish, probably, have their own type of neutrality.  It has been considered here to-day, and it has been termed &ldquo;indifferent&rdquo; neutrality and &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; neutrality.  A famous Irish writer in London alleged that when this question of neutrality was being discussed in this House, one of the members asked the question, in what he said was the real Irish fashion: &ldquo;Against whom are we to be neutral?&rdquo; That, of course, may be considered jocose by the writer, but, as things are at the present time in the world, considering the importance and the preponderance of the big Powers and the ruthlessness of the machinery which they put into force, and the little regard there is for small nations, their attitude, their culture and everything else, it certainly has some point.  It has some question of policy involved in it, to consider against whom you might be neutral.</P>
    <P>I think that, despite the criticism there has been of neutrality, there has not been shown any alternative.  We need to understand how best to utilise this policy of neutrality, not by getting on the band wagon, not by in any way falsifying the question of neutrality, but by utilising whatever forces we have, in this country or elsewhere, to soften any rigours which, in the minds of some people, may threaten us in a post-war period.  For myself, and I think many others agree, I think the enemies that we have, if we have any&mdash;which is doubtful&mdash;will have so many problems of their own to face that they may not have time to indulge in animosity and to take the economic measures which were suggested against us.</P>
    <P>I think, as far as can be gauged, the Department of External Affairs has, in many respects, done fairly noteworthy work in getting in many places sympathy for the Irish cause, for the Irish State and for the Irish attitude, that did not exist before.  I think it is barely due to the Department of External Affairs to say so.  I think that as a result of the attitude which they <Col N="2068" /> have adopted, the careful attitude of explaining this whole question of neutrality, very few really responsible correspondents of papers, even from Great Britain, have left this country without a better view of Ireland and a better understanding of Ireland than they had when they came to it.  That, I think, will certainly stand to our credit in the very serious times that are to come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier in to-day's proceedings I had occasion to address a question to the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, in which I asked him if he would state whether the publication of the <i>Annual,</i> 1944, which is published by Brian O'Higgins, has been prohibited by the Controller of Censorship; if so, if he would state the grounds on which such decision was made, and whether he is now prepared to permit the publication of the Annual, which has appeared regularly since 1932, and consists in the main of quotations from, and historical records of, leaders of Irish nationalism.  To that question I received a reply from the Minister, which was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question, is, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the second part, it is not proposed to release the Annual for publication as it contravenes the Emergency Powers Order, 1939.  It contains much more than quotations from historical records; it attempts to destroy the unity which Tone sought to establish and to justify the use of violence against the State <Col N="2069" /> established by the Irish people under the Constitution freely enacted by them and freely changeable at their will; it does this at a time when it was never more necessary for Irishmen not to dissipate their energy in internecine strife but to stand shoulder to shoulder in disciplined comradeship in order to defend the national territory which has been liberated and to hold it as an earnest of the re-union of all our territory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a Supplementary Question I asked the Minister to indicate to what portion of the publication objection was taken, so that the author would have an opportunity of amending it, if he wished to do so, and the Minister indicated that he was not prepared to do that.  I want to submit to this House that, as regards this particular case, we have probably the most gross abuse of the powers of censorship which were given by this House to, and exercised by, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  I say that on the following grounds: First of all, those powers were given, specifically, for the protection of this State against external enemies, and I want to submit that in this case there is not one single item in the whole of this publication which the Minister could publicly indicate to be a danger to the State, so far as any of the particular issues in which we are involved at the moment are concerned.  The reason we are not prepared to give him authority to use these powers&mdash;namely, the powers and duties of censorship&mdash;is that the Minister is not in a position to show the House where censorship can be properly applied, and has to fall back on powers of suppression.</P>
    <P>When this matter was brought to the attention of the author, he wrote, quite properly, to the Controller of Censorship and asked to be informed what portions of the publication were objected to, but the Minister had not the courtesy to reply.  However, he sent a letter, through his secretary, which I will read.  It is very brief, and is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have your letter of the 22nd instant, asking why the <i>Wolfe Tone Annual</i> was stopped by the Censor, <Col N="2070" /> and I am directed by the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures to reply as follows:</P>
    <P>Briefly, it was stopped because it seeks during the present emergency to promote among Irishmen that spirit of factionalism and violence, one against the other, which Tone sought to abolish but which it was ever the aim of the enemies of the Irish people to foster by every means and device.</P>
    <P>This spirit, engendered by foreigners, played havoc with the interests of the Irish people even before Sir George Carew wrote:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;And also it was thought no ill policy to make the Irish draw blood one upon another whereby their private quarrels might advance the public service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that when we make a comparison between a statement made by Sir George Carew and the publication of this Annual by Brian O'Higgins, we have reached the height of absurdity, however we may disagree with Mr. O'Higgins.  I challenge the Minister to go through the Annual and indicate to this House what part of that publication has caused or is likely to cause, in his own words, disunion among our people here.  The annual is devoted mainly, and I might say particularly, to the things that the Taoiseach himself has been advocating during the last few weeks, such as the furtherance of the Irish language and our native culture.  I am not one who agrees with Brian O'Higgins, but I do challenge any member of the Fianna Fáil Party to come in and say here that he can justify the action of the Minister in this connection, because, if he does so, he is repudiating the whole basis on which that Party is supposed to be built, namely, that the Government and members of the Fianna Fáil Party are men who are devoted to the principle of Irish nationality, to the principle that we should have a united and independent country, and also devoted to the interests of the Irish people, which includes the furtherance of the Irish language and Irish history.</P>
    <P>Those historical records are quite correct and, possibly, they might hurt the feelings of some of the people here, but I suggest that in our Constitution <Col N="2071" /> we are guaranteed at least the right to express our opinions, particularly when, in the expression of such opinions, there is no reference to any member of the Government or to the Constitution, and I submit that if it were possible to set up any machinery by which this matter could be examined&mdash;not by Deputies on these benches, but by members on the opposite bench&mdash;it should be availed of so that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party would realise the extent to which the powers of censorship are being abused.  Furthermore, if this incident is to be allowed to pass unchallenged &mdash;the incident of the suppression of this one publication&mdash;it is not very difficult to foresee that that kind of thing will be extended and applied to many other forms of activity in this country.</P>
    <P>It is useless for the Minister to say that he can stand on the record of the Censorship Office during the past four years.  I suggest that the action he has taken in this matter reflects on the whole activity of the Office of Censorship here and the manner in which the Minister is exercising his powers, and I leave it to the members of this House, especially members of the Fianna Fáil Party, and particularly those who wear the Fáinne, to determine whether what I say is correct or not.</P>

      <P>The innocence of Deputy Larkin amazes me.  I do not believe that anybody could be as innocent as Deputy Larkin pretends to be.  I recognise that he is one of the cleverest young men that has come into this House for a long time.  He has persuaded the Labour Party to take him to their bosoms, and now he wants to round up the remnants of a very dangerous movement throughout the country, and to use one rather futile old man as a shield so that he can break down the defences which this democratic State has thought it wise to erect in order to protect itself, during the present crisis, not only against potential foreign enemies, but against potential domestic enemies.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2072" /> Cold-blooded revolutionaries in various countries have utilised the claptrap of demagogy in order to break down the defences of democracy and Deputy Larkin is not so innocent as not to know that the whole tenor of the Annual, the publication of which was prohibited, was to the effect that no Government had a right to exist here against the wishes of one or two individuals who wanted to use force to overthrow it.  I do not know why he wants that principle established.  I do not think he wants to established it for the sake of the particular individual whom he claims to represent and speak for here to-night.</P>
    <P>I have as much respect for the past heroes of this country as Deputy Larkin, and if the young men of this country would read the past history of the leaders of the Irish people, those who suffered martyrdom for the Irish cause, I should be delighted.  But I would like to see the young men studying Wolfe Tone at first hand and studying the other disciples or leaders of Irish nationalism who are being quoted by the author in question, quoted in order to destroy the work which the people of this generation have done to bring to fruition the cause for which these men lived and worked, and for which some of them died.  I do not propose as long as I have charge of censorship to facilitate people of the type of the author in question, or to facilitate those who would support him in inciting the young men of this country or leading them to believe that they have a right to overthrow the Constitution which the Irish people freely enacted for themselves and which they can change at any time they like, of their own free will.  I cannot subscribe to the principle that the young men of this country have a right in these circumstances to use violence to overthrow that Constitution.  If Deputy Larkin wants to establish that principle let him stand openly for it instead of utilising a rather futile old gentleman as a shield in order to promote his propaganda behind it.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 16th November, 1943.</P>
