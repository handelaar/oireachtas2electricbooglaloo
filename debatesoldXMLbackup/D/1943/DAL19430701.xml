      <P>Ba mhaith liom an tairisgint seo do chur os cóir na Dála:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Go dtoghfar an Teachta Proinnsias O Fathaigh chun bheith ina Cheann Comhairle agus go rachaidh sé i gceannas na Dála anois.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Toghadh Proinnsias O Fathaigh mar Cheann Comhairle ceithre huaire cheana agus, o 1933 i leith, níor chuir aoinne in aghaidh an mholta.  Taisbeánann sé sin go raibh gach dream <Col N="15" /> agus gach duine sa Tigh sásta leis an gcaoi do rinne sé a chuid oibre mar Cheann Comhairle.  Do dhuine ar bith atá ina Cheann Comhairle, no do dhuine ar a bhfuil de chúram díospóireachtaí Dáil Eireann do stiúradh, is riachtanach tréithe fé leith do bheith aige.  An chaoi in ar dhein an Teachta O Fathaigh a chuid oibre is comhartha é go bhfuil na tréithe sin aige thar an gcoitcheantacht.  Má toghtar é, táim cinnte go ndéanfa sé an obair chó maith san am atá le teacht agus a rinne sé san am atá thart.  Tá súil agam go dtoghfar é&mdash; agus go dtoghfar é d'aon-ghuth.</P>
    <P>I propose that Deputy Proinnsias O Fathaigh be elected once more as Ceann Comhairle.  The manner in which he performed his duties during the period of 11 years that he has held the position is the best assurance we can have that he will give satisfaction to everybody in the time before us. He has done so, I believe, in the past. His name has not been opposed for this office since 1933.  I have great pleasure in proposing that he be elected as Ceann Comhairle and that he take the Chair.</P>

      <P>It is acceptable in the Independent Benches that, at least, I should be permitted to associate myself with the words of the Taoiseach in commending Proinnsias O Fathaigh as Ceann Comhairle to the House.  Those Deputies of this House who are supported by large Parties feel a certain sense of security that those who stand as Independents may not feel.  I should like, from the Independent.  Benches, to avail myself of this occasion to express, as an Independent Deputy, my deep appreciation of the impartiality and generosity with which Proinnsias O Fathaigh has discharged the onerous duty of Ceann Comhairle during his term of office.  All of us, or at least the spirited ones amongst us, have at times brushes with the Chair.  It is ordinary to expect that such things might be remembered, but in the case <Col N="16" /> of Proinnsias O Fathaigh, who has occupied that Chair with such distinction over 11 years, I, at least, am glad to bear testimony of the fact that nobody could have had his rights more fully or, I suggest, more carefully protected than I have, and I am convinced that in the future as in the past, the humblest Deputy of this House will have in Proinnsias O Fathaigh, if he is elected, his stoutest champion and defender against any attempt to deny him the rights inherent in membership of this House.</P>

    <P>It is a great honour to be elected Ceann Comhairle and I feel deeply grateful for having been re-elected to that position.  I am thankful to my fellow-Deputies.  I feel assured that I shall have in the future as in the past the help and co-operation of the <Col N="17" /> House in the discharge of my duties, without which co-operation my task would be an impossible one.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brian Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my great privilege, as an Ulster Deputy, to second the motion proposed by Donnchadh O Briain, that Eamon de Valera be elected Taoiseach.  There are many reasons that I could give in support of this motion.  He is the Leader of by far the largest Party in this House and the trust of the people in him is obvious.  He has filled the high office for the last 11 years, recognised not here only but throughout the world as the national leader; and he has filled it with distinction to himself, with honour to the nation and with benefit to all our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are critical days, and years, ahead for this country.  It is and will continue to be a time when prudent leadership and wise statesmanship are essential if the destinies of our people <Col N="18" /> are to be safely guided.  What more fitting choice can we make to-day then than that of the man who has so successfully led the country during the past four years&mdash;perhaps the most dangerous and difficult this nation has seen in our lifetime, or that of our fathers.  By his courage and his strength, by his tolerance and his wisdom, he has earned the respect and confidence not of a particular Party only, but of the Irish race, and nothing is more certain than that in the future, as in the past, he will uphold with dignity and without compromise the sovereign and indefeasible rights of our nation and will bring to the greatest of our unsettled problems that devotion which has been the mark of his whole public life.  I ask this House to pass this motion unanimously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my duty to put certain views to this House this evening, but, in particular, to nominate William T. Cosgrave as a fit and proper person to lead this country of ours through the stormy days that are before us, those stormy days which have been referred to by Deputy Donnchadh O Briain and Deputy Brady. I want to remind the House, through you, that we have had an election in which, if there was any decision given, it was a decision against Party Government in the future.  I had some thoughts myself that the day had arrived when the wounds of the past could be eliminated.  I am not yet unhopeful, and I think that the name of William T. Cosgrave would give more hope in doing that than any other name now before the House.  I, indeed, have no quarrel with the nomination made because I agree that the people, wisely or unwisely, have given him a vote in the largest Party, but I must be mindful of the future.  In my own constituency, I saw the people vote up and down and across for the various Parties and I interpret that as being a vote for a national Government in this country, notwithstanding the fact that although this Party may have advocated it, the people did not give it just the absolute approval I would desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people have given a decision, <Col N="19" /> and it is a decision against Party Government. I should like to know from the Taoiseach at the moment&mdash;he was the Taoiseach of the last Dáil and he remains Taoiseach until his successor is appointed&mdash;if he be re-elected what his plans will be.  He has been elected, no doubt, as leader of the largest Party to carry on the policy to which he had given effect for the previous four or five years.  When one comes to examine that policy one must put oneself this question: What is it?  It is a policy of hardships upon all sections of the community.  It is a policy that has sent our boys and girls to Northern Ireland and to Great Britain to seek employment.  It is a policy that has imposed hardship upon the farmer, his wife, his son, his daughter and his worker with no ample compensation for their labour.  It is a policy of staying at home, of not doing anything, of not making contacts with foreign governments. There is no quarrel, indeed, between this Front Bench and the Government Front Bench on the question of neutrality.  I think that even the Taoiseach himself would admit that this Front Bench and our Party, and also the Labour Party, have played their part in the defence of this country. I do not think anybody will doubt that for a moment although certain members of the Government may by their whispering campaign, their campaign of calumny and slander have befogged the issue in various parts of the country.  They did not do it in my constituency, I can assure you.  If they did try it, the result might be different from that which they expected.</P>
    <P>We are asked to vote for the present Taoiseach by Fianna Fáil, which is the largest Party, because it is the largest Party.  The members of that Party claim that the House should vote for the out-going Taoiseach to carry on the same policy which he has carried on for the last four years.  I cannot subscribe to that and, therefore, I put to the House the name of William T. Cosgrave as being a person who, if elected as Taoiseach, will give new hope to the people for the future.  The plan and the policy that he has is a plan to <Col N="20" /> establish a National Government in this country composed of representatives of all sides of the House, and he would include in this even his old sparring partner right across on the Front Bench.  I should like to see such a situation arising in this country because, in my opinion, it would give new hope to the people of the country.  If we continue the old system, we shall have a new era of sectionalism in this country in which you will have the Sons of the Soil&mdash;I am not an Irish speaker, I am the only person in this House convicted of not being one&mdash; Labour, artisans and every other section putting forward their own interests and the new situation will be such that the old traditions to which we all held fast and cherished will be lost.</P>
    <P>I think that the day of reckoning has come, a day on which Fianna Fáil as well as Fine Gael should take note of the writing on the wall.  You on the Fianna Fáil Benches have not held your fort; it has been very substantially reduced.  There are several other people here who have been able to take many seats from you.  I want to suggest to members of the House, whether they be Labour, Farmers or Independents, that in accepting William T. Cosgrave as Taoiseach, they will be accepting a man whose word is his bond and who under God will lead this country, in my opinion, to that position at which Collins and Griffith aimed and in which every one of us would like to see it.  I submit to you that if you support him you will be doing a good day's work for the country and that you will be maintaining the highest traditions of our race.  I do not want to irritate anybody; to think of doing that would be my last thought, but I would say that Fianna Fáil after 11 years of administration have demoralised this country to such an extent that it was even permissible in Dublin, I believe, to take out a loud speaker and to warn the people of Dublin that if they did not vote for Fianna Fáil this country would be deluged in blood.  That may be good policy for Fianna Fáil, but I think it was the most despicable episode in their history.  I know well <Col N="21" /> that if you asked the present Taoiseach whether he stood for that, he would deny the charge vehemently, but when that is done under his banner, I think that this House must be very careful as to its next step.</P>
    <P>I know that there are several people in this House who think that they should sit here without voting for the present Taoiseach and that there are certain other people who think that they should sit here without voting against him.  I want to remind the members of this House of a few facts. If you vote for him that is all right, because you will be exercising your rights as Deputies although you may not be exercising the specific right which the people gave you.  You are, however, free agents and you must answer to your people for your actions.  But, by sitting in this House and not voting against him, you accept the policy for which he as Taoiseach stands.  I want to warn the people of this House and the country generally that the moment you elect Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach you are giving him a power under which he can declare an election to-morrow.  That is not a threat; I am speaking of facts as I know them.</P>

      <P>I do not think he is keen on it myself, but at the same time he is a very strong-minded man and he does not give a damn what the Fianna Fáil Party thinks any more than what we think.  They will follow him like sheep through a gap.  You applauded me when I said he was a strong-minded man and I would ask you to take your medicine now.  You will follow him like a pack of sheep. The moment he barks you will run through the gap.</P>

      <P>There is no use in getting on to me in the way you got on to Labour because the moment you do that we will have a show down and you will not be the gainer.  I am not going to be drawn at all.  I say that <Col N="22" /> by electing William T. Cosgrave as Taoiseach you will have a man in that high office who has always been able to interpret the national mind of this country.  He will be able, if elected, to take the best out of Fianna Fáil, the best out of Fine Gael, the best out of Labour, the best out of Farmers, and the best out of the Independents to form a Government which, in my opinion, will bring hope and succour to every farmer, worker and citizen of this country.  You must remember that there are only 67 Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party and that there are 71 others.  Therefore, you must take the view that the decision of the people is that Fianna Fáil is not entitled to form a Party Government.  If they go on and form their Party Government, in spite of the 71 votes that are here against them, that is their responsibility. If they do it, they will do it against the wishes of the people.  It will be an indication that Fianna Fáil has taken the point of view that the Irish people are only sheep to be driven ahead as the Fianna Fáil Party goes through the gap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to second the motion proposed by Deputy MacEoin. Let me say at the outset that I was rather surprised that Deputy de Valera was proposed as Taoiseach, having regard to his very emphatic, if not very definite statement, made during the course of the election.  Is it necessary to remind Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches or any other Deputy in the House that the Taoiseach said&mdash;or at least that was the implication of his statement to every person in the country&mdash;that he wanted a clear majority over all Parties to form a Government?  &ldquo;If we do not get a clear majority, we go into Opposition.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, of course; the Taoiseach took very good care that he did not say that.  What he did say was: &ldquo;We can go into opposition.&rdquo; The Taoiseach, of course, is never definite.  However, that was the appeal which the Taoiseach and every member of his Front and back benches <Col N="23" /> made to the country&mdash;to give them a clear majority over all Parties.  That was rejected by the country.  The country refused to give Deputy de Valera or any other leader a clear majority over all Parties.  Let me take my own constituency, where the Taoiseach's Party was a very strong one.  In that constituency, the Fianna Fáil Party dropped over 10,000 votes. If any clear indication of the people's mind was given in the County Tipperary it was that the people wanted a national Government.  The candidates they returned were three Fianna Fáil, two Fine Gael, one Farmer and one Labour.  I think that is a fair picture of what happened generally throughout the country.  We are putting forward the name of W. T. Cosgrave to give this House an opportunity of forming what we believe this country wants, a Government composed of all Parties in this House.  We are making an appeal for the co-operation of all Parties in this House to set up a united Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last four years political opponents have stood on common platforms throughout this country&mdash;we had the full commendation of Deputy de Valera&mdash;and appealed to all sections of our people outside to bury all their differences and bitternesses, and in some cases political hatreds, and the people responded in a magnificent way to that appeal.  As a result of their response, the Taoiseach and every other member of this House was able to say that we have presented to all people both inside and outside this country such a united front as even the most optimistic member of this House had not hoped for.  Every Party and every section of the House co-operated in that appeal, and we got that splendid unity.  But, what is good enough for the people outside, what the Taoiseach declares is a sign of strength outside&mdash;that unity, that coming together of all sections&mdash;is described as a symptom of weakness when it is proposed to carry it into effect here in this House.  Is it a sign of strength that one Party is to be the Government of this country?  Are we to be told here in a deliberative Assembly <Col N="24" /> what the people were told outside at the cross-roads&mdash;that there is only one man in this nation fit to lead and save the country?  Does any sane man in this House, no matter to which Party he belongs, believe that?  A Minister says over there that that is the position&mdash;that there is only one man in this nation who can save the country.  Did not the Deputy say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well&mdash;the Deputy did not say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I am sorry.  Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches applauded when Deputy MacEoin referred to Deputy de Valera as a strong-minded man.  Of course they applauded.  He is so strong-minded that this is going to be a one-man Government as it has been for the last eleven years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be in the Government at all-good, bad or indifferent.  I know, perhaps, a lot more about this House than the Deputy does.  There are very few Deputies who have been in the House as long as I have been, and I am putting forward here a plea for co-operation. I am making the statement here&mdash;I do not think any reasonable man can deny it&mdash;that a Government formed from all Parties in this House will be stronger and better than a Government formed from any other Party.  We heard a lot of talk about the critical days that are ahead of us. There is no doubt about that.  There is no doubt that the most critical phases of the war are still ahead. There is no doubt whatever that the greatest struggle that will take place in this war, no matter how long it may last, will occur within a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we to be told that it is a sign of weakness for this House to unite as if it were one family in forming a Government?  Are we to be told that all the courage and patriotism and vision are concentrated in that Front <Col N="25" /> Bench opposite?  I do not want to go back on what has happened, or refer to what has flown from the administration of that Front Bench in the last 11 years.  I do not think this is the time for it.  But I do say that this is the time for co-operation between all Parties in this House.  It is the time for us to follow the splendid example of the people up and down the country when they rallied to the defence of the country; when men who had been bitter enemies during the last 20 years stood shoulder to shoulder in the ranks of the L.D.F., the L.S.F., and other services associated with our national defence.  Surely we cannot refuse to do what we appealed to them to do?  If Fianna Fáil insists on having a Party Government, a one man Government&mdash;I am stating the facts as we, who have been in this House for a number of years, know them&mdash;and if this House agrees to have a one-man Government, then, in my opinion, it is a sign of the greatest weakness that could possibly be shown in this nation.  We appeal to the House to say that this, above all other times, is the time for a national Government. We appeal to them to rally around the man who has pledged himself, both inside and outside this House, to form that national Government. We ask the help and co-operation of every Party in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the nominations which are before the House from the Fianna Fáil Party and from the Fine Gael Party, I should like briefly to express the viewpoint of the Labour Party.  In our view, it is the obvious duty of the Fianna Fáil Party, being the largest Party but of course not having a clear majority, to endeavour to form a Government in the situation which now confronts us, and it is presumably a recognition of that fact by the Fianna Fáil Party itself that has led to the nomination of Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not propose to vote against the nomination of Deputy de Valera and, as we do not agree with the Fianna Fáil policy, we cannot see our way to support their nomination. It seems to us that to <Col N="26" /> do so would constitute an endorsement of Fianna Fáil policy, the visible manifestations of which are the mass emigration of our young and middle-age people to try to find employment in Britain, large-scale unemployment at home for those who escape the emigrant ship, high prices on the one hand and low wages on the other hand, representing the only economic offering which Fianna Fáil can make to the mass of the people.  Then we have social services which are characterised by miserable pittances to the unemployed, to the widows, to the aged and the destitute poor.  Most inexplicable of all, we have an acute shortage of dairy and agricultural products in a country which has 12,000,000 acres of arable land available for cultivation. A policy marked by such blunders, by such intense human suffering, does not commend itself to the Labour Party, and we do not propose to endorse that policy to-day by voting for the nomination of Deputy de Valera.  Having regard to the past reactionary social policy of the Fine Gael Party, whose attenuated numbers are indicative of the people's disapproval of the policy of that Party, the nomination made by Deputy MacEoin makes less appeal to us than the appeal made by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you form a Government yourself?  No.  Before this business is disposed of it seems to be the very nadir of futility on the part of the Leader of the Labour Party to come here and say that he will not support Deputy de Valera, that he will not support Deputy Cosgrave, and that he will do nothing himself.  If nobody forms a Government we are bound to have chaos in the country.  I doubt if anybody aspires very eagerly to the honours of the office in the present crisis.  Whoever takes it on knows that he is going to undertake a thankless and an arduous task.  I would say that the Labour Party are afraid to shoulder that responsibility as, if they were not afraid, they would have some more constructive policy to offer than merely to be afraid to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I have more respect for the <Col N="27" /> man who will get up and do something. I heard all sorts of encomiums of Deputy de Valera being the greatest man the world has ever seen, to which I will not subscribe, but I say that he is very nearly the greatest politician that the world has ever seen.  He is, probably, the astutest politician in Europe.  He is one of the most astute politicians in the world and, if Deputy Norton thinks that he can make ducks and drakes of a politican like Deputy de Valera he will have to think again, because Deputy de Valera will make circles around him and the Deputy will not know it.</P>

    <P>Here we are, 137 elected Deputies in whom ultimately the fate of this country depends.  The people have chosen us.  We have a high and honourable office, and we have the courage to discharge the duties attached to it.  At this moment 137 men and women act before the world on behalf of the Irish nation.  Now I make no disguise of the fact that Deputy Cosgrave's outlook and record in this country commands my respect&mdash;my affectionate respect&mdash;and admiration and, if I had to work under anyone, there is no man I would be prouder to work under than Deputy William T. Cosgrave.  The fact remains that Deputy de Valera is the leader of the biggest Party in this House.  I am a believer in the Party system.  I may have misunderstood certain Deputies who spoke here to-day, but I seem to remember that some of them said that the Irish people had expressed disapproval of the Party system.  I do not believe that.  I believe implicitly in Parliamentary democracy.  I am a Party man, and I make no concealment of the fact that it is irksome to me to be outside Party.  I think Independent Deputies in a deliberative Assembly can do very little good, but the times are abnormal and the Irish people, because of the fact that the times are abnormal, have indicated very clearly by their votes that for the duration of this abnormal time they want the Party system suspended but not abolished. I think they are perfectly right in that.  Just as we surrendered a great many of our most precious liberties into the keeping of the <Col N="28" /> Government for the duration of the crisis, I believe the Irish people want to suspend the Party system now, but to keep it in suspension until the crisis is over.  They look to see it preserved and protected so that it can come into play post-war as the most effective instrument for the preservation of individual liberty in any nation.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those to bow down in admiration of the Russian system, the German system or the Italian system.  I think they are all equally beastly.  Parliamentary democracy is the best system that I have yet seen working for the preservation of human liberty and indissolubly associated with it is the Party system.  It is not perfect.  No human institution is perfect. The work of man will never be ideal, but under the Party system men can maintain freedom and dignity.  I want to see it maintained.  I seriously suggest to 137 Deputies that we are putting that system in jeopardy to-day as a permanent feature of our public life if we do not form a national Government. Some people say that the democratic system of Government is unequal to an emergency.  I deny it. If the democratic system is worked by men worthy of the trust of the people it will work.  It is working in Britain in face of the greatest crisis that has ever confronted the British people. There you have high Tories and extreme Left-Wing Labour men burying their differences and coming together in the Cabinet, because they recognise the magnitude of the perils that face their people.  The trouble is that in this country the people do not recognise&mdash;just as some Deputies do not recognise&mdash;the magnitude of the perils that face us.  There are elements in this country&mdash;who will deny it&mdash;who would like to take advantage of any confusion that might eventuate on the decision we give to argue that the time had come for the abolition of the democratic system and to substitute for it some other system. I want to ask the House, as a test of its courage and of its character, to defend freedom against those who would destroy it.  If this House is going to embark for a protracted period on futile vacillation, culminating in a general election precipitated <Col N="29" /> by the pique of Deputy de Valera, because of some minor reverse in a decision in this House, the forces concerned to abolish Parliamentary democracy will be immensely strengthened.  I want to demonstrate to our people what I know is true, that Parliamentary democracy properly worked is the best instrument of Government for carrying our people through the crisis.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach gave an admirable demonstration of that when France fell.  I remember those weeks well, when everyone felt that the moment of invasion was at our door.  There was then some real danger that we saw.  There was no question of words, no question of speculation.  We knew that at any minute the foreigner might set his foot on our soil.  What did we do?  Did we sit down and conduct a debate?  We did not.  We met in the Taoiseach's room.  He sent for us and we were glad to go.  The Labour Party came, the Fine Gael Party, of which I was then a member, came. Everybody came, and I think the Taoiseach will be constrained to admit that in those anxious hours leading up to the establishment of the Defence Conference he received material assistance from Deputies on every side. We were in conference with him as to how best to constitute the body which was to remove the question of the defence of this nation out of the sphere of Party politics.</P>
    <P>Is not that true?  Does he throw his mind back to the days when we were testing formulas and trying to arrive at an agreed programme?  Does he remember the hours when it seemed as if, through some futility, there might be a breach between us?  But sitting together around a table we found the form of words to say what we all desired to say and built upon it was the Defence Conference of which the present Minister for Defence said that it did good work, and, in respect of which he was prepared to say, behind closed doors where it worked, that the work was good, the co-operation generous, and the results excellent. Defence was then the most urgent problem of this country.  I want to tell this House now that getting our people <Col N="30" /> through the next two or three years safe is the most urgent problem that confronts the 137 Deputies of this House.  Are we fit to do now what our much despised predecessors were equal to when they decided to have the Defence Conference?  You cannot have a Defence Conference for economics, for agriculture, or for any other branch of Government.  When the Defence Conference was established the only division of Government that called for emergency action was Defence.  We take it now that every Department of Government calls for that same emergency approach, the high resolve to lay aside our differences until this crisis is over, to get through together in the belief that we ought to have a common desire to save our people and our country whatever the cost to ourselves, and in the firm resolve that when the crisis is overcome we shall return to the full undiluted system of Parliamentary democracy with the full thrust and parry of Party debate across the floor of this House.  That is the way the liberties of our people can be preserved.  I say to you deliberately that if we are unequal to this situation now we may be singing here the swan song of the only institution that can preserve the liberties of our people intact.</P>
    <P>These facts being so, I want to ask Deputy de Valera will he invite representatives from the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and Clann na Talmhan to join his Cabinet.  That is all I want to know.  I do not conceal the fact that I should wish to see Deputy Cosgrave sitting where Deputy de Valera sits now, but the people have decided otherwise, and I accept the fact.  If the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, will announce that he is prepared to form a Government consisting of his own colleagues and representatives of Fine Gael, Labour and Clann na Talmhan, I will vote for him.  He is quite free to say, and could justly say, that he would fix all and sundry with notice that that coalition will subsist only so long as the crisis subsists, and that at the conclusion he will advise a dissolution and a return to the Party system that obtained here before.  He has the prescriptive right, <Col N="31" /> as being the Leader of the largest Party in this House and in the country, to make that offer first if it accepts it and if he makes it.  But if he does not, and if we are to lapse back for the next three or four years into Party wrangling, culminating in a general election, which will be precipitated by Deputy de Valera on the ground that contentious Parties in this House had made it impossible for him to pursue a coherent policy&mdash;because that is the issue he will put to the country&mdash;I say that democracy and freedom in this country will be done irreparable damage.  Rather than afford him the opportunity of doing that, I think this House should turn in full confidence to Deputy Cosgrave and ask him that his Party and the Fianna Fáil Party should take in hand the task of forming a national Government that will endure for the period of the crisis.  I want to join with Deputy MacEoin in saying that my long experience of Deputy Cosgrave has been that he is a man whose word is better than his bond.  If he gave his written bond he also has the brains to get out of it if he chose to do so, but if he gave his word, then if there was any ambiguity Deputy Cosgrave always interpreted that ambiguity against himself.  He is the kind of man who, in his peculiar position, can be fully confided with the powers of choosing a national Government in the certainty that if given the position of Taoiseach he would not misuse it for any Party advantage, but would, as truly as he could do it, reproduce the people's will.</P>
    <P>I am a Parliamentarian.  I believe in Parliament, and I say now that Deputy de Valera's duty is to form this national Government. If he were prepared to undertake it, I would not desire to see that duty passed to another.  He is the people's choice for that duty, but if he is afraid to undertake it, if he will not face the difficult task of undertaking it, then I ask Deputy Cosgrave to undertake it.</P>

      <P>That is perfectly fair, and I appreciate the Deputy's courtesy. Doubtless this is a matter to which Deputy de Valera has given careful consideration, but these are the facts which are staring us in the face.  President Roosevelt, when his country was confronted with impending war, invited Mr. Knox and Mr. Stimson, two pillars of the Republican Party, into his Cabinet.  Mr. Winston Churchhill, the Prime Minister of England, invited into his Cabinet members of the Labour Party and members of the Liberal Party, old battle-scarred opponents of his, whom in the past he had handled none too gently, and by whom he himself was handled none too gently. Every great democracy in the world has chosen a coalition except Australia and with what results?  That in Australia, as soon as war began, you had one general election when Mr. Menzie's Government went.  Now they are going to have another election which will very possibly put out Mr. Curtin. How long will Australia stand that? Do Deputies seriously believe that if we are precipitated into another general election within, say, 12 months, our people will stand for it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Goodness knows Deputy de Valera is petulant enough, but I do not believe that he is as petulant as that, but if the country is precipitated into another general election in 12 months do Deputies believe that our people will stand for that?  Does any Deputy believe that the majority of the people desire Party Government at the present time supported only by a minority of the House?  I am perfectly certain that 80 per cent. of the Deputies sitting here know that our people want, above all things at the present moment, stable government. How else can you get stable government <Col N="33" /> except by a national Government at the present time?  If Deputy de Valera were to rise now and say that he proposed to form a national Government the proposition in favour of Deputy Cosgrave would, I believe, be withdrawn.  I am perfectly certain that there is not any member of the Fine Gael Party that I know who would not be prepared to get up and absolutely reject any proposal that he should be included if his exclusion would facilitate the formation of a national Government.</P>
      <P>I doubt if any man at this side aspires to high office.  At the present time it is a thankless task.  Some of our friends in Clann na Talmhan will discover very soon that Ministerial office, at the present time, is not the bed of roses that some of them think it is.  £1,700 a year for a Minister in Éire is not such a dream of delight as to tempt many men at the present time.  Those who undertake the task of forming a national Government now will be patriots and persons primarily concerned for the honour of the country. Those who are prepared to serve Deputy de Valera in a Party Government may be true patriots, but they are misguided, and my apprehension is that serious injury, if not ruin, may be done to Parliamentary democracy in this country, and that true liberty will be in jeopardy.  I would, therefore, appeal to Deputy de Valera to put forward his proposals for a national Government, to stir the Labour Party out of its futility, to invite the co-operation of the Fine Gael Party, which has never been afraid to shoulder its burden of duty, and to give Clann na Talmhan the opportunity, to which I am sure they will be equal, of doing their best to serve this country under the leader chosen by the largest majority accorded to any leader in the general election that has just come to a close.</P>

      <P>Ar son Clann na Talmhan ní maith liom cur in aghaidh Eamon de Valéra mar Thaoiseach ag an am i láthair.  Caithfimid seasamh agus oibriú le chéile anois ar son ar dtíre agus muintir na hÉireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> As leader of Clann na Talmhan, the Farmers' Party, I wish to state that it is not the intention of my Party to oppose the election of Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach, in view of the fact that he is the leader of the largest Party in Dáil Eireann.  We have decided to adopt that attitude because we believe that such a course is best in the national interest at present.  The farmers of Ireland always put their country's interest first.  The outstanding national need at the moment is stability and the Farmers' Party is prepared to do its part now and to give to the country that security which it needs so much; but we wish to emphasise that the Clann will definitely maintain its own independence and do all it can to carry out the wishes of the electors who sent us to Dáil Eireann.  It will not be swallowed up by any Party and we are determined that it will not meet the fate of previous Farmers' Parties in that respect.</P>
    <P>The course we are taking is, we believe, not only the best for the country, but in the long run will be the best for the people we represent, and we know that our supporters, and indeed many others outside our ranks, will understand and appreciate our gesture in this momentous crisis.  If another election is soon and suddenly sprung on the country, our Party cannot be blamed, and the Party or Parties who attempt to force an election will find themselves in the dock before the Irish people, and will no doubt be dealt with accordingly by the hardheaded, commonsense voters of the country.  Any sharp practice for the sake of Party advantage will not be tolerated by our people.  I have no illusions about professional politicians. I believe sincerely, as I stated during the election campaign, that the only ploughman&mdash;the man whom we represent&mdash;the professional politician cares about is the ploughman on the £ note. We hold that a broad national policy is most essential especially now and our Party will do all in its power to foster that policy.</P>
    <P>Another reason for stability at the present juncture is the fact that the Vocational Commission is to issue a <Col N="35" /> report at an early date.  We believe largely in vocationalism as opposed to entire reliance on the Party system, and the country is hoping for great things from that commission and from the brilliant churchman at its head, his Lordship the Bishop of Galway. I regret that in many cases neutrality was made an issue in the recent election. If the credit for neutrality was due to any particular section of the people, and I do not say it is, first credit must go to the people on the land, the men who manned the front, the middle and the rear line trenches in the economic war, and by their self-sacrificing stand made possible the agreement of 1938, which gave Ireland back her ports, but not yet her Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has thrown out a gibe. I suppose he took the hint from the Press reports this morning.  I have noticed these reports in the daily press which seek to convey the idea that some bargaining has been in progress between the Clann and An Taoiseach. There is no foundation whatever for such reports.  My interview with the Taoiseach was merely a courtesy call which I considered it my duty to make as leader of a new Party in this House. No bargaining went on.  No offer was made to us by An Taoiseach, because I may tell you that no offer would be accepted by us if it were made.  I shall conclude by saying again that no matter what other Parties may do, the Clann will act as patriots.  They will seek no unfair advantage, and will act only in the best interests of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The view expressed by Deputy de Valera by way of interjection during the speech of Deputy Dillon conveyed in a single sentence the considered opinion of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We do not believe in coalition governments.  We think they are a bad system of government. We think that in any circumstances they are a bad system of government and we consider that in present circumstances in this country a coalition government would be a source of weakness and perhaps even a <Col N="36" /> source of danger.  In abnormal conditions, democracy may be forced to work through coalition governments, but those who desire the preservation of democracy and the proper functioning of democratie institutions of government will endeavour to avoid the establishment of coalitions and endeavour to end them as quickly as possible.  That is our view.  We believe in a government of men who are agreed upon policy, of men who are loyal to the leader of the Government and to one another, of men who will stand together when steps have to be taken which are politically unpopular and which might lose the votes of sections of the people for the individuals concerned. Members of this House know that it is often the duty of governments to take action which is unpopular with individuals and sections of individuals. We believe that only a government that will stand together in such circumstances and take such action, if it is clearly in the public interest, can function properly under present conditions here.</P>
      <P>I think it is preposterous to suggest that the decision of the people in the recent election was in favour of a coalition government.  I should say that whatever interpretation might be put on the people's decision one thing is clear: That they were definitely against the proposal put to them by the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Dillon did well to remind us of the situation which arose here in 1940, when the danger of invasion of this country appeared imminent.  If he is advancing what happened then as an argument in favour of coalition government, I think he is by implication criticising the members of the Party with which he was then associated, because he will remember that there was no suggestion <Col N="37" /> of the formation of a coalition government then.  There was on the contrary a very definite and explicit statement from the leader of that Party that he did not believe and would not participate in a coalition government.  There was no desire to share responsibility then.</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious <Col N="38" /> from the tone of the speeches delivered by Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Morrissey, who proposed and seconded this alternative to the motion that Deputy de Valera should be elected Taoiseach, speeches which went almost to the point of being abusive, that they did not expect the proposition to be taken seriously.  If they were seriously concerned with the abolition of past disunions and Party feeling surely we would have speeches worded somewhat differently from those delivered.  It was obvious to everyone in this House that Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Morrissey were merely forwarding a Party stunt which was tried out in the recent elections and which failed.  Deputy Dillon was merely trying to prove to Fine Gael that he could make a better case for their policy than they could make themselves.  I am very glad that Deputy Donnellan made it quite clear that there has been and will be no bargaining.  The attempt on the part of the <i>Irish Times</i> to suggest that there has been some understand bargaining is very typical of that newspaper, typical of the contempt in which it holds the democratic institutions of the State.  There has been and will be no bargaining.</P>
      <P>The motion has been put to the House that Deputy de Valera should be appointed Taoiseach.  If he is appointed Taoiseach he will appoint a Government from this Party, a Government which will agree with him on matters of policy, a Government which will carry on, so long as it has the support of the House, for the full five years for which this Dáil has been elected.  So long as it is possible for that Government to carry out its policy, the policy which it believes to be essential for the welfare and safety of the country, so long will it continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say, in support of the point put forward by Deputy Dillon, that there is upon this House as its primary responsibility the election of a Government? That is a responsibility which is shared equally by every Deputy.  It is not sufficient to endeavour to avoid subsequent responsibility for the actions of whatever Government is chosen.  Every action of whatever <Col N="39" /> Government is chosen by the Dáil will be subject to review by the Dáil and the Dáil can pass judgment on every one of them.  No Deputy is held to be responsible to defend every action of the Government by his vote upon the motion for the election of Taoiseach. But there is a responsibility on every Deputy to see that this country has a Government.  That is what the Dáil is doing.  No Deputy can seek to avoid that responsibility.  Deputy de Valera stated during the election campaign that if he got sufficient support he would form a Government.  Whether he did get sufficient support will be put to the test to-day.  That is the purpose of the motion, and by means of the vote on that motion that question will be answered.  If there is sufficient support to secure his nomination as Taoiseach, then he will form a Government. If there is not, then the Fianna Fáil Party will go into opposition.</P>

I will not support Deputy de Valera.  I would not dream of supporting Deputy Cosgrave.  I do not agree with the policy of Fianna Fáil; I do not agree with the Fine Gael Party; and I do not agree either with Labour or with Clann na Talmhan.  So far as I can see, they are all only trying to whip a dead horse.  It does not matter what Government is elected to-day.  We have had two Governments in the past &mdash;a Cumann na nGaedheal and a Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;and both of them failed.  Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Dillon spoke of a national Government.

So far as I can see it is all the same what laws we make as there is a super-government over us&mdash;the people who control money.  Until such time as we take over the control of money we cannot do anything for the people; we are only wiping the people's eyes by being here at all.

What I am elected for is to see that whatever government is elected will take over the control of money, because until we have that we cannot do anything for the people.</P>

      <P>So far as the motion before the House is concerned, I should like to make it quite clear that I do not agree with either of the political Parties, because they are all one.  I do not intend to vote for Deputy de Valera or Deputy Cosgrave, because one was bad and the other was worse. I want to make that position clear to the House.</P>

      <P>Speaking for the first time in this House as an Independent <Col N="41" /> Deputy, I should like to say that I listened with great interest to the proposals made from both sides of the House with regard to the nomination of a Taoiseach.  So far as Deputy Cosgrave is concerned, I have heard a lot during recent months with regard to a national Government.  I had perhaps less time to read about it and study it than if times were normal.  Although it is only theory, it possibly might contain a lot of useful material.  What strikes me about the whole matter, however, is the absence of any plan. I should have thought that Deputy Cosgrave and his Party would have negotiated with Parties or groups in the House and that the plans for a national Government would be prepared and ready.  We are assembled here to-day to elect a Taoiseach.  The proposal made for the election of Deputy de Valera is, at least, cut and dried and ready.  But the other one is rather nebulous.  If Dáil Eireann decides to select Deputy Cosgrave, then he has apparently to go round and negotiate with other Parties in the House and see to what extent a national Government Party can be formed.  To that extent I think the proposal is not really serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the election, it is quite true that both the big Parties, for various reasons, have come back with attenuated forces.  It would be quite wrong, however, to assume that Fianna Fáil have not received a measure of support from the electorate which would justify them in taking the responsibility of forming a Government. They have got a jolt here and there; Labour has hit them up a bit. The sudden growth and the development of the Farmers' Party have been another eye-opener.  I hope the Fianna Fáil Party will bear in mind that these are true elements of our people.  Both the farmers and the workers must feel they have just reason for being dissatisfied with the Fianna Fáil administration. I hope that will be recognised <Col N="42" /> in the future by the Fianna Fáil Party which, I assume, will be the Party in power.</P>
    <P>There is one more aspect to which I would like to refer.  All Parties in this House have indicated their stand for neutrality.  It is a very necessary thing that this condition should be emphasised as firmly as possible.  I think an opportunity is afforded here now to emphasise our sincerity and it can best be indicated by unanimous agreement to leave in office the Party which has received the largest amount of support from the people.  That is the Party that, in actual practice, has successfully maintained the neutrality of this country up to the present.  Their attitude in regard to neutrality has been amply demonstrated.  I suggest that there should be unanimous agreement on the proposal that Deputy de Valera be re-elected as Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass, the Minister for Supplies, made a statement here this evening which was not in accordance with the truth.  The statement that I made in connection with a coalition government followed a statement which was made by the outgoing Taoiseach.  After his statement, I said that he was the obstacle to coalition government in this country.  One Minister, or ex-Minister, if you so like to call him, at least, had knowledge of that and made use of it in the course of his election speeches.  His colleagues either forgot it, or perhaps thought it better not to mention it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared at the moment to do that.  Their appointment is as members of the Government.  According to the Constitution, the Taoiseach has to make the necessary allocations.  At the moment, I am not in a position to indicate the Ministries to which the Deputies I have mentioned will be attached but, at the first possible opportunity, I shall do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It would make a very real difference in the discussion here if the Taoiseach would give the information which has been sought.  From a long experience of the Dáil, it seems to me to be unusual not to indicate the Ministries to which the members proposed are to be attached.  If necessary, some adjournment should take place to <Col N="46" /> enable the Taoiseach to do as required. I do not want to interfere in any way with the convenience of the Ministry or to hurry the dispositions, but I do say that, if we had the information which is being sought, it would affect very considerably the course of the debate. As the matter stands, we are merely dealing with names.  I am disposed to think that, on reflection, it ought to be clear even to the Taoiseach himself that it is scareely fair to the House to have the names of the proposed Ministry presented in this form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about that.  Members of the Government have to perform two functions.  Their first and most important function is, as a corporate body, to take responsibility for policy, for proposals for legislation and for executive action. That is a distinct and separate function from the other function which they have to discharge&mdash;the administration of Departments.  Deputies will, if they look up the Constitution and relevant statutes, find that it is as members of the Government that nominees have to get the approval of the Dáil, and that it is the duty of the head of the Government&mdash;the Taoiseach&mdash;to allocate the Ministries.  I think that it is wise that the matter should be left in that form.  However, I am prepared to indicate at this stage that there is to be as little change as possible in the Ministries held recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one case, the Minister for Lands and for Education.  The Minister for Education has also taken the work of the Department of Lands.  I think the work of the Minister for Education is so heavy that it is not right that we should carry on for a considerable period of time as we have done with one Minister trying to attend to both Departments.  It is for that reason that there is an extra Minister, so as to give me an opportunity of making such adjustments as may be necessary.  I think I could indicate generally to the House that my intention is to keep the Ministries pretty much as they are at the moment.  There may be changes as time goes on.  It is within the power of the Taoiseach to make reassignments <Col N="47" /> of Departments.  He has not necessarily to get the approval of the Dáil for that particular act, but, naturally, when the Dáil comes to a question of Estimates or to particular matters dealt with by Ministers, the members of the House will have their say.  However, I do not think it is constitutionally necessary that the Departments should be indicated.</P>

      <P>It is set out in that particular form, and all I can say is that there are not likely to be many changes other than those brought about by the fact that I think it is not desirable, as the emergency has lasted too long, to allow the Department of Lands to be operated by a Minister carrying Education at the same time. I feel the Department of Lands will have a great deal of work to do in planning ahead for the time when we reach something like normal circumstances. I think I have given a fair indication to the House what the assignment of Departments is likely to be.</P>

      <P>I say that I am putting the list forward as a team&mdash;it is in accordance with the Constitution that they be put forward that way &mdash;and I have indicated that I propose to make as few changes as possible. There are a few adjustments that will have to be made as a result of the inclusion in the Ministry of a former Parliamentary Secretary who was in charge of A.R.P. work, and he will be getting a Ministry which will probably not permit him to continue it.  With regard to the other Ministries, they will remain as before, but the Minister for Lands will no longer be the same person as the Minister for Education. I propose to have the Minister for Education, Tomás O Deirg, carrying on as Minister for Education.  The Ministry of Lands will have to be dealt with by another Minister.  As I say, the time has not been sufficient for me to go into the finer points, but all the other Ministries remain unchanged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we are not going into Opposition merely for the sake of opposition, but I might remind the House that on the first occasion on which Deputies opposite entered this House some 16 years ago, it was their very strong request that Ministers might be put up singly.  It was not our practice&mdash;it has never been the practice&mdash;but it was the invariable practice even on the last occasion in 1938 to indicate the Ministry which each one of the Deputies proposed by the Prime Minister would take.  Now, had there been an indication on the part of the Taoiseach to put forward the members of the Ministry to meet the present situation in a form which might not only commend itself to this House but also to the country, our attitude towards these nominations would be somewhat different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I make that point quite clear? There is, and has been throughout this country for a long time past, very serious criticism of the agricultural policy of the Government, that our agricultural production has gone down, that we have not during a period of emergency taken the steps which have been taken in other countries to get the maximum production out of the land, and that whatever may have been said about the disadvantages and disabilities under which the secondary industries of the State might suffer, we had here a unique opportunity of developing and expanding agricultural production.  It has been done in other countries.  The one closest to us, from all the information we have been able to obtain, has advanced in production something like 75 per cent. from the pre-war period.  If we were in that happy position here, it is our view that the imports we need would be much more easily procurable, not only during the period of emergency but in the post-war period from those countries in a position to export goods which are needed.  None are more vitally needed in the world to-day, <Col N="50" /> where there is a possibility of marketing them, than agricultural goods. That is the situation with regard to agriculture.</P>
    <P>If I may take just one phase of it, it would appear from the information at our disposal that the yield of milk by cows in this country is very much under that of our competitors. We are probably capable of producing something like two-thirds of the quantity of milk that cows are able to produce in other countries.  Milk production, as far as I am aware, has gone up in England and they buy our cows.  There does not appear to be any reason why some special effort should not have been made to get a greater milk production, and the approach towards a balanced economy should be on those lines.  Statements in connection with agricultural production were made by three Ministers nominated here before us, by the ex-Minister for Agriculture&mdash;I presume he is going to be the Minister in future&mdash;the ex-Minister for Local Government, I presume he will continue&mdash;and the Minister for Supplies. On different occasions they have committed themselves to statements which would discount any value that the people might assess on the agricultural industry in this country.  That is, generally speaking, the position as regards agriculture.</P>
    <P>The second case is the question of supplies.  Now, in the three or four years during which we have gone through this emergency, this Dáil has decided on action to deal with shortages impending, in distribution and so on.  The Dáil, rather than the Ministry, appears to have been taking the lead in that respect, but there has been very great dissatisfaction throughout the country in connection with the administration of the law, in so far as Ministers' power over the law has been exercised.  We have taken the view, and it has been already expressed in this House, that the administration of the law in this country should be exercised only through the courts.  If it be thought necessary to impose severe penalties, we should leave the question of the imposition of these penalties to an independent <Col N="51" /> judiciary, and power should not be taken to place in the hands of Ministers any discretion in such matters. In times of emergency such as this, it is most desirable that the maximum support should be behind the Ministry, that is that Ministers ought to have behind them the confidence of as large a section of the community as possible.  The Minister's approach to such matters as the imposition or remission of penalties in any set of circumstances should not depend on the measure of influence that can be exercised on him.</P>
    <P>The third matter to which I would draw attention for a very short period is the exercise of the censorship.  There is grave dissatisfaction in connection with the exercise of that function.  My information is that, although this is a country not engaged in the war, there is less news allowed to be published here in connection with the war and matters of that sort than in any other country.  On an occasion when a man of Irish birth and patronage was mentioned in dispatches, to put it no more lucidly, I have been informed that the publication of such matter was not allowed.  I have even been told that in certain cases, in the beginning, obituary notices were objected to because some such phrase as &ldquo;killed in action&rdquo; was inserted in them.</P>
    <P>That is the general situation.  I do not intend to delay the House except to say that in so far as presenting a united front in a time of emergency is concerned&mdash;I have said it before, here and all over the country&mdash;there is no question at issue.  Not only this Party but I believe all Parties can be relied upon in this connection.  I cannot speak, of course, for those who have come newly into the House and who will have to exercise their wisdom and judgment in the near future, but those Parties who were in this House before the dissolution were agreed upon the vital necessity of the maintenance of order and the observance of the rule of law.  I do put it to the Taoiseach that, in order to encourage that respect for the rule of law, there is a very grave responsibility on him to ensure that there is fair play amongst all classes <Col N="52" /> and that there is no discrimination shown in favour of any citizens, irrespective of whatever political influence they may be able to command.  That is the situation so far as the internal and external front is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have never challenged a division heretofore on the Taoiseach's nomination of a Ministry.  I believe that if there had been three or four changes I would have been able to persuade my colleagues to follow the practice observed on the last three or four occasions, but now, presented with a Ministry which is unchanged and probably unchangeable, we have no option, having regard to the dissatisfaction expressed throughout the country and to our knowledge of the imperfections of the Ministry, and to the general feeling that consideration is shown only where influence can be exercised, except to divide the House on this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has given us a list of persons who will constitute his new Ministry.  In fact, in the main, it is a case of old wine in old bottles.  I am opposed to this Ministry on one main ground, and that is, that it contains within its personnel Deputy MacEntee who, in my opinion, is unfit to be a member of any Government in a country where clean and decent administration is valued.  Deputy MacEntee enjoys the distinction of having been fired out of the Ministry of Finance.  He was put into the Department of Industry and Commerce, he was fired out of that, and public life in this country would be healthier and cleaner if he were fired out of the Ministry altogether. Nobody knows the depths of indecency in language to which the Deputy can stoop when dealing with political opponents. He has distinguished himself in the recent election by indulgence in the most slanderous language against his opponents, statements made without the slightest regard to truth, statements which we know were deliberately untrue.  He carried on that indecent campaign in the last election and, apparently, could not be induced even by the example of some of his decent colleagues to pursue a clean line in the election.  The Minister <Col N="53" /> seems to have gone berserk in the election.  He accused the Labour Party of being a Communist Party. He accused members of the Labour Party of being members of Communist Parties, and with that characteristic flair for lying which is so typical of him he alleged that the Labour Party got money from Communistic sources.</P>
      <P>Nobody expects a high standard of decency from Deputy MacEntee when he speaks from political platforms or in this House.  The Labour Party, Deputy MacEntee said, were Communists and the associates of Communists. The Minister must have known that that was untrue.  The Taoiseach also must have known that that was untrue.  Deputy MacEntee was not concerned in 1932, when the Labour Party's votes, unfortunately, made him a Minister for Finance, whether the Labour Party was Communist or not, but the Labour Party will not help to make him another tragic Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister's own speeches and his own filthy scurrilous vituperative advertisements would not be published by any paper except his own political rag.  The other decent papers would not take them because they knew perfectly well that the language resorted to by the Minister was such as to be unworthy of publication in any decent paper, and unworthy of use in a general election which people wanted to be clean, decent, and conducted on a high level.  So far as the Labour Party is concerned it has no use whatever for Communistic theory or Communistic ideology.  The Labour Party has no connection with the Communist Party in Russia.  The Labour Party's programme, which can be read by every person, is based on Papal Encyclicals, and it embraces the viewpoint of the Catholic Church in social and economic matters.  I challenge anybody on the Government front bench to attempt to deny that.  If it should be attempted, I shall prove within 24 hours, on the testimony of the highest ecclesiastics in this country, the sound Catholic character of the Labour Party's programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is Deputy MacEntee, in any case, to talk about Communism or <Col N="54" /> about Russia?  The Party of which Deputy MacEntee was a member sent a delegation to Russia in 1925, to get Russian guns, and, if they could, to get Russian money and to try to get trained in Russian methods of warfare. For what purpose?  Only that those guns, that money and that training in Russian methods of warfare could be used here in Ireland against Irishmen with whom Fianna Fáil disagreed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy MacEntee, although he knew it to be a contemptible lie, accused the Labour Party of having association with Communism.  I deny that; denial should hardly be necessary with people who have any regard for the truth, but it is apparently necessary to put it on the records of this House in order to show that, as far as we are concerned, we deny that detestable lie uttered by Deputy MacEntee during the recent election, and for which he apparently seeks to secure endorsement now by being nominated as Minister for Local Government to-day.  He will not deny that his Party sent a delegation to Russia to get Russian guns and bullets to use against Irishmen.  They did not care whether or not they were made by Godless Communists, so long as they <Col N="56" /> found billets in the bodies of the Irishmen who opposed them.</P>

      <P>He was one of the people who sent that dastardly delegation from this country.  Deputy MacEntee is one of the people who prate and prattle about law and order, notwithstanding his association with that delegation, and notwithstanding the association of another Minister with that delegation.  Law and order can only be maintained to-day by forcing people into hunger striking on the Curragh as a protest against being interned without charge or trial.  You forced them to go on hunger strike, pretending to justify law and order, although in 1925 you sent a delegation to Russia to get guns to wage another civil war in this country.  Here is an example of some of the methods adopted by Deputy MacEntee and his half-witted agent in the recent election&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain how a gentleman who was appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to a part-time job at £2,500 a year was unscrupulously utilised to get this agent of Deputy MacEntee released from work in order to engage in the dissemination of Deputy MacEntee's lies and slanders during the election. Here is a letter from ex-Senator J.T. O'Farrell, a person with whom Deputy MacEntee had some controversy during the election.  I am not concerned with the controversy at all; I am not concerned with the merits of the dispute between ex-Senator O'Farrell and Deputy MacEntee, but I am concerned with the scurrility that was employed to try to lower the reputation of ex-Senator O'Farrell before the public of this country.  A fortnight before election day a loud speaker was set up on Aston's Quay, and, through the mouth of this election agent of Deputy MacEntee, a tirade of abuse was directed across the Liffey to Transport <Col N="57" /> House, near which 700 or 800 railwaymen are employed, stating: &ldquo;J. T. O'Farrell, Labour candidate, is an agent of Freemasonry; has an arrangement with the British Labour Party to bring Éire into the war within a week if Labour secures a majority; has contacts with Communism, from which he also takes instructions.&rdquo;  On the day of the election, again by the manipulation of Deputy MacEntee, a loud speaker van toured the constituency, blaring out statements to the effect that Mr. O'Farrell is an agent of Freemasonry, an agent of Imperialism, an agent of Communism, and of various other &ldquo;isms&rdquo;.  This van, hired by Fianna Fáil, stopped outside Mr. O'Farrell's house; his name was called out twice, and then there was a repetition of the charges formerly mentioned and a blasphemous appeal in the name of God to all those who valued the safety of their country to vote for Fianna Fáil, to give Fianna Fáil an over-all majority or otherwise the country would be involved in war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be borne in mind, having regard to the character which Mr. MacEntee has given to Mr. J. T. O'Farrell, that Deputy Boland, when Minister for Justice, and his predecessor Mr. Ruttledge, when Minister for Justice, appointed Mr. O'Farrell as chairman of the Film Censorship Board for a number of years.  Did they believe that he was an agent of Freemasonry, or an agent of Imperialism, or that he had contacts with Communism and took his instructions from them?  The very fact that they appointed him chairman of the Film Censorship Board for a number of years is the clearest possible evidence that Deputy Boland-whose conduct in those matters I value on an entirely different basis from the conduct of Deputy MacEntee&mdash;and Deputy Ruttledge also obviously did not believe the lying statements of Deputy MacEntee.  I do not think Mr. O'Farrell needs to apologise to anybody for the manner in which he loves this country.  J. T. O'Farrell's name is an honoured name in this country.  He need apologise to nobody in so far as his national effort to secure the unity of our people in the face of <Col N="58" /> external danger is concerned.  J.T. O'Farrell, although a very busy man, was good enough to join the L.S.F. in June, 1940, and became a district communications officer in control of nine groups, which position he still occupies.  That is not the attitude of a man who wants to involve us in war. It is not the attitude of a man who is the tool or the agent of Imperialism or Freemasonry.  It is the attitude of a decent Irishman who can conduct an election campaign cleanly, and has not been initiated into the Sandy Row methods of electioneering which were brought down here by Deputy MacEntee.</P>
    <P>During the election Deputy MacEntee spoke at Leinster Square, Rathmines.  Of course, at Rathmines he cooed Imperialism to all the old darlings there, but when he went down the country, whenever the managers thought it safe to let him go out, he was a wild, roaring Republican, but he was the grandest Imperialist little chap you ever saw when in Rathmines, wanting to live in friendship with Britain, wanting to go hand in hand with Britain.  There was no greater darling than Britain.  He regarded his opponents as invaders, but had a passion for working hand in hand with Britain when in Rathmines.  Here is what Deputy MacEntee said at Leinster Square:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Will the Labour Party publish particulars of the money received by them for propagation of the Labour Party propaganda?  If so, it will be found that the bulk of their funds comes from trade unions with headquarters in Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach might take a note of this for decency and clean administration. &ldquo;Strange as it may seem,&rdquo; said Deputy MacEntee, who was Minister for Local Government, &ldquo;I have had an opportunity of seeing the acknowledgments&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The public ought to know now the sort of secrecy there is in the post when Deputy MacEntee speaking at Leinster Square, Rathmines, could declare: &ldquo;Strange as it might seem, I have had an opportunity of seeing acknowledgments from the Labour Party offices here to British <Col N="59" /> trade unions for the bulk of the money which,&rdquo; he alleged, &ldquo;came from the British trade unions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On that occasion Deputy MacEntee said that the Labour Party here received £12,000 from British trade unions.  Later in the election it was said that £12,000,000 came from the Communists.  I do not know what we spend £20,000 a year on the secret service for, or how we spend it, if the Government could not ascertain if money was coming to this country from Communist sources.  The Minister for Finance will be able to ascertain whether the Labour Party, in fact, gets £12,000 a year from British trade unions.  The balance sheet of the Labour Party is printed and circulated and is available for reading by anybody who wants to see it.  The accounts are audited by a reputable firm in this city who were auditors for the old Dáil Fund.</P>
    <P>They have certified the Labour Party balance sheet.  Can anybody find £12,000 in that from British trade unions?  Can anybody find £1,000? Not one halfpenny came from British trade unions.  If the Labour Party receives any affiliation fees at all they were received from Irish members of organisations who may have their headquarters across Channel, and if aggregated the Labour Party would not get £250, all of which would come from Irish members.  Yet, in the face of that information, which must have been available to Deputy MacEntee, he came out in this election campaign and indulged in a scandalous lie by saying that the Labour Party got £12,000 from British trade unions and, later, £12,000,000 from Communist sources.  Annanias was a gentleman compared with Deputy MacEntee. Another example of clean Fianna Fáil literature comes from Limerick asking for votes for Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Is it not a scandalous state of affairs,&rdquo; said the five Fianna Fáil candidates in Limerick, &ldquo;to have Labour canvassers and supporters carrying on a whispering campaign amongst the men in our Army that it is the intention of the Labour Party, if returned to power (which they will not be and consequently cannot be held to their promise) that they will disband the Army so that those demobilised can go to England to earn big wages?  Surely that is treacherous propaganda&mdash;to attempt to create discontent amongst the men who are standing on guard to protect our liberty?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does not the Taoiseach know, does not the Minister for Defence know, does not the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures know, that that is a deliberate lie?  I have gone from one end of the country to the other appealing to people to join the Defence Forces, to join the auxiliary forces and to do everything they could to present a united front in face of any danger that threatened us from without.  Yet Government candidates can accuse the Labour Party, which is responsible for trying to unite and consolidate our Defence Forces, of threatening to demobilise the Army.  The printer that printed that should be prosecuted because it is downright treachery, downright treason to the armed forces of this country.  These are samples of the electioneering tactics we are asked to endorse to-day by the nomination of Deputy de Valera and some of his Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with personal attacks made on me by Deputy MacEntee during the election.  He made a similar attack here on a previous occasion, but as he was then replying I had not an opportunity of answering.  Again, with that Billingsgate type of conduct and language he saw fit to repeat it during the election. Deputy MacEntee said that I was in the British service and that I was fed and clad by the British.  The statements were published in the daily newspapers.  I leave it to the good sense of the House to judge the type of delicate language used by this prospective Government Minister, but I want to tell the House the facts.  On a previous occasion Deputy MacEntee said that I wore a British uniform. The House should know the facts about that, too.  When I was 13 years of age, in fact when I was a week under 13; the eldest of a family of eight, my father being unemployed, I saw an advertisement at the Labour Exchange in Lord Edward Street stating that a telegraph messenger was wanted.  I answered the advertisement and was asked to sit for an examination. I passed the examination and I was appointed a telegraph messenger at 3/6d. per week, and I got a uniform as well.  After about 12 months I got 5/- per week.  I continued in that position until I sat for an examination as learner which I passed and I subsequently became a sorting clerk and telegraphist.  Deputy Little can consult the files of the Post Office which will confirm my statement.  I occupied that position until 1923 when, at the unanimous request of my colleagues organised in an Irish Trade Union, I resigned from the Post Office service. That fact will also be on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I then became secretary to a trade union.  When I retired I could have done so under Article 10 of the Treaty and got a pension.  I declined to retire under Article 10 of the Treaty, because <Col N="62" /> in order to do so I would have to say I was retiring because the British were leaving and an Irish Government was established here.  I refused to do that and I walked out of the Post Office without any pension.  That was my association with the British service. Deputies can see that it was not a very exalted one&mdash;a telegraph messenger at 3/6 per week.  There are many decent men in the British service. Many decent men in this country were in the British service.  I was a telegraph messenger in an Irish service.  It is only the inferior and filthy mind of Deputy MacEntee that could regard a telegraph messenger in the City of Dublin before 1922 as being a British civil servant.  He was an Irish lad serving the Irish people, and it is only the diseased outlook of Deputy MacEntee that would have put the construction that he did on that.  Michael Collins was in the British Civil Service, and he was a thousand times a better man than Deputy MacEntee. Roger Casement was in it, Erskine Childers was in it and Robert Barton was in it, some of them wearing the British uniform and, in a military sense, took the Oath of Allegiance to British.  I never did.  These are the facts.  I hope that Deputy MacEntee will, at least, have the decency to tell the truth about the matter the next time he talks.  Maybe that is too much to expect from him.</P>
    <P>In Deputy MacEntee's area during the election, the loud-speaker vans that I have indicated already were sent around blaring out exhortations to the people to vote Fianna Fáil and save from slaughter their wives and children, not to turn this country into a blood bath, and that only the return of a Fianna Fáil Government with an over-all majority could save this country from involvement in war.  But these speeches make very hollow reading now.  Do they not make mischievous reading now?  Fianna Fáil got 225,000 less votes than all the other Parties put together.  Does that mean that this country has abandoned neutrality? Does that mean that we are going to have a blood bath?  Does that mean that this country is going to be involved in war?  Of course it does not. There are as good Irishmen in the <Col N="63" /> other Parties in this House as there are in the Fianna Fáil Party.  Every Party in this House wants to keep the country out of war.  It would not matter if Fianna Fáil went out of existence to-morrow, this country would not be precipitated into war. This country will maintain its neutrality.  Even if Fianna Fáil is a minority Party, so far as the entire electorate of the country is concerned, every Party in the country and every elector in it will rally behind any Government that is in power in order to keep this country out of the blood bath which is taking place in Europe to-day.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House further.  I wanted to nail some of those lies&mdash;filthy, slanderous lies&mdash;that ought not to be uttered by anyone who has any regard for decency and any regard for truth.  I feel sure that some of the decent members on the Fianna Fáil Benches must abhor these wild, reckless and irresponsible statements made by a prospective Minister whose only contribution to the affairs of this House has been to make similar reckless statements before.  I am opposed to the Taoiseach's team because it includes, as I have said, the name of Deputy MacEntee.  The Labour Party is opposed to the team because it includes the name of Deputy MacEntee.  I think that the Taoiseach could render no better service to public life in this country than to get rid of Deputy MacEntee out of his Party&mdash;in any case out of the Government&mdash;and if he does elections in Ireland in the future will be conducted free of that Billingsgate type of conduct which Deputy MacEntee introduced into the last election and introduces into every controversy in which he is engaged in this country.</P>

      <P>I want to make it plain that as far as our Party is concerned, we have come into being chiefly on account of the unsatisfactory attitude of the Minister for Agriculture in the past towards the rural population.  As a body, we protest against the policy adopted by the Minister in that direction during the last ten years.  We expect that for the future there will be a generous, an intensive, change for the betterment of agriculture.  I want to make it plain that, as far as we are concerned anyhow, the support of our Party will be for the man who was selected as Taoiseach by the House to-day.  On him lies the responsibility of government, and responsibility as regards the conduct, etc., of his Ministers. While that duty has been placed upon his shoulders, and because of the fact that we expect a change from the past, I want to assure the House that we will not take any part in voting against the nominations of the man who has been entrusted with the duty of forming a Government.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is entitled to select his own generals, but in my opinion he has not selected enough.  I should like to hear him say that he proposed to appoint a food controller and a Minister for Mercantile Marine.  I should also like to hear him say that he proposed to appoint a Minister for Employment, and to drop altogether the word &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo;.  I think that in these three spheres there would be work for three new Ministers.  In the past Ministers may have been overworked. If it was overwork that was responsible, <Col N="65" /> then the three matters to which I have referred were very much neglected in the past.  We all know that in the future employment will be the biggest thing that any Government will have to plan for.  We know that at the present time 100,000 of our people are earning their living in other lands.  So far, I have not heard that any plans had been made to provide for them when they return home. Whatever Department will have that responsibility, whether it will be the Department of Local Government and Public Health or the Cabinet itself, I hope that it will abolish the means test that is at present being applied to widows' pensions, to old age pensions and to those receiving home assistance from boards of assistance.  I ask that there should be a change of policy in that respect, and a broader mind and a bigger outlook when dealing with people requiring assistance either from the Government or from the public authorities.  We have heard of cases of this kind.  A son goes away and joins the British Army, leaving his mother an allowance of 7/- a week.

    <P>I do not think the Taoiseach has appointed sufficient Ministers to deal with all these matters.  It is not my intention to oppose his selection, but I would ask for a change of outlook on the part of most of the Ministers in dealing with matters which Deputies bring before them.  If there is any man in the House who has reason to think that Ministers were hostile to him and made efforts to sneer at him solely because he brought cases that seemed small to their notice, I am that man, but I think the Taoiseach is entitled to select his own generals for the future carrying on of the country, and it is not my intention to oppose them.  I do not propose to go into the details of the various complaints one had to bring forward in days gone by, but the Minister for Defence might deal a little better with soldiers' wives in respect of the allowances he gives them. The Minister for Education might also deal a little better with them in relation to the application of the free <Col N="66" /> schoolbooks scheme.  The children of these people should not be deprived of them because their fathers are in State employment.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of censorship, of which I have myself been a victim. When I raised the matter of grievances which were worth while raising, in order to force the Government to remedy them, the censorship was immediately applied.  I do not know the reason for that action, but every member of the House should have the right to bring forward the grievances of any individual in his constituency or outside it, without being treated in the sneering manner in which some Ministers deal with them at question time. Most of the older Deputies know that I do not indulge in long speeches and that I carefully prepare questions with a view to getting Ministers to remedy grievances.  I hope there will be a change of front in this matter and that there will be a little more courtesy, which costs nothing, shown to the ordinary back-bencher, both in debate and at question time.</P>

      <P>This House in its wisdom, or lack of wisdom, has decided to appoint Deputy Eamon de Valera as An Taoiseach.  On Deputy Eamon de Valera rests the responsibility now for the formation of the Government, and, as An Taoiseach, he has presented us with a list of Ministers whom he proposes to appoint as his Government. We have had during the past years experiences of the actions and inactions of these Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We know their shortcomings and we know their faults.  We know how the Department of Agriculture, under the guidance of Dr. James Ryan as Minister for Agriculture, has succeeded in completely, or almost completely, destroying the main branches of the agricultural industry, We know how the Minister for Supplies, the man who is also Minister for Industry and Commerce, has failed ignominiously to make provision for the needs of our people in this emergency. Knowing these things, we cannot but feel bitterly disappointed by the team which the Taoiseach has selected.  We <Col N="67" /> feel that if he had gone to his extreme back bench, he would probably have found a more efficient body of Ministers to carry on the government of the country, but on the shoulders of the Taoiseach now rests responsibility for the success or failure of this Government. On his shoulders that responsibility will be firmly placed by our people and it is his funeral if these Ministers fail as they have failed in the past.</P>
      <P>We have listened to-day to an embittered debate arising out of things said and done during the election campaign. I am one of those who had hoped that when the results of the election were known to the public, the election campaign would be over.  We all, as responsible citizens, realised fully the danger of holding an election in this time of serious emergency.  We all, as responsible citizens, felt rather happy that the election had passed over without any serious trouble.  We all, as responsible citizens, hoped that with the end of the election and with the election of a new Dáil, we would all settle down together to work for the upbuilding of the country.  Having placed on the shoulders of the Taoiseach the responsibility for carrying on the Government of the country, we do not propose, as a Party, to interfere with his choice of Ministers. We leave it to him to select the men who he thinks will assist him and to bear the responsibility if they fail to give him the assistance to which he is entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a new Party, coming into this House without any feelings of hatred, spite, malice or bitterness, we appeal to the older Deputies to forget these feelings.  We appeal to each and every Deputy to do his part in contributing to the solution of the economic problems which face us.  We have been taunted here that we are afraid to vote on this question.  We are not afraid to take a decision on any question which comes before the House.  Whatever decisions we take will be taken with calm deliberation and not in any heat or passion.  We shall weigh and take into consideration not only what people will say about us and what <Col N="68" /> attempts may be made to misrepresent our attitude, but the more important issue also-what effect our decision will have on the carrying on of the administration of the country.  That is, and shall be, our main consideration, and on any and every occasion on which we are called upon to vote in this House, we shall frankly and freely consider all the issues involved, and not only the immediate issues but the more far-reaching issues which concern the welfare of our people as a whole.  We are not going to have this country upset or plunged into dissension and division in order to score any party strategic advantage.  We shall at all times place the interests of our country first and, because we intend to do so, we are not opposing this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been my privilege to be a member of this House for about 21 years.  During that time I have had to listen to a great many speeches from various parts of the House, but I do not think I ever listened to two speeches more full of humbug and dishonesty than the two speeches we have had from the Leader and the Deputy-Leader of the new Farmers' Party.  We have been told: &ldquo;We will place on the shoulders of Deputy de Valera the responsibility for Dr. Ryan's sacrificing of the agricultural community.&rdquo;  That is the very thing you have refused to do.  You refused either to place the responsibility upon his shoulders or to take it off them.  Deputy Cogan denounces Deputy Dr. Ryan and he denounces all the other Ministers.  He tells us here that agriculture has been ground under their heels and that he has been protesting for a number of years.  He said that if the Taoiseach had gone to the back benches and took the first dozen members there he would have got much more efficient men than the men he proposed.  Did not Deputy Cogan know well, will he deny that he knew, when this House was considering who was to be the head of the new Government, that Deputy de Valera was going to put back the very Ministers whose names he has put before the House?  Did not Deputy Cogan and his Leader know, when they refused to take any part in appointing <Col N="69" /> the Head of the Government here, that Deputy Dr. Ryan was to be the new Minister for Agriculture, if Deputy de Valera was elected as Taoiseach? &ldquo;We have the courage to take decisions.&rdquo; Deputies on the benches over there said: &ldquo;We are putting forward sufficient candidates to form a Government. We are asking the people to give us their support.  If they give us their support, we will form a Government.&rdquo; They came into this House, having got the people's support, and they were faced with the first and most important task any Parliament can be faced with&mdash;the formation of a Government&mdash;and they immediately set out to disfranchise completely the people, who sent them here by refusing to vote one way or the other.  They washed their hands completely of any responsibility and told us: &ldquo;Deputy de Valera can go ahead and appoint Deputy Dr. Ryan, and Deputy Dr. Ryan still can go on trampling on agriculture and ruining the main industry, but you cannot blame us.&rdquo; They did not tell him to do it, but they made it possible for him to do it; they made it inevitable.</P>
      <P>Other Deputies on the Farmers' Benches, or indeed on the Labour Benches, talk about Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy MacEntee as inefficient Ministers.  But the Labour Deputies knew that Deputy MacEntee was to be a member of Deputy de Valera's Government.  Still they would not vote against its being made possible for Deputy de Valera to appoint a Government which would include Deputy MacEntee.  It is all humbug.  It is hypocritical to talk in that way.  You are either for or against.  If you are against Deputy Dr. Ryan, Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Lemass, and all the others, you should start at the beginning. You should be against the man at the head whom you knew was going to appoint them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to Deputies on the Farmers' Benches and on the Labour Benches that in the recent campaign they went out against Fianna Fáil and that Fianna Fáil went out against all the others.  Is not that so?  Deputy Cogan shakes his head.  Deputy de Valera and the other Ministers and the <Col N="70" /> people on the back benches said: &ldquo;There is no use in having any Government except a purely Fianna Fáil Government headed by Eamon de Valera.  The Farmers' Party is no good; the Labour Party is no good; the Fine Gael Party is no good; the Independents are no good.  The only Party which will do any good for this country will be the Fianna Fáil Party.&rdquo; The Farmers' Party, the Labour Party, the Independents, and Fine Gael said to the people: &ldquo;If you want really to blast any chance of this country surviving you will send back the Fianna Fáil Government again.&rdquo;  The Farmers' Party and the Labour Party, having secured the people's votes by false pretences, come in here and refuse to carry out the first responsibility they are faced with, to vote either for or against Fianna Fáil, to vote for a Party Government or a national Government.  They refuse to vote either one way or the other.  That is all nonsense and humbug and will not get one Party or the other very far, either inside or outside this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Deputy who has just sat down, one would believe that the Farmers' Party went out in the election against Fianna Fáil and only against Fianna Fáil.  Coming from South Mayo and as one of the men who contested that election, I should like to make it quite clear that we went out against Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, both together. Indeed the administration of Fine Gael or, as they were known as, Cumann na nGaedheal, was certainly no credit to this country.  The same applies to Fianna Fáil.  Looking at the result of the election, every sound-thinking man must realise that the people put back Fianna Fáil as the strongest Party.  They did not achieve a majority, but they went very near it. For that reason we felt that it was on them the responsibility must fall for forming a Government and not on Fine Gael.  Anybody who looks at the Fine Gael Benches can see that the best men have been defeated.  Where are there any men capable of forming a Government?  They accuse us of being afraid to vote either for or against the <Col N="71" /> Taoiseach.  They voted against him because they knew that they would not be responsible for their actions.  We have something more than that on our shoulders.  Not only have we a responsibility in this House, but we have a responsibility to the people who put us here.  The people who put us here want a stable Government.  It is only another catch-cry when they talk about forming a national Government. They have no programme, they have no policy.  If they were really in earnest would not they have come to us and come to some agreement before coming in here?  How could we know their minds or how could they know ours?  They who talk about a national Government never approached either the Labour Party or Clann na Talmhan.  The obvious conclusion that any sensible man would come to was that they were going to allow the Taoiseach to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from all that, I should like to emphasise that we are not at all satisfied with the present Ministers, particularly the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Ryan.  He was down in my county during the election campaign and he tried to make a case for the killing of the pig trade, the paramount industry in Connaught, the only industry on which the people in the West of Ireland had to depend for a livelihood, apart from having to emigrate and seek one in Great Britain.  He told us that the scarcity of food forced the Government to take the high hand and reduce the pig industry, not only in Connaught but throughout Ireland, in order to save the food for the people.  It is my belief, and the belief of every man, young and old, that the Government did not go about things properly during their ten years of administration. The same blame can be put on the shoulders of Fine Gael who held office for ten or 11 years.  Both of them failed to place the men on the land. They failed to distribute the land of this country amongst the men capable of working it.  If they had done that, if they had divided the land into 30 or 40-acre farms and given it to the men who are to-day emigrating in hundreds <Col N="72" /> to Lincolnshire and Yorkshire to work for farmers there, they would be able to use the laidhe and the spade and the plough; they would need no tractors or oil.  We would have the material. They are Irishmen who would give it to us and there would be no need for tillage inspectors and for waste of money on a lot of paraphernalia and red tape.  The land would be cultivated and we would have wheat and beet and all the necessaries of life, not only for human beings but for animals.</P>
    <P>The facts are quite different.  The land is there yet.  In my own county we have the lords and the noblemen, the marquis of this and the marquis of that, the lord of this and the lord of that.  What have they done with them? Who is to be blamed?  The Minister for Lands, the man responsible for the division of the land, the Government in general.  When I say the Government, I attach the same blame to you, gentlemen, and to your colleagues who have been removed from this House, because you and they failed in an obvious duty.  You cannot deny it.</P>
    <P>This is not a time for making rash statements, and neither is it a time for laughing.  You may think I am a novice, but I may assure you that I have come from the country, from a farm of land.  My father earned his living on the land and he brought me up on the land and I know what I am talking about.  I know the conditions which confront the Irish people, those of them who have to live on the land. I know what they need.  I know what the Government of this country could do for them and, if you only did it and ceased bickering among yourselves, there would be less discontent among the farming population.</P>
    <P>What are you drawing your salaries for?  What are you taxing the people for?  You are drawing your £480 a year from them and you should do something for them in return.  Are we here merely to talk about what happened in Limerick, in South Mayo or across the Liffey?  I know we all flung mud in the election campaign.  I did it, and so did Deputies on the other benches. But we are here to work in the interest of every citizen in the country and not in the interest of any group or party. I submit that it is our duty to get all <Col N="73" /> the available land divided and put our people into comfortable holdings.  It is our duty to keep them at home, to give them some incentive, some encouragement, to remain here.  Give them the food they require and the wages necessary to keep them in reasonable comfort.</P>
    <P>What are the conditions under which some of our people are living to-day? If I go to sell a pig in the local fair or market and the buyer offers me 2/- above the controlled price, that will not be permitted.  The Government have officials on the alert and those officials will tap me and the buyer on the shoulder and prosecute us if I get 2/- or 3/- above the controlled price.  I would have to bring that pig to the factory and sell it for a little over 1/- a pound.  At the local shop you would pay 2/6d. a pound for the bacon from that very same animal.  Is it any wonder that Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael Deputies have not been returned with a mandate to rule the country?  The reason is that the people of Ireland are fed-up with both your Parties.  They feel that you are not alive to their interests, that you have cut yourselves adrift, that you do not understand what they want.  By your actions must we judge you.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Byrne talking about the need for a Minister in connection with a mercantile marine, I felt that we would much prefer a Minister for Forestry.  I believe that such a ministry would be much more valuable in an agricultural country such as ours, at the present time, anyhow.  I am sure that Deputies Ruttledge and Kilroy will bear me out when I say that between Ballina and Belmullet there are thousands of acres of little use for anything except afforestation. Just look at the employment that afforestation would give.  Would not our youth be better employed planting trees that, some 30 years from now, would be extremely valuable?  Those trees would furnish employment in our saw mills; the timber could be used in many ways, and in this connection unemployment would be considerably relieved.  Instead of the land being utilised for tree-planting purposes, it is allowed to remain idle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> In the County of Mayo there are at least 100,000 acres of unproductive land, and I suggest that that land would be well employed growing trees. Taking Ireland as a whole, there are 5,000,000 acres suitable only for afforestation.  If some of our young men were employed draining these areas and planting them, it would be far better than watching them going over to John Bull to live in barns and to pull beet, gather wheat and pick potatoes.  We see them every day going over to the country that many of our people still look upon as our only enemy.  Do you not think that it would be much better to encourage them to remain at home?</P>
    <P>Our Ministers should shoulder their responsibilities.  They claim to know all about the problem and they told us at one time that they had a plan to solve it.  They told us in South Mayo, through their press and radio, that they had a plan, and yet they have not made any effort to operate that plan.</P>

If one looks around in order to see what he has achieved during the past ten years, one cannot but be disappointed. I am not trying to hurt the gentleman who is responsible for the Department. I could go back to the time of the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration and point out that they did not do anything very effective either.  I am not here to blame the Minister of this Party or the Minister of an earlier Administration.  As a matter of fact, the two Parties are very much alike and they merely want to have an occasional argument&mdash;that is my conclusion. There is one other point with which I should like to deal, and it relates to old age pensions.</P>

Of course, the best chair was given to the official and there were apologies if it was not a good one.  All sorts of questions would be asked.  &ldquo;Have you a son in England?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&ldquo;Does he write to you?&rdquo;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  Those are the questions they were asked.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>The means test is introduced and the result is that they cut down the pension by a few shillings. Surely an old age pensioner, who has given such long service to the country, is entitled to better consideration? I suggest that the old age pensioners have given service far beyond any Army officer or any Minister, who is put in for five years and is then chucked out by the people; far beyond any post office clerk or any civil servants. I suggest that the man who tills the soil and who works 10 or 11 hours a day from Sunday to Sunday is certainly worthy of at least 10/- a week in his feeble days.  If such a man is not considered worthy of 10/- a week in his old age, then I say our so-called national Government is not worthy of the name.  In such circumstances we should have no Government here at all, and we should hand back our administration to an alien Government, because they had some respect for the aged when they gave them 10/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imagine any national Government here selecting the old age pensioners in order to start economies.  Those on <Col N="77" /> both sides of the House who did so should be ashamed of themselves.  Is it any wonder that patriotism, sound civic spirit and regard for duty cannot be found in parts of Ireland to-day?  That would not be the case, I suggest, if our people were properly treated, if they were looked after in their old age, fed and clothed, and if the workers were paid a living wage. If all the available land were divided, if we had proper drainage and forestry throughout the country, suitable pensions for the aged and infirm and reasonable allowances for widows and orphans&mdash;not the miserable pittances that are now being given them&mdash;then there would be a hopeful future.  As things are, Deputies should be ashamed to put out their hands for the £40 a month&mdash;if they have any shame at all.  My firm conviction is that they have not any shame.</P>

Really, it is fantastic, having listened to the very proper remonstrances of Clann na Talmhan during the election campaign because of the outrage perpetrated on the farming community by the Department of Agriculture, to hear the leader of that Party saying that he puts the whole responsibility over on the Taoiseach's shoulders.

The motion is to the effect that Dáil Eireann approves of the nomination by the Taoiseach of, amongst others, Deputy Ryan as Minister <Col N="78" /> for Agriculture.  The leader of Clann na Talmhan and his associates are members of Dáil Eireann.  We are a sovereign Assembly and ours is the power.  The Taoiseach does not run this Parliament.  The purpose for which the Ceann Comhairle sits in the Chair is to ensure that every Deputy will get his constitutional rights as against the Executive, that we shall be free to say and do what each one of us thinks right without any regard to what the Executive may think.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cafferky, in a very eloquent speech&mdash;and I think Deputies will join with me in congratulating him&mdash;dwelt at some length upon the shortcomings of the Minister for Agriculture.  I quite agree.  I think the Minister for Agriculture must be one of the worst Ministers the world has ever seen.  He is unique in that respect.  As a museum exhibit I would be glad to give him £1,700 a year if he would sit in the museum; but he will not go there; if you let him loose he will continue to sit in Merrion Street and play havoc with our agricultural industry. All that Deputies here are asking Clann na Talmhan is that they will do their part in preventing this man from running berserk in agricultural matters.</P>
      <P>He began his Ministerial career by slaughtering calves.  Now he has slaughtered all the pigs, and if you give him another five years he will finish the fowl.  There are a few still clucking around the country, but if you give Deputy Ryan another five years I think we may confidently assume that fowl in Ireland will be as rare as an auk, and we will be told, as the last fowl goes down the drain, that it is all being done to preserve foodstuffs for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt the bulk of the members of Clann na Talmhan agree with what I am saying.  Deputy Cogan used to spend hours telling us of the iniquities of Deputy Ryan and he would be all hot and bothered if there was any danger of getting squeezed out of the debate when Deputy Ryan's Department was under discussion. Now he is the deputy-leader of the Party and, by my halidom, he is afraid to vote against him.  What is <Col N="79" /> frightening this valiant man?  This is a free country and Deputies can vote as they wish.  Nobody will trip you up when you proceed to vote.  Anybody will show you the way.  We have ushers and every modern convenience, and we have &ldquo;Níls&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tás&rdquo; there.  Do not take example by the Labour Party.  The farmers are a cut above them.  They have been wobbling Here a long time, one day on de Valera's band wagon and the next day off.  The members of Clann na Talmhan should make a better show than the Labour Party.  On one issue they ought to be above suspicion, and that is their stand for agriculture and for those who live by it.  Is there a single member of Clann na Talmhan who believes that it is in the interest of agriculture that Deputy Ryan should be Minister for Agriculture?  Does any one of them believe that?</P>

      <P>Here is the issue&mdash;the proposal that Deputy Ryan be nominated Minister for Agriculture. Have the members of the Party the courage to vote against it?  These are the men who talk about professional politicians.  At least we hard-bitten chaws are not professional weathercocks. Professional politicians! I have learned more about the basest kind of politics from the leader of Clann na Talmhan in the last four hours than I ever learned in my whole life.  I am a politician; I am proud of being a politician, and I do not apologise for being one, nor do I apologise for getting £480 for giving service to the people as a politician.  I give darned good value for every pound, but if the leader of Clann na Talmhan is going to go on, afraid to move out of his bench, then he ought not to draw a single cheque. But he will draw it punctually every month&mdash;and more power to his elbow. Let him come out of the rabbit hole, and be a man and not a rabbit.  Does he stand for putting in Dr. James Ryan as Minister for Agriculture?  That is what I want to know.  If he does, it does not matter whether he sits there or trots into the division lobby after Taoiseach de Valera, but if he does <Col N="80" /> not, let him come into the other division lobby, and show that he does not approve of Dr. Ryan as Minister for Agriculture.  We do not, never have, and never will, approve of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go down the whole string of Ministers.  They are a poor lot.  What else do you expect?  Sometimes I am a little impatient when I hear Deputies on this side wax eloquent on the poverty of the material the Taoiseach has to dispose of.  But, the position is that no man with an independent mind could work with Taoiseach de Valera, and the Taoiseach knows it, and that is why he announced to-day that he would not sit in a national Government. The first pre-requisite for membership of a government under Taoiseach de Valera is that you are a yes-man.  In the heel of the hunt, whatever you say does not matter.  What Taoiseach de Valera says is what you must do.  Look at them!  A poor lot, but as good as you will get on that basis.  Any honest or dignified man would not be prepared to give a preliminary undertaking that in the last analysis he will do what he is told. Honourable men will co-operate up to the limit of their capacity.  If an honourable man cannot see eye to eye he will go to his leader and get a sympathetic hearing, always assuming that you have a reasonable leader, but if you serve under Taoiseach de Valera, he will have his own way.  As I said, they are a poor lot, but the poorest of them all is to be saddled on the farmers. Yet Clann na Talmhan are afraid to vote against him.  Why are you afraid to go on record as saying that you do not believe James Ryan is fit for the position of Minister for Agriculture? Is it because Seán T. O'Kelly is the grandest Minister for Finance in Europe, or that Seán Lemass is Minister for Supplies-the man who this morning took the taxes off 20 articles of which there are no supplies available, but who prevented the articles from coming into the country when supplies were to be had freely&mdash; the man who refused to allow in agricultural machinery, and now when there is not a wheel rake or agricultural machine to be got, when everybody except Seán Lemass knows there is not one to be got, tells you to go and <Col N="81" /> buy all you can?  Is it Frank Aiken you have so close to your hearts?  Do you admire his administration of the censorship?  Do you think the country could not get on without it?</P>
    <P>Is it Deputy Thomas Derrig you do not want to lose?  Deputy Cafferky did not know he existed, so is it for that shadow you want to vote?  He has been functioning so peacefully that he never registered in Deputy Cafferky's mind at all.  Do you think you could survive without Deputy Boland?  And Deputy Traynor&mdash;the Army would still function if you got rid of him, and Deputy Little&mdash;the telephone wires will not fall down if he goes.  Deputy Seán Moylan has not got there yet. As for Deputy MacEntee, the Labour Party has said mouthfuls about him, and Deputy MacEntee will, no doubt, have other mouthfuls to say about them.</P>
    <P>I rather agree with Deputy Cafferky &mdash;I do not believe in rehashing the abuse that went on at the election. Personally, it rolls off my back like water off a duck.  In Monaghan, Deputy Ward said that whoever voted for me voted for bloodshed in Ireland, yet Deputy Rice and myself sailed peacefully through the constituency, and when it is all over it does not cut much ice.  But here, what we are voting for is whether Dr. James Ryan is going to be Minister for Agriculture.  Now, there you are, the whole lot of you. I expected to see volcanoes of energy in Clann na Talmhan&mdash;are you all going to die so early in your career?  Come, do not get extinct before your first eruption.</P>

      <P>Is there a single man in that Party who believes James Ryan ought to be Minister?  I do not think there is.  I am asking their leader to stand for what he believes in and to make his position clear on this, without trying to shake off the responsibility that sits upon his Party, to tell us, yes or no, are they for or against Dr. Ryan as Minister for Agriculture?  I am against him without reservation or qualification whatever, and I speak from ten years' bitter experience of his disastrous career.  I will vote against him.  What is Clann na Talmhan going to do?  Is it conceivably possible that they are going to sit silent and do nothing?  I find it hard to believe it. I find it hard, after Deputy Cafferky's <Col N="83" /> speech, to believe that they are disclaiming responsibility for five years. They cannot get out of it.  They have their duties to this House, and to the country, and the question is: are they for or against Dr. Ryan?  The Division Lobby will tell.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Farmers' Party to-day, because I had some hope they would come out for the farmers.  Some of them complain that they listened to dirty speeches all day &mdash;nothing but mud-slinging.  There was no mud-slinging from this side of the House.  Deputy Cosgrave opened the debate by plainly pointing out that he would be agreeable to the Taoiseach's selection of the Ministers if he would make a change.  I think that was an easy way out, and that the Taoiseach could have met him in that way.  I know the Farmers' Party are new and will have to be forgiven a lot of things, but I am greatly afraid they are tied on to the tails of Fianna Fáil.  Their leader I never saw until to-day, but I heard during the election campaign that he was a supporter of Fianna Fáil up to 1938, and, therefore, I concluded he was one of the men who subscribed to Fianna Fáil all during the economic war, and by doing so, left the farmers of Ireland in a position they will never forget in this generation.  I am afraid he is branded still with that tar brush, and I hope for the sake of the Farmers' Party, the men behind him, that they will get rid of that tar brand because if they do not, it will be a poor day for the farmers of Ireland.  One of their speakers complained to-day that he did not agree with either Party, either Cumann na nGaedheal or Fianna Fáil.  He says that Cumann na nGaedheal did a lot of damage to the country and to the farmers' position. I say that if the Farmers' Party are able to put up a man as Minister for Agriculture fit to walk in the shoe-prints of the late Paddy Hogan, Ireland will never forget the Farmers' Party.  The policy of the late Paddy Hogan was &ldquo;one more blade of grass, one more sow, one more cow and one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that any member of the Farmers' Party should be ashamed to <Col N="84" /> criticise the efforts of the late Mr. Hogan as Minister for Agriculture. It was a sad day for Ireland when Deputy Dr. Ryan was appointed Minister for Agriculture.  He has left agriculture in a position that it can be said that not since Cromwell has it suffered more damage.  He did more damage to agriculture than Cromwell ever did to this country.  If the Farmers' Party support the nomination of Dr. Ryan as Minister for Agriculture they are doing a poor day's work for the farmers of Ireland.  Nobody who knew the condition of the farming industry in 1930 or 1931 would imagine that the day would come in Ireland when the City of Dublin would be without butter, bacon and potatoes. Dr. Ryan was to blame for all that, but yet they say they will vote for the Taoiseach's nominations.  They have now a chance to make the Taoiseach change his Minister for Agriculture.  I say in no bitter way that I implore them to take action now while they can.  They have their chance now. Not for five years again, if they are going to be tarred with the same brush as their leader, will they get the chance to change these Ministers, and I implore them now for the farmers' sake to act when they have the opportunity of doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the privilege of serving under two Prime Ministers in this Dáil&mdash;Mr. Cosgrave and Mr. de Valera, the present Taoiseach&mdash;but never in all my experience of these two administrations did I feel so deeply humiliated as to-night at the exhibition made by the new Farmers' Party.  The Party which made its entry into this Dáil with such high hopes, the Party from whom so much was expected, appears to be a Party of negation, and of negation only.  I do not know whether the farmers in County Cork or in County Kerry are a more intelligent body of men than the farmers from other parts of the country.  My association with farmers. I may say, goes back a long way.  I am almost in daily contact with them, but I must say I was amazed at the speeches to which I listened to-night from three members of the present Farmers' Party, one a deputy leader, <Col N="85" /> the other occupying the position of vice-chairman, or some office of that kind, and the third an ordinary backbencher. I say again that I have never heard a worse exhibition in my life than that which I heard to-night from the new Farmers' Party.  Is it a fact that during all these years the farmers have been telling &ldquo;fibs&rdquo;, when preaching to the whole of us that they had been robbed right, left and centre by the Minister for Agriculture?  I ask Deputy Halliden&mdash;he knows very well what I am saying&mdash;is it not a fact that farmers generally have been complaining that the policy of the Government and the Minister sponsoring that policy were ruining agriculture?  Yet we have the spectacle of these men coming in now to support the nomination of Dr. Ryan as Minister for Agriculture.  I feel that there will be opportunities at a later stage for criticising the policy of the various Departments and then, of course, we shall see what the farmers will have to say to that, but so far as I have listened here this evening, I can only say that the Deputies of the Farmers' Party who have spoken are a disgrace to the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of matter concerning the recent elections campaign has been introduced into this debate but I do not propose to go into that.  I cannot help reiterating that I had great anticipations that we would hear something of a constructive character from the Farmers' Party but, so far as I have seen from the contributions here to-night, they are a Party of negation. We have the Department of Lands and Fisheries which is also in control of afforestation; yet we have a Deputy coming into this House as a farmer who, apparently, did not even possess that knowledge.  In my view that Party does not at all represent the farmers of this country.  I have seen Farmers' Parties come and go in this country but this is the worst lot that ever came into this House.  Agriculture, as has been often pointed out, is the main industry of this country and one of which we should all feel proud.  I have met farmers from different parts of the world, French farmers, Scandinavian farmers and Polish farmers, and I always found that they were a <Col N="86" /> body of intelligent men, men who were proud of their calling.  Having listened to the speeches here to-night, I can only say that I do not blame the far mers in this country for having an inferiority complex when this is the type of representative they send in here.  These are their picked men.  I do not wonder at all at the poverty inflicted on the farmers when these Deputies are supposed to be the picked men of the farming community sent in here to represent agriculture.  After hearing them to-night, I can only say that they are the most inept and the most fatuous lot of men I ever came across in the whole of my life.  The Farmers' Party will get ample opportunity at a later stage to discuss the various Departments of Government.  I do not propose to follow the example of some other speakers who referred to these various other Departments, but I think some indication should be given by the Farmers' Party as to their future policy concerning the Department in which they should be mainly interested.  I came into the House full of anticipation that I would hear something constructive from the Farmers' Party but as far as I can see they are a Party of negation, who are not likely to be of any great assistance in restoring prosperity to agriculture.</P>

That Party, which has absorbed the independence and freedom of three Farmers' Parties in my time, went to the electorate, and in spite of having absorbed three Farmers' Parties they came back here with 32 members out of 138.  Now they are endeavouring to absorb the independence of another Farmers' Party which has come in here.  I welcome the presence of a Farmers' Party here, if it were only to criticise agricultural Estimates, because that Party opposite has failed as an Opposition.  Deputy Cogan and a few other farmers and myself were the only critics who gave any help to the Minister for Agriculture in the past five years in regard to his policy towards the farmers of this country. That Party over there counted for nothing.  Deputy Dillon has a crow to pluck with Deputy James Ryan as Minister for Agriculture.  He has a crow to pluck with him and a personal attack to make on him, because Deputy James Ryan was the one man who prevented Deputy Dillon's plan from coming into operation here.  Deputy James Ryan was the man who succeeded in inducing the farmers of this country to grow enough wheat to feed our people, so that we would not be forced, as Deputy Dillon hoped, to go to the foreigner and pledge our freedom for bread for our people.</P>
      <P>I am a farmer, and I know my duty to the farmers whom I represent.  I have done that duty at all times, both in Opposition and as a member of the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> Government Party.  What are the farmers invited to vote for to-day? They are invited to vote for the so-called national Government over there, who had 20,000 acres of wheat growing in this country when Deputy James Ryan took over, and who in 1932 had the price of barley in this country at 13/- a barrel.  Those are the people who want to absorb the independence of the Farmers' Party which has come in here.  As I said, I am proud to see a Farmers' Party here, and I welcome them here as farmers.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the killing of the pig trade.  What was the position in that regard?  Pre-war, there was imported into this country something like 500,000 tons of maize and maize meal, in addition to wheat pulp for pig feeding.  The only thing we had to replace that were 127,000 additional acres of oats and barley. That meant that, if all of that 127,000 acres were to be fed to pigs, all you could fatten in this country would be one pig out of every five you fattened previously.  There is no use in talking nonsense about the killing of the pig trade.  I do not blame Deputy James Dillon for his attitude when he thinks of the way he was swallowed up when he came in here as a member of the moryah Independent Farmers' Party. I have seen other Farmers' Parties swallowed up here in turn, and, as a farmer, my advice to the Farmers Party is to remain independent, to see that the farmers get a square deal here from whoever is Minister for Agriculture. They should be independent of all Parties, in order to see that the farmers gets a square deal.  Then, when they see a wrong being done to the farmers, they can vote against it, and when they see the farmers getting a square deal they can vote for it. To-day, the job of this Dáil is to appoint a Government, and elect the head of that Government.  Apparently, Deputy Dillon thinks it is his duty to create in this country a state of chaos. He apparently thinks it is his duty, after the Taoiseach has been elected, to see there will be a combine to prevent him from having in his Ministry a team of men on whom he <Col N="91" /> can rely, the men whom he considers the best members of his own Party to carry on the work.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Morrissey make the same speech in this House every year since he was fired out of the Labour Party and crossed over to the new Party.  I have heard the same filthy language hurled by Deputy Morrissey at every new Deputy, whether on these or on opposite benches, who had the independence to stand up and state his views.  Deputy Morrissey is an adept at quibbling.  His Party went out looking for a mandate to form a national Government.  They went out numbering 45 but only 32 came back to a House of 137 Deputies.  Deputy Cafferky described the position.  There is no man on the opposite benches with sufficient intelligence to be captain of a football team not to mention being a Minister in this State.  It is time that someone talked plainly.  I fought an election and when the result was announced I finished with it.  I do not want to carry on the election for the next three years.  That is no use.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, Deputy Norton should not have made the speech he made to-day.  If there is a case to be made he can attack Ministers.  I have attacked them for the past five years. I had to do it because nobody else would attack them.  There was no opposition in this House for the past five years.  When I considered that Ministers acted wrongly towards my constituents I let them know they were not going to do so without criticism. I will do the same in future as I have a duty towards my constituents.  When I see an attempt being made by a bunch of humbugs who endeavour to pillory any Deputy who comes here for the first time I say that that is contemptible, and is only worthy of the mud-slingers who carry it on.  As a farmer, respecting every representative that farmers send to this House I say that so long as they come here to do the nation's work, and to do their duty by the people, they should not be fooled by promises of Ministries from one Party or of places in shadow cabinets from another Party.  We went to <Col N="92" /> the country at this General Election. We faced the people and looked for a majority.  We were more entitled to a majority than anybody else.  We did not get a full majority.</P>

      <P>I do not want to read some of the propaganda that was sent around my constituency.  I want to leave the election behind me.  I do not want to rehash what Labour said, what Fine Gael said, or what the Farmers said in my constituency.  I survived it all.  If any Party wants another round in my constituency I will give it to them any time they like.  What I object to is the scandalous exhibition of mud-slinging in the presence of Deputies who come here for the first time with a mandate from the people to look after the farmers' interests.  They may not agree with the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, or with all that he has done.  At times I did not agree with that policy.  I did not agree last year about the price of beet as I considered that farmers were not getting enough money.  I fought to get them more but while I was doing so the farmers were wiser than I was, because they went in and signed contracts for 52,000 acres of beet at 80/- a ton, the price that the Minister offered.  That proved that the Minister was right and that I was wrong.  We have to look facts in the face.  I am prepared to back those who represent the agricultural community because we sadly need a body of men in the Dáil to fight for agricultural interests.  I am about &ldquo;fed-up&rdquo; fighting alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comparing the present Minister with other Ministers for Agriculture, I say that he has done his duty by the farming community as well as anybody could do it, having regard to the other interests that were at stake.  If I thought otherwise I would say so.  I remember what was said by some Deputies when it was proposed to buy Irish wheat so that the people would have it for their breakfast.  One Deputy said that bread produced from Irish wheat would not be eaten by pigs.  Now that Deputy eats the bread himself and is glad to get it.  That is the kind of opposition <Col N="93" /> the Minister had to face when he endeavoured to have wheat grown here in order to provide bread for the people.  That is the kind of filthy opposition that had to be faced. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney asked that supplies should be brought from America.  In November, 1939, the Deputy said he saw no reason why wheat and petrol could not be brought from America.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>How are they going to replace Deputy Dr. Ryan?  The question at issue now is whether the Taoiseach, the Leader of this House who has been appointed by the Dáil to form a Government, is going to be allowed to pick his team as a Government or not. I had no intention of intervening in the debate.  My only reason for doing so was to protect a body of young men who came into this House for the first time to-day, who came in here green in the usages of debate, and who have had to put up with this line of mud-slinging by past masters of the art like Deputy Dillon and Deputy Morrissey, not forgetting our noble friend, Deputy Anthony from Cork, who set himself out to advise and instruct the farmers of the country in regard to what they ought to do and on their duty.  I think it is unfair, unjust, indecent and rotten for individuals who have been here for 21 or 22 years to attack a group of Deputies the first day they came in here.  Deputy Dillon had a Farmers' Party sitting on the benches opposite. Where is that Party to-day?  If it had done its duty these men need not have come in here.  They have come in because that Farmers' Party was sold out as well as the farmers' interests. There were 12 or 13 in it, and now the whole lot opposite only number 32. There were three Farmers' Parties.  We had Senator Baxter's Party, Mr. Michael Heffernan's Party and the Party of Senator MacDermot and Deputy Dillon.  They are all now in <Col N="94" /> the 32.  I am proud to-day to see a Farmers' Party in this House that apparently is going to do its duty by the agricultural community and that will not be bribed or cajoled by promises from any side.  They are going to stand by the farmers of the country, and God knows the farmers need them.</P>

      <P>After the very dignified statement which we have heard from the Government Benches, I am sure that the Deputies, new and old, in the Farmers' Party feel very comfortable and complimented that they have such a dignified protector.  I should like to bring back the mind of the House from the hysteria, lunacy and recklessness of Deputy Corry to the question that is before it, and to remind Deputies that this is the first night of a new Parliament.  With the world in the midst of war we are being called upon to elect a Government. We appeal to the head of the Government to make some changes, to re-shuffle his Ministers and he will get the support of this Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The head of the Government already elected by the vote of this House claims to be a decent, Christian-minded man.  I have been waiting for him to stand up here or, failing that, to order Deputy Seán MacEntee to stand up in the House and tender an apology for the black-guardly conduct which he carried out during the recent election campaign and to withdraw&mdash;and it is only a manly man who can do it&mdash;the scurrilous, slanderous and libellous allegations which he poured out on the leader and members of this Party during the last general election campaign. If the Taoiseach cannot see his way to do that, well we must come to the conclusion that he is standing over the actions and the words of the man whom he now asks this House to make a Minister in his Government.  I think Deputy Norton made it quite plain from the quotations that he gave to the House, and from what he said, that any man who would be guilty of such conduct during an election campaign, and claiming to be a model Christian and Catholic himself, is not <Col N="95" /> fit to occupy the high office of membership of a Government in a Catholic Christian country.</P>
      <P>The only recommendation that I can see in favour of the men proposed by the Taoiseach is that they can be relied upon, if elected by the House, to act as loyal &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; to the Taoiseach, and to approve by their silence any proposals which he puts before the Cabinet and before this House during the lifetime of this Government.  My limited experience of politics and business has been that the average &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo;, is a man who does not think for himself.  He is a man who is always prepared to throw over his work to be done by somebody else.  That is not the type of man who should be a member of the Government of this country during these critical times.</P>
      <P>I find from my experience of members of this Government during the last 11 years that they have been prepared at all times to use the machinery of State and the taxpayers' money for the purpose of promoting Party interests.  That has been done in a most unscrupulous way by the members of this Government during the recent election campaign.  They have used the radio, the censorship, and the secret service funds to promote Party interests.</P>

      <P>Now, I think it is expected in a country like this where we boast of our high Christian qualifications and religious ideals that at least it should be a qualification of any man who is entitled to claim the position of Minister, that he should be truthful on all occasions, and truthful especially when dealing with public affairs with public men in public places, whether the public places be here in this House or outside this House.  There is plenty of evidence on record to prove that statements have been made in this House in the past by some men who are now being proposed as members of the Cabinet which could not be confirmed by figures or facts.  If these things have been done in the past, and if the Taoiseach admits that they are wrong, can we have an assurance that the same men who are now going to make up the Cabinet for the coming critical years will change their tactics, and will learn how to be truthful when dealing with public matters in a Parliamentary institution?  I have said that from my experience the men whose names are now put forward are &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; who can be relied upon to play the part of &ldquo;yes-men,&rdquo; or whatever part the Taoiseach desires them to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="97" /> The first and most important position in a Cabinet is the position of Minister for Finance and I assume that Deputy Seán T. O Ceallaigh will, in the future, as he was for some years past, be Minister for Finance in the Government.  The success or failure of any government in this or any other country depends upon the mentality, the outlook and the attitude of the Minister for Finance, and the failure of this Government to carry out the policy of self-sufficiency and to carry out the many promises made by Ministers and their spokesmen before they came into office is due to the fact that the Minister for Finance has not faced up to his responsibilities. Deputy Sean T. O Ceallaigh is personally a decent man and I have nothing to say against him.  He never injured a man either with his tongue or his gun, if he ever used a gun, but one thing is certain: as Minister for Finance, he signed many cheques which were certainly not in the interests of the taxpayers on whose behalf he acts.</P>
    <P>If, previous to the present emergency, the Ministry of Supplies failed, as they did fail, to produce the supplies which were required to carry this country over the emergency period, it was because Deputy Seán T. O Ceallaigh as Minister for Finance did not provide, when he should have provided, the necessary State guarantees to enable the Government as a central purchasing body, or the industrialists of the country to get the raw materials which would help to carry us over the emergency period.  Deputy Seán T. O Ceallaigh, as Minister for Finance, regards the monied classes of the country as the masters of the Government and as his masters as Minister for Finance, and it is only when the Minister for Finance whoever he may be in the future, takes the line that money must be made the servant and not the master of the Government and the people that this country will face up to a real solution of the great problems confronting it.</P>
    <P>What is the cost of the money provided for the carrying on of Government services in this country compared with the cost of the money which can <Col N="98" /> be got by the Government of any other civilised country in the world to-day? There is no country in the world so far as I know, whether at war or at peace, in which the control of monetary policy is so completely in the hands of private citizens as this country, and that was brought about by the deliberate act of this Assembly when it passed the Central Bank Bill in September and October last year.  Those of us who were members of the House at that time and especially those of us who took an active part in the discussions know perfectly well that the Minister for Finance, then Deputy Seán T. O Ceallaigh, was unable to do his job on that occasion and that the Taoiseach had to come to this assistance and give him the necessary support to get the Bill steam-rolled through the House by means of his majority of &ldquo;yes-men.&rdquo;  It is a serious state of affairs that in existing emergency circumstances the control of monetary policy, the fixing of the price of money, should be in the hands of private citizens and until that system is changed, Deputy de Valera's Government of to-morrow or any Government of the future will not be able to carry out their promises to the people.</P>
    <P>Whenever any proposal is put before the House for the purpose of improving the social services, of improving the miserable pittances at present paid to the aged, the blind and the infirm, or to those who are unable to get work, we are asked by this distinguished Minister for Finance where the money is to come from.  Even when we plead for small sums for the repair of bog roads, we are asked the same question.  There are thousands of tons of turf lying in the bogs in the turf-cutting counties because enough money cannot be found, or will not be given, for the repair of those bog roads so as to enable the fuel so badly needed in the cities and towns to be got out.  If the Taoiseach knows anything as a result of his recent tour through the country, if he has been told the truth&mdash;and I know it is very often kept from him&mdash;he knows that that is a fact.</P>
    <P>What is the cost of money here compared <Col N="99" /> with the cost in other countries, and what is the position of our Irish banks over which our Government and the Minister for Finance have no control, in regard to the charge they make for the money they lend to the Government, to the local authorities, to the farmers and to the industrialists compared with the price at which they are prepared to lend that money to a foreign Government to fight a war in a foreign country?  If you want money in this country to-day to build houses or to do any other work of a constructive nature, you have to go to the private banks and pay rates of interest ranging from 5 to 7 per cent., while the same banks are allowed by the Head of the Government and his Minister for Finance to lend money, made in this country by the Irish people, to the British Government to fight a war in a foreign country, for the destruction of life and property, at a rate of interest not exceeding 3¼ per cent.  Until that rotten system is changed, it does not matter whether Deputy de Valera is Head of the Government or Deputy Seán T. O Ceallaigh Minister for Finance, and I am afraid, from my experience of Deputy Seán T. O Ceallaigh, that he is not going to change that rotten system.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach made his policy pronouncement in this House on 29th April, 1932, he said he was prepared to accept responsibility for providing a solution of the unemployment problem, that he would stand or fall by his ability to provide that solution, and that if he could not find that solution inside the system, he would go to the country and ask the people to give him authority to go outside the system.  Having failed to carry out his promise to solve the problem of unemployment, except by the method of emigration, which has been going on since the emergency, I challenge him now, after a period of 11 years in office, as to whether he has the courage to say that he will go outside the system to find the solution which he has been unable to find inside it. We will want a more courageous Minister for Finance if we are to face up to that task, and I do not think that Deputy O Ceallaigh, who is a <Col N="100" /> gentlemanly and decent man, is the type of man who will face up to that heavy responsibility.</P>
    <P>I remember Deputy Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh boasting that he had whipped John Bull.  He is the smallest man associated with the smallest Government in the world that I know of who was ever able to make that boast, but having boasted that he had whipped John Bull in the economic war, he sat down on behalf of the taxpayers and wrote out a cheque for £10,000,000 to be paid to Britain in respect of moneys which he claimed were neither legally nor morally due. He said during the recent election that he never made a bargain.  I never heard of a good boxer who, having won his fight, handed over the stakes to the loser.  When we want money for the improvement of our social services we are asked where the money is to come from.  The same people said, when sitting on this side, that the defence services of this State should not cost any more than £2,000,000 per year. Where did the money amounting to £10,000,000 for the maintenance of the defence services this year come from? It can be got from the same source for the improvement of our social services if the Head of the Government and his Minister will only face up to it and see that that money is got at a cheaper price than it has been secured by this Government or its predecessor. That is all I have to say about the Minister for Finance, but I emphasise the fact that it is the most important Ministry in any Government either here or elsewhere in existing circumstances, or indeed under any circumstances at any time.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach if he will tell us whether it is intended in the future to maintain the position known as the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures and, if it is, will he, as one who believes that services should be given in return for money paid by the taxpayers, indicate what is the nature of the responsibilities to be borne by that Minister in future? This is not personal, and I hope the Minister concerned will not treat it as personal, but I do not know that that Minister has earned his salary during the past five years&mdash;I have no evidence <Col N="101" /> of it&mdash;when you compare his so-called responsibilities with the responsibilities of any Minister, such as the Minister for Supplies and Industry and Commerce or, if you like, the lazy Minister for Lands and Education who has held two offices.  I assume from the little information that has been given to us by the Taoiseach up to the present that it is intended to divide the Ministries of Land and Education in future, and that is certainly something to be satisfied with. I feel that the Minister for Lands and Education is one of the laziest members of the Cabinet.  He is too lazy to think for himself.  I believe he is too lazy to read the files of his Departments.  There is evidence of that in the fact that when you put down a Parliamentary question and ask a supplementary question the Minister has to go reading through the files and papers, and you have to wait for some minutes before getting a reply.</P>
    <P>In any case, I am glad to learn that he is to be relieved of some of his responsibilities and I hope his successor, as head of the Ministry of Lands, will do more than he has done since he took responsibility for the conduct of the Land Commission.  The Land Commission, as Deputy Cafferky has rightly said, can do very useful work in connection with the division of land and the carrying out of afforestation schemes.  Apart altogether from the fact that Deputy Derrig may be looked upon as a lazy man, I think it is not right to place the responsibility of carrying two Ministries, like the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Lands, on the shoulders of any one member of the Government. It is a welcome change.</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach give the House and the country a little more information about the future responsibilities of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures?  I think Deputies who have been watching the activities of that particular Minister are not satisfied generally that there is good value given for the money that is being paid to the man who occupies the position.  I often thought Deputy Aiken would be a very suitable man for the Ministry of Lands.  He did <Col N="102" /> occupy that position at one time in an acting capacity.  I am certain he would do the work of the Department better and know more about the work of that Department than the man who has been in charge of it for the last four or five years.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice during the past few weeks talked a good deal about the rights of our citizens under the Constitution.  He appeared to be addressing his remarks in particular to the members of the Labour Party. How can the Minister for Justice talk so glibly and pleasantly about the rights of our citizens under the Constitution when he as Minister reserves to himself the right to arrest and intern, as he has done, hundreds of our citizens without either trial or charge? Does that fit in with the relevant Articles of the Constitution?  The Taoiseach, when speaking in the country, made raving speeches about the rights of the citizens under the Constitution. He, in company with other Ministers, accused us of having tried to prevent the Dáil from adopting that Constitution. I was accused wrongly of having advised my constituents to oppose the Constitution.  I opposed certain Articles of the Constitution when it was under discussion in the Dáil.  I moved suitable amendments to it, but they were defeated.  But, during the following general election, taking that document as a whole, although I had very strong objections to three or four Articles in it, I advised my constituents to vote for the Constitution.</P>
    <P>That was like some of the allegations made, not by the Taoiseach, but by some of his Ministers, that we opposed and voted against what some people style the economic war agreement, that we voted against the restoration of the ports to the authority of the Government of this State.  I challenge the Taoiseach or any Minister sitting there to go out and get the records of this House and produce the name of any Labour Deputy who voted against that economic war agreement in this House.  We criticised it.  That is what we were sent here for-to criticise in a constructive way the policy of the Government of the State.  Is it not a fact that the first <Col N="103" /> conference arranged between the Head of this Government and the head of the British Government for the purpose of getting a settlement of the economic war was arranged by Deputy Norton with the British Labour representative at the time?  Is it not a fact that he gave every possible assistance to maintain Deputy de Valera's Government in office during the economic war?  Was it not a lie for Deputy Lemass, or Deputy MacEntee, or any other Minister to tell the people during the past few weeks that we voted against the agreement which restored the ports of this country to the authority of the Government elected by the Irish people?</P>
    <P>I accuse the Minister for Justice, who talks about the impartial administration of affairs, of having interfered on a number of occasions during the last few years with the impartial administration of justice.  Cases are on record where that Minister interfered with the judgment of our judges by releasing prisoners immediately after they were convicted in the courts.  I assert that that was done under political pressure by some members of his own Party who sit behind him.  I suggest to the Taoiseach&mdash;and I am making this suggestion very sincerely and in the best interests of the impartial administration of justice in this country&mdash;that it is quite wrong and improper for a person holding the position of Minister for Justice to be also one of the principal leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party organisation. The present Minister for Justice is one of the two secretaries of the Fianna Fáil Party organisation.  I think he should be released from that position so long as he holds the high office of Minister for Justice of this State.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal said this evening by farmer representatives who sit on the different benches about the qualifications, or lack of qualifications, of Deputy Dr. Ryan for the position of Minister for Agriculture.  Figures are available to prove that he has been a dismal failure as Minister for Agriculture. Since Fianna Fáil came into office and since he became Minister for Agriculture the value of agricultural <Col N="104" /> production has gone down by £15,000,000.  The value of food consumed in this country has gone down by £8,500,000.  The number of persons working on the land, whether as working farmers or agricultural labourers, has gone down by 48,500. The total population of the country has gone down by 23,500.</P>

      <P>If you look at the issue supplied to Deputies last September and if you get the comparative figures for 1932, you will find that my figures are closely related to facts and I admit that figures do not always represent facts.  Since the Minister for Agriculture came into office in 1932, no fewer than 250,000 people have left the rural parts of this country.  If these figures represent facts, there is a glaring case to prove that Dr. James Ryan is unfit to occupy the position of Minister for Agriculture in the Fianna Fáil Government. I do not propose to say much, because it is unnecessary, to show that Deputy Oscar Traynor, as Minister for Defence, and Deputy P.J. Little, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, should not be included in this list.  They are simple-minded, easygoing men&mdash;the most useless type of &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; I know, to be included in the Cabinet for the coming few years.</P>

      <P>It has been rendered almost unnecessary for anybody to reply to the statements of Deputy Davin and Deputy Norton. Deputy Norton is responsible for the way in which this debate has gone.  I took Deputy Norton to be the Leader of the Labour Party.  However, I find that he is not the leader.  There may be two leaders.  When Deputy Norton spoke about the proposed Cabinet, it was all right.  Deputy Aiken, Deputy Traynor, Deputy O Ceallaigh, Deputy Derrig and the others were all right and were not objected to in the slightest degree by Deputy Norton.  The only nominee objected to by Deputy Norton, speaking on behalf of the whole Labour Party, was Deputy MacEntee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Cléirigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is illuminating to the House that Deputy MacEntee should be objected to not because he <Col N="107" /> did not do his work in the Department, not because he was inefficient as a Minister or because he introduced the Trade Union Bill or the stop Order in regard to wages or any of the other things which were supposed to have ruined the worker, but because he took the gloves off in the general election and fought Mr. Norton and his campaigners in Dublin with their own weapons.  On these grounds only, the leader of the Labour Party, speaking for that Party, objects to Deputy MacEntee becoming a member of the Cabinet.  I ask Deputies, and particularly new Deputies to judge the value of the Labour Party and of their leader by the request to them to accept the rule that a Minister is to be kicked out of the Cabinet and, as they said, kicked out of the Dáil and his Party, because he takes the gloves off and fights an election, as we all do, with bare knuckles.  There was not a single word in the speeches of Deputy Davin or Deputy Norton to suggest that Deputy MacEntee's nomination was being opposed because of alleged inefficiency.  It was not suggested that he should not be a Minister because of the Trade Union Bill about which we heard so much.  Deputy Norton was to start a revolution because of that Bill.  Now, he would allow the Minister responsible for it to come back were it not that he said certain things during the election campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Cléirigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be; I am not judging that.  It may have been even disgraceful, but I think that the tactics of Deputy MacEntee would have to go much farther to equal the tactics of certain members of the Labour Party, both in Dublin and in the country, during the last election. Tactics of candidates during an election campaign are no criterion of their value as Deputies, if they get in here. Many of us would fare very poorly if we were to be judged in that way.  I think that this is the meanest and most unjustifiable attack that was ever made, and one that will bring no credit at all to the members of the Labour <Col N="108" /> Party, who stand behind it because of a certain attack on Deputy Norton. His pride may be injured.  He told us his whole history this evening.  We did not want to hear it.  He spent days and days telling Deputy MacEntee's history, and that from a most twisted angle.  Why should not Deputy MacEntee hit back?  Does Deputy Norton, or Deputy Davin, with his reference to a Belfast brat, think that they only should be allowed to be scurrilous?  Are they to be allowed to attack Ministers and suggest that they be kicked out of public life, and are they only to be allowed to fight with bare knuckles?</P>
      <P>I have sympathy with some of the Labour Deputies.  Some of them are here to-day for the first time.  I am glad to see them here.  They, too, were brats.  They were not called brats or rats by Deputy MacEntee.  They were so called by members of their own Party.  That is the Party that comes in here to hurl an attack against Deputy MacEntee for scurrility.  That is most unbecoming.  I think that an apology to new members of the Dáil is more or less due by Deputy Norton and Deputy Davin for opening up the sores of the election campaign&mdash;all because Deputy Norton did not do as well as he thought he would and is not forming a Government.</P>

      <P>I listened calmly while Deputy Norton was speaking.  I enjoyed his speech because he was his real self.  He talked a lot about Russia in 1925.  But Deputy MacEntee was all right in 1932, when Deputy Norton voted him into power.  There was not a word about Russia then.  Deputy MacEntee was a Minister from 1932 to 1943, and Deputy Norton voted for his measures on many occasions.  There was not a word about Deputy MacEntee then or about his Party's past.  There were times when Russia was all right but, when it suits to open up the old sores of the general election, Deputy Norton tries to befuddle the House by showing his bravery in debate and attacking a particular <Col N="109" /> Minister.  Why are not other Ministers wrong?  I took it from speeches of Deputies of that Party during the election that Deputy Seán Lemass was not fit to be a Minister. Deputy Lemass' name was dragged in the mud in this city for years.  A low campaign was carried out against him in this city&mdash;and off Labour platforms, too.  There is not a word about that now.  He is fit to be a Minister.  So, according to the leader of the Labour Party, is every other member of the proposed Cabinet but Deputy MacEntee.</P>
      <P>There are worse features of the debate than that.  We have examples of these from Deputies from whom we should expect better&mdash;members of the Fine Gael Party.  Why should they take upon themselves, not only to tell the country what it should do, but to tell the new Farmers' Party what they should do.  Deputy Anthony, of Cork, has the cheek to come in here and tell the new Farmers' Party what they should do and what the country expects them to do.  That really means what the Fine Gael Party expects them to do.  I have a lot of sympathy with the members of the new Farmers' Party.</P>

I presume he did not approach the Labour Party and he, certainly, did not approach this Party.  Are we to take Deputy Morrissey, or any member of his Party, seriously, when he gets up to propose Deputy Cosgrave as Taoiseach with a view to forming a Government without having the assurance of one Deputy outside his own Party that he would stand behind him?  That is merely a lot of child's play.  What was the idea of proposing Deputy Cosgrave when not a single member of the House outside his own Party would go in with him?</P>

The campaign Deputy Dr. Ryan had to fight for the past three years was a campaign against the Fagans and the Dillons who did not want tillage at all, except on a limited scale.

They may well talk about Deputy Dr. Ryan's policy for the farmers of Ireland. Deputy Dr. Ryan's policy of tillage is the policy that has left this country neutral.  It has not had to beg our food from outside sources, and were it not for the policy of Deputy Lemass and Deputy MacEntee in putting up the necessary mills to mill our flour, they would be going to America to-day as Deputy Dillon and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney suggested.

      <P>When Deputy Dr. Ryan went to Wexford, one of the best tillage counties in Ireland, the farmers put him at the top of the poll.  His success can be measured by the fact that the Farmers' Party itself did not think fit to nominate a candidate in Wexford.  It is easy to play politics in Opposition.  What is the alternative suggested by the Opposition now? An Taoiseach has the responsibility of forming a Cabinet.  One of the sanest things was said by Deputy Donnellan, leader of Clann na Talmhan, in this debate.  He said it is the Taoiseach's responsibility to select his own team.</P>

      <P>Can anyone suggest that it is not the Taoiseach's right?  Would Deputy Cosgrave surrender his right to pick his team were he Taoiseach?  Would Deputy Norton surrender it?  When the Taoiseach as he now is, having experience of government for 11 years, picks his team, they are the only team we feel are fit under present circumstances to be a team. According to Deputy Davin now, none of them is fit.  That is a new departure since Deputy Norton sat down. This is done for debating purposes. Deputy Norton must outshine the other two Parties in order that the country might look on them as being the principal Opposition in this Dáil.  He must outshine them in oratory, outshine them in scurrility and in abuse, and in attacks of every kind.  That is not the way the Dáil should carry on at its opening meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Cabinet has been proposed by the Taoiseach, and there is no single man in it that can be opposed on grounds of inefficiency.  Deputy Davin alleged that secret service money, the post office and the Taoiseach's office were used in a political way in favour of a political Party&mdash;I presume the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is the statement which was loosely made here.  What about his quotations of Papal Encyclicals? Is he going to back up his statement by proof?  Foreign papers would like to use that statement to show the type of Government we have here.  It was made without a single atom of evidence to show it was true. The Deputy passes it over as a speaker's argument, and for no other purpose.  I think the example set by Deputy Norton and Deputy Davin is not a good one.  Better examples might come from time to time from their Party.  Better examples will come from that Party and I think a better example might come from the Opposition Party.  The chief Opposition I take to be Deputy Cosgrave's Party, and it is time that Deputy Cosgrave's Party would cease to lecture either Labour or Clann na Talmhan as to what their duty is here.  When they find their feet, these Parties will know well what their duty is and they should not be rubbed <Col N="114" /> up by slick debaters trying to twist words they may say without proper practice here.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet put before this House is the best Cabinet for this country; it has experience of wartime and peacetime. The country has given its opinion on it.  With one exception, the country voted every Minister to the top of the poll.  The people of Eire want them to be the Cabinet, and put them back to get on with the work the country has to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that I have not the political morals of the last speaker.  I take it that a fair interpretation of his speech would be that a man may be a liar and a cheat and deficient of all attributes of justice and charity, and yet make a good Minister of State.  Deputy Norton criticised Deputy MacEntee for his campaign of scurrility.  I do not think there is any journal in the country which would not agree with Deputy Norton's description of Deputy MacEntee's campaigning efforts.  They were in sharp contradistinction to the efforts of a number of his colleagues. Every word Deputy Norton said to-night was well merited.  We have sad experience of the same Deputy.  He made himself almost the leader in that type of campaign effort in 1932, and he had the good grace which this House welcomed, in an honest and open way to apologise about 1938 for what he had done, and even though it took him six years to find the decency and honesty to make that confession, the House did applaud it, and he had almost reinstated himself in the good esteem and respect of people who were here.  All that can be said is that he has certainly laid grounds for future apologies, and I hope they will come earlier than six years hence.  There is one Party very unfortunate in this debate, the Party most people were inclined to welcome to this House&mdash; Clann na Talmhan.  They have had criticism from nearly everybody who spoke, and they have had far worse. the indignity of protection offered to them by such a Deputy as Deputy O Cléirigh, and they have the goodwill of Deputy Corry.  When they are some <Col N="115" /> years older in this House they will realise how low a depth they have sunk to when they have merited that.  It has, undoubtedly, been an unfortunate day. I think there never was more interest taken in the opening of the Dáil session than in this one, and that mainly centred in the fact that the people thought they saw opening up before them a new pattern of Parliamentary Assembly.  They had the emergence of a new Party and the growing strength of another sectional Party and people welcomed that because they thought these people would bring in a more vivid appreciation of certain problems than the larger Parties.  There could have been unfolded before this House that technique of government discovered in other countries and there might be a chance of discovering with a number of minority Parties which technique could have been adequate in the circumstances of this country to lead to good government that would become more and more normal.</P>
      <P>We found, as we came into the Dáil, that the opportunity to have that new pattern traced here was denied us right from the start.  From the moment that Deputy de Valera was proposed as An Taoiseach here, no word was spoken as to whether he was going to change the form of government, but after a few speeches were made, it was quite clear that he proposed not merely to abide by Party government but to abide by the very same group of Ministers. All that showed the shadow of coming events.  I complain that, although the Labour Party on this particular Vote have recovered some lost ground, both they and the new Party should have seen what the proposal of An Taoiseach under these circumstances meant and that everything we are now discussing was inherent in the situation the moment Deputy de Valera was proposed as Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clann na Talmhan are not going to vote in this division.  I say that is their responsibility.  Deputy Alfred Byrne used the phrase that the Taoiseach had not sufficient generals. There is nothing more ruthless in war <Col N="116" /> than the sacking of inefficient people. How many battles have these famous generals now proposed for Executive office lost; how many have they through our sad experience lost?  Have their records merited that they should be again proposed to man the gap or to lead their men to the sort of disaster they have already accomplished? Deputy Cafferky said that there are landlords in this country and he complains of their existence.  There are many landlords written up in Irish history for the clearances they made on certain farms on their estates.  We have held these people up to ignominy and to the hatred they justly deserved for what they did, but Deputy Dr. James Ryan has cleared 40,000 people off the land since 1932 and he is now again proposed for office.  No landlord that Deputy Cafferky could get excited about has made such a clearance of human beings off the land as Deputy Dr. Ryan has, but Deputy Cafferky thinks that it is the responsibility of An Taoiseach to nominate his team, and he will not take the opportunity of saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to Deputy Dr. James Ryan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky said, that as far as pig production in his area was concerned, the efforts of Deputy Dr. James Ryan had been devastating.  That is not the only area in which he has been devastating.  There are many areas of agricultural production which Deputy Dr. Ryan has swept more cleanly than any Biblical plague of locusts that ever fell upon a country and, yet, Clann na Talmhan will not walk into the Division Lobby against him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what Deputy Dr. Ryan has done, but what has he promised those who represent the farmers?  He told one group in Cork that we had to admit this, and to submit to it; that certain lines of agriculture were no longer economic; that as far as dairy produce was concerned, there was going to be no profitable dairy surplus and we had got to do without it; that as far as pig products were concerned, he thought that whatever production was carried on would <Col N="117" /> have to be focussed or concentrated entirely on the home market, and that so far as there had been any export trade in these products it was gone.</P>
      <P>His colleague, who came under the lash of Labour for his scurrility, did interfere in an agricultural discussion on one occasion before a farmers' assembly here in Dublin, and he told that assembly that&mdash;his colleague the Minister for Agriculture has since denied it&mdash;as far as the cattle trade was concerned, he regarded it as virtually exterminated.  That is the policy that has driven people off the land and devastated this country in certain areas of production.  Deputy Dr. Ryan, if now re-appointed, can say afterwards to these people who refuse to vote against him: &ldquo;I made my position and my programme clear.  We are going to go out of agricultural exports of a certain type.&rdquo;  He has no suggestion to make as to the products which are to be substituted for those which we are not to produce.  Deputies who represent the farmers are going to allow this cruel devastation of the countryside to proceed still further.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has had a reminder from one of the Labour Deputies that when he came into power in 1932 he founded his programme on his capacity to rid the country of unemployment. When he was challenged by Labour Deputies between 1932 and 1933 on that pronouncement, he said that he would stand or fall by his ability to deal with that programme.  Ten years passed and in July of last year in replying on the Vote for his own Department the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;As far as that problem is concerned, I see no solution for it except possibly if I got power to conscript labour.&rdquo;  Ten years ago we were told that we had a remedy for unemployment staring us in the face such as no other country possessed, but in July 1942, we were told that there was no solution for that problem &ldquo;except possibly that I would be allowed to conscript labour.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party have concentrated to my mind too much on the scurrility of Deputy Sean MacEntee.  I must say that I had expected more from them on one other matter because I know the interest they take in workers in the <Col N="118" /> town.  In one of the Budgets which he introduced in this House, Deputy Sean T. O Ceallaigh, as Minister for Finance, told us that he was nicely balancing things as between two sections of the community.  He had found that certain people had made substantial profits arising out of the war and he proposed to lift these moneys from the profiteers.  In one year he was going to get £750,000 in this way.  Then the nice balance on the other side was that no worker was going to get his wages increased beyond the point at which they stood at that particular moment.  That was the nice balance. The profiteers were to have their ill-gotten gains extracted from them but they were allowed to retain their normal profits.  The man in the wages line, however, found that he was held fast by a standstill order.  We know that in the course of the debate in the next two or three days, when it was represented to the Minister that this arrangement might harm certain industries, he threw the £750,000 back to the profiteers although, he told us, his Revenue Commissioners had information from the books of these companies that they had got this money in this outrageous way from the community. The Taoiseach is well aware that the value of the pound which the poor man receives in wages has now gone down to about 12/6.  There is an income tax of 7/6d. in the £ on those who are above a certain level.  There is also an allowance made for subsistence and for children below a certain age, but when you come to reduce the value of the £ that goes to the workman and the clerk, we find that there is a reduction in value of 7/6d. without any such allowance for subsistence.  Is that any recognition of family responsibility? The poorer sections of the community get the same 20/- in wages but that amount buys only 12/6. worth of food if the food is there to be bought.  They will get still less if these goods are bought at an enhanced price or at a black market price.</P>
    <P>Another Minister went to another of those societies and said&mdash;it was repeated during the election&mdash;that there was no good in people promising extra social benefits of different types, because <Col N="119" /> they cost money, and the only way they could get it was out of extra taxation.  Apparently their minds are absolutely certain that production is fixed in this country, that we cannot raise it, and that therefore if you give any additional social benefits the cost will have to come out of taxation. Deputy James Ryan is of the same mind when he tells us about the types of agricultural production that will have to disappear from this country. His colleague in the Department of Industry and Commerce tells us that production is fixed.  The pool is absolutely rigid, and if you are going to give people extra social benefits the cost will have to come out of taxation.</P>
    <P>All that brings me to the third point. Deputy Davin has spoken, quite properly&mdash;I should have imagined that Deputy Cogan would at least have found an echo of what Deputy Davin said in that respect jostling him into action instead of inaction in this matter&mdash;when he criticised Deputy Seán T. O Ceallaigh, the Minister for Finance, for having made no proper use of finance as a weapon towards increased production in this country. We had a Budget here in May of this year.  If Deputy Seán T. O Ceallaigh, as Minister for Finance, had done nothing but read a couple of newspapers he would have known that there is a completely new conception of finance in the world to-day, but in that Budget of this year the only thing we got in the way of an approach to some ease in the finance of production in this country is that the rate of lending of the Agricultural Credit Corporation is reduced to 4½ per cent. Deputy O'Ceallaigh's last Budget and all his previous Budgets were a simple matter of housekeeping: what have we to spend, and how are we to get the money?  The other conception of finance that there is abroad in the world&mdash;that money is an instrument of production if it is properly used&mdash;has apparently never crossed the mind of the man who is now proposed as Minister for Finance in this country.</P>

Their chance is here now, and it looks to me as if they are going to fail.</P>
      <P>Deputy Seán MacEntee has been criticised very vigorously, and I hold very properly, for his conduct during the election campaign.  One other name has been introduced here, that of a very fine and decent and loyal Irishman who served in the Seanad of this country, ex-Senator O'Farrell.  If we were to take nothing else in respect of Deputy Seán MacEntee but the language he used in regard to that one individual, then the Deputy who is proposed here as Minister has undoubtedly not merely demeaned the Party to which he belongs but has disgraced this Parliamentary Assembly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that we here on this side of the House ought to express our thanks for this lecture on manners which we have had from Deputy O Cléirigh this evening. Members of the House will observe that, although we have not heard his voice for a very long time and have seen him only very rarely, he has not departed from his old form.  He runs very true to form.  When he talks about scurrility, I do not think there is anybody on this side of the House who would dare to enter into that domain.  He is certainly an authority on that subject; he has distinguished himself on many occasions here as an authority on that subject.  But I think that we ought to have from the Leader of this House some indication as to whether he thinks that we ought to continue to have in this country a Minister for Co-Ordination of Defensive <Col N="122" /> Measures.  Great Britain is engaged in a life and death struggle at the present time, but the Government in Great Britain, fighting as they are for the very existence of their nation, does not consider it necessary to have a Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures.</P>
      <P>Surely it is not too much to expect that work in connection with the censorship and other matters that fall to be performed by somebody during the emergency could be discharged by the Minister for Defence.  I noticed that the Taoiseach said that there is likely to be a change in regard to the Department of Lands.  If that indicates that there is to be a complete closing down of Land Commission activities, one cannot object, but if it means that the present inactivity on the part of the Land Commission is going to continue, there is no justification whatever for having a separate Minister for that Department, to exercise nominal control over the cessation of activity which has been associated with the Department for a considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I observe that the Taoiseach indicated that he proposes to include Deputy Seán Moylan in the Government. I now register the objections to that which I voiced on previous occasions.  On April 7th I quoted from a letter written by Deputy Moylan when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to Mr. J. Gilligan, 4 Chapel Street, Tullamore, Offaly. For the information of Deputies who were not then members of this House, I should mention that this letter arose out of the appointment of a manager to the labour exchange at Mallow.  The manager there was a venerable old gentleman, who had reached almost 80 years of age.  He was retiring, and the lady who had assisted him and who had practically managed the office for ten years, was an applicant for the position.  I assert now that the lady to whom I refer obtained first place at the interview board set up to examine applications and I assert that Deputy Moylan's personal interference prevented that lady's appointment because he had decided to make it on <Col N="123" /> political grounds.  He wrote to her ather as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have your letter and a number of others in regard to Miss Nan Gilligan's appointment to the position vacant at Mallow.  The appointee shall, in the first instance, be certified as competent and suitable for the position by the interview board.  I believe Miss Gilligan will fulfil that condition.  From the list certified as competent, I shall appoint the person best suited to the position from a political viewpoint.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In my opinion that letter should preclude this House from giving ratification to the nomination of Deputy Moylan for inclusion in the Government. That viewpoint and policy represent a complete overthrow of the claims of merit and competitive examination, as well as all the fundamentals that are accepted in regard to qualifications for public appointments. It reveals a state of political corruption that has been rampant in this country for a number of years under the auspices of the present Government. I object to that type of political racketeering and I am not willing to allow myself to be associated with the appointment to the Government of anybody who stands for that particular policy.  It is true that no word of defence was made by the person concerned.  The only defence made was a muttered defence with the kind of bovine loyalty to Party that is characteristic of Deputy O'Grady who was put up to reply.  I assert that this political corruption has permeated practically every appointment for a number of years and has even influenced the appointment of auxiliary postmen; that it is rampant in every Department and in every aspect of public life in which it can be exercised and, not alone is it inherent in that Department and in regard to the person proposed to be appointed a Minister, but elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I exposed in this House some time ago the scandalous misuse of power being made by agents of the Minister for Defence at Bere Island.  The late Deputy Hurley disclosed the full story <Col N="124" /> of similar racketeering that was taking place in Haulbowline.  I say now that an appeal was made to the Army and that a foreman appointed in the defence works at Bere Island distributed election literature in the last few weeks on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I ask now what steps are going to be taken to end that state of affairs? It is time that the matter was publicly challenged and that the Leader of this House, who assumes an air of virtuous and pious responsibility on many occasions should be asked to state whether he approves of that or not.  I asserted in this House before that no man can get a situation in Bere Island on defence works that are paid for by the taxpayers unless he is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party. Deputy Hurley made a similar allegation with regard to Haulbowline. There was no defence.  I assert that in Bere Island in connection with contracts with traders the same political discrimination is being exercised, and that for the most menial appointments political influence and political interference is the ordinary feature rather than the exception.</P>
    <P>It is time that we faced up to matters of this kind.  I do not want to make any reference to other events that were referred to by my colleagues beyond exercising my right to raise questions on what I regard as revealing a grave public scandal and to do whatever I can to expose and to criticise actions of the kind.  I suggest that until the viewpoint behind that letter is repudiated and apologised for the Deputy is unfitted to be a member of the Ministry.  I suggest that if the Minister for Defence is unaware of what happened he is not pulling his weight in the Cabinet and is not carrying out the responsibility given to him by an Irish Parliament as a member of the Cabinet.</P>

      <P>This is a type of debate in which I intervene with some diffidence, because in a certain way it is an unfair type of debate.  It is the one debate in which Ministers are tongue-tied and are, so to speak, like Aunt Sally, where every Party can fling sticks at them while <Col N="125" /> they are not in a position to respond. Under these circumstances I do not care very much to intervene, but I find that it is necessary to do so owing to certain remarks that were made from the Government Benches.  While refraining from attacking Ministers, it must not be thought that I consider the Ministers are a competent body.  I do not believe that real competence is to be found in any member of the Government, yet I stand rather more as a defender of the actual Ministers than anybody else.  Except from the Government Benches, in my judgment, the faults of the Government have not been so much faults of administration, bad as these faults have been, as want of political foresight and want of political judgment.  When one looks to a Government with want of foresight one blames especially the Head of the Government, as the faults of Fianna Fáil are not so much, in my opinion, attributable to the Ministers who form the Executive, as they are to the want of political ability, and real knowledge of agricultural conditions, as well as the complete want of economic foresight which characterises the present Head of the Government.  I was taunted by two members of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy O Cléirigh and Deputy Corry, for having in November, 1939, from my place in this House, urged on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to purchase the American ships which were then, by President Roosevelt's orders, ordered off the seas.</P>

The Minister should know that it was grown during the last war.  Every single member of the Fianna Fáil Party ought to know that the policy of growing wheat before the war, instead of being of assistance, was detrimental to the policy of wheat growing during the war, because it had exhausted the soil.

      <P>A great deal has been said about the attacks made upon the members of the new Party of Clann na Talmhan who have come into the House.  For my part, I think that a person making a maiden speech ought to be kindly received.  The rules of debate should not be applied as strictly against him as they would against a more established member. All maiden speeches follow much the same line.  The speaker wants to see unemployment ended, the land afforested, drainage carried out and a lot of other things done.  That is the regular formula into which they all fall.  Everybody comes into this House full of general ideas, and it is only after a certain time here that one sees how these ideas can be carried into operation.  Therefore, in regard to maiden speeches everybody should be kind and sympathetic towards them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is a great difference between making a maiden speech and exercising a vote.  The one is merely an expression of a general opinion, the other is exercising a power.  If one goes back to the foundation of the whole matter one finds that idea rather obscurely expressd in the Constitution. There, it is said all power lies in the people under God.  That <Col N="127" /> power is delegated to those elected by the people, and there is an obvious duty on them to exercise it.  It is given to them to use and not to rust away unused in their hands.  It is absurd for the Labour Party to say, &ldquo;We will not vote for Deputy de Valera because we do not like his policy.&rdquo;  It is their duty to do one thing or the other.  If they considered that he was the most suitable person in the present crisis to be Taoiseach, then they should have voted for him.  If, on the other hand, they did not, then they should have voted against him.  I think that is a perfectly unjustifiable attitude for any Party to take up on a question of major importance.  It is their duty to sum up the arguments for and against the taking of a certain course, and not to shirk drawing the conclusion which they ought to draw, one way or the other.  There must be something more in favour of one course than another.</P>
    <P>I submit that the power which has been given to Deputies on matters of major interest should be used by them, and there could be no more important issue before the House than the selection of the Taoiseach and the members of the Government.  It is true that we here are departing from precedent because on this occasion we are opposing the nominations submitted by the Taoiseach.  We did not do that on previous occasions.  Deputy Cosgrave expressed our opposition in a very temperate speech.  We consider that there are certain changes in the membership of the Government which are absolutely vital, changes which must be made unless this country is to go down completely.  We have already pointed to the want of foresight and of a policy on the part of the Government. I shall have something to say on that when the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture comes to be debated.  I do not intend now to go into the various matters which I hope to deal with when that Estimate comes up.  I am of the opinion that this debate would not have taken half or quarter the time it has taken if the Taoiseach had adopted the wise course of selecting some Minister other than the present one as Minister for Agriculture, because in the judgment of <Col N="128" /> the ordinary members of the House he is not fit to hold his position.</P>
    <P>I want to lodge the strongest protest I can lodge against certain speeches which I heard here to-night and especially the speech of Deputy Cleary. We have heard from various sides of the House statements which amount to this, that people are entitled to lie as much as they like from political platforms, that any methods at all may ho adopted to get votes and that no scruples should restrain a person from attacking his political opponent.  &ldquo;We are entitled to a little mud-slinging&rdquo; is, I think, the view which was put forward in one place&mdash;a fight with the gloves off.  A fight with the gloves off is a different thing from fighting with the stiletto and stabbing in the back. I sincerely hope that when the members of the Government cease to be tongue-tied by the rules of debate, when this discussion is over and they are able to intervene, they will join with me in the protest which I make against the doctrine being put forward in this House that lying from political platforms is justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to vote against this motion and I propose to detain the House only a few moments in order to state my reasons.  I voted against the motion we had here to-day for the election of the Taoiseach for two reasons.  The first was that the Taoiseach had made it quite clear that he intended to have Party government and Party government alone and, secondly, that I hoped the Leader of my Party, Deputy Cosgrave, in the alternative, would have an opportunity of forming a national government which, if this Dáil does not form it, some future Dáil will form. Unlike Deputy Dillon, I am not a very great believer, and never have been a great believer in Party government.  I believe the time will come in this country when the country will insist that We have a national government. There are two points of view on that, but I believe that in so far as we can say that this election has brought an expression of opinion from the Irish people, it was definitely against Party government because they did not send back a Party to this House in sufficient strength to form a government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> Having voted against the motion for the nomination of the Taoiseach, it is naturally consistent that I should now vote against the appointment of his Ministers, but I go so far as to say that while it is the function and the duty of the House to confirm or reject the names of the Ministers put forward by him, the responsibility for selecting these Ministers undoubtedly does lie with the Taoiseach; but having rejected the idea of a national Government and having decided, as he is perfectly entitled to do, the House having given him the right, to form a purely Party Government, I am not satisfied with the present position of the various Ministers.  As has been stated by other speakers, if any indication were given that some of the Ministers would be changed around I would withdraw my opposition to the motion.</P>
    <P>I hope that so long as this Dáil exists we shall not have the same type of debate as we have had here to-day.  I do not propose to say who was wrong or who was right, but I certainly think that our constituents did not send us here to continue the election campaign. Some of the speakers have actually said that it is justifiable to throw mud, that they threw it themselves and were prepared to do so again.  Personally I do not agree with that point of view, and in any event I think that sort of thing should be left outside the House.</P>
    <P>I am sorry also that on a major matter of vital importance, two of the five Deputies sent here to represent my constituency did not see fit to vote for or against.  That is a matter for themselves, but I think it very wrong that 40 per cent. of my constituents should be disfranchised in this way.  With regard to the new Farmers' Party, I welcome them.  I was glad to hear them intervening in the debate, but I would very much have preferred to see them give a vote one way or the other &mdash;I do not care which way&mdash;on the major motion to-day.  We have a new Dáil here.  We started this morning with prayer.  We have to settle down to a new life and see that this country is properly governed.  We in Opposition have duties to perform as have <Col N="130" /> the Government, and I should be very sorry to think that we should have the same type of debate on any other future occasion as we have had to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to oppose the Ministry proposed, but a peculiar position has been created by the Parties outside the Opposition and the Government.  These two Parties, although they said very hard things about the Government, would not oppose the motion to put Deputy de Valera into power.  Then we had the awful whinging of the Clann na <Col N="132" /> Talmhan Party, or farmers.  They did not seem to be in favour of anybody. In fact, they do not seem to know where they stand.  I am sorry for my colleague from South Tipperary over there.  The whole attitude of Farmer and Labour Parties to-day has been much worse than that of some members of the present Government so far as acrobatics are concerned.  From every platform in the country they announced they were against the Government. Deputy Cogan knows this House very well, knows the country very well, and has some experience, and I did not expect the type of stuff that came from him to-day.  They talk about professional politicians.  I say that there are no greater professional politicians than those men of the Farmers' Party who came in here pretending to help the farmers.  My firm belief is that they came in with the full intention of drawing their £40 per month and that they had no greater object than that.  I am sorry to be hurtful towards the members of the Clann na Talmhan; I am not referring to the Independent farmer members. But I am afraid the others came in to carry on a real game of acrobatics, such as we have had in this Dáil off and on for a number of years.  It is time that it was stopped.</P>
      <P>The position is that we voted against the nomination of the Taoiseach. We had varying views on that, but we thought we were doing right so far as the people we represent were concerned.  We did not consider whether we would lose votes by that in the future, though other Parties seem to be concerned with that aspect.  This thing cannot continue in Irish life. Unlike Deputy Dillon, I have given up hope for the Party system in this country.  I have given up hope because every &ldquo;chancer&rdquo; can come along and play on the minds of one section or another in order to obtain votes.  They can tell some gullible fools that they will create a new heaven and earth for them.  That has been going on too long in this country.  I should also like to remind the Labour Party that they will have to play straight some time&mdash; they will have to take some responsibility; they will have to support one or the other of the bigger Parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> Coming to the motion, before the House, I am totally opposed to the Ministry selected by the Taoiseach. Most of them have been failures of the worst kind.  As representing a large number of farmers in Tipperary, I feel I could not support the election of Deputy Dr. Ryan as Minister for Agriculture.  While I feel it hard to have to mention his name particularly, I feel that I could not possibly stand over his election as Minister for Agriculture. It is one thing that I hate to harp on&mdash;everybody in the House seemed to harp on it to-night&mdash;but I have a duty to my constituents and to my Party, and the Deputy's administration of that Ministry has been bad from beginning to end.  When he came into office we had a great deal of trouble in connection with the dairying industry in Tipperary.  We had a great deal of trouble in connection with condensed milk factories and creameries taken over by the Dairy Disposals Board during the last Administration.  One of the things I have against him is that when he comes down to County Tipperary or somewhere else and some case is put to him, he says: &ldquo;That will be all right. I will settle that.&rdquo;  Then he goes away and you wait for two or three months, but nothing is done, and Deputies are asked about the promises given to them.  That has gone on continually. Now we find ourselves in the position that our dairying industry and our live-stock industry are almost finished. The same thing applies to the pig industry. I do not blame him so much for that because of the food shortage and other things.  But there are many things in connection with the dairying industry and the live-stock industry for which he must be blamed.</P>
    <P>To come hack again to the Farmers' Party, when it came to nominating a Ministry they said that they were relying on the Taoiseach to get the work done within the Ministry.  Deputy Cogan has some years of experience here and I did not think he would have taken that line.  You are afraid to face the situation and still you travel through the country stabbing everybody in the back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting-Chairman Acting-Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting-Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought to address the Chair.  I do not like <Col N="134" /> being told that I have been travelling through the country stabbing people in the back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree completely with the Taoiseach's policy and with most of the Ministers, but especially with Deputy Dr. Ryan, Minister for Agriculture.  I will now come to the Department of Supplies and the Department of Industry and Commerce. No doubt it is a difficult job.  but if a mess was made in the early stages it should have been remedied.  No effort was made to remedy that mess.  I suppose it would be very difficult now to remedy it.  I have the greatest sympathy with anyone who takes over this Department.  I have lost faith in the Department of Industry and Commerce, and I think all the people, including those who are trading in a fairly big way, are pretty tired of it.</P>
      <P>Everything that could be done with the object of frightening the electorate was done in the last election.  Efforts were made to influence the Army and other organisations controlled or semi-controlled by the Government.  All that was done, even in the Army camps. Posters were displayed inside Army camps and on the bogs where men were cutting turf.  There were plenty of interruptions at meetings and there were lorries taking bands to Fianna Fáil meetings.  How was it that they could have plenty of fuel for that purpose? That could not be done without the knowledge of Ministers or their Departments. Surely, then, it is time to oppose such a Minister.</P>
      <P>I appeal to those farmers who pretended that they were coming in to help the farming industry to make up their minds that there will be no more of this &ldquo;codology.&rdquo;  I ask them to act squarely and not to be waiting to make political profit out of what has happened. I appeal to them to act fairly and squarely with the people who put them here.  I say to Labour that it is a damn shame for them&mdash;perhaps I should not use those words in the House&mdash;when they would not oppose the Taoiseach, now to come along and oppose Ministers.  That is the wrong way of doing things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position in the provinces? If you go into a town and meet <Col N="135" /> innocent, gullible business man he will tell you that the Taoiseach is a decent, honest man, but he has a terrible crowd of Ministers, and if we could get rid of them things would be all right.  That is the general feeling and Labour Deputies know that.  Why do they not face the situation and not try to court political favour?  I am determined to oppose the Ministers proposed by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the appointments proposed by the Taoiseach and I wish to take advantage of his opportunity to refute the libellous and slanderous statements made against myself by one of the candidates for a position in the Ministry, not alone by public advertisements, but by statements in the City of Dublin.  He suggested that Labour representatives condoned the sinking of an Irish boat and he used the Press censorship to prevent the truth getting out to the public; but in my own constituency I told the people the truth in spite of the censorship, with the result that the sailors, the men qualified to man these boats, returned me at the head of the poll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that the Labour Party protested against Englishmen and Welshmen being employed as captains and officers of the Irish boats.  We protested against the English Mercantile Marine badge being used by our sailors.  When they went ashore at Lisbon they wore the badge of the British Mercantile Marine.  The German spies communicated the fact to their own people and the result was that our boats were sunk.  They were sunk because Englishmen and Welshmen were officers on the upper decks. The Minister cannot claim to be ignorant of that matter.  The facts were brought to his notice when a German submarine held up one of the Irish boats.  The captain of the boat, when ordered into the small boat, skulked behind the Irishmen in the small boat and was afraid to face the German commander, on account of being a Welshman.  He let young Kelly, the first mate, make the appeal that it was an Irish boat, carrying an Irish cargo. The captain was afraid because he <Col N="136" /> came from a country that had declared war and was a national of a belligerent nation; he was afraid to face the position because he thought he would be arrested and taken to prison.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that all this information was brought to his notice by the Defence Conference, the Taoiseach said that he was not aware of the nationality of the officers.  We asked was it not a fact that the British Government would not allow Irishmen to control the Irish ships, although they were better qualified to be officers on those ships.  There was a lot of false propaganda circulated by the Minister for Local Government when he was going around the country, and also in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>He suggested that we condoned the sinking of Irish boats.  As a matter of fact, we were protecting the Irish boats.  I may say that there are men in the Minister's constituency who are better qualified to control those boats than some of the officers who were on the Irish boats, but they were not permitted to take control.</P>
    <P>The Minister must surely have some knowledge of the facts.  He has a civil servant drawing £1,000 a year as chairman of the shipping company.  Must he not be aware that the Defence Conference got a promise from the Cabinet that Irishmen would replace Englishmen on those boats?  Was it not for the protection of Irishmen that we raised the matter here?  Our sailors approved of our action and they denounced the Government for allowing Englishmen and Welshmen, who had not the same qualifications as Irishmen, to control the boats.  Simply because they were Englishmen and Welshmen, they got the jobs.  It is because we resent the lying statement made by the Minister that we will oppose the Taoiseach's proposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made suggestions about Communism and he stated that we were in receipt of Communist money.  I have been in this Parliament for 21 or 22 years and I may say I sever received a penny from any Communist Party.  The Minister forgot to tell the people of Dublin where he received his funds from.  Even in his <Col N="137" /> own constituency did he not receive funds from the wives of high officials in this State?  We are in a position to prove it.  Is he prepared to publish a list of the subscriptions to his election fund?  Did he tell the people about the Irish insurance company which subscribed a large sum of money to the Fianna Fáil Party?  Did he inform the people of the amount-that Ranks, the firm that received £2,000,000 by way of subsidy here, gave to the Fianna Fáil Party?  He did not, but he libelled the Labour Party and alleged that they received money from Russia.  I have been connected with the Parliament of this country for a longer period than any of the Ministers and, please God, I will be here long after they are gone. I deny that I or any member of the Labour Party ever received one penny from the so-called Communist Party.</P>
    <P>Up in Rathmines the Minister condemned the bombing of his native city, Belfast.  We all condemned it.  But there are other places nearer to him than Belfast that were bombed and he had no word of sympathy for the bombing in Dublin or in Wexford.  He was inviting support from the Unionists of Rathmines. Belfast appealed to him more than the citizens of Dublin. I had the privilege of listening to the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Agriculture in my constituency, and I can say that they fought a clean fight.  There was nothing personal in their speeches.  They criticised programmes and put forward their own. I am as long in politics as any Deputies here and no man can say that I ever attacked him personally from a public platform.  I could have done so in the case of some of the Government candidates.  I am opposed to the nomination of Deputy MacEntee. Apart from his libellous attacks, the Deputy is a failure in his position.  At one time, he was in favour of &ldquo;one man, one job&rdquo;.  While acting as Minister, he sanctioned the appointment of men to two or three jobs, any one of which was sufficient to maintain a family.  Simply because the persons concerned were supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, two or three jobs were sanctioned for them.  I am sorry <Col N="138" /> the Farmers' Party have taken up the attitude they did.  I say that is the result of the agreement their Leader has with the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that the Minister for Local Government has been a failure as Minister.  He has sanctioned the appointment of men to several positions.  He refused to sanction an increase of 2/6 per week in wages to workers, while certain high officials, drawing £800 a year, received an increase, notwithstanding the standstill order.  I can prove that in my own constituency medical men received an increase sanctioned by the Minister, while similar increases would not be granted to men in receipt of small wages.  On these grounds, I say that the Deputy is not capable of filling the responsible position of Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>I come now to the position of the Minister for Agriculture.  No county had a bigger grievance regarding the administration of the Agricultural Department than Wicklow.  There was no louder denunciation of the state of affairs than that from the representatives of the Farmers' Party in County Wicklow.  They had just reason for that denunciation.  If a plebiscite were taken to-morrow, the farmers in that constituency would vote against the re-appointment of the present Minister, although he is a resident of the county.  They recognise that he has been a failure in that position. Notwithstanding all this, we are asked to enable the Government to continue their policy of low wages and standstill orders while we have a Minister degrading his high position as Minister of State by using language which would not be suitable for use by a Deputy.  On these grounds, I say that we are justified in opposing the re-appointment of this gentleman as Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Supplies Department, the truth is we have nothing to supply. People in the country are unable to get <Col N="140" /> half a gallon of paraffin oil.  That Department is costing £3,000,000 a year but it has nothing to supply to the ordinary citizen.  The Department has plenty of petrol for the Army and the Garda, the L.D.F., Ministers and their supporters, but there is nothing for the person who takes up a critical attitude. We all see the L.D.F. and the L.S.F. arranging meetings, with dances.  They go to the meetings before the dance and they enjoy the privilege of L.D.F. petrol.  That is common throughout the country.  There is a waste of petrol in the Army and, at the same time, owners of lorries are unable to get sufficient petrol to enable them to carry on their ordinary occupation.  Some of them are unable to bring in turf from the bogs.  Lorry-owners have had to dismiss some of their employees, while we see Ministers travelling around the country to the seaside and a number of other cars parked round theirs.  We are asked to support this policy of self-interest on the part of a certain small political gang, with positions going to supporters of one political party.  We have the judiciary being used in the interests of the wealthy class.  Quite recently, we had four or five highway robbers brought up in connection with a sum of £100,000 connected with a factory in Clare and we saw the way the judge made an arrangement in that case.</P>

We can find it even in the smallest village.  It is rampant and the proof is there.  It happened quite recently in the case of one judge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think for the first time in my life I have sympathy with the Taoiseach, and very sincere sympathy, indeed, because I do not believe in any individual or any group of individuals in this House having any right to place responsibility on <Col N="142" /> shoulders which those shoulders should not bear, and the entire burden of the speeches that have been made from two Parties here to-night is simply because a certain person has been nominated as Taoiseach of Dáil Eireann, that on him, and him alone, rests the entire responsibility of forming a government in this country. If those Deputies' conception of the duties of a Party is that the responsibility should be placed on the shoulders of an individual Deputy, that is not my conception of their duties.  We are sent here, firstly, either as individual Deputies if we are Independent, or secondly, as Deputies who may be members of Parties, but our first duty in this House is to represent as far as we can, and express the wishes of our constituents, and to carry them out, as shown by the way they voted, in what we view as the best manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that any man in this House who dislikes the team the Taoiseach has offered the House to-night has the slightest right to criticise that team when he gave the entire responsibility for formulating it to the Taoiseach.  As far as I am concerned, my mind is perfectly clear on what my attitude is.  It is not a question of being opposed to the team as a particular Fianna Fáil team.  So long as I remain a Deputy of this House I will vote against any team put up by any Taoiseach who is head of a Fianna Fáil Party, and, as far as I am concerned, the individual does not alter my opposition to Fianna Fáil in the slightest.  If, as somebody suggested, he picked them out of the Fianna Fáil Benches by chance or by lot, it would not alter my opposition.  In fairness to the Taoiseach, his position is this: Not alone did Fine Gael attack him throughout the country, not alone did Fine Gael do their best to see that Deputy de Valera would not be elected Taoiseach, but the Labour Party did their best, and Clann na Talmhan and Independent Farmers did their best, to see that he would not be elected. We are now in the position that he has been elected Taoiseach.  They do not want his Ministry; they do not like Deputy Dr. Ryan.  But at twenty minutes past three, when they saw <Col N="143" /> who was walking into the Division Lobby, and it was not a question of whether they liked Mr. Cosgrave's nomination or not&mdash;it was merely a question as to the election or non-election of Deputy de Valera&mdash;the people who campaigned the country as viciously as Fine Gael&mdash;more viciously in fact&mdash;against the Taoiseach and his Party, took the line of least resistance and sat down to wait to see what would happen.</P>
    <P>In order to cover themselves up, having thrown the entire responsibility on the shoulders of one man, having asked that man to take up responsibility, they come along and say: &ldquo;We have given him responsibility but we do not like his team.&rdquo;  They do not like the team.  Clann na Talmhan does not like Deputy Dr. Ryan.  If they did not want Deputy Dr. Ryan as Minister for Agriculture in this House, there was one way, and one way only, of preventing Deputy Dr. Ryan from being Minister for Agriculture and that was by defeating the nomination of the present Taoiseach.  If the Labour Party, anxious as they are to prevent the nomination of Deputy Seán MacEntee, did not want Deputy MacEntee, they had one way of preventing it and that was by preventing the nomination of the Taoiseach as Taoiseach.  I cannot understand &mdash;and I doubt if I will be able to understand&mdash;how anybody can say to the present Taoiseach: &ldquo;Yours is the responsibility and yours alone.  You have to take that responsibility.&rdquo;  And those 35 or 36 people will sit there having shirked their responsibility, reserving the right to criticise what any Party or anyone else does in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky tried to evade the question.  He said he would not vote for Deputy De Valera and he would not vote for Deputy Cosgrave.  It was not an issue on that division between Deputy de Valera and Deputy Cosgrave. The motion before the House was the election, or non-election, of Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach, and Deputy Cafferky or any other Deputy cannot now complain if the Taoiseach, in picking his team, is going to leave <Col N="144" /> them with Deputy Dr. James Ryan as Minister for Agriculture.  Sooner or later, people will have to find out that there is one thing you cannot have in this world, in politics or out of it.  You cannot have the best of both sides of the game at the same time.  If you are going to make a stand against a Minister or a political Party you should not run.  You cannot go half way and squeal then that you could not go the whole way because you did not like the man.  I never believed that we would see an exhibition in an Irish Parliament so inane and futile as the exhibition we saw this evening in the division for the election of Taoiseach when 33 or 34 Deputies abstained from voting. The Taoiseach came back to the House with his team of Ministers, as he was fully entitled to do, and the very moment he arrived the attack started. What did they expect him to do?  If Deputy Donnellan was forming a Government, if Deputy Norton was forming a Government or if Deputy Cosgrave was forming a Government, would any of these three Deputies, having been elected Taoiseach, go around the House and consult every Deputy before he distributed his Ministries? Would they not at least agree that the man elected as Taoiseach has the right to select his own team of Ministers? If he has not, I cannot see that the election of a Taoiseach is of any value when he has been refused the right to nominate his own Government.</P>
    <P>I am unremitting in my opposition to Fianna Fáil.  Opposition to those in the Fianna Fáil Cabinet means nothing to me.  I do not care who is Minister for Agriculture; I do not care who is Minister for Supplies; and I do not care who is Minister for Justice.  I will vote against the formation of any Fianna Fáil Ministry, and I am not going to allow anyone or any Party to get away with the well-known trick of avoiding responsibility. Surely we ought to be old enough in Parliamentary tradition now to realise that when we are sent here we are sent with a duty to our constituents, to act up to our responsibilities. There is only one way to do that, and that is by talking out what is in our minds, and acting as our <Col N="145" /> constituents desire.  I defy any Deputy, whether Independent, Labour, Clann na Talmhan or Farmers, to deny that his constituents have sent him here to sit down and not vote.  If any Deputy sent here sits down and does not vote, the constituents of that Deputy will only get from him the type of representation they deserve. It is worse than disfranchisement.  It is merely being mute of malice, because they think it suits.  They can glory in the fact that when Deputy Dr. Ryan was put forward as Minister for Agriculture they made a terrific fight for his removal.  The Labour Party will be able to tell their supporters what a gallant effort they made to prevent Deputy MacEntee being appointed Minister for Local Government.  They can talk for the next three years about Deputy Ryan and Deputy Moylan for all the effect it is going to have, once they have committed themselves to the appointment of Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach.  Having done that, they might as well remain mute for all the difference it is going to make.  It was a most inept exhibition.  If Irish politics is going to descend to that level, some people will never make up their minds on major issues.</P>
    <P>When I first came to this House I had to listen to Deputy Corry saying something similar to what he said to Deputy Cafferky.  I remember that after my first speech here I got a very ardent welcome from Deputy Corry. There was a way for dealing with people like him, and that was not to wait for any sympathy.  The same thing happened in connection with the Farmers' Party.  What happened to-day.  The farmers were told by Deputy O Cleirigh and Deputy Corry that they were decent fellows, that they were delighted to see an independent body of men in the House at last to represent the agricultural community. They said that they were proud of the fact that at last agriculture had come into its own, and had a fine stalwart body of men in this House who would agree with Deputy O Cleirigh and Deputy Corry in so far as they would oblige these Deputies by sitting down and not voting against the <Col N="146" /> appointment of the Taoiseach.  No wonder they were delighted.  If I was a candidate for any appointment and found myself in a minority position I would not have much to say about people who sat down and did not vote. I am not sure what the Minister for Local Government said about the Labour Party or what tha Labour Party said about the Minister.  I think the Minister said some very hard things about me in my constituency, but I have yet to realise that Irish politicians have become so thin-skinned that we have to take up a couple of hours in Dáil Eireann criticising what somebody said about someone else during the elections. Occasionally I have been sorry for things that I said on election platforms, but I have never yet been sorry for what somebody said about me.  If one goes on an election platform electioneering one must be prepared to take what people say.  The greatest compliment that can be paid by anybody, particularly in opposition, whether he be Deputy or candidate, is to be attacked by a Minister or by somebody else.  It is a very good sign to see such an attack being made, as it shows that some impression has been made&mdash;whatever impression it may have on voters.  It is really no concern of mine what team the Taoiseach comes here with.</P>
    <P>During this debate a number of points were made with which I am in entire agreement.  I heard one Fianna Fáil Deputy saying that some people were attacking the Ministers, not because of their incapacity as Ministers, and not because of their failure to carry out their jobs and not because of something they said.  As far as I am concerned I would not vote for the Minister for Supplies because of one incident.  There was a period in this country when horse shoe iron was badly wanted.  A friend of mine was in a position to get three tons of horse shoes in Belfast at that time.  I applied to the Department of Supplies for a permit.  Unless I am greatly mistaken the Minister for Supplies was also Minister for Industry and Commerce. After a little time I got a reply telling me that it appeared to be <Col N="147" /> a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce, over which the same Minister presided.  I applied to the Department of Industry and Commerce and after some time I got a reply stating that it appeared to be a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. I may have been wrong in applying in the first instance to the Department of Supplies, but in November when horse shoe iron was badly wanted the Department of Supplies should not have referred me to the Department of Industry and Commerce or to the Revenue Commissioners, as if that Department was doing its business, it should have given me an Army lorry to go to Belfast to bring it down.  The revenue authorities were the only people who did their business properly but by then the iron was not available.  Many things happened like that.  I will vote against Deputy Dr. Ryan because of another small instance. Deputy Dr. Ryan knows perfectly well that 90 per cent. of the small traders in country towns are seedsmen, and that they are in the habit of dealing directly with well-known English seedsmen.  Deputy Dillon can verify that statement. Last year I raised a question with the Minister for Agriculture about the import of agricultural seeds.  There was a lot of talk about it, and when it was too late we were permitted to bring them in.  Early this year, in April, those firms in England wrote to their customers here saying that the British Ministry of Agriculture would permit the export to this country of any type of agricultural seed that was required, because they had a surplus of them in Great Britain.  Individual shopkeepers who were customers of those merchants naturally immediately wired back saying they would take all they could get of them.  A week went by, and the first thing those shopkeepers heard was through a wire from the people in England saying that the Eire Government would not permit the import into this country of anything except garden beet.  A letter subsequently followed, which verified that position.  There was an attempt made to explain the matter to me by saying <Col N="148" /> that the Eire Government would not permit individual licences to be given for the import of those seeds.</P>
    <P>If that was the position, I should like to know how they expected those people to bring them in?  Here you had, all over the country, shopkeepers, co-operative societies and creameries, who had been dealing with those wholesale seedsmen in England during the last 30 or 40 years.  Those people were prepared to supply them with seeds.  The British Government were prepared to allow the seeds to be sent to this country, but the Irish Government, the Department of Agriculture, under Deputy Dr. Ryan, would not permit the import into this country of any type of agricultural seed except garden beet.  On that one point alone, if nothing else, I would vote against the nomination of Deputy Dr. Ryan.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back over the 101 other things which would make me vote against his nomination.  I am quite sure there are members on the Clann na Talmhan Benches who, if they went back seven or eight years, would be inclined to vote against Deputy Dr. Ryan for quite a number of reasons.  I am quite sure that there are others on those benches who, like the Deputy we heard earlier, would not agree with Deputy de Valera, and would not agree with Deputy Cosgrave; apparently, he has spent his time since he came to the use of reason trying to make up his mind who is the worse, and is still in such a state of flux that the only thing he is sure of is that one is worse than the other, but he cannot make up his mind about anything else.  What complaint has he against Deputy Dr. Ryan?  What complaint has he against Deputy Lemass, or against any member of the Government? What has he been doing for the last seven or eight years?  What did he do at the last few elections? Did he or did he not support them? Any one who supported that Fianna Fáil Ministry in 1932 and in 1933 and in 1937 and in 1938 should have very little cause to desert them now because in my opinion they are not any worse now than they were in 1932 or in 1933 or in 1937 or in 1938.  There must be <Col N="149" /> quite a number of converts to this policy of &ldquo;sit down and say nothing,&rdquo; who have discovered something about Fianna Fáil in the past four or five months that we did not succeed in finding out over a very long period, but they have not told us about it. They are quite satisfied, as one Deputy said, that a lot of people in the country think we have a great Taoiseach but a rotten set of Ministers, and they spent their time here bearing out that idea of some loose thinkers in the country that we have a great Taoiseach and a rotten set of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Does anybody imagine, if the Taoiseach is the one outstanding man of our generation, if the Taoiseach, as Deputy Dillon said, is probably the cleverest politician in Europe, if he is, as some people seem to think, one of the greatest men of all time, that his Ministers can be as bad as they are painted?  Surely, if he is the great man they think he is, he ought to be able to make a better job of picking a Ministry than some people think he is doing?  They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot stand on one foot and pretend to support Fianna Fáil by saying &ldquo;We are for de Valera&rdquo;, while standing on the other foot and opposing Fianna Fáil by attacking his Ministers. They will have to make up their mind as to whether they want a continuation of the Fianna Fáil Government in this country.</P>
    <P>Might I ask whether it is the intention of Clann na Talmhan Deputies, as long as this Dáil lasts and as long as the Taoiseach carries on with his team of Ministers, to sit down and do nothing&mdash;to talk as much as they want, but never to vote?  Do they realise that, after a division in this House, there may be as much responsibility on them to form a Government as there is on the Labour Party, or on the Fine Gael Party?  If they were put into that position, would they just sit tight and say: &ldquo;We will do nothing.  Let somebody else carry on. We reserve the right to criticise those who carry on, and not alone do we reserve that right but we reserve the right to criticise those who are entitled to criticise those who carry <Col N="150" /> on?&rdquo; The Labour Party went out of their way to attack a certain Minister. Apparently they are prepared to vote against him.  Having given that Minister his job already by nominating Deputy Eamon de Valera as Taoiseach, they are now prepared to say they were wrong because they do not like to see that Minister.  Clann na Talmhan are going one better still. They have allowed Deputy Eamon de Valera to become the Taoiseach.  They do not like Deputy Dr. Ryan very much.  They hope to be in a position to direct his policy by their able assistance and the great guidance they will be able to give as the only people who are interested in farming in this country.  They hope to direct Deputy Dr. Ryan's mind on such lines that he will not be the Deputy Dr. Ryan we knew of old.  Do they seriously think that either, the Taoiseach or Deputy Dr. Ryan will care a hoot, after the division which follows this debate, what Clann na Talmhan or anybody else thinks, or that any influence they can exert by word or deed will have the slightest effect on the Minister for Agriculture?  As far as I am concerned, I doubt that there is any Minister of the Fianna Fáil Party for whom I would vote even in a coalition Government if we were to have one in the morning.  I suppose I would have to salve my conscience by letting in a few members of that Party, but I am not at all sure that, like another Deputy who has spoken, I would not select them from the back benches.</P>
    <P>There is only one thing of which I am certain: If the Fianna Fáil Party, when they first formed a Government here, had the principles and ideals which they led the people of this country to believe they had, if they reasonably believed that they could do something to end unemployment, if they reasonably believed that they could do something to relieve the poor and destitute of this country, if they reasonably believed that they could improve the position of agriculture, then they came into office with as high a set of ideals as any Party that ever came in.  If they reasonably believed that they could carry out any of those promises, they must be a sick and sorry <Col N="151" /> lot of Ministers now.  They must be tired listening to people telling them what they promised and did not carry out.  I am sure they are disillusioned, because it is possible that they had convinced themselves at the time, as they succeeded in convincing the country, that they could do all those things.  They are probably tired and disillusioned now.  I am quite sure a lot of them would not mind getting out if they could, but they cannot get out; no Minister of that Fianna Fáil Cabinet can get out at the moment. Clann na Talmhan and the Labour Party know very well that, even even though Fianna Fáil dropped only ten seats at this election, one crack in that Cabinet or one crack in a division here might mean the end of them. Deputy O Cléirigh and Deputy Corry were right; if I were the Taoiseach or any of the Ministers or any member of the Fianna Fáil Party I would join with Deputy O Cléirigh and Deputy Corry in welcoming into the House a new Party who are prepared to give Fianna Fáil another chance, after telling the country during the election campaign that they wanted Fianna Fáil out of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to enter on a criticism of Ministers, I should keep the House sitting here for hours.  I assume that I am the Deputy to whom Deputy Linehan referred as the Deputy who did not know whether Mr. de Valera or Mr. Cosgrave was the worse.  I may say that I was at one time a member of the Fianna Fáil organisation.  I worked hard for it and canvassed hard for it&mdash;may God forgive me.  I found afterwards that I was wrong.  I am not going to vote for any of the Ministers on the list before me nor am I going to vote against them because I have nobody to vote for.  If I were to indulge in criticism, I could criticise the Minister responsible for the County Management Act or I could criticise the Minister to whom Deputy Everett referred as being responsible for the disgraceful standstill Order in regard to wages, an Order that would not be tolerated in any other country in the world, an Order that is in conflict <Col N="152" /> with the teachings of Pope Leo who held that every worker was entitled to a wage to enable him to bring up his family in Christian decency.</P>
      <P>In enforcing that Order, you are working in direct opposition to the teaching of all the Popes, to the teaching of Christ's Vicar on earth.  I could not support the Minister placed in charge of land division, nor the Minister responsible for having 13 of my constituents in jail, one of whom was at one time a member of this House and another of whom is a colleague of my own on the Laoighis County Council.  When the Land Commission would not divide the land in Killeshin area, those men, because they were anxious to put in practice the teachings of Fintan Lalor&mdash;that the land of Ireland belonged to the people of Ireland, without fee or fealty, rent or render to any foreign power whatsoever&mdash;went in on the land and ploughed it in order to produce more food for the people, as demanded by the Government.  They were brought before a special court and got six months in jail, but the very moment they come out you will have to put them into jail again, because they believe that this land should be utilised for the people.  I say that if any action were taken to divide the lands in my constituency, these 13 of my constituents would not be in jail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received a communication from the Political Prisoners' Committee drawing my attention to the fact that several of these prisoners have been deprived of their liberty although no charge has been preferred against them and although they did not commit any offence.  They are in jail for holding the same principles as Wolfe Tone, Pearse and Connolly, because they were out for a 32-County Republic just as I am out for it.  We never hear about the Republic here now.  The Taoiseach can go down to Wolfe Tone's grave and talk about the principles of Wolfe Tone, but when he comes back here he has to abandon all these fine principles because the Irish people are tied down to the Bank of England.  Fine Gael are no <Col N="153" /> better in that respect than Fianna Fáil.  I read in a newspaper a short time ago a statement by Deputy Dr. Ryan in his own constituency in which he said that there was no difference between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. That was the first time that Deputy Dr. Ryan ever told the truth in his life. There is no difference between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have criticised Deputy MacEntee and I think they have every right to do so.  I certainly would be ashamed to use some of the references which he made about Mr. O'Farrell, about any man.  I would not use such language myself and I am only a Deputy and not a Minister of State.  I am not familiar with the procedure in this House and perhaps I lack experience in that respect, but I heartily approve of these statements from the Labour Benches.  I want, however, to make my position quite clear.  I do not care &ldquo;tuppence&rdquo; about Fianna Fáil; I care less for Fine Gael and I care nothing about the Labour Party.  I was elected by my constituents to assist as far as I can in establishing a 32-county Ireland.  I demand the release of Seán McCool and the other Republican prisoners. Immediately after I was elected, I sent a telegram to the Taoiseach demanding the release of these prisoners and asking for an immediate reply.  He did not reply to me at all. The telegram was given to some official or member of his staff who wrote back saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of the 25th instant and to say that an application in the matter to which you refer should be made to the appropriate Minister, that is, the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Justice as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently, he did not know which of them I should apply to.  Whoever he is, these men should not be in jail and it is up to us, to the members of the Labour Party and of every other Party, to demand the release of these men, some of whom fought with you in 1916 and 1921.  They are men who hold the same principles as you held <Col N="154" /> before you came into the Dáil and got your pensions.  They could not be bought.  No money could buy them. As far as I am concerned no money can buy me.  I would not sell my principles for any money and I would like to meet any man who tried to buy me.</P>

      <P>The principles of the Deputy are not at issue; the principles of the proposed Ministers may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no principles of Ministers to be in question. Although I heard several Deputies in this House criticising Ministers, as I am criticising them, I heard no Deputy explain how Ministers could improve their administration in the years to come.  If Deputy Linehan, Deputy Byrne, Deputy Cosgrave or my colleague, Deputy O'Higgins, went over there for one year to the Ministers' Benches or even if I myself found a place there, under present circumstances, we would turn out every bit as rotten as the Ministers themselves. As I told you this morning, there is no use fooling the people over these matters because, as Deputies, we are powerless while the present system is operated.  Many of my constituents were born in debt, they are living in debt and they will die in debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not desire to delay the House much longer.  I am only 23 years of age, and this is my first appearance in the House, but if I were to remain here until I reached the age of 80, until I became an old man with a beard down to my chest, I would be able to do nothing to improve conditions while the present system is operated. I have every sympathy with Ministers who are trying to work under that system, but if they are under the impression that they can achieve anything in that way, I think they are only deceiving themselves.  Deputy Alfred Byrne says that we want more Ministers. Well, we have a Minister for Supplies, but we have no supplies at all.  We have a Minister for Lands, but we all know that land division is held up.  I think there are too many Ministers, and indeed too many T.D.'s <Col N="155" /> in present circumstances.  We are only an excuse; I am an excuse, like every other Deputy, because we are tied up with certain people without whose good-will we cannot do anything.  The people over there are the people who control all power in this country.  He who controls the purse controls the tune, and the hand that gives, rules the hand that takes.  I cannot vote for any of these Ministers who have been nominated.  I cannot vote for anybody else, and I am not going to vote at all.</P>
    <P>I only wish that every member of this House had the same grasp of things that I have.  I met a Deputy on the lawn to-night who asked me how I was, and said that he had not seen me for a long time.  He said: &ldquo;I am sorry you left the Fianna Fáil organisation; you had a great cumann down in Mountmellick, and I am sorry you left it.&rdquo;  I said that I was sorry I had anything to do with it.  I know Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who agree with my policy and my teaching, but they are afraid to say anything against the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>I apologise.  It is not the Dáil, it is the Fianna Fáil Party. I could be talking here for hours, but I would be only wasting my time. There is nothing further I have to say except that I am not voting for these Ministers.  I have no one to vote for; therefore, I am not voting.  So far as de Valera and Cosgrave and Republicanism are concerned, the Ulster <Col N="156" /> Government in the North, the Southern Government in the South and the English Government all have the same respect for republicans. They lock them up and put them in prison.  I say, open the prison gates.</P>

      <P>The existing Government holds office until its successor is appointed.  Its successor is not appointed until this is voted on by the Dáil, one way or other.  I say again that I think it would not be right, in <Col N="158" /> view of the line pursued in this debate, that I should simply make a few perfunctory remarks in the space of four or five minutes.  I think the situation demands something very much more than that, and, consequently, inevitably we will have to sit to-morrow. The only point is the one which has just been mentioned by the Minister for Supplies, that I should be allowed a reasonable time to reply; in view of the fact that this debate has gone on for several hours, during which all sorts of attacks and all sorts of statements have been made.  I think I should get an hour to conclude.</P>
