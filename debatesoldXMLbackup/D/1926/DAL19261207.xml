The position is that, apart from the sum voted specifically for the relief of unemployment and distress (£50,000), <Col N="445" /> provision has already been made by the Government in the Estimates for the current year of a kind likely to help in securing the same object.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister take into account the fact that these sums were voted nine months ago, that there is still a very great amount of unemployment in the country, and that therefore these sums have been found not to be adequate?

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how much money we vote, I do not think we could cover all the areas.  The general view taken when the Estimates were being framed was that works of a capital nature should be pushed ahead as quickly as possible, and as big sums as possible expended on them in the present year in order to relieve unemployment. We might have done less in that respect and given less employment and have had no more criticism than we have had.  I do not think it can be taken that there is any negligence because we are spending the money on what might be called ordinary constructive work rather than on special relief schemes.</P>

      <P>I am accustomed to be treated with discourtesy from the Front Benches, but I appeal now to the Chair.  Am I not entitled to know what the express purport of the answer is, granted that I am so stupid as to fail to understand it?  Is the Minister aware that on December 7th, 1925, the President used these words&mdash;I quote them from Vol. 13, Col. 1,312 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>They&mdash;the British Government&mdash; were not out to haggle over petty details or minor considerations.  They were prepared to take the bold course ... They agreed to close all outstanding questions of controversy with us....</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the Seanad on the 16th December the President practically repeated the same statement?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reconcile these two statements? In December, when the matter was under full discussion in the Dáil, the President declared that the cancellation of Article V. was practically an agreement to close all outstanding questions.  Now we arc given a document which was signed in March which includes a considerable number of items, and these are over and above the items included in the settlement under the cancellation of Article V. Will the Minister give us an opportunity of debating this matter?  It is a very important thing.  It commits the State to millions of money.  It remits payments to which we are entitled and that has been done, so far as I am aware, without the sanction of the House.</P>

Special efforts have been made to procure steel, and these are being maintained.  Possibly within five weeks from now the necessary steel will be available to enable us to deal with the principal portion of the building. We have already exhausted our work at the Custom House; we are more than ahead of time there.</P>

      <P>I think I had a deputation last year, and I pointed out to the deputation that it would scarcely be a proper thing to deal with this question of the trapping of foxes in a Game Preservation Bill.  Foxes, to a great extent, live on young game. This argument in favour of fox-hunting apparently is that it encourages horse-breeding.  If the Minister for Lands and Agriculture thinks so, presumably he will deal with the matter by way of legislation.</P>

I can <Col N="455" /> show the Minister letters from Secretaries of Fox-Hunting Clubs complaining that foxes are scarce in the country because of the trapping of them and the selling of the pelts for the making of women's wearing apparel.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of procedure, I think that in view of the Minister's statement we should understand how we are placed.  I understand from the Minister's statement that he intends to embody most of the recommendations of the Committee in the new Land Bill, but that there are certain recommendations of the Committee which he does not intend to embody. As I understand the procedure, if the <Col N="474" /> recommendations which arc left out have no relevance to any existing section in the new Bill when it comes before the House, then Deputies will have no power to discuss these particular recommendations.  I suggest that it is a very important matter.  Certain recommendations were put before the Select Committee and debated.  In some cases they were carried by a vote. If the Minister now decides not to embody those recommendations in the new Land Bill it will mean that they cannot be discussed by the Dáil in a way that would afford an opportunity of their being carried.  They could only be discussed on the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I want to point out that it is a weakness in procedure and the setting up of Selection Committees is only a farce if all their recommendations are not embodied in a Bill.  If the Minister, in introducing his new Bill, embodied all the recommendations in it, he could also, of course, on the Committee Stage, move amendments to delete those that he objected to, but, at any rate, that would give an opportunity to the Dáil to discuss all the recommendations carried by the Select Committee.  As matters stand, we cannot discuss recommendations not embodied in the Bill.  I maintain that is a weakness in our procedure.</P>

      <P>That is what is being suggested.  The Deputy can get a discussion on these matters. If he wants a decision he can get it by bringing in a Bill, or by putting down a motion of a particular kind.  If Deputies are interested in getting a decision on a particular matter which concerns the House, and the peace, order and good government of the country, we can always find a method of getting that decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to let it pass that the Select Committee has been treated with disrespect.  What has occurred is that the Committee which has been set up has made about thirty recommendations, some of them extremely <Col N="476" /> important.  I propose to introduce a very much extended Bill, introducing about twenty-five of these recommendations. It will then be easy for Deputies to move amendments to the Bill on the Committee Stage.  I do not say that does not exclude them from putting in some amendment which may not be in order on the Bill.  It is incorrect to say that we should condemn the whole Select Committee procedure because of the action I am taking in this matter. I am accepting four-fifths of the important findings of the Committee, and I propose to introduce a new Bill embodying them, and that will extend the power to introduce amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that though the Minister has said he is going to introduce a Bill embodying twenty-five out of thirty recommendations of the Committee, it is within the Minister's power, according to the procedure laid down, to introduce only five out of the thirty.  If he happens to deal with the twenty-five recommendations it is only by a chance.  I maintain that the procedure of appointing a Select Committee at all is practically a waste of time.  In fact, it only amounts to an advisory committee, the recommendations of which the Minister may or may not take, despite the fact that the recommendations are carried by a majority of the Committee.  I suggest that procedure is not helping the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Every committee is an advisory committee, and the Dáil, when it comes to deal with the recommendations, may reject every single one of the proposals made.  Not only may the Minister say &ldquo;I do not agree with the Committee,&rdquo; but any Deputy can stand up and say &ldquo;I do not agree with the Committee.&rdquo; Deputies may argue about it, but the great value of a Committee is that members get closer to one another and can argue out a matter of details better than in the House.  Deputy Heffernan wants a decision on certain points, and a procedure can be outlined for Deputy Heffernan which will enable him to get a decision.  I do not know what the Deputy wants to have decided, but I know that procedure can be found for getting a decision on a matter that concerns the House.</P>

      <P>That it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas of all the expenses of carrying into effect any Act of the present Session to make provision for the regulation and control of wireless telegraphy on land, at sea, and in the air, and for the regulation and control of certain classes of visual and sound signalling stations, and for the establishment and maintenance of State Broadcasting Stations, and to provide for other matters relating to Wireless Telegraphy, Signalling and Broadcasting respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main expense in connection with <Col N="484" /> broadcasting will, of course, arise from the establishment and maintenance of broadcasting stations.  Other expenses of a more or less trivial nature will arise from the collection of licence fees and from various headquarters expenses, but they will be very small.  In general, we may say that the expenses to be borne under this Bill will be in connection with the carrying on of broadcasting stations.  The amount of this will, of course, depend on the number of stations and on the class of station that is in existence at any particular time.  It is anticipated that the licence fees, and such other revenues as may be obtained as, for instance, from the tax on wireless instruments, should suffice, or very nearly suffice, to pay the whole expense of maintaining the broadcasting service, and that contributions from the general taxpayer, if any at all, should be small.</P>

      <P>I am not resisting the proposal of the Minister that it is expedient to get money for the control of wireless&mdash;that is, with regard to the maintenance of the broadcasting stations, but the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs conveyed very little information to us.  They gave us no outline of what this scheme is going to cost the country.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, speaking in the Dáil on 30th November, stated: &ldquo;It would surprise me if from fees alone we should not reach a sum of £20,000 during the current financial year.  That sum, plus a lesser sum which we expect to get from import duties, will place us in a sound financial position.&rdquo; We would be very glad to get some information from the Minister for Finance as to what sums have been collected to date from the import duties.  What sum do they expect, in the light of their recent experience, will accrue to the Exchequer under the Finance Act of 1926?  I confess that I find it difficult at this time of great financial stringency to approve of the policy of imposing a charge on the taxpayer in respect of broadcasting.  I think it is not a fair thing to do.  Even though the Minister may say it is a small sum; yet, after all, it is not a wise <Col N="485" /> course.  You are really imposing duties on the public at large, those who want wireless to the extent of £20,000.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs stated that he was going to erect a wireless station for the Gaeltacht.  I confess that I have the feeling that if the Government could give bread to the people there it would be better than giving them a wireless station. We have no information; no figures have been put before us as to what the charge will be on the taxpayer.  I do not think it is right that, at present, any money, even one penny, should be expended in respect of this service, which places an additional burden on the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>The reason why the Bill is necessary is that powers must be obtained to ensure that those who are in a position to get benefit out of broadcasting shall pay.  If it were possible without this Bill to collect the licence fees it would not be so urgently necessary to have it.  Certain expenditure has been authorised by the Dáil in the Estimates of the present year and in the Appropriation Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise at the moment.  The object of the present Bill is simply to secure that the whole or the great bulk of the charge shall not fall on the general taxpayer. The amount of money that broadcasting will cost will depend upon the number of broadcasting stations that are established, on the class of the broadcasting stations, and on the sort of programme that is given, but it is not possible at this stage on a general Broadcasting Bill to give an estimate of all the developments that will take place in the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister states that it is not possible in a general estimate to give an outline of what will occur in the future, but at the same time let me point out that, in fact, he is making provision, and in effect he asks us to give him carte blanche for his expenditure.  He has no right to ask that.  The Estimate for <Col N="486" /> this year was something in the neighbourhood of £30,000.  I believe the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said that he had received about £4,000 in fees.  I asked the Minister in my opening statement: What sum had accrued to the Exchequer from the import duties on wireless apparatus.  He has not given us these figures, and I think that he should give them.  He has surely got them.  When he comes down here asking us to provide the money, surely he must have his case prepared. He must know the net sum he is asking us for, and he has not given us that information.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;The member of Dáil Eireann who is the Chairman of Dáil Eireann immediately before the dissolution of the Oireachtas shall, unless before such dissolution he announces to Dáil Eireann that he does not desire to continue to be a member thereof, be deemed without any actual election to be elected at the ensuing general election as an additional member of Dáil Eireann not representing any constituency and shall as such additional member have all the rights and obligations of an ordinary member of Dáil Eireann <Col N="487" /> (including eligibility for the office of Chairman) save that his death, resignation, or disqualification shall not create a vacancy in the membership of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>To delete lines 32 to 34 inclusive and substitute:&mdash;&ldquo;and shall continue so to be deemed until immediately after Dáil Eireann has elected its Chairman but, save as is hereafter provided, no longer.  The said additional member shall be eligible for the office of Chairman and, if Dáil Eireann elects him to that office, he shall, so long as he continues therein, continue to be deemed to be an additional member of Dáil Eireann, and shall have all the rights and obligations of an ordinary member of Dáil Eireann save that his death.&rdquo;&mdash; Tomás Mac Eoin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to meet all the case that was made by the Minister for Justice and yet to secure that the Dáil which will be elected after any general election may still be an elected assembly.  The proposition in the Bill is that the Ceann Comhairle who has presided over the Dáil shall without election be deemed to be a member of the succeeding House and shall continue to be a member of that House while it lasts.  If he is elected as Ceann Comhairle or if he is not elected, he is to remain a member of the House.  The Minister gave the illustration that a person elected as Chairman would be in fact a representative of the constituency of the Dáil.  My proposal is that, in line with the Second Reading of the Bill, the Ceann Comhairle who comes in automatically to the succeeding Dáil is, by the fact of his being a member, open to be elected as the Chairman or the Ceann Comhairle of the new Dáil, but if he fails or does not secure election, if the new House has no confidence in that member, who has come automatically into the House, he will thereupon cease to be a member. The effect would be, of course, that there would not remain in the House one member who has not got the confidence of any constituency, not even <Col N="488" /> the Dáil.  I think all the claims that were put forward by the Minister and accepted by the House are still retained and some of the objections would be met by the adoption of this proposal. I think the danger that would result from having a member of the House in ordinary membership who is not representative of anybody is one too great to allow to be introduced.  I put this as a possible and by no means an improbable position that might be created at some future time:</P>
    <P>The House is elected with fairly equal representation of parties.  A majority prefer not to re-elect that member, who has come automatically into the House because he had previous experience as Ceann Comhairle.  They think that he would be a most suitable person to occupy a Ministerial post, and, therefore, they do not elect him as Ceann Comhairle but he is appointed as a Minister, even Minister for Finance, and there is nothing then left in the Constitution which would prevent such an event happening.  I think it would be most undesirable to make it even possible for an Executive Minister to be a member of the House, because, being a member of the House, he is capable of being appointed as a member of the Executive Council, holding ministerial office but not representing any constituency.  I think it will be seen that that is quite an unfortunate and undesirable possibility.  Yet it is a possibility under the Bill as at present framed.  The amendment would allow all that was set forth by the Minister in the House and by those in favour of the Bill in Committee, and yet would prevent that kind of happening, that is to say, that a person would be a member of the House not representing any constituency, and would prevent even the possibility of such non-representative person being chosen as a Minister. I do not think that any injustice and unfairness could result from the acceptance of this amendment, and, undoubtedly, a considerable risk would be removed.  Therefore, I move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Dáil to reject the amendment.  The Deputy bases his case for the amendment on the position that would arise in the event <Col N="489" /> of the Ceann Comhairle being returned to the new Parliament and not being reappointed to the Chair.  He says that you would then have within the Dáil a member unrepresentative of any constituency. It is recognised, here and elsewhere, that this question of the Speaker is one that cannot be met in a completely satisfactory manner, one that would be entirely satisfying to the logical, constitutional mind of Deputy Johnson and people like him.  Let us see what is done elsewhere.  Elsewhere, in Great Britain, it is recognised that it is highly undesirable to have the Speaker of the House indulging in the everyday polemics and controversies of domestic politics.  He is expected to detach himself from parties and to hold the scales evenly and impartially between parties, and, because a man so placed could not be expected to defend his constituency against the competition of all or many parties, there is agreement between the leaders of parties that the Speaker's constituency will not, in effect, be contested.  That has been the position for many and many a long year.  The Speaker is returned automatically without opposition in his constituency.  That is not entirely satisfying to a man with a logical, constitutional mind, because the consequence of that is that one large and important constituency is, and has been for a long period, disfranchised. It has really, practically speaking, no voice whatever in deciding who shall be returned to Parliament in its name, and it is really unrepresented within the House because it would be straining things to pretend that the Speaker is an adequate or effective representative of any constituency within the House. He is not, of course.  That is the picture in Great Britain&mdash;a constituency in a state of chronic disfranchisement, permanently without an effective representative in Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of that picture let us move on to consider what is proposed here, namely, that the man who has acted as Ceann Comhairle throughout the period of the lifetime of one Parliament shall be returned to the following Parliament, not as representing a constituency.  It is proposed to eliminate that particular fiction, the fiction <Col N="490" /> that is maintained in Great Britain, that the Speaker is, in fact, representative of a constituency while he is never opposed there, and his nomination and return are simply a solemn farce.  It is proposed here that the person who acted as Speaker in the lifetime of one Parliament will be returned to the following Parliament without a constituency.  It shall not be mandatory or compulsory in any sense on the following Parliament to appoint him to the Chair.  It is desired to leave them quite free in that matter. One of the objections I have to Deputy Johnson's proposal is that it does not leave them quite free.  It puts on the new Parliament a kind of moral compulsion. &ldquo;At any rate here is a man in your midst; if you do not appoint him to the Chair he must go out from amongst you.  You banish him from public life.  We are commencing now a Parliament of five years' duration. There is one man here amongst us whom it is open to appoint to the Chair, but if you do not so appoint him, he must walk out and disappear from the political arena for a period that will possibly be one of five years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit, if you introduce that factor into the position, you put a couple of degrees more compulsion on the new Parliament to elect the old Speaker than would otherwise exist, and to that extent I consider it an undesirable factor to introduce into the position. We say, because the Speaker obviously cannot compete for his seat against political parties in the country, because it is undesirable that he should be under the necessity of having so to compete, that he should be placed in a different position with regard to an impending general election from other Deputies.  When he was appointed to the Chair he was called from the service of the constituency which elected him, and was divorced from the ordinary cut and thrust of party politics. He could not effectively represent any constituency from the date of his appointment and, in fact, ceased to try to represent any constituency from the date of his appointment.  It is suggested that a man in that position should be returned without a constituency to the new Parliament.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> If the new Parliament wishes, it can re-appoint him to the Chair.  If it does not, we say he should remain serving in the House, and presumably prepare to contest some constituency outside in the general election that would next follow. But Deputy Johnson says: &ldquo;I go with you to the extent of saying that he should be returned to the following Parliament without a constituency, but, in the event of his not being re-appointed to the Chair, then he should vanish.&rdquo; I object to that on the ground that it puts a few more degrees of compulsion on the new Parliament to reappoint him.  The alternative would be that he would have to vanish from public life entirely.  It is said that if he remains he is a speck on the brightness of your democratic shield, your representative character.  Granted.  No bigger speck than the Speaker in Great Britain, who has never been elected by any constituency, who is never opposed, and whose return is a solemn sham.  If it is a speck on the representative character of Parliament, a great Parliament elsewhere, one that prides itself on being the mother of Parliaments, has such a speck.  The Speaker is no bigger here than there.  If there is any difference, it is that we are more relentless in facing the fact, in tearing away the sham, and in doing the obvious and necessary thing in the light of these facts.  That is the only difference. There the solemn farce is perpetrated, general election after general election, of a Speaker presenting himself, forsooth, for the franchise of a constituency, all parties refraining, and his solemn return without the vote of any elector in that constituency, it being well understood that his return would never be challenged.  It has not been, in fact, challenged, I understand, since 1895.  Deputies may have their own view as to whether there is any great merit, or any great virtue, in keeping the pious sham, whether that holds any great advantage over the course proposed here, namely, the frank return of the Speaker to the next Parliament without a constituency, and remaining in that Parliament, serving as a member in the event of that Parliament not reappointing him to the Chair.  I see <Col N="492" /> no advantage.  I see certain disadvantages in Deputy Johnson's amendment, and I ask the Dáil to reject it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is unfortunate the Minister should have supported his case by what seems to me, in effect, to be a plea that, because a member of the House has been elected as Ceann Comhairle, and has therefore been unable to take part in the cut and thrust of political controversy, he should be allowed as a matter of kindliness and pity to remain a member of the succeeding Parliament, even though the succeeding Parliament does not choose to appoint that person Chairman. There would, according to the Minister, be a certain feeling of pity for him, that it is better he should be allowed to have the privileges of a member of the House, even though he has not a constituency, and even though the House, of which he has become a member, has not seen fit to retain him in the office of Chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To introduce a constitutional amendment and base it, in effect, on a plea for pity for the defeated candidate for the Chair, is playing it on rather too low a scale.  The Minister may say that it is not out of regard for any particular individual that this Bill is brought forward, but because of the feeling that if a speaker is not re-elected to the chair, he will be thrown out in the cold.  That, again, is a small argument for such a constitutional change.  After all, every member has to run that risk, and you do not approach the constituencies on the ground that if the retiring member is not re-elected, well, it will be pitiful; he will be thrown out in the cold, and some regard ought to be had for the fact that he has had already three or four years' experience, his way of life has been changed, and, therefore, he ought to be re-elected out of pity.  The constituencies will not respond usually to that kind of plea, and it is not the right kind of a case to put before the constituencies. Yet that is the case the Minister is putting before the House in favour of retaining, as a member of the House, a person who has not been elected by a constituency, who has not received the approbation or, shall I put it more correctly, has not been deemed <Col N="493" /> a fit and proper person to be appointed to the Chair.  The Minister has not met the case I put up of the possibility that the House may appoint such a person a member of the Executive Council, or even President.</P>

      <P>That has been passed by the House on Second Reading. The greatest part of the Minister's speech was really Second Reading discussion.  I am dealing with the proposal contained in the amendment presuming, as we must presume, that the person who has held the office of Ceann Comhairle comes in automatically to the succeeding Dáil, without election, to give an opportunity to the new House to elect one who has had experience and still to allow that person to remain outside the cut and thrust of political activity.  If, then, it is found that the new House does not approve of that person being its Chairman, the Minister proposes that he should remain a member of the House.  I say that not having secured the confidence of the House, and not having been elected by any constituency, he ought not to be a member of the House.  The Minister agrees that it ought not to be allowed that such a member should have an opportunity of being a Minister, that it should be a constitutional prohibition, but he thinks such a person ought to be a member of the House not representing any constituency but having all the other privileges of membership.  I say the Minister has made no case against the amendment and I hope the House will express its views upon it.</P>

    <P>I move this amendment because, while it is thought that the normal lifespan of Parliament should be five years, and while the intention is to fix it at five years in the Electoral Act, as Deputy Johnson and others pointed out on the Second Reading of this Bill, circumstances might arise which would make it desirable to prolong the lifetime of Parliament.  In such a set of circumstances it would be more easy to amend the ordinary law of the country than to proceed by way of amendment of the Constitution.  For that reason, I ask the Dáil to agree that the constitutional maximum should be fixed not at five <Col N="497" /> years, which, in our view, ought to be the normal period of the life of Parliament, but at the longer period of six years, on the understanding that five years is what will be fixed by law.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the Schedule, Deputy Johnson looked for some explanation to justify the continuance of the Local Government (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916.  The Minister for Finance agreed to have some statement made that would explain the necessity for the continuance of this particular measure.  At the outset I would like to say that equally with Deputy Johnson I suffer as a result of not having the reports that he referred to on that particular occasion, as such reports would be of great help to me in administering the Department.  I am not in any way anxious to withhold information from Deputies, but these reports have not been forthcoming. It is just as well for Deputies to recollect that Local Government for the last five or six years has been in a state bordering on chaos.  We had for a considerable period two authorities struggling for supremacy in the control of Local Government, and, as a result of their opposition, officials throughout the country at times found it very difficult to know what Government to recognise and what duties to carry out and what duties not to carry out.  That applied to the officials of the local authorities, including rate collectors and other important officers.  I might also mention that the Custom House was burned in the campaign during the hostilities with the British forces, and as a result of that our records were destroyed during the struggle.  During the struggle with the Crown Forces and during the recent domestic disturbances here an exceptional burden was thrown on practically every section of my Department. I might refer to the roads.  These were picked out for particular attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also carried through an amalgamation scheme which has considerably upset the administration of the Poor Law in the country.  The Local Government Act, by the abolition of the rural councils, has put considerable additional work upon my Department <Col N="499" /> Section 13 of the Local Government (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916, which we are continuing, deals mainly with the publication of Local Taxation Returns and Annual Reports of the Department.  It removes the obligation to publish abstracts of the receipts and payments of local bodies, and to append to the Department's Annual Report certain statements as to orders and directions in respect of outdoor relief, etc., as required by the Poor Relief Act.</P>
    <P>There are two reports required under statute to be furnished by my Department. The Local Government Application of Enactments Order, 1898, requires that the Department shall prepare, each year, an abstract of the returns and receipts and payments of local authorities under the Local Government Act.  The local taxation returns are required to be sent to this Department by local bodies within one month after the completion of audit. The holding of local audits was considerably in arrear in 1922, and since then additional audit work has arisen as a result of the adjustments consequent on the abolition of boards of guardians and rural district councils. The audits are now well advanced and under way, but it is desirable that the provisions of Section 13 of the Act of 1916 be retained for another year. Sections 21 and 23 of the Act of 1916 are ancillary to Section 13 as they relate to the application of that section to Ireland.  The other return that is to be issued in my Department is in connection with the Act of 1872.  Section 7 of that Act (the Local Government Act of 1872) enacts that the Department shall, once in each year, make a report concerning the execution of the several powers and duties vested in them.  The Department recently sent to the Stationery Office for printing a report dealing with the administration of local government and public health for the years 1922 to 1925.  So our statutory obligations regarding that particular Act will be performed when that is printed.  The local taxation returns are being prepared and it is expected that they will be ready next year; so that will meet that obligation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> The Department at all times afforded the fullest information on all matters within its jurisdiction, both in the Oireachtas and before public commissions. I think that information should be sufficient for Deputies at the moment.</P>

      <P>Before you finish with the Schedule of this Bill, I want to call the attention of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to the fifth item on this Schedule, that is, the Motor Car Act of 1903.  An explanation of this Act was furnished to Deputies, and I must say that the explanation given as to the necessity for insisting on the continuance of this Act does not meet with my approval.  I did not introduce an amendment to delete the Act because I can quite understand that some form of control is necessary until the new Bill is passed into law. But I want to point out to the Minister that, in my opinion and in the opinion of a great many of the motoring public, the law passed as far back as 1903 is absolutely obsolete as far as the control of those motoring is concerned. For instance, there is the twenty-mile speed limit.  It is mentioned in the explanation that those questions are very debatable.  I want to say to the Minister that all questions of that kind are debatable, but still there is a very large majority of people interested in motoring who are in favour of the introduction of some kind of new laws to control in some other way the speed of motor cars.  Anybody who has some little acquaintance with motoring must know that under certain conditions and in certain places it is perfectly safe to drive thirty and forty miles an hour, and even in some places fifty miles an hour, with perfect safety, while it is quite unsafe to drive at ten miles an hour in other places.  But still the law remains such that the Gárda Síochána can set a trap and prosecute motorists for driving over twenty miles an hour. <Col N="501" /> I suggest to the Minister that such a condition of affairs is not desirable and that legislation should be introduced to bring up to date the laws regarding the speed of motor cars.  I think very cogent arguments can be used in favour of the change which I suggest ought to be made in the law.  I would ask the Minister if he has given any consideration to that matter and if he has any intention of introducing legislation in the near future to deal with it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to add a word on this matter.  In view of the money that the State is expending on roads, straightening them, taking off curves and putting the roads into what is an ideal state, I want to know if the Minister still holds that motorists should not travel on those nice, new, straight roads at a higher speed than twenty miles an hour, and that if they do so the Gárda are entitled to prosecute and entitled on prosecution to a conviction if the speed is over twenty miles?  I think everybody knows that the law that was good in 1903 is obsolete now so far as the speed of motor cars is concerned and that those laws should be brought up to date.  The law at present is quite a farce when we know the speed at which motor cars can travel with safety on the roads.  Deputy Heffernan put the thing in a nutshell when he stated that motorists can travel at twenty, twenty-five or thirty miles an hour.  I do not recommend any man to travel faster than thirty miles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that ancient House.  However, everything was not all right.  I would ask Deputies to focus attention on the implications and provisions in Section 18:</P>
      <P>(1) Within twelve months from the date of the passing of this Act every council having power to appoint a coroner shall, subject to the approval of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, revise the salaries payable to the coroner or coroners appointed by such council: provided that the salary payable to a coroner holding office at the date of the passing of this Act shall in no case be diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there are in Section 18 principles which we cannot very well admit, either at the moment or even at any time.  The proposal here is that the salaries of coroners should be revised. There is a proviso, but the principle is that the salaries are to be revised. There are really two provisos, and the revision must be subject to the approval of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, but in no case can the salaries be reduced. In other words, bureaucracy can take the sovereign people of the country into court and tell them, in effect, &ldquo;It is heads we win and tails you lose.&rdquo; I do not think that is a desirable principle to introduce in our legislation. Have the people of the country got no rights?  In the office of coroner, or any <Col N="504" /> other public position, no man is compelled, coerced or conscripted.  The people in those positions take up office of their own free will.  Some of us are very well aware of the canvassing and the intrigues in order to get these public jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle contained in this section is that when the coroners have their salaries revised it means they are increased subject to the approval of the Minister. What case has been put up for increasing salaries?  I put two questions on to-day's Order Paper in order to elicit information.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health had not the full details, but he told me that the average salary was from £30 to £250 per annum.  I asked whether special fees in respect of inquests and travelling expenses were given, and the Minister for Justice had no information, neither had the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case ought to be made why these salaries should be raised.  I could give cogent reasons why at the present time the country cannot afford to increase any national or local taxation.  What is the effect of this going to be in the country where local authorities are confronting tremendous odds, where they are coping with former enactments which safeguard local officers, and where the capacity to pay on the part of the people demands that revision must be made in the light of the present economic situation?  I claim that this section runs counter to all that big principle, and that the many are subordinated to the interests of the few. I think that should not be so.  The taxpayer must have some consideration, <Col N="505" /> and it is our bounden duty to get some justice for him.  When we ask to have the section deleted, we are leaving the salaries as they are.  We have no evidence that the coroners made any demand for an increase of salary. Quite irrespective of that, and independent of that, the Bill proposes to make it obligatory upon local bodies to revise the salaries in the sense of an increase. That is not a fair proposition.  With prices for farm produce generally down to pre-war, I should like to find a justification for such a section as this.  It may be said that this is a small thing&mdash; that from an actuarial point of view the burden that it will impose on the people may not be very much&mdash;but the principle behind it is so big that we certainly could not let such a proposition go unchallenged.  What is to prevent other bodies of local employees, or even civil servants, getting a Bill like this carried through the Seanad in this way to get their position stereotyped, and to make it obligatory upon local authorities or the Government to revise salaries in the sense of increase?  I say it is a dangerous principle to admit.</P>
    <P>Of course, I am aware, and the Minister is aware, that you can never establish a precedent in wrong-doing, but will you get that readily established down the country?  If we pass this Bill as it stands, will not local authorities say that their efforts to effect economies are thwarted by the inclusion of such a section?  There is no justification put forward for the increasing of coroners' salaries.  Their job is only a part-time one at most, thank God for the peace and good name of the country they are not given jobs every day.  Why should we pass a section like this when there are no further duties imposed upon coroners?  I have yet to have it established that they do not get fees in respect of every inquest in the shape of travelling expenses.  I say that it is not a fair thing, with the people struggling to live as they are, that this provision should be put in.  It may be said that we can safely leave the matter in the hands of the Minister for Local Government. But the Dáil is shirking its own responsibility, and it should not put the responsibility on the Minister for Local Government in regard to the fixing of <Col N="506" /> these salaries.

      <P>Deputy Hogan has, as we are well aware, a vivid imagination, and occasionally he gives rein to it.  This evening, under the magic of that imagination, the Clare County Council became the sovereign people, being led into the dock by a bureaucratic junta.  A county council&mdash;coming down to mere prose and the facts of the situation&mdash;is elected on a very much more restricted franchise than the franchise on which the Dáil is elected, and why a county council should be the sovereign people in contra-distinction to a bureaucratic junta, which is a Government elected by the Dáil, which in turn is elected on an adult suffrage basis, I really do not know, and probably Deputy Hogan would take too long to explain it.  But his objection to the section is that this bureaucratic junta is dictating to the sovereign people, in the shape of the Clare County Council, an increase in the salary of a particular officer.  In fact it is not.  Quite apart from nicknames, the fact is not that any increase is being dictated.  The duty is imposed on them of reviewing, reconsidering, bringing expressly before them, the question of the coroner's salary.  Then, if a coroner is aggrieved, by the neglect or refusal of a council to revise his salary, pursuant to sub-section (1) he may appeal to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who shall thereupon, after consultation with the Minister for Justice, fix the salary at such rate as he thinks proper&mdash;not necessarily a higher rate, not necessarily a different rate, but at such a rate as he thinks proper.  The sole effect of the section is to provide a protection for a particular officer against the type of mind which says that because farm produce is down to the pre-war figure&mdash;incidentally this is an additional lie&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy is enthusiastic.  The Minister for Local Government is in a position of responsibility to the Dáil.  It is absurd to talk in mere perfervid rhetoric about bureaucratic juntas.  He is, in fact, in a much more responsible position than the Clare County Council, or any county council, and under this section any order he makes fixing a salary is open to the fullest criticism.  I should think that even the Deputy would recognise that he is not going to intervene to use the powers conferred by that particular section unless the case is very strong indeed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Unless the particular county council is so utterly unreasonable, so utterly out of accord with the average standard prevailing up and down through the other counties of the State&mdash;that there is a compelling case for him to intervene to do equity. I cannot agree with the Deputy's amendment proposing to delete the section.  He says, &ldquo;Why throw the onus on him?&rdquo; Because, unfortunately, cases have come under his notice, as I think they have come under the notice of all of us, where the local bodies through the country, rushing in a panicky way, without much sense of perspective, from one extreme to the other, have endeavoured to strike rates <Col N="508" /> for officers at one time or another that were very far from being an adequate remuneration for their services, and a section of this kind in the Bill is required in the light of those facts.  It is not by injustice, it is rather by a general, careful stewardship that economies will be effected and should be effected. But it is no substitute for that general, careful, prudent stewardship to turn round panic-stricken and try to take it all out of the skin of some unfortunate official and to say: &ldquo;Because we have been reckless, because we have been improvident, because we have been extravagant, you shall work for half pay.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think, however fluent the language of the Minister, that he has explained away the position or the application of the terms contained in the clause.  It says: &ldquo;Every council having power to appoint a coroner shall, subject to the approval of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, revise the salaries.&rdquo; What is the meaning of the word &ldquo;revision&rdquo;?  If revision can only mean change in one direction, then the word is not used in its proper application. I do not know what is in the mind of the Minister for Justice when he seeks to right an imaginary wrong. If it is the real wrong, I know nothing about it.  I am not aware of any case where the man is paid half salary for work done.  I think I can see in all this the finger of someone representing one or other of the professions.  I think we are beginning to realise that the professions have their thumb upon the throat of the taxpayer.  Especially have they raised the standard during the years of the war, when money was flowing all over the country.  That position is not only now being stabilised, but a provision is sought to be made for revision with a view to an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice sneered at the prices of agricultural produce now, and the prices in 1914.  He made a haphazard statement that prices are 30 or 40 per cent. higher now than they were then.  But he omitted&mdash;and whether it was a studied omission or not I am not in a position to say&mdash;to <Col N="509" /> mention the cost of national upkeep since 1914, and the percentage by which it was raised, and, also, he omitted to mention by what percentage the taxes were increased.  He has not told us by what per cent. the cost of labour and machinery and the upkeep of the farm have increased.  He has omitted all the other things that weigh equally in the balance with what he described as 30 or 40 or 50 per cent. increase in prices. He omitted to say that all this extra cost that we did not have in 1914 has turned the scale, and has put the farmer in a position in which he is 50 per cent. worse off than he was in 1914.</P>
    <P>In 1914 the farmers knew where they were.  I speak from experience.  They knew what their profits and their taxes were to be, and the country never was in a position of greater security than it was in 1914.  The boom years of the war did not give us security.  They gave us wealth, but they did not give us security, and we are reaping the whirlwind. I say that this section of the professional classes are trying to set up a standard that we cannot afford.  The principle is wrong, and it may be too late when the Minister comes to realise the position that has been brought about by it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish also to support this amendment moved by Deputy Hogan.  I think he has put the case fairly before the House.  This revision, or so-called revision, set up by the Minister is a one-sided affair.  If this revision is to be made it will certainly be a revision that will not be detrimental to the person holding the office of coroner at present.  They are given quite a free hand.  Every coroner in the country to-day could appeal to the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Local Government with safety on the question of salary, because the salary could not be in any way reduced under this provision, and if it was not increased it must at least be left as it is. Coroners would take their chance and go to the Minister in the hope that they would get an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the state of the country warrant such increases to-day?  Are the people called upon to pay to have no word whatever in fixing the salaries of these gentlemen?  That is left to the <Col N="510" /> Minister for Justice and the Minister for Local Government, the people dare not raise a finger, and even if these salaries are extravagant they cannot decrease them.  They must either increase the salary or leave it as it is. This is the most unfair section which could be put into a Bill, and I certainly will support the amendment moved by Deputy Hogan for its deletion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Hogan is to be commended on having drawn the attention of the Dáil to this section.  The Minister made a case in opposition to the amendment that there is no obligation here to raise salaries. I imagine he is reading the word &ldquo;revise&rdquo; in perhaps its original meaning as being &ldquo;to look at it again.&rdquo; It is quite obvious that in this section it means that there is to be a change in the salary and that that change must be upwards.  There is also a contradiction in the section.  The section in the third part of it seems to suggest the possibility that the salary should remain where it is, but the first part says there shall be revision and that the salary shall not be diminished.  In effect that practically says there must be a change, and a change upwards.  I would like somebody defending the section to tell us what the range of salary for coroners is and whether it is merely a honorarium or a retaining fee or how it is at present fixed.  Someone in charge of the Bill should be able to give information upon this question.</P>
      <P>Supposing this section is deleted, what harm is done to the Bill?  There is nothing to prevent the coroner approaching the county council and nothing to prevent the county council submitting a case to the Minister for Local Government.  If the section is deleted all that is removed from the Bill is the compulsion that the salary shall be revised upwards subject to appeal to the Minister.  I think the deletion of this section is not going to do any harm to anybody and might do a good deal of good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does undoubtedly involve principle that we should be asked to approve of automatic changes in salary without having any information as to what the salaries are for, how they are fixed and upon what scale they are based.  It is <Col N="511" /> an unfortunate suggestion that we should be asked to vote this automatic increase without having any knowledge of the facts in regard to coroners' salaries, and inasmuch as there can be no harm done to any coroner by deleting this and in the absence of any justification for its retention I shall vote for its deletion.</P>

      <P>You have to understand what the Bill sets out to do.  It is, in fact, a codification of the law bearing on the coroner's position.  It establishes the office and proceeds to lay down the statutory conditions governing it.  In this section it provides that, within a year from the passing of the Act, the salary of the coroner shall, as I interpret it, come under review. If I find on investigation that I am wrong in believing that the language of this section involves anything more than an examination of the salary of the coroner, I am prepared to bring forward the necessary amendment.</P>

      <P>I did not realise that.  At that rate, I am prepared to leave this Bill over for investigation as to whether the effect of the section is to impose, and necessarily to impose, an increase.  If it is, I would not stand for it myself, but I take it that the effect of the language of the section is simply to necessitate a review and an examination of the salaries paid to the coroners in the various counties, and to put it within the power of any officer dissatisfied with the result of such examination to appeal to the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Justice. But let us suppose for a moment that the effect of the language is as I state.  You are establishing this office and you are wiping out all prior legislation bearing on it; you are, in fact, setting up an office now in the Free State, and in the course of your Bill doing that it is laid down that there should be within a year an examination of the salary paid to the coroner with a view to seeing whether, in fact, it is an adequate return for the duties imposed by this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the result of the Bill will be a necessary increase in the duties of the coroner, and in the light of that it is said that within a year, when the effect of the Bill, and so on, is fully demonstrated, there should be an examination of the salary paid to this officer clearly with a view to seeing whether he is in receipt of adequate remuneration for work done, and then he is given an appeal in the event of his being dissatisfied with the result of such examination. I will meet Deputies to this extent, and only to this extent, that if I find the effect of the language is to impose an increase, and not merely to necessitate an examination, I will see that the language is altered; but if I am right, and if the only effect of the section is to make it necessary for the county councils through the country within the year to bring under consideration the salary of this officer, and to provide him with an appeal from the result of such consideration, then I would not alter the Bill at all.  If, as Deputy Johnson and Deputy Hogan seem to think, this section says there must be an increase before there is any examination of the result of the Act, whether in fact it does mean an increased volume of work for the officer or not, then I would not stand over that.  What I propose now to the Dáil is to leave this Bill, which cannot be considered in any sense an urgent Bill, over until Tuesday next with a view to a more careful examination of the section, and of making quite sure what the language involves.  If Deputy Hogan is right in his interpretation of the section, then I would circulate an amendment simply imposing the necessity for an examination, so that the item shall, so to speak, come before the county councils within a year.  They will decide then in the light of the work <Col N="513" /> which the coroner is actually doing what they consider adequate remuneration. If he is dissatisfied with that, he has first an appeal, not to the Minister for Local Government alone, or to myself alone, but to the Minister for Local Government in consultation with the Minister for Justice.  As I say, there would need to be a strong case for the officer before any Minister who must stand criticism in the Dáil, and before the public would intervene to use the powers conferred by this section.  But Deputies should not shut their minds to the possibility that there might be a strong case, and a very strong case, for the officer, and that there have been, not too frequently, indeed, but there have been quite sufficiently frequently, cases to warrant the introduction of this section&mdash;cases where local bodies proposed to flagrantly underpay officials simply in a kind of blind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a matter in connection with Section 17, and three or four other sections, which I would like the Minister to deal with.  I am referring to sub-section (4), which says that &ldquo;An appeal shall lie from the decision of the comptroller under this section to the law officer.&rdquo; I am not dealing with the subject of the appeal in this case.  There are three or four other sections, and some one, particularly, which deals with an appeal from the comptroller to the law officer on the question of law as to the morality of a design or trade-mark.  My point is as to whether it is not undesirable to have an appeal to the Attorney-General, who may be a political officer at some time, and may be a contestant in a case in the courts.  I am not sure, but I think this is probably an adaptation from the Lord Chancellor in England. I suggest that it is undesirable to have an appeal from the comptroller to the law officer, who is an advisor of the Government, and who may be required to appear in the courts on behalf of the State on a matter on which he would perhaps be giving judgment. The idea runs right through the Bill that the appeal from the comptroller is to the Attorney-General.  It seems that some defence is required of that provision, and I would like to have some views from the Minister in defence of that line of policy.</P>

There is an appeal to the law officer in cases which fall more or less under two heads: one, the question of a matter of fact to be determined; and (2) the question of office administration; but where there are the rights of parties in conflict then there should be an appeal to the court and not to the law officer. This is a pretty definite translation to our conditions to what is in the corresponding British legislation, where the <Col N="518" /> appeal is to the Attorney-General and not to the Lord Chancellor.  One specific point has been brought forward which I am fairly well inclined to accept, that is where it does not appear to be a matter of office administration or a discussion of facts, but something more than that, and where it would be invidious to leave it to the Attorney-General to decide.  The distinction we have tried to keep throughout is that where it is on a matter of office administration, or on a matter of ascertaining facts, then it is for the law officer to decide, otherwise it is for the Court.</P>

      <P>The section provides that when a patent which has become abandoned or void the specification and drawings accompanying it shall not be open at any time to public inspection or be published save as otherwise provided.  I am not referring to the other provisions.  The proposition is that there shall be a time limit of twenty years to that prohibition. I suggest that there ought to be a time limit, that, provided the idea has been submitted by drawings and left to the patentee to work upon for twenty years and he has failed to do so, there may be in that idea something that is of use and value to the community, and humanity as a whole, perhaps, and it should then become available for other minds to work upon, that it should not be hidden and absolutely lost to the world.  The period is not material.  I only mention twenty years because it seems to give a fairly long interval between the deposit of the drawings and specifications and the time when it might be reasonably expected to be worked up.  But it ought not to be absolutely lost to humanity, simply because the particular inventor had failed in some way to take advantage of what was a sound valuable idea in its germ.  I cannot think that there is any objection to it.  I am quite prepared to modify the period to any number of years, but I say that we should not preclude the possibility that some bright thought may be absolutely lost to the world.</P>

      <P>There does not seem to be any great objection to this. The relative sections with regard to abandoning and voiding are Sections 16 and 18.  You cannot say at the start that there is any objection to stating that twenty years after the date of the application in a case where the matter is deemed to be abandoned or has become void, it should not be open to public inspection.  The only difficulty I can see&mdash;the only hint of even a difficulty&mdash;is this, that if some valuable idea, contained in some original application, made and not proceeded with, is not published at all, it might thereafter be taken up by somebody and would not be voided for prior publication, whereas if after twenty years from the date of the application it were not merely open to public inspection but happened to be published by the Comptroller, the point might arise that that would prevent any further publication. I would like to get a little time to look into that more deeply.  I cannot see any objection to it at the moment; it does seem to be reasonable that matters of this kind should be open to public inspection at some specified time. I would like the Deputy to leave it over so that I could have the matter I refer to looked into.</P>

      <P>On Section 29, a point which has been raised before and which can fall to be dealt with on many sections can be more properly raised than anywhere else, the point in connection with what are described as enemy patents.  The effect of Section 29 is, briefly, that existing British patents prior to the commencement of the Bill are taken over into this country.  They come over subject to anything that might apply to them on the other side. Now, it must be recognised and definitely stated that that includes, say, such German patents as were confiscated under war legislation in England and licences to work these patents granted by the Board of Trade in England to somebody in the late United <Col N="524" /> Kingdom.  Those are definitely coming over.  In addition, however, this has to be said, that an order was made by the Board of Trade in, I think, July, 1920&mdash;the month is not material&mdash; which gave power to the Board of Trade to modify or to make any disposal of these patents, confiscated under war legislation, for which licences had been granted.  Whatever power was granted to the Board of Trade by that order of 1920 lies under the Adaptation of Enactments Acts with the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Free State, and whatever power was given to the Board of Trade and the President of the Board of Trade comes over under the Adaptations of Enactments Acts to me.  So that whatever power there is in the Board of Trade at the moment with regard to the control of it, or modification of it, or in dealing with confiscated patents, that will lie now in the hands of a Minister of this State.  I am not very clear what variety of dealings I may have with these patents in case any original owner of such German patents, confiscated under war legislation, should make application here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at the moment. That is the situation.  If you take one of the normal cases, a British inventor who obtains a patent for some idea, and he parts with that patent right to somebody for a good consideration, we take over that person here under Section 29.  Of course that is all subject to revocation if it is found that any application for a similar type of patent had been filed here in the interim, from 1921 to the date of the <Col N="525" /> commencement of the Bill.  But leaving that out of consideration for the moment, we take over any licence-holder who holds for a good consideration from the holder of the patent in the first instance, and his rights operate here.  We do the same with the licence-holder where that licence has been granted by the Board of Trade in respect of a patent which was originally German-owned, but which had been confiscated under war legislation.  I have, then, the powers of the Board of Trade with regard to the modification and disposal of that licence here.  Just exactly as to what those powers are and as to how far I can go, I am not quite clear, and I mention it here so as to make my position, dubious as it is, clear to the Dáil.  If later on I find there are certain things that I want to do with these patents and am precluded from doing by the Board of Trade order or the war legislation, I will make an announcement of that position to the Dáil, have the case discussed on the merits, and see if any further legislation on the matter is required.  I am moving simply to adopt the present powers, with the proviso that if they are found to work inequitably there will be a further statement and a further search for powers, if powers are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have that explanation from the Minister.  It gives me an opportunity to say that the position, as far as I can follow it, is that any act of the Board of Trade in issuing licences before the 6th December, 1921, might well, in equity, be retained, so far as it affects the territory of the Free State.  I cannot see any justification for maintaining that since 6th December, 1921.  I think any licence that has been issued since that date ought, automatically, be revoked. There was a reference earlier in the day to the revocation of claims under war reparations.  This is the other side. I do not think it is reasonable to say, on the one hand, that we are cancelling any claim we might have ever had in regard to war reparations, and then to say that the value of patents, which were held by German or other belligerents, had been handed over to somebody in England, and that they should have <Col N="526" /> freedom to exercise their monopoly in Ireland for patents, to which they have really no equitable claim.  I hope that matter will have some consideration before we lose this Bill entirely, and that we shall have some kind of assurance, at any rate, that the holder of a patent, which is not the result of any active brain or even monetary expenditure on the part of the holder, shall not have special privileges in this country.</P>
      <P>As I say, I can understand the arguments and the equities up to the 6th December, 1921&mdash;one might say up to February, 1919.  I can understand a date being fixed where it might be said that there was a United Kingdom, and that the patent law ran freely by consent of the people of the Free State, but I cannot see the justification of allowing confiscated patents, confiscated property in ideas of Germans, Austrians, or Turks, being handed over to a British manufacturer, and of giving him monopoly rights within the Free State for how many years I do not know&mdash;whatever limits the patent laws might impose.  It is, I think, an unfair discrimination against manufacturers in this country, and the people of the country, and in favour of persons who have certainly no valid rights in the matter.  I think I would not be far wrong in saying that when a licence had been granted to a manufacturer to work a German patent in England, it was with the object of seeing that the patent was worked in England, that there was actual industrial development, that there was some value to the community out of it.  We are proposing, unless some further modifications arise in the course of the Bill, that the freedom will be absolute, and will give no value to this community.  That, I think, is quite an unfair discrimination against the people of this country, in favour of recipients of favours from the British Government, at the expense of the German inventor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clear up a certain number of difficulties. First of all, there has been no confiscation, no extra confiscations, in regard to what is described as enemy-owned property since 1921.  In fact, there has been none since the period that marked the closing of the war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  If there has been any movement since 1921 in regard to these things, it has been in the handing back of licences.  Any movement since 1921 has been in the direction of getting rid of these German-owned patents, taking them out of the hands of the licensee, to whom power was given to work the patents, and giving them back to the original owner.  The Deputy rather mixed two points.  If a licence were cancelled so that the patent lapsed with all its rights, or were returned with all these rights into the hands of the original owner, the German or whoever it might be in the particular case, that would be always subject to whatever was ordinary legislation, say, with regard to working on a commercial scale in a particular number of years in the country, and if the English national holder of a licence of German confiscated patent comes into this country with that, he comes subject to our legislation.  If he does not work that in this country on a commercial scale within whatever the period be in the Bill then we have power to take that licence from him, so that that matter is apart entirely from the question I am at, at the moment, which is, the man who has a licence, not with the goodwill of the original owner, but who has got it through war legislation. Definitely the tendency has been, in England, to return this enemy property. I had a list of patents confiscated, patents under which licences had been granted without the goodwill of the owner at a certain period. That is about two years ago.  That ran to something over 400 cases.  The most recent list&mdash;I got one about a fortnight ago&mdash;shows that the number has decreased to 88.  Of course, a number of them have lapsed.  If you take the position of patents taken over at the beginning of the war, in 1914, and suppose that they were just new then, that the ordinary life of the patent had to run, and that it was doing that all through 1915, 1916 and the years of the <Col N="528" /> war, it can be seen that with the ordinary life of these patents they would lapse quite soon.  As most of them were not new, not in their first stages on the date on which they were held to be taken over, at the outbreak of the war, naturally a lot of this difference between the 400 and the present 88 is due not to the handing back but to the lapsing of the patents.  The position is that the tendency in England is along the lines of getting rid of this type of enemy property, and there are 88 outstanding cases.  They are the only material we have to deal with in the matter I am speaking of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson also said that a holder might get his licence, not by reason of his brain-work or of any sacrifice of money on his account.  It should be remembered that the licence-holder of a confiscated German patent has to pay royalties, and that such licence-holder gets every consideration. The only difference between him and the normal case is that in a normal case the owner parts for good consideration, and he is the judge of whether the consideration is good or not.  In this case the Board of Trade intervened, came in compulsorily and asked whether there were any offers for the licence, and they handed it out on such terms as they thought reasonable.  They still retain that power.  If it is merely a matter of deciding whether the royalty is too much or too little it could be adjusted. All that power is in the Board of Trade and will, in future, be in my power.  It is a difficult question and one on which I am not prepared to be definite in regard to any of its aspects: (1) whether it is proper that this should be taken over at all, and (2) what exactly can I do if the original inventor makes application that Saorstát Eireann should no longer be regarded as an area in which the Board of Trade in England should be allowed to operate.  I am not promising that before this legislation goes further I will have that question so far examined that I will look for further powers if I think they are desirable.  All I am doing is to state my doubts here, and to say that we will leave it until a test <Col N="529" /> case arises.  If I find on examination of a particular case that the circumstances are such that I am forbidden to act, in the way I would be inclined to act, I will lay the whole matter before the Dáil, and let the Dáil decide whether I should get further powers.  I could not do that before this Bill passes, and I think we will have to wait until a definite case is taken and tried.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with the prevention of abuses of monopoly rights, and what I desire is that, in the consideration of the terms and general facts regarding the article, some regard will be had as to whether proper advantage to the community is being given by the holders of the patent.  It may be said, for instance, that a firm is charging a price per article, which has more or less a luxury demand, and is making just as much profit over the sale of one thousand articles at a certain price as might be made over the sale of ten thousand articles at a quarter of the price; that they prefer to do a small, <Col N="530" /> select trade rather than a larger trade at a lower price.  My proposition is that some consideration should be given to that aspect of the matter, so that the patentee will not be using his monopoly rights to deprive the community of some of the advantages of the idea if the community is prepared to pay.  You not only have the patentee in the matter to take into account but also the exploiters of the patent.  I ask that some consideration be given to that question as to whether the patented article could not be sold at a lower price which would lead to a bigger demand. It is really, in fact, stimulating the activity of the firm which is working and selling the patent.</P>

      <P>There is on record a law case in connection, I think, with Dunlop tyres, and the evidence showed that goods which were being sold in England, let us say, at £2, were being sold in France at £1 10s.  The goods were exported from England and sold by the same firm in France for 30/-. Under the monopoly secured by the patent they were getting a larger price in England than in France.  The price was lower in France because they were meeting a not dissimilar competitor. My point is that we ought to get what might be called most favoured nation treatment.  If a firm can export a patented article to the Continent of Europe from England where it has been manufactured, they can afford to send it to Ireland, and only ask the Continental price, subject to variations in carriage and the like.  At least we ought not to be subject to every limitation that is imposed on the English buyer. We ought to get the advantage that the English patent holder or seller gives to the French, Germans, Dutch, or wherever the goods may be sold.</P>

      <P>Before this amendment is accepted, I would like to have the principle Deputy Johnson enunciated more carefully considered.  Business conditions in many countries are altogether different and, if one is to continue doing business in some countries, one has to adopt tactics of a certain character. May I explain what I mean.  Say that the articles in question are tyres and that competition has to be met in France, if the company adopted the usual method, cut the price, so as to keep trade, the danger would be that under Deputy Johnson's proposal it would be compelled to give a similar concession in this country.  I, for one, would not be prepared to support that <Col N="532" /> principle.  Another thing that has to be taken into account is the difference in the value of coinage in the different countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to point out that these are very serious problems, particularly in business, to-day.  On behalf of the business community I would be slow to accept a principle of the character embodied in Deputy Johnson's proposal.  I would stress the point that if the Minister is disposed to accept the amendment in its present form he should have some inquiry made into it between this and the Report Stage.  On the face of it, it appears to me to be a dangerous principle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Johnson has met the point that Deputy Good speaks of by the words &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances.&rdquo; Taking the words as they occur, if someone interested applies to the comptroller alleging that there had been abuse of monopoly rights, by Deputy Johnson's amendment, the Comptroller is given a right to consider the price at which a patented article is sold, and if &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances&rdquo; it is unreasonably high.  He also has the right to find out at what price it is sold in other countries.  The Patent Comptroller will indicate at some stage if he is disposed to agree that the price is unreasonably high, &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances,&rdquo; and it is for the person who is given a monopolistic privilege to put up a concrete case, and show that he is not abusing that privilege.  It is for him to disprove when the Comptroller sets out what the circumstances are.  That will be taken into consideration when a decision is being given.</P>

I think the Comptroller would rather if the burden of deciding if an article was sold, &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances,&rdquo; at an unreasonably high price, was put on someone else's shoulders.  If the Deputy leaves the matter that way, I would indicate acceptance of the amendment, omitting the phrase referred to, which I will further have reconsidered on the Report Stage.</P>

I think the amendment has its use.  I am leaving over for consideration the adoption even, of the phrase that I have asked the Deputy to omit at this stage.</P>

      <P>I did not understand that.  I think the words have their value.  In another country it would be possible by them for the patentee here to compete with rivals. With some modification he might meet competition.  If he could do that it would be indicative of the possibilities of producing an article here at a cheaper rate.  I saw value in Deputy Johnson's proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I would still stress my argument that there is more behind this, from the business point of view, than appears on the surface.  I will give an instance of what I mean.  In this country we have, occasionally, what is known as &ldquo;dumping.&rdquo; Opinions differ as to whether that is a desirable state of affairs or not. &ldquo;Dumping&rdquo; is essential to mass production and to get down costs.  If &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; took place in connection with the manufacture of some item, in <Col N="534" /> order to get down prices, and get a larger output, then it might be sought under this particular amendment to get a reduction of price in this country corresponding to that prevailing where the article is dumped.  That is interfering with the manufacturer.  The ramifications of an amendment such as this are very wide, and I suggest that they should be carefully considered before adopting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that this is a Bill dealing with patents in the Saorstát.  It is not concerned primarily, at any rate, with manufacturers in other countries.  When we give monopoly rights in patents we give a privilege to the patentee, and I think we are entitled to look for some conditions attaching to that privilege.</P>
      <P>We are giving the patentee certain monopoly rights to sell his article, and to preclude any other person copying that article for sale in this country. We surely have a right to say: &ldquo;You have no liberty to abuse those monopoly rights; if you, in the course of your business arrangements, manufacture that article in England or in France, as the case may be, and sell your manufactured article to some other country at a lower price than you are prepared to sell to us, surely we have a right to say that your privileges are being abused.&rdquo; At least we have a right to question the matter, and that is all we are proposing to do in this section.  We are entitled to ask: &ldquo;Are you abusing your privileges,&rdquo; and to say: &ldquo;We think you can sell, and ought to sell, your goods in this country at as low a price as you are selling them in France or in England.  It is for you to answer that contention.&rdquo; That is all we are seeking to have done in this section.  It seems to me to be the simplest form of protection in the interest of the people who are giving the privilege to the patent-holder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can see that underlying this proposal is the question of the selling price of a particular commodity.  Can the Deputy give me a corresponding clause in any legislation that we have passed in which we circumscribed the selling price of an article?  The Deputy can see the effect <Col N="535" /> of this proposal.  If, owing to the fluctuation in the coinage, or to some particular difficulty in trading, an article was being sold at a lower price in Germany than it was being sold here, that would give rise to a question here as to whether a similar advantage should not be conferred on this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Good has used the phrase &ldquo;circumscribed as regards price.&rdquo; If Deputy Johnson's proposal provided for a case where an article was sold at a higher price here than it was sold at in other countries, there might be a definite limitation of the price.  But the phrase is tricked out with a certain number of conditions. The phrase used is, &ldquo;if the price is, having regard to all the circumstances, unreasonably high in comparison ...&rdquo; I think that that involves a very slight circumscription of price.  Deputy Johnson is perfectly sound in contending that he is merely asking that inquiry shall be made as to whether the price is unreasonably high.  The Comptroller is to decide whether the price, having regard to all the circumstances, is so unreasonable that it may be described as an abuse of monopolistic rights.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1) Any inventor or patentee may (either for or without valuable consideration) assign to a Minister on behalf of the State all the benefit of an invention and of any patent obtained or to be obtained for the invention.</P>
      <P>(2)  In this section the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; means a Minister head of a Department of State established under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 (No. 16 of 1924).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this amendment in order to give credit where credit is due.  There is a gap in the Bill.  The proposal here is to allow the Minister to take over an invention offered as a gift.  The Minister accepts the amendment, which is satisfactory. I want to give an illustration which may surprise some Deputies, particularly Deputies from Cork.</P>
      <P>I know of a case where a man believed he had a very sound and valuable idea, which he endeavoured to work up.  He made a promise to certain people who had helped him in his experiments&mdash;experiments which failed. unfortunately&mdash;that if his experiment should prove fruitful and valuable, it would go to the State.  I think that is a manifestation of public spirit that might well be encouraged.  We certainly ought to provide machinery within the Act whereby the Minister could receive a gift of that kind, and the Minister has promised to accept this amendment, which will permit of such acceptance.</P>

      <P>This is a proposal to give the Minister certain control over the patent agents.  It seems to me reasonable that there should be some check upon the patent agents who are registered and who have certain privileges under this Bill.  There should be some check upon the amount of fees to be charged by them, inasmuch as, in the majority of cases, inventors are bound to make use of agents.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 18:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) before paragraph (a) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) in the case of any work in the production of which printing is involved, the printing was done in Saorstát Eireann; and.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Section as it stands in Part VI., dealing with copyright, is taken from the English Act of 1911.  That Act, as you are aware, consolidated a great many English Acts conferring copyright, more particularly amending the Act of 1842.  The object of my amendment is to make this an Irish Act.  If the amendment is accepted, the copyright law will be copyright law for the Saorstát and in the interests of Irish trade.</P>
      <P>The section unamended sets out that, &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act, copyright shall subsist in Saorstát Eireann ... in every original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work, if&mdash;<i>(a)</i> in the case of a published work, the work was first published within Saorstát Eireann or a part of the British Dominions to which the benefit of this part of this Act extends; and <i>(b)</i> in the case of an unpublished work, the author was, at the date of the making of the work, a citizen of Saorstát Eireann or a British subject, or resident within Saorstát Eireann or any such part of the British Dominions as aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment introduces under the &ldquo;if&rdquo; limitation a third limitation, that where such original literary and artistic work involves in its production <Col N="545" /> the process of printing, that the printing shall be done in Saorstát Eireann. I am expressly limiting my recommendation to printing, which does not include setting-up.  It is merely that where the production of the work in question involves being put through the printing machine that the plates, if it is a case of engraving, for example, or the stereo-plates in the case of the printing of a book, shall be done here.  That would provide an enormous amount of additional work in a department where work is very badly required, and where unemployment at the present moment is so rife.</P>
      <P>It really does not interfere with the freedom of the author.  Naturally, when one considers the question of copyright, one's mind turns to the originator.  Suppose an Irish author or an Irish engraver, an Irish draughtsman or artist, thinks he will command a better market, and will do better on the whole by employing an English publisher, the amendment does not interfere with his liberty or discretion in that regard; it merely insists that the work should be printed here.  He may employ an English or foreign publisher.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, in the book-producing trade in England a very small percentage of publishers are likewise printers.  There was a time, of course, when the printer was a book-producer and a bookseller.  The book trade practically was covered by the publisher, printer and seller all in one: but specialisation has gone on here as elsewhere and now, in Great Britain particularly, the practice is that a publisher does not trouble to be a printer, and he is not a bookseller except in the sense in which the published work involves a wholesale distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the English publisher is quite indifferent, has always been indifferent, as to the place where his book is printed so long as the price is satisfactory. We are all familiar with that remarkably cheap and excellent series of books known as Everyman's Library.  The publishers of that are good business men.  When a fresh item is to be added to their library list, they inquire in which town in Great Britain printing is slack, get an estimate <Col N="546" /> from a printing works there, and that particular work is printed in that locality.  It does not matter to the publisher whether the book is printed in Southampton, Liverpool or Manchester, so long as it is done within the time to meet the market and at, of course, a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>Such work as that is done in Dublin, but not upon the scale that we would all like to see it done.  I suggest, in fact I am confident from my knowledge of this business, in which I have an immediate and direct and long experience, that if an amendment were passed which prescribes as a condition precedent to the granting of copyright that the work should be printed here, British publishers would be very glad to do as they sometimes do in the case of America and Canada&mdash;to send their stereo-plates here to be printed.  It would add enormously to employment in that occupation.  The <i>quid pro quo,</i> the gain they would have for that, would be worth while, because they would secure at once copyright in Saorstát Eireann as well as copyright in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Irish population is not remarkable as a book-buying population.  Many of the great works that are produced abroad would not have a large market here, and therefore it would not be worth the while of an Irish publisher to have the type set up here.  There is a reason why I am distinguishing between setting-up and printing.  If we could secure the setting up, so much the better; but what I want to point out to the Minister is that, under the amended section, it would be possible for the practice to continue that is already in vogue; that is, A.B., say an author, gets his book printed in Germany or Belgium, more particularly in Germany, where the printing is remarkably good, and as cheap as it is good.  He would then bring his book, printed and produced in fact in Germany, and claim to have copyright here.</P>
    <P>It is not requiring too much from an Irishman who is publishing his work that his fellow-countrymen, who give him a monopoly, for a copyright is a monopoly just as a patent right is a monopoly, should have a corresponding <Col N="547" /> advantage.  He should give that advantage to his own people employed in the printing trade.  The amendment is a very little one, but it means a great deal.  It hurts nobody.  I contend it is an injury neither to the author nor to the publisher.  It simply means securing for the Irish printing trade, in return for a copyright monopoly, a wider and a better occupation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is every reason to support this amendment. It is simpler than the later amendments and more direct, and I think it will cover, perhaps, a wider range of works.  However, the principle that is involved might be discussed, and I agree with Deputy Professor Magennis in saying that no harm can come to any Irish national by the adoption of this, and no author will suffer, and there will possibly be very little cost to the publisher.  There might be the cost of transferring from an English machine to an Irish machine and a little handicap, perhaps, in the change over from the English house to the Irish printing house.  That is the utmost.  That is a small price to pay for the privilege of having a monopoly in the Saorstát for books and works published in the Saorstát.  It may be said that the effect of the amendment would be to prevent reading and even prevent printing in Ireland.  I think that that is wrong.  The probabilities are that unless there was a fair expectation of a sale of, say, three thousand copies of the work, no copyright would be taken out and no copyright would be sought, and no Irish publisher or printer would attempt to issue a copyrighted work unless he saw the chances of the sale of 3,000 copies.  The result of that would be that only in cases where there is considerable sale expected in Ireland any copyright need be sought, or if there was to be such sale that there would be no obligation upon the publisher to get his work printed in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a considerable sale for printed matter, then it is right that we should do what we can in exchange for the monopoly to ensure that the work should be carried out in this <Col N="548" /> country.  There is no restriction by this amendment or by any of these amendments upon the sale and distribution of literature.  It is, in effect, a protective measure and without any cost to the consumer.  Perhaps Deputy Heffernan is prepared to accept this form of protection in view of the assurances I can give him that it is not going to be an imposition upon the consumer.</P>

      <P>If you are thinking of the Irish writer, and, I presume, you are thinking of the Irish writer, the position is this&mdash;he goes to the English publishing house and he is expecting a royalty on all copies that are sold in Ireland, he is not going to be a loser if you oblige that publisher to get the Irish sale printed in Ireland; if he is going to expect only a small sale in Ireland, then no Irish printer is going to go to the expense of copying his work in Ireland.  So that I do not see where the author is going to suffer any disadvantage.  I think if there is any disadvantage of any kind, and I cannot see it, it is overwhelmingly smothered by the advantages, and I, therefore, ask the Dáil to support this amendment, and I hope the Dáil will approve of the principle embodied in it.</P>

      <P>This amendment is something similar to the amendment in my name and to the amendment in Deputy Johnson's.  I would like to say a few words in support of it.  A good deal has been said already by Deputy Magennis and Deputy Johnson that I had intended to say on this amendment. I think the Bill before us is <Col N="549" /> one that would be improved by the inclusion of this, or an amendment of a similar kind, with a view to bringing back a substantial amount of the printing that is being lost to this country at present.  It has been stated as an argument against a duty or tariff on printed books or literature that it would considerably increase the cost of the book to the purchaser in this country.  But in this case, where the printing and binding is done in Ireland, it would not increase the cost of the book in any way.  The book published in London would cost no more to buy in Ireland than if printed and bound here.  It is well to realise what the state of the printing trade is at the moment.  The printing and binding of such works here would help to a great extent to relieve the unemployment that unfortunately exists in the printing and bookbinding trade at present.  If the passing of this Bill with the inclusion of this amendment would bring compulsion on publishers to have their books printed here it would help the trade.  It ought, also, to bring compulsion on the Irish authors to do something for their country, and that something they could do by getting their books printed here.  It is not too much to ask the Irish author, who draws his inspiration from his native country, to give some return to his country by having his books produced here.  In the Bill the publishers are compelled to supply free copies to each of the following:&mdash;Trinity College Library, the National Library, Oxford Library, University Library Cambridge, Edinburgh University, the National Library Wales, and the National Museum.  I consider that these are not a fair tax on their business. No benefit is given in return. In Canada three copies are asked for, in England six, and in Germany one. I do consider that this is an imposition on the trade here, and on the people affected by it.  At any rate, I support the amendment, and trust it will receive the support of the House, and will meet the point that has been advanced.</P>

      <P>This has been described as a little amendment, but as <Col N="550" /> a little amendment it appears to require a great deal to be said in its support. It has been urged that if this amendment is carried it will make this Bill really a Free State Bill, and that it is going to do good to the publishing trade here.  Deputy Johnson has used the three-thousand figure which has been put before me in a certain letter I got recently.  I do not know whether he is quoting from that letter or not, or whether he has got his information from the same source.</P>

      <P>The printers say that not five per cent. of the books published in England have a sale of 3,000 in the Irish Free State.  It is only when you get a sale of three thousand that the production of a book is profitable, so that we are bartering it for&mdash;if we take England the country from which most of the books in this country come&mdash;five per cent.  The publication in this country of five per cent. of the books that come in.  That is one side of the account.  What is the other?  I notice that the printers refer to Canadian legislation, and I notice that Deputy Magennis spoke of English authors sending their &ldquo;stereos&rdquo; to the States and to Canada.  I presume that has reference to the Canadian legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Gone on for years! I wonder why?  Was it simply because they thought it was a good thing to send the &ldquo;stereos&rdquo; across or was it because they thought it was necessary to get the works printed in Canada if they wanted to have the copyright in Canada?  I do not know what is the opinion held by Deputy Magennis with regard to that, but the printers are decidedly and definitely wrong in what they have said in this matter.  They speak of Canadian legislation.  The Canadians passed an Act in 1921, expressed not to come into effect until 1924.  In that they had a clause 13, that &ldquo;Any <Col N="551" /> person may apply to the Minister for a licence to print and publish in Canada any book wherein copyright subsists, if at any time after publication and within the duration of the copyright the owner of the copyright fails: (a) to print the said book or cause the same to be printed in Canada; (b) to supply by means of copies so printed the reasonable demands of the Canadian market for such book.&rdquo; That was passed in 1921, but not to come into effect until 1924, and in 1923 they passed an amending Act saying that section 13 and some other sections &ldquo;shall not apply to any work the author of which is a British subject other than a Canadian citizen or the subject or citizen of a country which has adhered to the Convention and the additional Protocol thereto set out in the second schedule to the said Act.&rdquo; That was the Convention modified by the 1908 additions, and I think known thereafter as the Berlin Convention.  Canada did that.  I should like to give a quotation here as to why Canada acted in that way. This is a gentleman writing on &ldquo;Imperial Unity and the Dominions,&rdquo; Mr. Berriedale Keith, of whom the House has heard before.  He says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This solution of the question was, however, temporarily only, for more acute questions developed with the coming into operation of the Berne Copyright Convention, and the anxiety of the Imperial Government to secure some measure of protection for foreign copyright in the United States of America, a country whose policy of blackmail in copyright matters was then at its most perfect stage.  The Dominion was consulted and definitely agreed of its own will to join the Berne Convention, and thus it bound itself, so long as it should be a member of that Convention, to refrain from passing any law which made the recognition of copyright in foreign works protected by the Convention dependent on the printing of the work in the Dominion.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you pass this amendment, you leave the Berne Convention.  That is <Col N="552" /> the effect of this &ldquo;little&rdquo; amendment. If you do leave the Berne Convention, is that any harm?  The peculiar tendency of the civilised world in copyright matters has been rather in a direction contrary to that which it has taken in regard to patents&mdash;in regard to patented articles.  The tendency recently has been to give patents the monopolistic privilege that is conferred by the grant of the patent, and to say that if the article is not worked on a commercial scale in a particular country within a certain period of years then a licence will be given to someone who will work in that country the article which the patent covers.  The tendency with regard to copyright has been exactly the opposite. The Berne Convention in 1886 was adhered to by a certain number of people.  It aimed at certain uniformities. It was adapted ten years later, and further brought up to date in 1908 at Berlin, and the whole tendency has been away from what has occurred in regard to patents.  The tendency is to give a copyright, but not to have anything of this sort with regard to the requirement of printing in the country before the copyright is given in a particular country.  It may be said that at this moment the only country of any importance outside the Berne Convention is the United States of America, and the United States is coming in.  A Bill appeared about two years ago&mdash;I cannot say what has happened to that Bill since; it certainly has not become law&mdash;but a Bill was promoted with the object of bringing America within the ambit of the Berne Convention, and so taking out this requirement of printing in the country before copyright would be given to any work.  Canada at one time had legislation of that sort.  It was simply a retaliation to the American system and Canada dropped it.</P>
    <P>I am not going to say that the House should not make up its mind for itself if it likes, and should not decide to go contrary to what is the world opinion, but I should like the House to understand just exactly what is being done&mdash; that we are going definitely back upon the whole line with regard to copyright <Col N="553" /> matter.  We are going to be the only country in the last ten years which has taken this step towards the United States law and away from all the countries that are inside the Berne Convention.  Apart from that, getting away from tendencies, what position are you going to put authors in?  You are going to provide that in order that books may be copyright here they must be printed in this country.  The author has to make up his mind: Is the sale in that country worth getting copyright there at all?  We are told by the printers&mdash;of course their evidence on this point may be just as bad as that with reference to Canadian legislation&mdash;that not five per cent. of the books published in England have a sale of 3,000 copies in this country, and that only a sale of 3,000 copies makes a profitable business.</P>

      <P>I happen to have the document here to which the Minister has referred and from which he read a portion just now: &ldquo;In very few cases would it be profitable for an Irish publisher to go to the expense of setting up a book for sale in Ireland only.  The minimum sale for the profitable <Col N="554" /> production of a book is 3,000 copies and not five per cent. of the books published in England have a sale of 3,000 in the Saorstát.&rdquo; In the very sentence from which the Minister quotes, the words are used &ldquo;the production,&rdquo; the setting up.  The amendment refers to printing only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy's amendment, but the three amendments are being dealt with together. I am not sufficiently expert to go into this matter to decide as between setting up and printing and one thing or another.  At any rate, there is the case, that you have to balance the two sides of your account.  You are going to get a certain amount of printing done here by reason of this.  On the other side, you are going to have that difference, that no Irish author is going to come within the Berne Convention. That is to say, that you are not going to have any copyright in any country for any work published here unless this State is able to enter into a treaty with individual countries with regard to copyright in these other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the terms upon which copyright is generally given?  Let me take the British 1911 Act with its international copyright section as an example.  They will give copyright to authors of countries who are not either within their own copyright union or within the Berne Convention if they find that those other countries give their authors adequate protection. They describe it later: &ldquo;If there is reciprocity in the matter.&rdquo; If we put in this, what reciprocity can we look for?  We are going to have Irish authors denied copyright in America, under the present conditions unless it is printed in America&mdash;printed, set up, produced and everything in America. when it is produced in English. We then come to Germany.  There is not going to be any copyright for an Irish author there unless we can get terms from Germany, and the terms will naturally be the same as we give to German authors.  At any rate we start off with this: that we cut ourselves clean out of the Berne Convention, and as far as Section 6 of this Act is concerned we might as well scrap <Col N="555" /> the whole thing.  That will only mean a little delay to get the matter re-adjusted, if we decide on the amendment. This whole Section 6 has been drafted on the assumption that it was desirable and that it was profitable that we should become, or, at least, should remain, a member of the Berne Convention. We are not going to be allowed to remain a member of that Convention if we put in this amendment, and it is for people to decide whether or not in the long run that is going to be profitable.  You have to set off the harm to Irish authors against the small amount of printing that is going to be done here through the acceptance of the amendment.  I think it should be considered also that we are definitely going back, upon the whole tendency of the world at the moment.  We are going back to the position that America alone of reputable nations occupies at present, and the position from which it is understood America is anxious to remove herself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the proof at the moment.  I can simply say that a Bill was introduced two years ago and one of the leverages put upon Canada was that America was definitely coming into line with the Berne Convention, and it is definitely the opinion of many of the people with whom I was able to get into touch recently that America would shortly be within the Berne Convention.  The position in America is something corresponding to what Deputy Magennis's amendment would establish here.  It is not exactly the same.  They include the reproduction of plates and binding and they make a difference the other way, that in the case of a foreign author that only applies to a work published in the English language.</P>

But when you get to the foreigner, nonresident, then it is only with regard to books published in English that that requirement of printing holds.  That requirement of printing has been described in the words I read to you as &ldquo;blackmail in copyright matters.&rdquo; That is the position this amendment would put us into if accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is identical in principle with the others on the Paper, but in point of the operation that it has in view it is not the same.  I have expressly limited the amendment to the requirement of printing.  The Minister spoke all the time of books; but the machining applies to other work besides books, such as magazines, newspapers, music and certain artistic works that are capable of mechanical production.  I have no hesitation in declaring myself in this, as in many other matters, a &ldquo;little Irelander.&rdquo; My first consideration is this country and its interests.  The great world outside can mind its own business very well.  There are other countries with big established works and great capital to draw upon, and Ireland, I suppose, is to join in that glorious race at the heels of the rest going to manufacturing perdition.</P>
      <P>The Irish author would be hurt, we are told, by not being protected by the Berne Convention.  The Minister who said that admitted he knew very little about printing or the publication business in Ireland.  I admit I am arguing for a business in which I am financially interested, but I would take the same ground even if I were not.  I know very well how small is the percentage of Irish authors who publish, much less print, through Irish publishing houses. They take their work to Macmillan, Longmans, Hodder and Stoughton, the firms which can afford to give them a great advertisement.  How few will be affected by the operation of the Berne Convention?  They will have their protection through their own publisher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is an opportunity of coming to the aid of an industry that is perishing. We know that, at the present moment, there are men and women unemployed, <Col N="557" /> particularly here in this city, for whom there would be ample employment if this amendment were adopted.  We are asked to doom these people to unemployment, and to doom this side of Irish industry to failure, merely because some Irish author would not have the Berne Convention's protection.  I think if that were put to the Irish people they would very easily make their choice.  It is not true that America has gone into this Convention, or has shown any desire to go into it.  Years and years ago America protected herself in all her industrial production.  And now other countries are protecting themselves against her, so well has she prospered under protection.</P>
    <P>I remember well the time when Mr. Bryce produced his monumental work upon the American Constitution, and to protect himself the chapters had to be set up in America.  It is not correct to say that under my amendment the situation as regards copyright would in the Saorstát be the same as in America, for in America the whole production must be American&mdash;the setting-up, the printing, the binding, the sending out the total work of printing in all its branches and publication. All that is asked for here is that the printing and machining of the plates shall be done within the Saorstát.  In the case of a published work, when the work is first published, there is a variety of choice given.  No author is really injured except the author who is willing to have his work printed, published, and produced for Irish circulation within our own shores. He may be injured theoretically by being shut out from the Berne Convention, but how many of our school books produced for boys and girls in Irish primary or secondary schools are going to have a sale in Germany or Italy?</P>

      <P>Some of the things said recently are surprising and are not true.  I hope there is no desire to deceive.  I think that eliminates the charge of untruth, but it is quite hysterical and absurd to say that the printing industry is doomed &mdash;doomed was the word used&mdash;if this amendment is not accepted.

      <P>I ask the House, which knows as much about the industry as I do, to consider the term that has been used.  This industry is to be doomed if this amendment is not accepted?  Deputy Magennis has not attempted to deny, no matter what I may have said with regard to the amendment, that he definitely excludes this country from the scope of the Berne Convention.  That is the outstanding feature of it.  It means that we become, with the United States, outcasts as far as that is concerned: that we move backwards as far as world progress is concerned in this matter. and that we enter upon a course which I personally think is a dishonourable one, and all on the hysterical plea that something is doomed if something which the Deputy puts up is not accepted.  The choice here is a very simple one.  It is a matter of where does this country take its stand in copyright matters.  Is it going, to use the phrase used with regard to the United States, to take the place of Canada?  Canada was moved by its closeness to America to adopt a certain retaliatory measure as against America, but even though close to America, on seeing the harm that her authors were suffering by reason of this, Canada withdrew and came within the Berne Convention.  We are asked to simply turn in the opposite direction, and to walk with Deputy Magennis towards dishonouring ourselves in this way.</P>

      <P>This is an English Act of 1911, and I beg the House to recollect that it is not to be altered one tittle, one iota, in this regard in the interests of an Irish industry because, forsooth, we would be dishonoured&mdash;a fine phrase&mdash;and no proof given.  Is America dishonoured? Will the Minister dare to say that America in protecting her industries against the foreigner, dishonours herself? Are we fools to be fooled with a phrase of this type?  It is easy to talk out of ignorance as the Minister admitted about an industry and form of occupation about which he knows nothing.  I cannot be silent in regard to a business about which I know a great deal.  Every statement that I have made is fact.  I have stated that there are very few Irish authors, except those who are willing to be penalised, who would be injured by being shut out from the Berne Convention, but there are a great many working men and women and youths who will be tremendously injured if we put into operation an English statute where we might have had an Irish statute.  I did not at all allege that there will be no printing left in the Free State if this amendment is not accepted, but I do say that in rejecting it we will have doomed men and women to continual unemployment. We shall be restricting the scope of employment in this particular industry and that with our eyes open. It is not so long ago as to be outside the recollection of Ministers that a meeting was held here in Dublin on behalf of the printing trade.  The facts of the odious situation were made clear by those within that industry who knew all about its details and working.  If the Minister will say that he dare not depart from the English Act of 1911, then he may find those who will follow him into the Lobby to support him in the division who believe that our liberties are to be for ever restricted because of some arrangement made elsewhere.  But if we are free to make laws for ourselves, as I contend we are, there is no use in quoting to us <Col N="560" /> restrictions on our liberty in aid of our own industries as is done in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put the matter in this way&mdash;that, as between the Berne Convention and what is called the Commonwealth Union, the Berne Convention laid down certain things which countries must follow in order to get copyright in all countries attached to that Convention.  The Berne Convention was modified at Berlin in 1908.  A certain number of signatures were put to it, and it has come to be known to-day as the revised Berne Convention.  When the Imperial Conference met in 1910, the British Government, with the aim of seeing that the uniformity desired by the Berne Convention should be achieved as completely as possible, said: &ldquo;Let us have, within the Commonwealth, uniformity; let us aim at the uniformity which is desired in the terms of the Berlin Convention or the revised Berne Convention.&rdquo; Agreement was come to, and the 1911 Copyright Act was drawn up.  You may say that the distinction between the 1911 Act and what was really entailed in the Berne Convention was simply this: that the 1911 Act made more rigid and approached more closely to the uniformity desired by the Berne Convention.  Let me take one or two points.  With regard to the term or date of copyright, the Berne Convention stated that they thought it ought to be more or less a headline <Col N="561" /> that people would aim at a term of copyright which would be the life of the author and fifty years thereafter, but they stated that this was a matter which could in special detail be regulated by domestic legislation. The 1911 Act simply set out and said, as far as those people who are to come within the Commonwealth Union are concerned, that the terms shall be rigidly the life of the author and for fifty years after.  Another point dealt with, on which I shall have to speak later, was the question of excerpts for educational books.  The Berne Convention laid down certain things and certain provisions, and spoke of works not intended for educational purposes wherein copyright existed.  Speaking of taking excerpts from these educational books, it went on to say that that was left in the main to domestic legislation, or to any agreement that there might be between countries in that regard.  The Commonwealth Union made that more rigid, and simply laid down a specific thing, that within a period of five years there could not appear in a book designed for educational work more than two quotations or two passages from a single author.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Convention set up certain standards which it laid down for a country adhering to that Convention.  The English Act of 1911, which gave legislative force to what is called the Commonwealth Union, had the effect of tightening up some of the rather loose points of the Berne Convention and making them more rigid.  The Berne Convention, or its revised form, the Berlin Convention, is a wider thing and is signed by many more nations than the Commonwealth Union.  The principle is that once an author gets copyright in any of the countries adhering to the Berne Convention he, <i>ipso facto,</i> gets copyright in every other country, and prohibition against the setting up of certain formalities before copyright went wrong.  America is definitely outside the Berne Convention by reason of the fact of this requirement about printing.  This country will leave the Berne Convention if this amendment is put in.  After all, it is not that our <Col N="562" /> authors are without the possibility of gaining copyright.  It means that if we are prepared to remain without the Berne Convention and the Commonwealth Union we would have to seek from every individual country to make terms with regard to mutual recognition of copyright as between the two countries.  That must be set about.  If we do not do that, it means that Irish authors, nationals of our own, or people who produce for the first time in this country, have no copyright secured to them in any other country.  It is a matter for Treaty making then.  If we come within the Berne Convention there is a particular circle of the Convention which we join, and this is what the amendment destroys.  It is simply a matter of deciding whether you are going to decide for some vague benefit to be derived by the trade here, you are going to put yourself outside that Union.  In doing that you are going contrary to the whole tendency of the world at the moment&mdash;a tendency which has been to get more adhesions to the Berne Convention and the Commonwealth Union.  Another point, we being more or less in it would be the only country to go over to the American side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I entered this discussion with a somewhat open mind, though emphatically and clearly supporting the general proposition.  With regard to the argument with respect to the Berne Convention, I listened carefully with the desire to understand the ill-effect, as alleged, of the adoption of this amendment.  As far as I have heard and learned it seems to me the case is something like this: we are now on the point of either adhering to or conforming our legislation to, the Berne Convention, and by that fact adhering to it, or we may depart from that Convention.  I imagine that considering these pros and cons we have to weigh the advantages as against the disadvantages.  I am quite at a loss to understand where there is any question of honour.  I think we must consider the question from the point of view of weighing up the advantages or disadvantages, and in fact material advantages as against material disadvantages. <Col N="563" /> I do not think any question of honour or morality arises. I assume that if after a few years' experience we thought it desirable we should enter into this Convention it would be quite possible to do so, and in the meantime we may level up into a position of equality with other countries which are within the Berne Convention. That is to say, in exchange for some of the restrictions we are going to get certain advantages, and that there is going to be some reciprocity amongst equals.</P>
      <P>But our position to-day is, and from that we have to move, that a certain number of Irish authors are looking in the main to the world outside Ireland for the sale of their books and products. The great majority of those do not get their works published in Ireland. In so far as they continue that they are not going to be disadvantaged. They are going to be disadvantaged, if at all, only by virtue of any possible loss within this country. I do not see where that is coming. Those who are encouraged, and have made it their practice to have their books published in Ireland, may be at a disadvantage unless there are new compacts entered upon.  I wonder what proportion of authors who have published books within the last ten, fifteen or twenty years, have had them published in Ireland?  I think it would be very small.  A great number of them, I think, have not only their books not published here but they follow the trade.  They go out of the country to the publishing country.  I wonder then if the disadvantage which would arise by the loss of the printing trade is worth undergoing for the sake of the minority of authors who have been true to their national feelings and have had their books published in Ireland at the cost of their material wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the advantages distinctly lie with risking the Berne Convention penalties for the sake of the printing trade in the country.  If that trade develops, and with it there is a general development of the country culturally, you have an encouragement to publication. Once you have re-established <Col N="564" /> your publishing business then would be the time to seek entry into the Berne pact, and possibly to re-consider the whole question of the abrogation of this amendment if it were passed.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we have to start the discussion from the point of view as to how it affects the printers and authors to-day, and not from what might eventuate in fifteen or twenty years time.  I think if we consider the number of authors, and the reputation of the authors which we have every right to consider, we ought to give every encouragement to them.  Having regard to the fact that in the great majority of cases they do not get their books published here, I think there is no great disadvantage to existing authors at any rate, in keeping free from their running the risk of being expelled by the Berne Convention. That is how it seems to me, and on the argument adduced by the Minister on his explanation of the Berne Convention, the obligations and advantages do not weigh in the balance with the advantage that is going to be given to the printing trade in the country by the adoption of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put this point: No matter how few Irish authors get their works printed in this country at the moment, if this amendment is accepted no Irish author will get his books printed here, because you may take it definitely that the sale of any Irish book is bigger in England than it is here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is the risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If we put this on we will have left the whole circle&mdash; we will have to make a treaty with England with regard to getting copyright for our authors in England, and we will get it more or less on the terms we set up here with English authors, certainly with a condition that the book is printed in England.  Whether that condition were put on or not, I suggest that at any rate there would be a very definite temptation put in the way of Irish authors to get their works printed in England, because by publishing for the first time in England <Col N="565" /> they would come again within the Berne Convention.  So that for the future there would be no work of any Irish author published here.  I have spoken of honour.  I think honour is involved.  What would happen if this amendment is carried&mdash;&ldquo;In the case of any work in the production of which printing is involved, the printing was done in Saorstát Eireann?&rdquo; But if the printing is not done there will be no copyright.  This would become a land of literary pirates.  You could certainly increase your printing trade that way, but I simply ask you to consider if it is a proper thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two sorts of Irish authors to be taken into account.  There are the Irish authors whose appeal is to the wider world outside.  They have always followed the practice of publishing in Great Britain.  Now, the author in Great Britain has, for the most part, followed the practice of getting work printed in Great Britain.  The effect of my amendment would be that, if that author wanted to have copyright in the Free State secured to him, his publishers should have the work printed here.  That author would still be within the Berne Convention.  As regards the other class of authors&mdash; those who are satisfied to have their work published by an Irish publisher&mdash; their appeal is to the Irish, distinctively and immediately to the Irish. Their sales are mostly here, or with the Irish in Great Britain and in America. From my own experience with regard to a series of books, I know that it only paid to produce them here on account of their sale in America.  If such books were limited to the home market, the price would be more or less prohibitive.  So that the authors whom I will call distinctively Irish, and of Irish appeal, write for buyers here, and for buyers in America particularly. America is outside the Berne Convention; the Berne Convention question does not affect that class of author in the slightest degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, on the point of honour, theoretically, we should be a land of literary pirates as the Minister called it.  Let me put it more accurately, <Col N="566" /> because I am afraid that the hysteria which we hear occasionally breaks out in that quarter of the House. Theoretically piracy would be possible, as it was in the eighteenth century. Of course the Minister does not pretend to know anything about Irish history.  His concern with Ireland now is as part of the Imperial connection, and he forgets its past.  There was a time when Ireland was outside the copyright Act of Great Britain, and when important works were published in England they were immediately pirated in Dublin.  Some of the finest specimens of typographical work and of superb bookbinding dated from these times under these conditions.  Strange to say, those who write about book production never blush about that.  They admit that it was good business for the country.  But let us take the scrupulous and delicate honour sense of the Minister.  The desire for piracy will find its natural corrective in the fact that the pirated book will have to be set up.  I am sorry to have to harp on this point so often, but it is the cardinal point in this whole argument&mdash; the difference between the cost of production where a book has to be set up from manuscript by a compositor or a composing machine, and the whole process of production carried through. That would be prohibitive here.  The type of work that the Irish publisher might want to pirate would be such that it would not pay him to pirate it. Furthermore, it would always be possible to enter into an arrangement with regard to later or cheaper editions, or editions of an inferior type of paper.  The fact is this, that the Minister is afraid to depart from the English Act of 1911.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I might as well say, in answer to that, that the Deputy is afraid to sacrifice his financial interests.  One is as true as the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  I pleaded guilty, to put my position clear before the House, to having a financial interest in the matter.  But I also declared that if I had not one farthing of financial interest in the matter I would take the decision I take <Col N="567" /> on this, because this is a question of a little-Irelander position and the interests of the Irish people, the interests of the Irish worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no glory in standing among the nations of the world under the Berne Convention or any other Convention, call it by any name you please, if it is not going to have as its reaction the advantage of the people of Ireland.  I see dwindling industries; I see people walking the streets unemployed. I know what they are up against.  I know the tremendous advantage that prevails in Great Britain alongside us and across the border in <Col N="568" /> Belfast.  Belfast to-day is one of the finest printing centres in the world. The finest class of printing work can be done there.  We are ringed around with all that competition, and yet we bring in a Copyright Act, an Act to confer monopoly rights upon certain people.  We are asked to hold our hands and have no consideration for the Irish printers.  That is a most extraordinary attitude for a so-called Irish Minister to take up.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission instituted proceedings for the acquisition of the untenanted lands in the possession of William Orr (trustee of A. Bagnall, deceased), Ballyclare, Offaly, under the provisions of the Land Act, 1923.  These lands have been let for grazing by the owner, and the Land Commission are in negotiation with him as to the date on which possession thereof can be handed over to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as time is concerned.  I am prepared to agree to have it discussed to-morrow afternoon after questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the President that there are items in this White Paper that are not quite clearly <Col N="471" /> understood and that cannot be understood. They require some explanation. It would be opportune, I think, to give some explanation of the various items in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance would do that in the course of the discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we decide that, there is also the question of the report of the proceedings of the Imperial Conference.  If that is to be discussed we ought, I think, to decide these two things together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately the Minister for External Affairs has not been very well for the last week or fortnight. I had hoped to be able to indicate on what date we would be able to take that discussion.  Perhaps before the adjournment this evening I may be in a position to say when he will be able to make a statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that there was a definite arrangement that it should be taken on Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There was, but that depends on the Minister's health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the President's statement with regard to the White Paper, will he say when it will be circulated amongst Deputies? It has been laid on the Table of the House, but so far it has not been circulated amongst Deputies.  I think that the White Paper should be in our hands when debating this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>If the White Paper has not been circulated the Deputy can certainly get a copy. With regard to the President's suggestion to take this matter after questions to-morrow, it seems to me that it would be better to take it when we have disposed of the business on the Order Paper to-morrow.  That would still <Col N="472" /> leave a considerable amount of time. We could take it on a motion for the adjournment unless Deputy Magennis desires to give notice himself to take it on the adjournment to-morrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We could take it by general agreement without limitation of time on the motion for the adjournment.  If we took it after questions we would have to limit the time in some way so that we would be able to deal with the ordinary Orders of the Day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am willing to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Imperial Conference Report, that is a matter which I think should have some attention at the earliest possible date. It seems to be going by default that it is something that everybody applauds and approves of.  Therefore, I think that it is desirable that there should be some explanations given in the House of it at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that as soon as the Minister recovers it will be given without any delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be better if a date were fixed for next week, and that it were understood the Minister for Finance would expound this extraordinary document to the House and initiate the debate.  It is a most important matter involving millions of pounds.  It was done in the dark, and no facilities were given for debating it.  It is a matter of the utmost importance to the State to have it fully understood.  It is only the Minister for Finance, who set his name to it, who can thoroughly explain its details and their implications.  We would be really debating it in the dark without the Minister's opening explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely expressed a preference for next week, inasmuch as other Deputies have displayed an interest in it.  I believe the country, when they have heard about it, will also display an interest in it.</P>
