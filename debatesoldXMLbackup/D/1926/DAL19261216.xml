      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the total quantities of wine imported into the Saorstát during the periods 1st April, 1925, to 30th November 1925, and 1st April, 1926, to 30th November, 1926, giving particulars of the quantities at strength not exceeding 30 degrees and at strength not exceeding 42 degrees; also the quantities of each strength on which duty was paid during <Col N="772" /> these periods; and the quantities of each strength ex-ship (duty paid) during these periods.</P>

      <P>The details required are too numerous to read to the Dáil.  I will, with the Deputy's permission, send them to him.  They will appear in the Official Report in due course.  I regret that it is not possible to give the strengths of wine imported for warehousing during the periods specified, as these particulars are not available and could not be ascertained without incurring an undue amount of expense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount expended to date is £2,217,359.  The amount which will probably be expended in the remaining portion of the financial year is £2,364,686.  The total probable expenditure is, therefore, £4,582,045.  This figure may be increased by £217,964, being the expenditure in the current year from Road Grants made available in previous years but not fully expended, thus bringing the grand total of probable expenditure to £4,800,009.</P>

      <NameTxt>TOMAS MAC EOIN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether it is proposed to introduce legislation dealing with the regulation of road traffic, and, if so, whether the legislation will provide for the licensing of drovers and the regulation of the driving of cattle and other stock on roads and in markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of legislation to deal with the more effectual regulation of road traffic has been under consideration for some time.  The Minister for Local Government had power conferred upon him by the Local Government Act, 1925, to deal with certain important aspects of the problem, but there are other aspects which still remain to be considered, and it is difficult to say whether the Department of Justice or the Department of Local Government and Public Health would be the appropriate Department to deal with them.  I have decided to ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to cooperate with me in setting up a Departmental Committee of Inquiry to investigate what fresh powers are required to deal with the regulation of road traffic, and to recommend what authorities should have the responsibility of making and enforcing regulations. This Committee will be asked to consider the licensing of drovers and the regulation of the driving of cattle on roads and in markets.</P>
      <P>This particular matter has been brought to my notice by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, whose primary interest it is, but as there is a traffic aspect, I think the question might appropriately be referred to the Committee of Inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim to Unemployment Benefit made on 24th December, 1925, by Patrick Moore of Borahan, Errill, Leix, was disallowed on the grounds that the claimant was not unemployed and not unable to obtain suitable employment. From this decision he appealed to the Court of Referees which recommended that the claim should remain disallowed. The case finally went to the Umpire who confirmed the decision disallowing the claim.  In the circumstances, it is regretted that no benefit can be paid on the claim.</P>

      <P>In respect of a claim made on the 1st May, 1926, John McNamara, of Main Street, Banagher, was paid 48 days' benefit.  This exhausted all his contributions but as he claimed to be entitled to further benefit, which could not be allowed, he appealed to the Court of Referees, which found that his claim could not be allowed.  The Insurance Officer agreed with this recommendation and it is regretted that the claimant will not be entitled to further benefit until further contributions have been paid for him.</P>

      <P>As regards the third part of the question, the latest information in the possession of the Registrar shows that a majority of the ordinary share capital of one out of the 25 shipping companies is held by Coast Lines, Limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>MICHEAL O hAONGHUSA</NameTxt>
      <P>to ask the Minister for Education whether his attention has been called to a statement made by a member at a meeting of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (Cork County), held at Cork on the 11th December, 1926, to the effect that he knew of Inspectors who had been discourteous to lady teachers and who did not know their business, and whether in view of this allegation he will have inquiries instituted immediately in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agreed with Deputy Hennessy yesterday evening to allow this question to appear on the Order Paper.  Having looked further into the matter, I am of opinion that the question is of a type which ought not be put, because it opens up the way for an enormous number of questions at second-hand, if I may use the phrase.  If the Deputy were inquiring about some matter of which he was personally cognisant, the question would be in order, but the type of question which appears on the Paper is not in order and I am of opinion that it should not be asked.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid not.  The objection I have to the question is not in respect of its form but rather to the idea that the Deputy should put a question based upon a newspaper report, which is open to all the world as well as to the Deputy.  If a question were put by the Deputy with regard to the system of inspection in National Schools, based on an incident reported to himself personally by the aggrieved person, it would be in order but a general question, based upon a report of what somebody else has said, opens up the way for a large number of questions of that type.  The Minister could hardly be expected to be constantly making inquiries into statements of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  If the Deputy himself had personal knowledge of a case, which he was prepared to argue with the Minister subsequently, that would be quite in order but this question does not appear to be of that type.  We can, however, go into the matter elsewhere.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if an application for an old age pension was received from James McIntosh, Borris Road, Portlaoighise, Leix, on March 2nd, 1926; whether same was accompanied by a sworn statement that claimant was then over seventy years of age; if he can give the reason why payment of pension was sanctioned as from July 30th, 1926, and if he will now order payment as from March 2nd, 1926, or state his reasons for not doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim of Edward (not James) McIntosh was received by the pension officer on the 2nd of March last, as stated by the Deputy, and came to me for determination on appeal on the ground of age on the 21st of May last.  The only definite evidence available as to age was the record in the official marriage register that he was 22 years old when married on the 21st of July, 1881, according to which he would not be 70 years old until the year 1929.  Declarations in support of the claim were made by several neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local investigation was made by one of the Department's general inspectors, and on his report, in conjunction with the evidence already received, I was not satisfied that the claimant had attained the statutory age of 70 years prior to the 30th of July last, the date on which the decision was given.  A pension of nine shillings a week was accordingly granted from that date, <Col N="778" /> and I am unable to authorist payment from an earlier date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if an application for an old age pension was received from Mrs. Mary Wheeler, Castlegrogan, Ballybrophy, Leix, on January 6th, 1926; whether same was accompanied by a sworn statement that applicant was then over seventy years of age, and if he can state the reason why payment of pension was sanctioned as from September 1st, 1926, or if he will now order payment of arrears as from January 6th, 1926.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are as stated by the Deputy.  This claim was received by the pension officer on the 6th of January last and came to me on appeal on the ground of age on the 21st of July last.  After local investigation of the facts bearing on the claimant's age had been made by one of the Department's general inspectors, the claimant was granted, on the 15th of September, an old age pension of nine shillings week from the 1st of September, 1926. I was unable to authorise the grant of a pension from an earlier date, as I was not satisfied on the evidence before me that the claimant had attained the statutory age of 70 years prior to the date specified in the decision, which cannot be reconsidered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state, regarding his two answers, whether pension applicants are to understand for the future that it is useless and an unnecessary expense on their part to endeavour to secure sworn statements from reliable local people in support of their claim to be the required age, and are we to understand from him now that he prefers to take the opinion of a general inspector, who does not reside in the district, or who, if he does, does not know the people of the district, as against the sworn declarations of reliable local people?  In other words, has he come to the conclusion that all people over seventy years of age have lost their memory or are perjurers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see what the Deputy has to complain of in this par <Col N="779" /> ticular case, or how his argument follows from the way the claimants have been treated in these two cases.  Both of them have not only got the pension but the full pension from the date when the claims were settled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The dates were admitted by the Minister to be correct.

      <P>The dispensary medical officer of the Ballymahon Dispensary District lives at the village of Keenagh, on the main road between Ballymahon and Longford, and approximately 5½ miles from Ballymahon. He attends twice weekly in Ballymahon Dispensary, once at Keenagh, and once at Newtowncashel.  Keenagh is about two miles from the centre of the district, while Ballymahon is on the extreme outskirts.  There is telegraphic and telephonic communication between <Col N="780" /> Ballymahon and Keenagh.  The midwife lives close to Fowlard's Bridge, and about two miles from Ballymahon. Her place of residence does not inflict any undue hardship on the sick poor.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are over 700 people in Ballymahon dependent upon the medical aid of the doctor and the midwife, that the midwife at present resides about two miles outside the town, and that when people go there and find she is attending a case, there is no one there to tell them where she may be found? Furthermore, as poor people cannot afford to send telegrams or pay for trunk calls on the telephone, will the Minister see that better facilities are given for attendance on the poor?</P>

They are centrally situated.</P>

It may, however, serve the Deputy's purpose to some extent if I mention that I understand there are up to the present 64 ratings in Dublin City, valued at £100 or over, the valuation of which is deemed to be reduced under Section 69 of the Local Government Act, 1925, while the total valuation of the ratings in Dublin City referred to in the second question amounts to £31,033.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to what strikes me as a subject for a new Bill in this connection, which would be more necessary than some of the provisions of this Bill.  I have a document here issued by the Local Government Department giving a list of coroners in the different <Col N="789" /> counties.  I find that in the County Tipperary there are four salaries paid in the North Riding and four in the South Riding.  In the North Riding, the four salaries are £32, £34, £40, £56. In the South Riding, the salaries are £80, £85, £100, £140.  There seems to be some contradiction there.  It says: &ldquo;Posts in each riding held by the same coroner.&rdquo; There may be four coroners, but there are eight positions and eight salaries.  I am not in a position to say that there are eight distinct coroners, but there are eight salaries. In the County Louth, a very small county, there are three, one with a salary of £30, another £40, another £66. I suggest to the Minister that here is a real subject for legislation, rather than the powers he has thought well to confer on his Department in the present Bill.  I think if he will look over this list he will find plenty of reasons for introducing legislation to deal generally with the question of coroners. Here is the groundwork of extravagance, and the Minister having the groundwork ready has brought in a Bill whereby these salaries can be raised to whatever sum is acceptable to the official mind in Merrion Street.

      <P>My Bill, or rather Senator Brown's Bill, which came on to us here.  I put it to the Deputy, however, talking for a moment to his irrelevancies, that what does matter is not the number of coronerships, but whether the work performed by each <Col N="790" /> individual coroner is necessary work, useful work, and adequately remunerated. In the distant past the conception I think was to have one coroner for each county.  Presumably there was a reason for departing from that, and certain counties have been broken into districts.  There are some counties &mdash;Leix is one&mdash;where the coroner is coroner for the entire district.  There are other counties which are divided into districts.  Kildare, I think, is broken into a coronership for North Kildare and a coronership for South Kildare.  Then in other counties there are more districts.  Presumably the salaries are small in proportion to the work performed.  Where you would have possibly one coroner with a salary of perhaps £120 or £150, you might have four with a salary of £25 or £30. If any county council wishes to make recommendations on the matter, thinks that there is reason for departing from the existing position, then that is a matter that is open to it to make recommendations on.  It is a matter which might quite appropriately be discussed at the General Council of County Councils.  But we have had no representations of the kind, and we must only assume that each individual county council is satisfied that the breaking up of the counties into districts is better than the conception of having one single coroner for the entire county.  But, in the absence of representation from individual county councils, or through the medium of the General Council of Co. Councils, it is not a matter that we propose to interfere with.</P>

      <P>One as brilliant as the Minister ought to be able to interpret anything.  Is there a coroner in any county who would go before the county council and ask for an increase? Would he dare do it?  He would not. The work does not justify an increase. In place of that, the Minister inserts in this Bill a section enabling the salaries to be reviewed by a Department, and only with the right to increase and not to decrease.  The point of view that Deputy Gorey and his Party hold is that if there is any change it should not be in the direction of an increase.  There is very little work to be done, and the salaries paid are out of proportion to the amount of work involved and the responsibility of the office.  The Minister thinks that it is the duty of a department to arrogate to itself the right to review the salary of any local official and increase it, whether the local authority are satisfied or not.  That is a principle that we have very good reason for objecting to.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment to my name&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In page 6 to delete lines 49 to 68 inclusive, and in page 7 to delete lines 1 to 3 inclusive.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> This amendment desires to delete the greater part of sub-section (6) of Section 11.  It is unfortunate, I think, that special attention was not drawn, either by the Minister or any Deputy, to the effect and the purpose of this provision.  It will be remembered that in the principal Act of 1925 certain provision was made regarding exemptions from the full rating of buildings erected over certain years.  It will also be remembered that the provision in question was inserted in the Seanad on the Report Stage in the Seanad after the Bill had passed all its stages in the Dáil.  When the Bill, with this new provision, came down from the Seanad to the Dáil the exemption provision, as it finally was inserted in the Bill, was agreed to by a small majority. Now there has been inserted into this Bill a provision for further exemption of new buildings from rates: an extension of the period of exemption for all buildings that come under the provisions of the principal Act, and an extension of the period during which new buildings may be built for the purpose of obtaining an exemption. Under the principal Act, which is now sought to be amended, certain buildings were to be exempted compulsorily by the local authorities from two-thirds of the rates for a certain period.  Under the 1916 Dublin Reconstruction Act there was an extension of the period of exemption from rates for four years. Under the later Act, the Dublin Reconstruction Act of 1924, there was an extension of three years, but then it provided that any other buildings anywhere, except houses built under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and under the recent Housing Acts, were to be exempted for the years from 1926 to 1933.  A new building, or a building which had undergone considerable reconstruction, was a building which had been reconstructed or built in the years 1920 to 1927. The proposal in the Bill is to do two things: to extend the period of building so that new buildings under the Bill would be buildings erected up to 1930, extending the period by three years.  The second provision is that the years of exemption shall be for seven years after the completion of the <Col N="793" /> building.  Under that provision a new building is a building which is not a workman's house or a house built under the provisions of recent Housing Acts, State assisted, and, of course, occupied by the less fortunate section of the community.  All other buildings than those are to be exempted from two-thirds of their rates for a period which may include the years 1930 to 1937.</P>
    <P>Now it would have been better, perhaps, had we been able to have examples of the effect upon rates generally on all the counties and towns in the country of the principal Acts. We might then have been able to form some estimate of the cost to the remainder of the ratepayers of this proposed amendment.  The Minister replied to part of the question I put to him a few minutes ago.  He told us that for the City of Dublin there had been 64 ratings, valued at £100 or over, which had been exempted, or, as one may say, in respect of which the rates had been reduced by two-thirds, and that the valuation of these 64 premises was £31,000.  I cannot say exactly what the rates for the City of Dublin are at the present time.  I take it that, at a rough estimate, they are 16/- in the £.  I am not quick enough to make a mental calculation as to the cost of these exemption in respect of this £31,000 worth of valuations, but it would probably be somewhere in the neighbourhood of £15,000 or £16,000 a year.  The period of that gift of other people's money that we are making is to be extended, and we have had no suggestion of justification from the Minister for such an extension of these free gifts.  Let it be borne in mind by the House that the same principle that was introduced into the original Bill of retrospective action is introduced again in this Bill.  You have buildings that have been erected any time within the last few years on the understanding that their rates would be reduced for a certain period. That was the Act, and whether we like it or not it was accepted, but now it is proposed that the proprietors of those buildings should have a further gift by exemption from two-thirds of their rates for another period which may <Col N="794" /> vary in time and may even extend to three or four years beyond what was originally proposed.</P>
    <P>Now it is quite difficult for me to understand why this should be provided for.  The case was made in the original Bill that it was necessary to make some exemption of this kind to encourage building, but we are proposing to make this present at the expense of the remainder of the ratepayers to buildings which have already been erected.  Is that going to encourage new buildings? I cannot understand how that argument could be made and applied even now or in the original Act.  This sum of £15,000 or £16,000 which has been presented to the proprietors of these sixty-four ratings is, of course, borne by the remainder of the ratepayers: artisans, clerks, civil servants and others who are engaged in endeavouring to pay off the charges upon highly-priced and highly-rated houses.  It is they who are going to bear the cost of this exemption, and we are now asked to extend this gift to the wealthier portion of the population, because that is what it means. This does not apply only to the City of Dublin.  We have not the figures, and one cannot say how it applies to the County Dublin and the townships, but we know, as a matter of fact, that there has been a great deal of dissatisfaction at the cost entailed upon the rates, generally, by this exemption that was included in the original Act.  I speak now for the townships and the County of Dublin as well as for the city, and I know that similar complaints were made in respect to Cork and other towns, and also, I have no doubt, in respect to county areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It certainly is not desirable, unless there are some very strong reasons adduced which I cannot conceive, that we should allow this further exemption to be made.  We are repeating and extending the procedure of the last Act when we said to the ratepayers of Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Dublin, Dun Laoghaire, and the rest of the country: &ldquo;We are imposing certain charges upon you out of general legislation for the general good.  We know you are grumbling at the imposition, but it is <Col N="795" /> for the general good, and, therefore, you must bear it, but we are going to add to that another obligatory charge: we are going to make it impossible for you to collect rates from the proprietors of those new buildings, at least to the extent of two-thirds of what they would otherwise be required to pay.&rdquo; We are imposing upon the local authorities this obligation, that they are to make a free gift to some of their ratepayers&mdash;to a select few of their ratepayers.  Now I think it is unjustifiable that we should take that action, not for the general good, not for a general service which all citizens are going to benefit by, but solely and wholly for the benefit of these few people who have deemed it to be their interest, convenience or advantage to put up new premises.  It is entirely unnecessary, because these new premises in many cases have already been put up; they are already built, and why we should be asked to compel a local authority to remit rates to the proprietors of these buildings I cannot understand.  I wait with interest to hear what justification the Minister can put forward for inserting this provision in the Bill.  I beg to move the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to examine minutely the advantages that are gained by this remission of rates or the advantages which are expected to be gained in the building of extra houses, with subsequent benefit to the community.  I do want to say that there has been a great deal of confusion entailed by this particular section which has been included in the Act in regard to the remission of rates.  I can advert to cases that have come under my own observation in urban areas where the county authority is the assessor of taxes and assesses taxes not alone upon the rural but also upon the urban portions of the county; where the urban authority refuses to sanction any remission of rates on houses built under the recent Acts, where those who built on the assumption that they were going to get these advantages have refused to pay the full tax, where measures have been taken to press for the collection of the full tax and where the full tax had to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> It would appear that while provision was made that a local authority may, or where the Minister so directs shall make this rebate of taxation, it was to the major authority that rule should apply and not to the minor authority. The major authority is the authority that assesses taxation, and not the minor authority, which has only the duty of collecting the taxation and handing it in full to the county authority. The local authorities have a perfect right to say that they could not collect it.  After people have had their property assessed on a full valuation, and that money is payable to the County Council, there are cases where these people exempt themselves.  I do not know what kind of contention exists, or whether the Minister has sufficient authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What the benefits of this measure will be in future must be judged from our experience of past legislation of a similar nature.  We have no other means of knowing whether the present measure is or is not a wise one except we fall back upon the experience gained under the Acts already in operation.  Until I have information of that sort before me, I would not be prepared to prohibit the inclusion in the present measure of even the extended exemption that is proposed. It should be encouraged if it tends towards the provision of houses that are badly wanted.</P>
      <P>The exemption of houses is a very big inducement to those who go in for house building.  Houses will not be built by private enterprise or speculators unless there are some advantages offering.  I certainly would not support Deputy Johnson's proposal that these advantages be taken out of the Bill.  I have endeavoured to show the difficulties that have arisen in relation to the legislation already in operation.  Some of the provisions, in their method of administration, are ridiculous; they are things that the Minister should grapple with.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Johnson was a little bit off the track in speaking to his amendment.  There was a good deal of controversy in the Dáil when the provisions of the principal Act first came before it.  I think the opposition on that occasion was more <Col N="798" /> to the retrospective clauses contained in the measure.  The Act has served a useful purpose.  It has been, I believe, a stimulus to building, and in that way it has given employment.  I have a good deal of sympathy with Deputy Johnson's point of view, but I must say I rather expected that point of view would have come from the Farmers' Benches or from somebody representing a proprietory class than from any Deputy on the Labour Benches.</P>

      <P>In other words, the new section will only operate in cases where the valuation has been increased.  Where the valuation has not been increased the full rate will be paid.  In that way there will be no possibility of a situation arising such as arose in the city of Dublin, where, as a result of the application of this particular section, the rates in the city dropped to the extent of £31,000.

      <P>I want the Minister to make his case for the whole subsection&mdash;for the extension of exemption and the extension of the period during which the building may be deemed to be a new building.  We have not had a case for that made.  It may be useful if the Minister would make his case in favour of that extension. Then, perhaps, we would be somewhat clearer as to what is involved in this proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy wants me to make a statement in connection with Clause 11, but it seems to me that the whole clause is involved in this.  This clause contains provisions of two kinds (a) Changes in machinery and procedure; (b) an extension of the time for the erection of a new building.</P>
      <P>A.  <b>Changes in Procedure.</b>&mdash;In the working of Section 69 the following difficulties have appeared:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Unless the building is valued separately from the rest of the tenement it is impossible to say exactly what is the amount of the valuation to be reduced.  There must be some way, therefore, of segregating the valuation of the building from the remainder for the section to work satisfactorily.  This has been provided so far by order of the Minister, but it was not possible to make that order clear and mandatory without a definite legislative authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  It is often hard to say exactly whether a building is or is not a new building.  Section 69 leaves the question to the Minister, but only &ldquo;in case of dispute.&rdquo; Local authorities have given numerous decisions which cannot be justified but which, being in favour of documents, are undisputed, and, therefore, cannot be interfered with.  It is essential that, in the future, there should be a uniform <Col N="802" /> set of principles governing these decisions.</P>
    <P>3.  Questions have arisen as to the position of out-offices to dwelling houses.  If such erections are completely separated from the house and stand alone they must be treated as separate new buildings, though that was never the intention of the section.</P>
    <P>4.  A claim for reduction could be made at any time in the local financial year and, if upheld, the estimate of rates was upset to that extent, causing grave inconvenience to the rating authority.</P>
    <P>These points of difficulty are dealt with as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Sub-clause (2) provides for a segregation by the Commissioner of Valuation of the portion of the valuation of the tenement relating to the new building.  It confirms the determinations of this kind already made by the Commissioners under Order.</P>
    <P>2.  Sub-clause (3) requires that before the valuation of a building is reduced it must have been determined to be a new building.  The determinations already made by local authorities are not to be interfered with by the clause.  As regards all buildings not already the subject of such local determinations, no reduction will be given until the valuation has been revised.  The determination whether the building is or is not a new building will be made normally by the Commissioner when preparing the valuation list.  The few cases which remain outstanding from the lists for 1926-7 will be dealt with by the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>3.  Sub-clause (3) provides that garages, etc., are to be treated as part of the main structure, not as separate buildings.  Thus they can still be reckoned for the purpose of considering whether the alteration of the main building is so &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; as to make it a new building.</P>
    <P>4.  The determinations of the new buildings will appear with the valuation lists in March.  If an occupier is dissatisfied with an adverse determination he can appeal. <Col N="803" /> If he neglects to appeal before the 1st April he gets no reduction, even if he succeeds, during the ensuing year.  Delay in determining the appeal, once brought, however, will not affect his rights, and in any event a successful appellant will get the reduction in the year after that in which he appeals.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for the publication of a &ldquo;New Buildings List,&rdquo; etc., under procedure orders, see sub-clause (7).</P>
    <P>
      <b>B.  Extension of time for erecting new Buildings.</b>&mdash;The experiment first tried by Section 69 has been a successful one.  It is felt that it would be a mistake to allow the section to stop working on the 1st April next, just as people are beginning to know and take advantage of its provisions.  Sub-clause (6) therefore extends the time for the erection of a new building to the 1st April, 1930, but it limits the reduction of valuation for such buildings as do not come within the time fixed by the original section.  No valuation of such building is to be reduced under the section to an amount less than the valuation in force immediately before the erection or improvement. Thus, the rateable valuation of the rating area will never be reduced by the erection or improvement of a building, though the increase of valuation caused by the building is postponed for seven years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty still remains. It seems to me, from reading this section and the Minister's explanation, that he is confining his attention to additions to existing buildings or reconstructed buildings.  I would like to put this specific question.  If A, B and Co. desire to erect a new factory in a certain field which has never yet had a building on it, what is the position of that in respect to rating under the new proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, assuming there was no rate paid there before, the property will be re-valued and they get two-thirds of the reduction.  If there was a building there before, the rating of which was higher than what the <Col N="804" /> rating of two-thirds of the new valuation would be, it would not operate, or only operate so as to leave it as it was before the new valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that that clearly justifies my contention.  The only point the Minister is making is that if there was a building in existence, and rated, there would be no exemption which would reduce the amount payable by rates.  I want to say that this provision goes very much beyond that.  It extends to all new buildings and extends the period of exemption and the period during which new buildings will be erected.  It continues the exemption over a longer period for those buildings which have already been built.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is only in respect of buildings not completed by April, 1927.  In respect of buildings which are at present in course of construction and which would not be completed by that date, it is extended in respect of them, but the original Act, in so far as the length of its life is concerned, limits the exemption for a period of seven years.  We will presume that there is a house reconstructed, the valuation of which was £20, and that the new valuation was fixed at £20. In that case the rates will be charged on £20 for seven years, and not on two-thirds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point which <Col N="805" /> seems to be overlooked.  Deputy Johnson talks about the loss to the local authority.  Let us take the case he cited.  There is a building in a portion of a field valued at a certain rate.  That building is increased very considerably. The valuation of that building cannot be less than that of the old structure. Under this Bill there will be an additional income coming to the local authority.  What is the extra expense on the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It happens to be heavy at Ardnacrusha.  It means a great deal of additional expense in the way of hospital accommodation, and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to be a member of a local authority, and its contribution to hospitals is purely voluntary. In considering matters of this importance we would like to have something a little more practical than that which Deputy Johnson mentioned.  May I put the case of the other side?  Deputy Johnson asks why it is necessary to tax the ratepayers in order to get these new buildings.  I pointed out when this matter was under consideration some time ago in connection with the original Act that it is essential in this poor country of ours to give encouragement to building owners to erect factories, and give employment.  Why is it necessary to give that?  Because, unfortunately, the position as regards the city of Dublin is that it is the most expensive place in Europe to erect a building.  If a person connected with any industry has under consideration the erection of a factory, is it likely that he will erect that factory in the place where it is most expensive to build?  Of course, he will not.  Therefore, it is necessary to give some inducement to that industrialist in order to get him to invest his money here. What is the effect of this?  If we do not offer attractions of this kind we do not get factories erected and we do not get employment for the many unemployed around us.  For the life of me, I cannot fathom the object Deputy Johnson has in mind in opposing this proposal, because the effect of his amendment would be that this attraction, which I hold is very considerable, <Col N="806" /> would not be there, because the valuation, as pointed out previously, of many of these factories which we have recently erected here is very high, and, even with a rate of 16/- in the pound, it amounts to a considerable sum.  If you do not offer that attraction you do not get the factory erected, you do not get a large amount of employment for the unemployed, and you inflate the charge on the local authority, and also on the State&mdash;in the one case through the medium of the poor law in assisting the unemployed, and, in the other case, through the medium of the Unemployment Insurance Act.  That is the alternative that Deputy Johnson puts up to us, that we should inflate the cost to the local authority and the cost to the State and not give this attraction to those building houses.  I think there are very few Deputies who have given any consideration to this problem who will support Deputy Johnson's proposal, even amongst his own party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy sometimes expresses himself as being very proud of the achievements of the Dublin Commissioners, but now he is expressing the view, inferentially, that they cannot be expected to encourage the erection of factories by giving special facilities.  The obligation must be imposed upon the Pembroke Urban Council, the Rathmines Urban Council or any other council by this Dáil.  We are supposed to know what is best for the local authorities in respect of the remission of rates, and we are supposed to impose an obligation on them to do this, whether they would wish to give facilities to a particular factory or not. If the Deputy is so anxious regarding the improvement to buildings, factories and the like, perhaps he would join with me in pressing upon the Minister the desirability of so changing the law as to remove the imposition that is placed upon people who improve their factories or their buildings.  Any improvement is immediately followed by an increase in valuation, which is the most effective deterrent on building that I know.  But the Deputy would join with those who ask that a firm like Messrs.  Players, who have ample funds and ability to pay even <Col N="807" /> out of their business operations in this country, should be treated in exactly the same way as any other company or firm which is desirous of risking things. The Deputy wants to make this wholesale and mandatory exemption from rates.</P>
      <P>The Minister assures me that the meaning of these hundred or two hundred lines is not that which I have read into them.  I hope that will appear in the final reading, and, with the assurance that the Minister gives me, I am not going to press the amendment.  If I am convinced, on a re-reading of the sections, with his explanations, I hope that the Senators who on a previous occasion did a certain surgical operation with his previous Local Government Bill may repeat it on this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In page 7, to delete in line 56 the words `The Blind Persons Act, 1920.' &rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment of an entirely different kind.  In Section 3, sub-section (1), there is a reference to the transfer of the powers and duties of the county council, in a series of Acts, to the boards of health.  That list of Acts includes the Blind Persons Act, 1920.  The deletion of this from the Schedule would mean, of course, that there would be no transfer to the boards of health.  My object, I may as well confess, in moving this amendment is to find out from the Minister whether there is any intention on the part of the Ministry to put into operation the Blind Persons Act of 1920. Section 2 of that Act says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the council of every county and every county borough, whether in combination with any other council or councils or otherwise, to make arrangements to the satisfaction of the Minister for promoting the welfare of blind persons ordinarily resident within their area, and such council may for this purpose provide and maintain or contribute towards workshops, hospitals, homes or other places for the reception of blind persons and with the approval of the Minister do such <Col N="808" /> other things as may appear to them desirable for the purpose aforesaid. the council shall&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>this is mandatory upon the Council, and the Minister is responsible under the Act for seeing that the council do the work&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;within twelve months after the passing of this Act prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme for the exercise of their powers under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be seen that the section is very widely drawn and that the council could do very many things to aid the blind of this country provided they got the Minister's approval.  They would be empowered to provide homes for the blind, to supplement the earnings in occupations which are specially suitable for blind persons; they may establish a Braille library, do many things for the assistance of the blind, and encourage employment and make them self-dependent to some degree.  But we have not had any or practically no schemes of that kind submitted by the councils in the past to the Minister for approval.  I speak of that very broadly. Whether there are any schemes or not I cannot say, but very little indeed has been done, if anything at all, in fulfilment of that obligation which is jointly upon the council and upon the Ministry. I would like to have some assurance, when we are putting in a schedule of this kind, to transfer the responsibilities from the county councils to the boards of health, that it means, and the Minister will see that it means, not merely a transfer of responsibility under the Act, but will mean the actual fulfilment of the obligations under the Act.  This is a section of the community whose lot has been considerably worsened since the coming of the Free State.  If my information is reliable, and I think it is, the position of the blind persons in this country is very much worse than it was prior to the passing of the Treaty, and the fault is largely, I fear, that of the Minister for not stimulating the councils to do their duty under the Act.  I would like to have some assurance from the Minister that the intention in inserting this Blind Persons Act in the Schedule <Col N="809" /> is that there shall be henceforth, at least after the passing of the Act, a fulfilment of the obligations, and that he will do all that lies in his power to ensure that the local councils will be reminded of their obligations and will fulfil them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is largely to meet the views expressed by Deputy Johnson here that this addition to the principal Act has been inserted.  The machinery for dealing with blind persons is by no means operating smoothly at the present time.  As the Deputy pointed out, Section 2 of the Blind Persons Act, 1920, imposes on each county council the duty of making arrangements to the satisfaction of the Minister for promoting the welfare of blind persons in their county, and of submitting to the Minister for approval a scheme for that purpose.  Sub-section (4) of that section empowers the council to carry out their duties in connection with such a scheme by means of a committee, of which two-thirds of the members are to be drawn from the council.  The functions of such committees were transferred by Section 15 of the Local Government Act, 1925, to boards of health, and the proposal of the Act of 1926 is to vest in boards of health the powers of the county council under the Blind Persons Act, 1920.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grounds of this transfer are the desirability of having this service administered in conjunction with public health services by the board of health, and the failure of the county councils so far to formulate schemes for the welfare of the blind, the only council which took action in regard to bringing such a scheme into operation being the Dublin County Council, although this Department drew attention to the duties devolving on county councils under the Act of 1920.  The failure of councils to take action in this respect is probably due to the comparatively small number of blind in the Saorstát, being only about 3,250, and also to the fact that if the blind resident in county boroughs are excluded there is an average of less than 100 blind persons per county.  Of this number, a recent return shows only <Col N="810" /> about 94 blind persons in the Saorstát counties suitable for training, and not yet provided for in institutions.  The county councils have not the machinery for investigating the cases of the blind persons scattered through their counties, and the administration of schemes by them would mean appointments of more officers.  So I think that Deputy Johnson may feel reassured that the passing of this section will tend in the direction of improving the administration of this particular service.</P>

      <P>I have set down a considerable number of amendments to this Bill in my own name, because they were discussed on the last stage and I wanted to have an opportunity of explaining them.  I am not by any means proposing to accept these amendments.  The first amendment is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  &ldquo;In page 15, line 59, after the word `time' to insert the words `before the expiration of twenty years from the date of application.' &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment which was previously listed in the name of Deputy O'Connell.  It was moved by Deputy Johnson, and I asked that it should be held over so that I could make inquiry as to what would be the position if in the case of either a voided or a lapsed application, publication did occur after the twenty year period from the date of voidance or lapsing.  I cannot see that <Col N="811" /> the Deputy's amendment would serve the purpose which he has in mind.  The Deputy explained that he thought that, at the end of twenty years, an application which might have the germ of an idea but which had not been followed up, should be open to the public, so that somebody might avail of it.  If it were published, even after the twenty-year period, that would, then, be a reason for blocking any application which might take up the idea.  It is far better to leave the thing in obscurity and not to have it published, as the mere fact of publication would afterwards avoid any application which contained the same idea.  That was the opinion I held myself, and I have had that verified.  In England, up to 1885, the law was not exactly that applications of this type should be published after a certain time, but there was nothing said about them, and occasionally they made their way into print. There was considerable administrative difficulty, and a question arose as to whether the mere fact of accidental publication was not blocking an idea from afterwards being made use of.  To preserve the idea, even though keeping it in obscurity, and leave it to be worked out, if it should occur to somebody after the period, an Act was passed leaving the position much the same as will be effected by this Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition, I might point to some of the other difficulties in the way of the amendment.  It would mean considerable administrative work, because there would have to be a register kept of these lapsed and voided applications, and exactly who is going to benefit by that I cannot see.  One would have to imagine a person, not an inventor himself but in search of other people's ideas, who would continually search the register for these voided or lapsed applications and see if any of them could be brought up in another form.  But the mere fact of publication would afterwards destroy any new application containing that idea.  The amendment would not, therefore, effect the purpose the Deputy had in mind, and there would be enormous extra work thrown upon the office.  For this reason, I ask that the amendment be not pressed.</P>

      <P>I admit that there is some force in the Minister's contention. It seems to me that while it may have the effect of leaving the possibility open for a new discoverer of the same idea it may prevent use being made of that idea unless the second person comes along&mdash;that is to say, if there was validity in the idea, not only is the use of it precluded from any individual who might exploit it if he came across the same idea, but the community as a whole and the State lose the value of that idea.  I should like it to be provided&mdash;it could be done by the procedure I proposed earlier&mdash; that where an application for a patent has been abandoned it should become void for twenty or thirty years, but that then it should become the property of some person who would utilise it, perhaps, under licence from the State.  I can conceive, for instance, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce or a development commission might say: &ldquo;Here is an idea that has been lying dormant for twenty or thirty years. The patentees had every opportunity during that period to develop it.  It is not right that it should be lost entirely to the world.  We will now see whether some person, or group of persons, can make anything of that idea for the common good.&rdquo; That is what I would like to be made possible by the Act, so that any good thing included in the specification should not be lost entirely to the community.</P>

      <P>Before we pass from this section, I should like to know from the Minister if the conditions set out here apply to patented articles not manufactured in the Free State.  In this section there are a number of provisions for the prevention of abuses of monopoly rights.  I should like to know whether these provisions are operative outside the Free State or if they only apply to patented articles manufactured in the Free State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I understand the Deputy's point. These conditions would apply only to patents which are operative in the Free State.  I cannot understand how the Deputy's point would have application to articles patented outside the Free State.  Assuming the monopoly right of the patentee here, assuming the presence of some of the abuses which are set out in serial form in the section, if those abuses be proved to the satisfaction of the Controller, then he will grant a licence to somebody who will work the monopoly right in a way not regarded as an abuse by the Controller. I am not convinced that I have answered the Deputy's question, because I am not sure that I understand it.</P>

      <P>Let us take the case of a patented article manufactured in America, and sold in this country. Under the section that we have just amended, if the price of that article in this country is in excess of the price in America, the matter can be brought before the Controller.  To whom, then, can the Controller apply?  This is an abuse of a patent right in the Free State, the manufacturer being in America.  The duty is cast on the Controller of dealing with certain matters that are set out as abuses of monopoly rights.  I want to see how he is going to carry out the obligations cast upon him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I am at a loss to understand the Deputy's point. The Controller would not apply to anybody. He would make up his mind unaided. It is possible that inquiry might have to be made, in the case quoted by the Deputy, in America to find out at what price the article was being retailed there.  Having got that information, it is for the Controller to make up his mind whether, under all the circumstances, the article is being retailed here in a way that would constitute an infringement of this section.  I do not think there is any necessity to bring in the holder of the patent in America. It would be rather a matter which would concern the retailers of the article which embodies the patent.</P>

      <P>But the holder of the patent is in America.  I do not know whether the Minister appreciates my point or not.  If the patented articles are manufactured in this country it is easy for the Controller to get at the manufacturer, in the case of abuse as set out in this section.  But suppose that a number of those abuses exist here but do not exist in England or America, what will be the effect?  The person who has a patented article will choose the country for manufacture where there are the fewest restrictions.</P>

      <P>In page 57 to delete lines 32-42 and to substitute therefor the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>(iv)  the publication in a collection of prose or poetry or of both, bona fide intended for the use of schools and so described in the title and in any advertisements issued by the publisher, of passages not exceeding in each case one hundred lines from published literary works not themselves originally published for the use of schools in which copyright subsists: Provided that such passages shall not include passages taken from copyright works within five years from date of first publication and that not more than two of such passages from works by the same author are published by the same publisher in any one book, and that the sources from which such passages are taken are acknowledged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the amendment of which I gave notice on the Committee Stage.  I notice that in the report of the Committee Stage there has crept into the amendment, of which I then gave notice, a phrase which is not actually incorporated in the text of the amendment as now before the House.  The interpolated phrase would have come in after the words &ldquo;of both,&rdquo; at the beginning of the second line of the amendment.  As reported in the official report the phrase &ldquo;mainly composed of non-copyright matter&rdquo; came in.  I had not intended to have that phrase used, and I am not now proposing it because it would destroy the effect that is sought to be produced by this amendment. I explained the facilities it was intended to give Irish publishers in order in some way to try to take away the difficulties under which they labour in opposition to English publishing firms, which have an amount of general copyright matter at their disposal which they may use without payment by agreement with the author, and for which an Irish publishing house would be made to pay, and pay <Col N="817" /> heavily.  I said I was leaving this amendment over, intimating that it seemed to be a good amendment, and that it would be put down and put to the House for acceptance unless in the interval I could get explained to me what were the special advantages gained by adherence to the Commonwealth Convention, as opposed to the Berne Convention, because I definitely stated that this amendment, while possible with adherence to the Berne Convention, seemed to be definitely and specially outside the Commonwealth Convention.  Just whether that is so 1 not I am not clear at the moment.  It would be a matter for inquiry afterwards.</P>
    <P>I have had one objection put up to this, that under this it would be possible simply to have an anthology of modern poetry, and put a back upon it&mdash;&ldquo;Intended for the use of schools,&rdquo; and sold generally to the public, but in the guise of a school-book.  I have had that examined.  The suggestion was made that that might be prevented by putting in towards the end that &ldquo;the sources from which such passages are taken are acknowledged,&rdquo; and say that such a publication should only be issued to the order of schools.  It is a dangerous addition.  It is not thought right to put down any addition of the sort here.  One cannot say with any definiteness what a court would do in the circumstances, but it seems likely that a court interpreting &ldquo;bona-fide intended for the use of schools&rdquo; would in the circumstances put to me, definitely rule against the publication of such an anthology as coming within this section, and that, in fact, the danger that is apprehended does not exist to any great degree.  I have not got any clear statement as to what are the advantages of adherence to the Commonwealth Union rather than to the Berne Union.  There is certainly greater rigidity.  I think the Berne convention is rather the wider of the two conventions in that respect, because it allows for certain changes to suit the convenience of different countries, and this seems to be the part that ought to be changed to meet our requirements. I am, accordingly, moving to have this amendment accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a point that the Deputy had raised.  The Deputy had said that obviously one hundred lines of this type of book would be more than a hundred lines of another type of book.  That is so, but it is a hundred lines from a published work.  In other words, the published hundred lines will not depend so much on the form in which they appear in this publication, but on the form in which they ordinarily or originally appeared, and it would really be a matter for the court to determine, in any case, even supposing it is meant by the use of smaller type, or something else, that one was able to get 150 lines instead of a hundred.  It is not regarded that that is of any great consequence, and I am not making any change in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This was an amendment in Deputy O'Connell's name, and I asked that it should be held over so that I could have it considered. I would ask that it should not be accepted unless we hear some stronger reasons for it than what were put forward. To a certain extent there has been a movement outside the Commonwealth Union by the acceptance of the last amendment.  Just so far that is going to hold I cannot say at the moment. Inquiries must be made to see. To accept this amendment would be definitely to leave that Convention, and for no reason so far stated.  It does seem to be rather ungenerous to limit the term from fifty to thirty years.  I would not have minded the term of, say, a patent being limited, where it was going to be a matter that might flow over to industry and where there might be certain work depending upon it, but this copyright matter gives the benefit of a particular type of work to <Col N="819" /> a man's descendants.  I understand that previously in England the term was not so extended, that it was later made fifty years in a fit of sentiment into which the English people got when they found that the grandchildren of Dickens were in abject and dire poverty; it was recognised that if the copyright had been enlarged to its present term their particular position would not have come about.  One must recognise that changing the term would penalise, not the writer of the ordinary ephemeral type of novel, but the authors of good work, work of a lasting nature, and they are not so many but that their property might not be improved by having the term fifty years instead of cutting it down to thirty. There are countries in which the right is perpetual.  There are other countries in which the right is life and eighty years, and I think it will be found that the countries in which good work, with which copyright would be associated, is being produced are the countries which have the life and fifty years term.  You will get countries with life and five years, but I would like to examine the literature of these countries to see what had been produced in order to find out the reason why they adopted the shorter term.  I would urge the case that this is a definite step outside the Convention, the precise effect of which we are not clear about yet, but it is a step outside for no special reason that has been stated.  Secondly, as this pertains rather to the good type of literary work, it does seem a little ungenerous and somewhat illiberal to cut down the term unless we have a good reason for making a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My feelings in this matter are not very strong, except that I felt when we were granting special privileges, not merely to the author of a work but to the producer of a design, or many other things commercial in their value, that the special privilege might be restricted to a period which would ensure that the author or producer would benefit and his children would also benefit until they came at least to thirty years of age.  That is a reasonable proposition.  If you take thirty years it means that the youngest child <Col N="820" /> would be at manhood and there would be more reason in that than a figure of fifty years, which does not seem to have any special reason attached to it.  If in the working out of this the Minister can assure himself that the fifty years secures better literature, better design and better production generally, I have nothing to say against it.  But I think the case for fifty years as against thirty ought to be made, and I think the limitation of thirty years has more to be said in its favour than fifty, because, as I say, you have the man or the woman protected during his or her lifetime, and the youngest child until he or she becomes thirty years of age gets the benefit of the parent's mental activities. That, I think, is a fair period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I will express the opposite opinion from that expressed by Deputy Johnson.  I think after what we have heard from the Minister that the period of fifty years is none too long.  In fact, one would like to argue that it is not long enough.  Deputy Johnson says that the interest of the family in the copyright of the work, which may be very valuable, should cease after thirty years.  I do not agree, in the same way as I would not agree with Deputy Johnson if he suggested that in the case of a man who had spent his life in the building up of a business, or any other form of reproductive activity, at a certain time after his death that property should be taken because, forsooth, his children have had the benefit of the business for a certain period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  We are giving an incentive for the production of something which is for the public good, and if it is not of benefit to the public the copyright is very little value. In other words, the copyright is only valuable in what it covers, and one can conceive quite well where, as has often happened, the production of an author, or the production of one's brain, does not materialise as commercial property during the lifetime of the author at all and that it may be a long time after <Col N="821" /> that the real value of the work is secured.  I do not wish to put forward the suggestion, in face of what the Minister says, that the fifty years should be extended any further, but I would certainly strongly oppose the reduction of the fifty years to thirty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is largely concerned with amendments 9 and 11.  In reality amendments 8 and 9 are consequential on amendment 11.  The idea of this amendment is to take Trinity College out of the class in which it stands, along with the National Library and the British Museum, and to put it into another class with the other University Colleges of the country, which is provided for in amendment 11.  The only reason I had for suggesting the amendment was that I thought it would not make any difference to Trinity College in actual fact, and that it would put the whole four University Colleges <Col N="822" /> in the Free State on the same level as regards this privilege.</P>
    <P>It applies only, of course, to books produced in Ireland.  So far as I can see, the arrangement that Trinity College at present adopt as regards books produced in England could be applied to these books without any additional trouble or expense.  The only result of amendment 8 would be that Trinity College would be put on the same level formally as the other universities and university colleges in the Saorstát.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>On a matter of procedure.  I think it is quite clear there are two distinct points.  There is the point of the transfer of Trinity College from sub-section (1) to sub-section (2), and the second point&mdash; which, I think, we should keep quite distinct&mdash;that is the substitution of the other university colleges for the libraries named.  I should like to suggest to Deputy Tierney that, though it may not be a serious thing, it is a definite real point for Trinity College to be retained in the section where it has been placed.  We have no separate grant for library maintenance, but the fact that we are put in sub-section (1) by the Minister would relieve us in the matter of the agency which is maintained for applying for books generally.  It is not a mere matter of form&mdash;there is a real point in being in sub-section (1) instead of sub-section (2).  That does not affect in the slightest the main object which I am sure the Deputy is seeking, namely, the provision of better library facilities for the university colleges. But this does Trinity College definitely an injury without doing the other university colleges any good.  I appeal to the Deputy to take the second point and leave the first one untouched&mdash; that is to say, leave Trinity College in sub-section (1).</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor TIERNEY Professor TIERNEY">
      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no desire in putting down the amendment to inflict any injury on Trinity College.  My only idea was that it would look better, from a formal point of view perhaps, and be more satisfactory from the point of view of the other colleges, if the four were on the same level.  If it <Col N="823" /> is a fact that definite financial loss would be caused to Trinity College by the treatment suggested in amendment 8, I would not wish to press it&mdash;that is, if it is in order.  However, before the question is definitely settled, I should like to understand more clearly in what way financial loss would be involved to Trinity College.  I understood that it would be possible for Trinity College to make use of the agency, which it makes use of at present for English books, for the purpose of procuring books produced in Ireland.  I must confess I do not quite understand yet how this amendment would make it necessary for Trinity College to set up extra machinery for these Irish books.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain that further, because it does depend to a certain extent upon what is done with the third amendment.  Suppose that was carried, and the Oxford and Cambridge libraries were cut out, the advantage that we get from association with these Universities in maintaining a common agency would cease, and we should have to maintain our own agency for the Irish books.  I do not say it is serious.  It would mean probably an extra clerk in that agency. I could not exactly say how much it would mean, but it is real, not purely formal for us.</P>

If the fate of this amendment could be left open, while we discuss the more important, even though a later, one, I think it would be of benefit to all concerned.</P>

      <P>That course would, in fact, be more in line with the purpose I have in moving the amendment. Amendment 11 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 68, lines 22-24, to delete from and including the words &ldquo;the Bodleian Library,&rdquo; line 22, to the word &ldquo;Wales,&rdquo; line 24, and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, the Library of University College, Dublin, the Library of University College, Cork, and the Library of University College, Galway.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at this matter, not as a University representative, or as a person necessarily interested in this particular University College, but from the point of view of the country as a whole, and as the ordinary representative of a country constituency, it struck me that it would be a peculiar thing if a Bill like this were allowed to go through containing a provision giving privileges to a number of libraries in England, Scotland and Wales, which may not at the moment, be very valuable, but which might, in the course of ten or twenty years, become valuable&mdash;as the original privilege has become very valuable in the course of time&mdash;if a Bill were allowed to go through giving these privileges to foreign Universities and making no provision whatever, and no reference whatever, to the three quite poor and badly-provided-for University Colleges that we have in this country. It would be a very peculiar kind of provision and a very peculiar act for the Dáil to perform.  I started out with the notion of trying to have that question debated on its merits, not to try to do anything in the matter of the privileges which Trinity College already possesses, because it has nothing to do with it, but to confine the matter to those books produced in Ireland and to try and secure that the interests of the three University Colleges mentioned in the amendment would not be lost sight of. It then occurred to me that if that amendment were to be passed it would be very desirable, as the Minister has said, that Trinity College should take its place along with the other University institutions in the country in <Col N="825" /> regard to this privilege, instead of being put in a special position alongside the National Library and the British Museum which have that privilege&mdash;at least the National Library, it may be supposed, has that privilege largely for purpose of registration and seeing that a proper collection of the books published in the country is kept somewhere.  It is not necessary to provide for that in more institutions than one, and for that reason I thought it would be more logical and more satisfactory from the point of view of the other colleges, and look better in general, if Trinity College were put in the same position as the other three University Colleges.  However, that is more a formal point, as I have said.  The question would arise whether it would be a matter of more expense to Trinity College if it were accepted and carried out.</P>
    <P>What I want to insist upon in moving Amendment No. 11 is that it would be a great pity, and most peculiar, to say the least of it, if we made elaborate provision for supplying Irish books free to four foreign colleges, and made no provision at all for providing books produced in Ireland to our own colleges here.  This privilege in relation to Irish books may not at the moment, as there are not perhaps many books being produced in Ireland, be of great value, but if, within the course of the next ten or fifteen years, there is an improvement in the Irish publishing trade, and a big number of the ordinary text-books used in schools and colleges begin to be produced in Ireland, a privilege of this kind would be of the greatest possible value to our university colleges.  It would be of value in a way in which such a privilege is really not of value to Oxford or Cambridge University. The point was made, I believe, that by the inclusion of Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Wales in this section you would be doing something for the advantage of Irish authors.  I should like to point out, in the first place, that this section as it stands provides that Irish books be supplied to university libraries only on the demand of those libraries themselves, so that the authors will have very little to say in the providing of this advantage to them.  It <Col N="826" /> is really intended, and it was intended originally, to be of advantage to the universities, and it is only of definite advantage to the universities, as far as I can see.  As regards the university colleges of Dublin, Cork and Galway, this amendment which I have proposed would be of most value in the case of ordinary text-books which would be produced for the use of school and college students.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that at present University College, Dublin&mdash;and I am sure the same is the case with the other university colleges&mdash;suffers a certain disability in that regard which is not met by the existence in Dublin of libraries such as that of Trinity and the National Library.  Undergraduates in universities are not easily permitted to study in other university libraries. It is not an easy thing for an undergraduate of University College, Dublin, to become a reader at Trinity College. That is not at all unnatural or peculiar. It is not easy for him at present to become a reader in the National Library.  There are certain difficulties in the way, and if he does become a reader there, and goes in to study some text-book which may perhaps be somewhat out of the way, or may be quite an ordinary text-book for his purpose, it may not be very easily procured.  He may find that the National Library does not keep it, because it has to a certain extent ceased to keep minor text-books. He might then simply have to fall back on his own college library, and I suggest that it would be a very valuable privilege to that college library to get a supply of such text-books as are produced in Ireland.  These three libraries at present are not well provided for. I can speak best, of course, of the library at University College, Dublin, which is not well provided for at the moment in the way of building and in the way of funds, and, in general, any little benefit it could get from the operation of such an amendment as I have suggested would be most welcome. I say that in face of the statement that the housing of such books as might be procured under this would be a difficulty. I do not see where the difficulty would come in.  This leaves it optional for the college library to ask only for <Col N="827" /> the books it wants, and there is no necessity for it to undertake the housing of a large quantity of books.  It can pick and choose and make up its own mind as to the books which it requires, according to the exigencies of the space at its disposal.</P>
    <P>I think that point does not arise very much even in the case of University College, Dublin, which, perhaps, is the worst provided for of all in the way of space.  In the case of Cork, I think the arguments for my amendment are even stronger than for University College, Dublin.  The library of University College, Cork, is the only one of its kind that exists in the second biggest town in the Saorstát.  For that reason it should be provided for in a Bill of this kind on much the same lines that the National Library is provided for.  Certainly in a Bill like this it should be provided for in preference to the libraries of Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh or Wales.  The library of University College, Cork, has certainly a bigger claim on this State for a privilege such as this is than those external libraries to which a privilege of this kind can never be nearly as valuable as it would be to a library like University College, Cork.  The case for both the University Colleges of Cork and Galway is really stronger than the case for Dublin.  Even in the case of Dublin there are certain classes of books for the use of which the ordinary student, both undergraduate and post-graduate, must fall back on the library of his own college. We have something like 1,200 or 1,300 students in University College, Dublin, at the present time.  A considerable proportion of these could not by any possible stretch of the imagination be regarded as finding it easy to be admitted either to Trinity College Library or the National Library.  It would not be physically possible for them to become readers in one or other of these two libraries.  For that reason I think that we have every right to ask, on behalf of University College, Dublin, and of the University Colleges of Cork and Galway, that instead of going out of our way gratuitously to make provision for the supply of Irish books to colleges in England, Scotland and Wales the <Col N="828" /> State should first think of its own University Colleges with their poorly equipped libraries for which it is primarily responsible.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputy Tierney that I am in complete sympathy and agreement with the purpose that has moved him to put forward this amendment.  I would point out to him, however, that it seems to me a little inopportune. I agree with him that it is desirable and it is the duty of the State to see that the three constituent colleges of the National University are provided with properly-equipped libraries, dealing with all the subjects with which a university has to do.  This amendment, I submit, will go a very little way, if it will go any way at all, towards effecting that purpose.  Consider the number of subjects with which a university has to do.  Take anything from pure mathematics to wireless telegraphy, or perhaps I might take Greek, in which Deputy Tierney has distinguished himself.  How many books dealing with Greek literature and archæology are published in Dublin? To equip a library it is not the books of to-day that you want; it is not the books that can be procured now from publishers that you want.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tierney knows, probably better than I do, that though there are many books perhaps published across the Irish Sea and obtainable to-day in Greek, there is still a greater number published on the Continent.  A very large proportion of the books that the Department with which the Deputy is concerned would require are at present out of print.  They only can be procured by gift or be purchased secondhand, and by ways in fact that call for a direct money grant.  I think, as Deputy Tierney has brought up this point, that he should frankly propose on a proper occasion that such a grant should be made.  If he did so, he certainly would have the support of his fellow University representatives.  If this amendment can help in any way the libraries of Cork, Galway and Dublin, I am afraid it will be only in a very small way.  As I have said, I am in sympathy with it, but I do not believe it will go very far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> I would like, before the Deputy moves for the exclusion of these four libraries in England, Scotland and Wales, that he would look at the question from another aspect.  We talk of ourselves as a land of saints and scholars.  I apologise for using the old cliché.  I will not say anything about the saints at present.  I know that our reputation for scholarship is perhaps a delicate one and must be handled with care.  I will leave Wales and Scotland alone for the moment, but they certainly have a claim on our regard as kindred nations.  I do know a little about the libraries of Oxford and Cambridge. I know that they contain a vast amount of material: manuscripts, books, records and documents of all sorts of immense interest to Irish scholars, and Irish research scholars particularly.  I know that those libraries welcome Irish scholars who go across to them.  There are no scholars more welcome than those who go from this country.  It so happens that this year I was in both libraries.  In both of them I saw our own students working. I saw students from Galway and I think two students from Dublin.  It is well that the continuity of Irish literature should be kept up at these centres.  It is certainly appreciated there, and our scholars in these places avail of their opportunities to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>The other day an Oxford scholar, working on a subject of great interest to Irish Gaelic scholars, completed his book, copies of which he sent to a Dublin Library.  As well as that, he sent a vast amount of manuscript material to a Dublin library&mdash;it was not Trinity College&mdash;in order to help research scholars who might be working on the same subject over here.  There is that solidarity and co-operation amongst scholars that I would be very loath to injure or break it in the slightest way. I am sure that Deputy Tierney feels with me in this, and that it is not the spirit of the Dáil to do so.</P>
    <P>I remember an incident that happened in another Dáil to which I had not the honour to belong, and at a time when money was very scarce.  That Dáil met under cover.  They were forced to hide their light under a bushel, but they sent a sum of, I think, £200 to a <Col N="830" /> Continental scholar to complete a work of interest to Irishmen.</P>
    <P>I know how word of that passed around from scholar to scholar, and how it was applauded all over the world of scholarship.  I know I felt, as a humble Irish scholar, very proud indeed that the Dáil of that period had time to think of that and do it.  I would be very sorry to look at this question from a purely national and insular point of view.  I think there is a bigger question involved, and I would rather like to take a wider outlook. I suppose that later on this evening we will be talking of the League of Nations and Commonwealths.  I would remind the House and Deputy Tierney that we belong to a Commonwealth of Letters; that we are rather proud of belonging to it, and I would not like at this moment, when we are joining other unions, to do anything that would be interpreted as illiberal, as a desire to withdraw in on ourselves and retire from that wider world in which our scholars have played a rather fine part.  I admit that we are a poor nation, but surely we are not so poor that we cannot afford to do justice to the constituent colleges of the National University and provide them with proper libraries, and at the same time continue to act with the generosity that is certainly appreciated and reciprocated by our friends and scholars overseas.  The amendment would have appealed far more to me if it did not involve the exclusion of those four libraries across the sea.  If the Minister were willing to accept an amendment according the privilege to seven libraries I certainly would be willing to support that.  In conclusion, I just wish to bring before the Dáil and Deputy Tierney this point, that in advancing his amendment there is a wider perspective in which the whole question should be viewed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor TIERNEY Professor TIERNEY">
      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate again that I am not looking at this question as the representative of the National University.  I am not one of the representatives of that University, but I am looking at the question as the representative of a very rural constituency, and I am trying to take what would be the point of view of the in <Col N="831" /> structed man in the street.  That point of view is this: that even supposing in this case you have to choose between a series of English, Scotch and Welsh libraries and a series of Irish libraries, it surely is more proper and fitting that we should decide in favour of the Irish libraries, especially in view of the fact that we are poor and very much in need of some consideration.  To put it at its lowest, this Bill will certainly look strange to the man in the street who thinks about it when he finds that there is provision made in it for supplying Irish books gratis to the university libraries of Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Wales, and that there is no provision made at all for the supply of Irish books to the three university college libraries that we have in Ireland, and that in the Bill there is even no mention made that these three university college libraries exist.  In these circumstances, the Bill, if passed like that, might as well be the British Copyright Act of 1911 all over again, taking no account of any university institution in Ireland except Trinity College, but turning particular attention to the supply of books to Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Wales.</P>
      <P>Deputy Alton has said that this privilege is not a very valuable privilege at the moment.  I do not know whether he said &ldquo;at the moment,&rdquo; but I will put that in myself.  It may not be very valuable at the present time, but there is no saying how valuable it may become in ten, twelve, or fifteen years. If it is valuable at the present time to an Oxford or a Cambridge library, surely it would be equally valuable, and perhaps more valuable, to libraries which will have a more direct interest in books produced in Ireland than would Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh or Wales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned there are not very many Greek books produced in Ireland.  There are not.  There will probably be a good many Irish books, a good many books on Irish history. Irish geography, Irish economics, and other questions concerning Ireland, which it would be more to the interests of these university college libraries to <Col N="832" /> possess, than it would be to the interests of libraries outside Ireland to possess. These books will be produced in greater volume as time goes on, and I think it would be a pity to have a Copyright Act passed by the Oireachtas and set up as a model for years to come, making provisions such as are suggested for English, Scotch and Welsh libraries, and not making provision for the libraries of our own country, the libraries that we will be responsible for.</P>
    <P>It would be a particular injustice in the case of Cork, because the library of the University College, Cork, is not only a college library, but it is also the most important library that exists in Cork.  If it is necessary in the interests of the International Commonwealth of Letters to send Irish books free to Cambridge and Oxford, surely it is still more important to send them to Cork.</P>
    <P>I do not dissent from what Deputy Alton has said about the necessity for an interchange between different countries, but before you can conduct that interchange on any kind of a just basis, you must provide first and foremost for your own country.  While sympathising with the necessity for friendly relations between our own and foreign universities, I think it would be a great pity, and it would look very bad, indeed, if an Act went forth from the Oireachtas making provision for foreign libraries, and neglecting to make any provision for our own libraries.</P>
    <P>As a representative in the Dáil of a rural constituency, I have no interest whatever in proposing that the Government should give a special grant to the libraries of these university colleges.  I have a doubt, even if I wished to do so, that it is the right way to go about it. I feel it would be still more peculiar to have an Act like this passed, making mention of certain colleges in other countries, and making no mention of our own colleges, and then to make special financial provision for these more or less pauper colleges which it was thought unnecessary to include in this general provision in an Act that will have validity for years to come.</P>
    <P>First and foremost we should make provision for our own libraries, and then if it were thought necessary we could make provision for continuing the <Col N="833" /> privilege given to Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Wales in the 1911 Act of the British Parliament; we could do that by some special means.  It would look much better and much more reasonable and sensible if this House considered the interests of the college libraries directly under its charge.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give us some enlightenment on the point whether he considers that a maximum of seven free-gift books should be imposed upon the publisher?  It seems to me that the proposition here is made on the assumption that seven books and no more shall be imposed upon the publisher as the price of the privilege of copyright.  If that is the case, I certainly say the preference in respect to three of the colleges should be given to the Irish colleges.  But would the price of ten books be too great to impose?</P>

      <P>And that, by the way, at the option of the colleges.  I do not know whether that would be looked upon by publishers, and possibly even by authors, as too great a privilege; but it was stated here before on behalf of authors that there was a certain advantage to them in having free-gift copies of their books in a number of libraries inasmuch as it acted somewhat as an advertisement.  I do not know whether the number of seven books is the maximum the Minister himself has laid down, or whether it might be possible to meet the claims of the respective advocates and add three more books so as to include the Irish University College libraries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Copyright has very little to do with this matter.  The security of copyright does not depend to any degree upon this whole section. If there is any bargain arising out of this section it is simply this: the definite privilege of having a single copy of every work published in England delivered here automatically is secured if we on our side deliver a single copy of everything published here to the British Museum.  If there is any bargain, or <Col N="834" /> anything approaching a bargain, it is that.  Once you have that, it is a matter of this House doing what it pleases, there being various peoples to be considered, the publishers, the Irish University Colleges, and certain English University College Libraries which used to get books from Ireland but which need not necessarily get them now.</P>
      <P>I said here the last day that I was not at all impressed by the case made, that the libraries mentioned in sub-section 2 should continue to get a copy of every book published in Ireland.  I moved to delete that sub-section.  I raised an argument, and incidentally misquoted a member of the Committee. I represented him as saying that it was to the advantage of authors that books should be sent to these four University College Libraries.  The actual argument he used on the Committee was that it was to the advantage of this country that books should be sent to these four libraries, but that authors had represented to him that they thought it was in the author's interest also that books should be sent.  I said I was not impressed with these arguments. The Committee, however, accepted them, the Bill was modelled on the Committee's Report, and consequently this sub-section appeared.  I was moving to delete the sub-section.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tierney's proposal is that we get the same number from the publishers as before, but that we should divert the volumes to other colleges. With regard to the publishers, I felt it was hard to impose on them the necessity of sending four copies outside the country.  We gained nothing by it in the sense of other books coming here. I did say I felt publishers could not complain very much because they had entered into their business under conditions which necessitated their sending six copies of published works&mdash;this is the old arrangement&mdash;to the four libraries mentioned here, Trinity College and the British Museum.  There is a single book extra; the number now is increased by one.  The publishers have always complained of this burden, but if they have anything to complain of in addition, it is represented by a single copy of every book published, if demanded by certain people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> That is the situation.  You have the publishers on the one hand with their grievances that they are made supply these books.  I was moving to wipe out the provision in regard to these books outside the single copy to the British Museum.  Deputy Tierney comes along now with the proposal that these books should be diverted to the University Colleges named.  Any argument I used as to the difficulty of housing these books has not application to this section.  That argument was only in reply to Deputy Magennis, who suggested that a copy of everything published in England should go to the university.  It was then I mentioned the difficulty with regard to housing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tierney has made one new and very good point, and that is that the college library in Cork is definitely the main library in the southern counties and there is a definite need that it should have provision made for it. Dublin is pretty well provided.  It has a National Library, Trinity College Library with, we hope, better access, and the Deputy proposes to add the University College, Dublin.  There is not the same case to be made for this book going to another Dublin institution as there is for the provision of the book to Cork College Library.</P>
    <P>I have no sympathy whatever with the proposal to send those extra copies outside the country.  This is the most open of open questions.  My own personal view about the matter is, if people are not impressed with the fact that any additional burden is thrown on publishers, then undoubtedly the books had better be diverted to the three university colleges here than to the three colleges abroad.  If one were to take the publishers' objections into consideration, and to take into consideration the grievances the university colleges suffer from in not having anything like adequate provision made for them in this matter of library facilities, I think the grievances of the colleges should be allowed to outweigh the grievances, whatever they be, of the publishers, particularly as there is only a single additional copy now required from what used to be required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> If Deputy Tierney's amendment is carried, my own proposal, of course, falls.  I would be disposed to agree with Deputy Tierney's amendment leaving it to be considered afterwards whether, on some basis of reciprocity, an arrangement might be made with these other colleges outside the country.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Tierney made a complete case for the inclusion of the university colleges in this section.  I do not think either he or the Minister dealt adequately with the corresponding part of his proposal, namely, to exclude the university libraries in England, Scotland and Wales. Personally, I should regret that very much.  I think it would be a really retrograde step on our part.</P>
      <P>There is no difficulty in explaining the presence of this provision.  It is simply little more than an act of courtesy that has been going on from this country to these libraries for many years.  I am sorry I cannot give actual figures, but I do not believe the cost to the publishers in this or in any year for the past number of years would come to three figures.  It has been a very small thing.  It has been merely an act of courtesy, and the burden on the publishers must indeed be very small.  When you take everything into consideration.  I do not believe the cost is anything of real importance.  It is merely, as I have said, an act of courtesy and good relationship between this country and those university libraries.  I entirely support what my colleague, Deputy Alton, has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though I quite understand what the Minister said about the exchange of one book from this country for one book from Great Britain.  I think there will be a greater disposition to weigh that bargain from a material point of view across the water than at present.  I believe if you take out this clause in the way that Deputy Tierney suggests it would be more advisable.  I support Deputy Tierney in his case for the three university colleges.  I do not think it <Col N="837" /> would put an undue burden on the publishers and would not be likely to do so for years to come.  I think it would be an admirable solution if the Minister could see his way to adopt it.  You are ceasing to do a gracious thing which costs the country very little and you are introducing a matter that might, perhaps, involve danger.  In my opinion I do not think it is worth while to risk that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely rise to support my colleagues in saying that I heartily approve of the amendment of Professor Tierney.  I think it is only right that the University Colleges should be included in this.  At the same time, I agree that it would be a serious thing for us to stop sending books to Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Wales.  As Professor of Medicine in Trinity College, Dublin, there reaches me, with the compliments of the publishers, practically every work in medicine that is worth while.  That must be done for some purpose, and the purpose, apparently, is that I should recommend these books to my students. It is quite possible that the authors may bear the expense of that.  I do not, in fact, know whether the publishers or the authors do so, but edition after edition of such books reaches me so as to keep me in touch with things that are going on.  If the publishers, or the authors, think it worth while to send me these books in order that particular works should be commended by me, surely it would be a good thing for Irish authors to have their books still reach the libraries of Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Wales.  I think it would be a pity to exclude these libraries, because it seems to me that there is no great desire on the part of publishers to cut down the number of books which they send forth as an advertisement for authors.  There would be no great hardship on publishers if we continued to send these books and, at the same time, include the university colleges, which have a just claim to a copy of each Irish book published here.</P>

The only point which I desire to make is that if we are confined to a particular number of books we should from every point of view, especially from that of form and the very appearance of things, consider our own libraries first.  I would like to hear whether there is any possibility of sending books as before.  I would like to reinforce what Sir James Craig has said about publishers on the other side. I am convinced that it is the publishers and not the authors who take such trouble in sending out these books.  It is very easy for a university professor, or other person engaged in teaching, to get even costly books, because the publishers believe that giving them in that way is really an advertisement in itself. Perhaps it would be possible for Irish publishers to be brought round to that point of view.</P>

How then can it be possible to fit into that arrangement the further discussion of this very important question, the Imperial Conference arrangement?

      <P>The Seanad to-day, after consideration of the Wireless Telegraphy Bill, made two verbal amendments. The first is in Section 4, Clause 6.  The section before the Seanad read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if both such Houses shall, within twenty-one days, upon which either such House has sat next after the regulation was laid before such Houses, pass resolutions annulling such regulation, such regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such regulation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The change made in the Seanad was to substitute &ldquo;either such House&rdquo; for &ldquo;both such Houses,&rdquo; so that the section would read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas ... and if either such House shall, within twenty-one days ...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A consequential amendment changes the word &ldquo;resolutions&rdquo; in line 62 of the same sub-section to &ldquo;a resolution.&rdquo; The object of the change, in the mind of the Seanad, was to prevent a curtailment of its authority in acquiescence <Col N="844" /> in regulations made governing the application of this Bill and laid on the Table of the respective Houses.  The word &ldquo;both&rdquo; and the alternative word &ldquo;either&rdquo; have been, I think, on previous occasions the subject of controversy here, and in the majority of cases the latter word has been accepted. It is now merely suggested that the same should apply in this case.  I see no objection to the inclusion of these amendments.</P>

      <P>The next item on the Orders of the Day is consideration of the report of the Select Committee on the Land Bill (No. 2), 1926.  I received to-day, from Deputy Heffernan, a motion which has been circulated and which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that all the recommendations of the Select Committee appointed to consider the Land Bill (No. 2), 1926, should be included in any future proposal for legislation to amend the law relating to the occupation and ownership of land.</P>
      <P>The motion is one of which notice has not been given and, therefore, under Standing Orders it can only be allowed by special leave of the Chair. The report of the Select Committee was before the House on the 7th December &mdash;eight days ago.  During that interval, I think sufficient time was afforded to frame a motion of this kind.  Therefore, I would not be disposed to accept the motion without notice, unless the House were unarimously to agree with such a course.</P>

      <P>The discussion of that point would bring us to the merits of the motion.  The position is that this motion was tabled this morning.  It certainly fails for want of notice.  On the 7th December I said, on three occasions, that if there was any matter on which Deputies wanted a decision they could be furnished with a method of obtaining that decision. No steps were taken in that direction until to-day.  Therefore, I think the motion should not be taken without notice when objection is taken to that course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>A very large number. I do not pretend that they are all very serious amendments or that they raise very serious issues.  But there was a large number of serious amendments accepted&mdash;some of them my own.  These amendments considerably extended the scope of the Bill, and I submit they go a long distance to meet the demands of nearly all parties.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to deal with the amendments which are verbal.  I only intend to deal with amendments which are important and which are in connection with contentious issues.  I have accepted, I should say, about five important amendments in connection with issues that have been debated here in the Dáil often&mdash;amendments that different parties hold different views about.  These amendments represent, to some extent, a compromise between the views of parties on these particular issues.  That is, I think, if I may say so, the right function of a select committee&mdash;to find such right compromise, and in that respect, at all events, if not in other respects, this select committee was useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first amendment is in connection with building ground.  Deputies will remember that building ground was excepted simpliciter from the Land Act of 1923.  That was not the first time that building ground came up for discussion in connection with Land Acts here and elsewhere.  It was excepted from practically every Act passed since 1880, dealing with agricultural holdings. We continued that tradition, rightly or wrongly, in the Land Act of 1923.  There was more reason, as a matter of fact, to continue it in the Land Act of 1923 than in the others, because in the Land Act of 1923 there was power taken to purchase what were called &ldquo;future tenancies&rdquo;&mdash;that is to <Col N="847" /> say, agricultural tenancies, which were subject to termination at a year's notice, and the tenant of which could not get a fair rent fixed.  That extended the Land Act of 1923 a long way. As we had extended the Act to all tenancies, no matter when created&mdash; even though created in the immediate past&mdash;and in view of the fact that these tenancies were created between people in exactly the same circumstances in life, and for temporary reasons, and created deliberately as terminable tenancies, we were extending the Land Act of 1923 in a very big way.  For that reason there was all the more cause to be careful about problems like building ground in connection with the Land Act of 1923.  The case was made that this particular exemption from the Land Act of 1923 was operating harshly in a great many cases.  First of all, there was an undoubted grievance in a typical case where a man owned 200 acres of land, and where the Judge held that though only five acres of it adjoined the road, and was, therefore, building ground, the whole farm, notwithstanding that it was held as a judicial tenancy, was exempt from the Act. That was obviously unfair, and it was only necessary to see that state of affairs in existence to get the admission at once that that had to be dealt with. That was dealt with, first of all, in this way:&mdash;It was decided that where the Judge found that a portion of the holding was building ground, that portion should be sub-divided from the rest, and the remainder of the holding purchased, after the rent had been apportioned, on the terms set out in the Land Act of 1923, and that the building ground portion should remain as it was&mdash;that is, as a present tenancy or a future tenancy for a definite period.  That definite period was fixed at five years.  It was provided that during that five years the tenant would have security of tenure on that building ground except as against the landlord, and except as against the landlord, who had rights over it for one purpose and one purpose only.  He had a right to take it up for immediate building.  If the landlord failed to exercise that right to build or begin building on this land within five years, then it automatically <Col N="848" /> vested in the tenant under the Land Purchase Acts on his application.  I think it is generally agreed by all parties that that meets that case fairly.</P>
    <P>There was then the question of subtenancies. There were a number of sub-tenancies in the country&mdash;not a very large number, but a considerable number.  I could not even give the approximate figures, but Deputies can take it they were a number sufficiently large to make it a genuine grievance for a considerable number of people. There were a number of such tenancies existing on holdings that had been purchased under the previous Land Acts, that is, under the Ashbourne Act, the Land Acts of 1903 and 1909.  These tenancies, as a rule, came into existence after purchase, and they are in existence now for a great many years. Under the Act of 1923 these sub-tenancies could not be purchased.  I should not use the word &ldquo;sub-tenancies&rdquo; in such cases, because a man who has purchased his tenancy is no longer a tenant. He is owner in fee, subject to a mortgage. The common name for them is &ldquo;sub-tenants.&rdquo; They were sub-tenants, if you like, of purchased holdings. These holdings are now purchasable on terms practically agreed to by the Committee&mdash;that is to say, they are purchasable in the same way as tenancies which existed and which were purchased under the Act of 1923, whether judicial or non-judicial.  They are getting exactly the same terms.  They are referred to as &ldquo;agricultural tenancies.&rdquo; I am not quite clear whether there could be a judicial tenancy of such a holding.  They are generally non-judicial. They might be what are called &ldquo;present tenancies&rdquo;&mdash;tenancies which could not be terminated except for failure to pay rent.  Or they might be future tenancies, terminable on a year's notice.  They generally were future tenancies, although there were some exceptions.  All these tenancies are purchasable in exactly the same way as if they were tenancies under the ordinary Land Acts and subject to a land annuity.</P>
    <P>With regard to fishing rights, fishing rights were reserved to the State under the Land Act of 1923.  I thought that that was right and I still think it is right, as a rule.  But this gave rise <Col N="849" /> to a rather peculiar state of affairs. Land had been purchased under the Act of 1903 on the banks of a river in respect of which the fishing rights had been transferred to the tenants, while the fishing rights in respect of lands on the opposite side of the river, purchased under the 1923 Act, were reserved to the State.  That gave rise to a most extraordinary anomaly, that tenants up and down the river, who had previously purchased, owned these fishing rights, while tenants who purchased under the Act of 1923 on an estate between them did not own them.  That was obviously an impossible situation. If one body had the rights it might be possible to make something out of them, but it would be quite impossible to make anything out of them where you had two distinct bodies, and we take power, in order to meet that sort of case, where the Land Commission thinks fit, to transfer the fishing rights to the tenant.  That is not compulsory.</P>
    <P>We made a slight change, if it is a change, in regard to mill holdings.  It was not the intention of the Land Act of 1923 that what used to be called mill holdings should be exempt from the Act, and, in fact, disused mill holdings were not exempt.  When there is a question as to whether a holding  agricultural or not, and that is a question on which such an issue would turn, it comes before the Judicial Commissioner, and the effect of the Land Act of 1923 is that holdings which were originally let as mill holdings and which are now disused, should not be exempt.  But it was found that for one reason or another, in some cases, if you like, borderland cases, mill holdings were exempt, even while the mill was not in use.  We make it clear that a holding originally let as a mill holding, and on which the mill is now disused, shall be purchased as an agricultural tenancy when the other requisites of an agricultural tenancy are present.  Of course, on this question we will meet with some difficulties, as we did before, though not perhaps as many.  A mill holding on which there is a disused mill will come up before the Judicial Commissioner.  He will reject it as an agricultural holding, for perhaps an <Col N="850" /> entirely different reason, and people will come to the conclusion that it is because a mill is on it.  In any event it is quite clear from the Act now that a disused mill is not a ground against the holding being regarded as agricultural.  On the other hand, there are cases that will come in now that did not come in before.</P>
    <P>Now we come to fee farm grants, and this is an important point.  Deputies will remember that in the Act of 1923 fee farm grants were dealt with. In the congested districts land held under fee farm grants vested automatically as untenanted land in the Land Commission: they had the powers which they had in regard to any other land which vested in them and which they did not need for congests or for distribution.  They had power to sell to anybody, including the owner, and they sold it to the owner.  But the fee farm grantee, the man who occupied the land in the congested districts, was in the happy position that where he owed arrears of rent the Land Commission could allocate a certain amount of the purchase money, which should go for the tenant's interest and which corresponded to the amount of rent that was in arrear to the owner, which was, in fact, adding the arrears to the purchase money.  So that in the congested districts fee farm grantees, in fact, purchased their lands under a system which enabled them to add the arrears of rent to the purchase money.  Outside the congested districts the system was somewhat different.</P>

      <P>I know it is not, of course.  That is rather an important and rather an astute question, in view of the fact that the real dispute is as to whether fee farm grants are ten ancies or not, and Deputies have forgotten, perhaps, that in the 1923 Act there was a clause which provided that all tenanted land was subject to the <Col N="851" /> ten per cent.  I hope that Deputy Wilson will now receive it as final that I happen to be right in my view of fee farm grants and that he is wrong. Outside the congested districts they were in a slightly different position. It was left to the owner to make application to the Land Judge to redeem the rent, an advance was made to the grantee for the redemption money, and he paid it off by annuity in the same way as a tenant purchaser would.  But he could not make such an application while there were arrears of rent.  There is one other slight difference.  As the Land Commission have to buy all fee simple untenanted land in the congested districts, these lands in the congested districts, vested as untenanted lands, are vested at a sum which was what I might call a Land Commission price, that is, rather a small price compared with the market value.  Out of that price the Land Commission had to allocate the landlord's interest and the tenant's interest, and that had the effect of making the annuity somewhat smaller to the fee farm grantee in the congested districts than it would be outside the congested districts.  Outside the congested districts the application is made by the grantee; there is no question whatever of the price of the land, and there is no limitation imposed on the Land Judge by reason of the fact that he has to fix a maximum price for the tenant's interest, the grantee's interest and the grantor's interest.  He has only to consider the fee farm grantee and the redemption of the rent, and in practice that will result in a slight difference as against the grantee in the annuity.  Outside the congested districts we have divided fee farm grantees into two classes&mdash;that is to say, land which bears an agricultural rent &mdash;though that is by no means an accurate or a scientific definition.  All agricultural rent is, like the price of barley, depending on the quality of the barley, and it may vary from 10/- to 35/-.  To get anything like an accurate test of the distinction will require some drafting.  It has not yet been done, but we can get it.  But they are divided between fee farm grants held under agricultural rents and fee farm <Col N="852" /> grants which are not held under agricultural rents.  The latter are purchased in the old way.  They are generally small rents or very high rents. They apply, and the rent is redeemed. Men holding fee farm grants outside the congested districts apply to the Land Commission, and the Land Commission vests the land in the same way as it vests automatically in the congested districts.  The only difference is that in the congested districts it vests automatically, and it is resold then compulsorily to the tenant.  In the non-congested districts it does not vest automatically; it is left to the grantee to apply.  If he applies it vests and is resold.  We are all at one up to a point&mdash;that is, the point at which the land vests.  The Land Commission have to decide whether they require the land for the relief of congestion, which is a proviso I insisted on; they must have that discretion after the land vests, because they require a tremendous amount of it.  A big proportion of the land which we acquire inside and outside the congested districts is land held under fee farm grants.  Therefore we must preserve that right to the Land Commission.  But after they have come to a decision on that point it is suggested that if they decide to resell they shall resell as if the rent was an agricultural rent.  That was, to reduce it by 25 per cent., then reduce it further and make a fair rent of it, and then resell it on that basis.  I do not want to be, as the Ceann Comhairle knows, in any way contentious, but that is an absolutely irresponsible suggestion to make.  People forget that fee farm rents were always in an entirely different position from agricultural rents.  Fee farm rents were always a negotiable security.  They were always regarded as sacred.  No Land Act applied to them.  They were regarded as good security up to 80 or 90 per cent. There was never any question about paying these rents.  Agricultural rents, on the other hand, were never regarded as such a security.</P>

      <P>Do not start interrupting me.  Since 1840, agricultural rents <Col N="853" /> have been subject to constant changes. They have been dropping all the time under pressure of one kind or another. Between 1840 and 1880 they fluctuated, went up and down, according to the whim of the landlord and according to the pressure of the tenant.  About 1880 they were reduced, and they have been reducing ever since.  It would be impossible for anyone who knew what an agricultural rent was forty or fifty years ago to recognise it now.  They had been dropping, and while they have been fluctuating in that way there has been constant agitation to depress them further, with the result that the ordinary agricultural rents were never a valuable security except for about quarter the value.  No owner of ordinary agricultural rents could get an advance on them up to the full value or anything like it.  That should be perfectly obvious to anybody who considers it.  No banker from 1880 to 1923 would give an advance on an agricultural rent which was constantly fluctuating&mdash;the whole tendency being to depress it&mdash;to anything like its market value.  It was never done.  Fee farm rents were always in a different position. They were good securities for banks; they were good securities for business-men and the owners.  It would be nothing short of confiscation; if people are in favour of confiscation they should say so.  There could be a very good academic case made for that, provided you know what you are going to do with what you confiscate.  I am afraid even if we did agree to confiscation the difficulties would only begin after we had succeeded in confiscating &mdash;and when we had to make up our minds what policy we ought to adopt in regard to the property confiscated. I say quite deliberately that it would be something in the nature of confiscation at this stage, suddenly after sixty years of agitation, to treat fee farm rents as agricultural rents, and I am not going to do that.  What is more, there is no necessity for it.  We are doing these men extremely well now. I think we are doing them too well. We are giving them power at the public expense to redeem their rents.  We are reducing their rents; in the nature of the case they must be reduced considerably <Col N="854" /> because the land must be bought as untenanted land.  We are doing the one thing necessary to meet the man who has perhaps met with misfortune. That is to say, we are adopting a procedure which compels the land judge to add the arrears to the purchase money. We are not in a position, I think, to discuss residential holdings, because it is not one of the recommendations. Hence I do not propose to say anything on that.  The fact is, I have met every point that was put up.  At least I have gone some distance to meet them.</P>

      <P>I do not think so. There were only two contentious amendments agreed to by the Committee which I do not propose to insert in the Bill.  One of them is the amendment I have just referred to, the amendment in connection with fee farm rents, that fee farm rents be treated as agricultural rents.  The other is an amendment which nobody on the Committee, and certainly not myself, understood but which most people fought over; which Deputies now say they did not understand or agree to, and which I do not propose to insert in the Bill.  That is the amendment compelling the Land Commission to reinstate&mdash;that is what it means if it means anything&mdash;in their original holdings and to eject, presumably, the present occupiers, every evicted tenant who was evicted during the days of the Plan of Campaign.  This <Col N="855" /> amendment was proposed with great enthusiasm, but the enthusiasm subsided shortly afterwards when people began to realise what it meant.  Nobody wants that amendment now except the original mover, so the only amendment between us is the amendment in connection with fee farm grants.  That can be moved; it is quite clear to me, though it is not for me to decide these matters, that it can be moved.  When the Bill which I propose to introduce is put through it can be debated on Second Reading or on the Committee Stage, but that procedure is not to be adopted.  This procedure has held up the Bill.  All this debate could take place, as I pointed out, when the Bill is introduced.  The contentious amendments could be debated on the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage. I am to be asked will I give a form of undertaking.  I will not.  It is not my business to find out whether such an amendment is in order.  It would be the obvious duty of Deputies who are so interested in land purchase to find that out; they have not done it.  Here we are with this debate which accomplishes nothing which could not be done on Second Reading, and we will have the same thing over again when the Committee Stage is reached.</P>

      <P>The Minister professes to view with horror the act of Deputies in postponing the hurried passage of this Bill.  He is evidently in a wonderful hurry.  Any day lost in its passage, any obstruction put up by anybody to make this Bill acceptable is a national calamity in the Minister's eyes.  What was the Minister doing during the last twelve months and since 1923?  How many times has he been asked and pressed to introduce a Bill?  It was not a question of days or hours with him, it was a question of years.  He has come along with it now, and he seeks to make the case that we are delaying it by a few hours or days.  A certain class of tenants whom it is proposed to relieve in this Bill has waited in vain since 1881, since the first Land Bill was introduced. When they waited so long they could wait for another week or two.  So much for the Minister's horror of the attitude of Deputies on these Benches. <Col N="856" /> He has refused to enter into the clause dealing with residential holdings.  He fought shy of that.  He does not agree with the recommendations.  He does not agree with two of them.  He does not approve of the Report of the Committee because it contains two particular clauses.  We do not agree with the Report of the Committee, because it does not contain more, because it rejected two distinct amendments, one dealing with residential holdings, and the other dealing with fee farm grants. We do not approve of it either, and I venture to say some of the arguments, especially in regard to fee farm grants that were advanced in the Select Committee would not be advanced in a public debate, they were so ridiculous and so unsound.  We have had cases with regard to residential holdings in which the Land Judge had, of necessity, to give a judgment in a certain direction. Even where it can be proved beyond yea or nay that these holdings were in the possession of the people who occupied them for seventy or eighty years, and that the residences were built by these people, the Judge, by the terms of the 1923 Act, is forced to regard them as residential holdings.  That may be equity and justice in the eyes of the Minister, but it is not justice in our eyes.  The amendment dealing with that particular class of tenancy was defeated by four votes to three.  Owing to some confusion about the time of the meeting, I was unable to be present, otherwise, perhaps, a different aspect might have been put on the matter.  My presence, at any rate, would mean an additional vote for the amendment, and the voting would be equal.  Perhaps even some of my arguments might have weighed with the Minister.  This exclusion of residential holdings is as much abused a provision as the potential building value clause.  I do not know that there is very much use in dealing with the merits or demerits of it at this stage, inasmuch as it is not recommended. I suppose we had better reserve it for the Second Stage of the new Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to deal with fee farm grants and with the Minister's objection to the recommendation sent forward, we deal with something that we are entitled to deal with.  The <Col N="857" /> recommendation passed by the Committee reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Provided that the redemption price fixed by the Judicial Commissioner shall in no case exceed the standard price fixed for tenanted land of similar character as agricultural land in same neighbourhood as based on subsection (1) of Section 25 of the Land Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not want that.  He will not incorporate that in his new Bill.  That amendment passed by the Committee preserves the last shred of equity and justice for a class of tenants that the Minister has left out in the cold.</P>
    <P>Let us go back on the history of the whole matter.  The Minister talked about agricultural rentals being no security for money, or a very indifferent security, in 1840.  That is not true. I have more experience than the Minister. I am an older man than the Minister, and I came more in contact with these things in those early years than he did.  I think it was in 1881 that the State first interfered with regard to agricultural rentals.  Up to that time every tenancy was the same, no matter what the title&mdash;as far as the tenant was concerned.  Whatever title was put on a letting, it was all the same to the tenant. In the extraordinarily bad years between 1860 and 1880, especially 1878, 1879 and 1880, a state of affairs existed during which we had wholesale evictions. They began in the famine years and continued up to 1880.  There was no security for any class of tenant, except those who were able to secure one of those long-term leases or fee farm grants.  There were some people in the country who could help themselves.  Some people happened to have money and were able to offer considerations to the landlord whereby they got these particular leases.  They were able to advance a certain bulk sum of money to the landlord&mdash;£200, £300, £400, £500 or more&mdash; and got long-term leases at £2 or £3 per acre.  They got, perhaps, a fee farm grant at £2 or £3 per acre.  As I say, they were able to help themselves.  They were able to give this security, but the vast bulk of the tenants were unable to help themselves.  The result was that <Col N="858" /> in 1881 the British Parliament came to their assistance.  They were unable to help themselves, and the State had to help them and came to their assistance with the first Land Act in the early eighties, giving them security of tenure. That was the first time that the State ever interfered with land values in this country.  As I say, all tenancies were of the same class at that time.  Everybody in the country was clamouring for security.  Those who were able to help themselves did so, and the position became so bad for those who were not, that the British Parliament had to step in and do it.</P>
    <P>We have always stated that where a genuine fee farm grant or long-term lease was in existence, we stood for respecting it.  Where this class of tenancy exists that the Minister refers to &mdash;where banks or money-lenders have advanced money with a reasonable degree of security&mdash;we stand for respecting that class of tenancy.  But am I to be told that a tenancy at £2 or £3 per acre, bearing a fictitious title, on which money may, or may not, have been advanced, should be protected by the laws of the country?  I say it is not equity or justice&mdash;I say it is a fraud. The man who got money advanced to the extent of £2 or £3 per acre has done something very little short of obtaining money by false pretences.  He does not come within the law, but he should come within it.  The bank or the money lender who is fool enough to advance money to that man deserves to lose not alone portion of it, but all the money.</P>
    <P>We did not want, and do not want, the operations of the Land Act held up. We did not want to have it held up with regard to the relief of congestion. With regard to this particular class, I proposed an amendment which was rejected for reasons that were absolutely unsound and would not stand the test of public opinion.  The Minister said it would interfere with the operations of the Land Commission in securing land in the congested districts.  In order to meet the Minister this was drafted:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That where, in the opinion of the Land Commission, the rental charged on a fee farm grant or long lease amounts to or exceeds a judicial rental, and where in the opinion of <Col N="859" /> the Land Commission such holding is not required for the relief of congestion, all the terms of the 1923 Act shall apply.</P>
    <P>The Minister still insisted that that would interfere with the acquisition of that class of land in the congested districts, and he got a majority on the Committee, but I say that the reasons he advanced were absolutely unsound and that the members of the Committee were misled by his reasoning. The Committee at a later stage thought to redeem itself and by a majority carried a portion of a previous amendment to the effect that the Land Commission should not run amuck and pay exorbitant prices for the redemption of this land.  But the Minister is not prepared to accept that.</P>
    <P>The rejection of the previous amendment guaranteed one thing only, and that was no matter what the rental was, two or three pounds an acre, and we have any amount of instances of that class of tenancy, the whole rental would be recoverable by law.  The arrears would be recoverable by law. No reduction on the arrears was possible and no reduction of payment in lieu of rent would be possible, and it should be redeemed one hundred per cent.  The only thing that rejection did was to secure to that class of landlord or whatever you would like to call it, the holder of a fictitious title, security in getting away with it, and he got away with it all, and he is getting away with it if the Minister has his way and if this House is going to reject this amendment whereby the rent fixed by the Land Commission shall not exceed a standard price.  I think it is time to put an end to this fictitious title, to this contradiction in terms, to a claim that has no foundation in fact.  I hope the House will not be of one mind with the Minister in this, and that when we discuss the new Bill which will be introduced we will be in order in proposing an amendment to amend this or a similar amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the position will be in regard to residential holdings. With regard to the other recommendation <Col N="860" /> the Minister takes exception to, that is the one dealing with the evicted tenants in the days of the plan of campaign, there was, as the Minister said, considerable confusion of thought with regard to that.  There was a motion here on the Order Paper for the Committee&mdash;I do not know if I have it with me now&mdash;but these words, &ldquo;the plan of campaign,&rdquo; were not in it.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="861" />&ldquo;That the Land Act of 1923 shall be amended to make provision for the reinstatement to their holdings of bona fide evicted tenants whose holdings are now in possession of the respective original landlords, their successors or other persons.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture objected to the motion and stated that it was ridiculous to think of reinstating all evicted tenants in their original holdings.  I pointed out that there was no such word mentioned in the motion as &ldquo;all,&rdquo; that it was bona fide evicted tenants I was concerned about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COSGRAVE</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Minister, and I will not be interrupted. The Minister then asked me to define what a bona fide evicted tenant was.  I explained in plain language that a bona fide evicted tenant was a tenant who was evicted on principle, for refusing to pay rent in the days of the Plan of Campaign, and for the purpose of breaking down landlordism. I then added to the motion after the words &ldquo;bona fide evicted tenants&rdquo; the following: &ldquo;who were evicted in the days of the Plan of Campaign.&rdquo; The motion was then put as amended, when it was carried by five votes to four.  The Minister then for the first time pointed out that the words added could not be embodied in an Act of Parliament.  I then suggested to strike out the words complained of, and to insert instead the words: &ldquo;who were evicted twenty-five years previous to the passing of the 1903 Land Act,&rdquo; when the Chairman ruled my suggestion out of order.  That, sir, is my explanation of what transpired at the committee meeting with reference to this motion, and I would ask you for your ruling as to whether I can amend the motion as suggested.  There are very few evicted tenants to be reinstated, thanks to the Wyndham Act, 1903, and surely to goodness the Minister for Lands and Agriculture will not prevent the reinstatement of the few remaining soldiers of the Land War to <Col N="862" /> their old homes, which are now in the hands of grabbers and evicting landlords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke of his dealing with potential building sites as if the last thing had been fixed, and justice had been done in this particular case.  Now, when the Bill of 1923 was passed through this House I put it to the Minister and to the Government and to the members of the Labour Party that they never intended, through the means of that legislation, that injury should be done to any tenant who held land with fixity of tenure.  This particular section in the 1923 Act, in the case of men who held land with fixity of tenure, took possession of that land from them, and handed it over to the landlord.  That was the effect of the potential building clause in the Act of 1923, and these amendments here which are supposed to remedy that state of affairs, do not meet the case.  A man who held land as an agricultural holding when the Act of 1923 came into operation, and which the judicial commissioner said was potential building land, immediately lost fixity of tenure, and in many cases got notice to quit. That is the position, and I put it to the Minister and the Government that they never intended it, and in my opinion ought to remedy it.  How do they propose to meet the case?  In this way: They propose to retain the possession of the occupier in that land provided that after five years the landlord does not build on it.  The tenant then gets back his possession.  What will happen in practice is that the landlord may not want to build on the land, but he will go to a speculator and say: &ldquo;I will resume possession of these particular acres.  I will give you the land for £5, £6, or £10.&rdquo; The man will say: &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; He takes the land from the owner, who perhaps held it for 60 or 70 years.  The incremental value that should have come to that particular man passes on to the landlord, and the landlord gets from the speculator this potential building value vested in him, while the other man loses his land and all.  I contend that that was never intended under the Land Act.  If there was an incremental value it should have <Col N="863" /> gone to the man who held the land, and not to the landlord.  The change that is proposed to be made here does not meet that case.  Some very peculiar anomalies have arisen on this point. We are coming now, I agree, to the winding up of this question of land tenure in Ireland.  The easy cases have been disposed of, and now we are coming to the jagged end and to the tangled parts.  The Minister cannot handle it as if he were unravelling a ball of twine where, meeting a knot, he could snap it off at any moment.  This is a question he will have to disentangle. The Minister, speaking in the Seanad on the 25th February, 1926, gave a definition of agricultural land as land held by tenants which came under the Land Acts passed between the years 1881 and 1909.  That was the Minister's definition of agricultural land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case this man held land subject to the judicial fixtures adjudicated on by the Commissioner. He decided it was potential building land, and therefore the man lost his holding as well as the chance of getting something out of it.  He is left now in the position that this particular value goes to the landlord, while he is left high and dry with his losses.  That has occurred in very many cases.  I know a case where a man paid £400 or £500 for a small holding.  By reason of this potential building clause in the Act of 1923 that sum of £400 or £500 has been wasted as far as that man is concerned.  That is a state of affairs that was never intended, and that, I am sure, the Minister never intended. Turning to residential holdings, there are, as Deputy Gorey mentioned, many cases in this country where the residence was built by the tenant.  Places have been adjudicated on by the judicial commissioner as being residential holdings, but in many of these cases the residences were built by the predecessors in title of the present tenants.  That cases such as these are to be decided as being outside the purview of the Land Acts is not, I submit, equity.  I know a case in Wexford <Col N="864" /> where a man held what has now been adjudicated on as a residential holding. The man's house was erected by his predecessor in title and contains two tenants paying rent.  The judicial commissioner adjudicated on the holding and said it was a residential holding. What happened in that case was that the landlord gave the man six months' notice, while he also wrote to the tenants telling them that on no account should they pay this man any more rent.  How is the Minister going to meet a case like that?  Is that, I ask, equity?  This building was erected by the tenant of that land.  That is a specific case of injustice and is not by any means a unique case.  There are several cases of the kind to be met with all over the country.  That is the reason why we are so anxious to get the question of residential holdings settled. This matter of residential holdings was only intended to apply to large cities. I do not think it is the object of the Minister or the Government to treat anybody unjustly.  There are many cases, however, where on investigation they will find that they are doing a wrong.  I contend that they should do something to meet the particular case I have mentioned&mdash;the case where you robbed the man of his potential building right and the value of the cost of his residential holding.  If the Minister and the Government intend to be just they should, we contend, include cases of this kind within the purview of their Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to bear out what Deputy Gorey has stated as to the exorbitant terms on which very many of these fee farm grantees hold. Many cases were put before me recently in which the rents varied from £1 per acre to £3.  This, I submit, is an impossible impost on land.  Anyone who knows anything about agricultural conditions in the present day will allow that.  The recommendations contained in the report of the Committee will not go any way to meet cases of that sort. The Government will have to find a much more drastic method of dealing with that problem than that contained in the recommendation of the Committee. There was one particular district in which I met a number of these fee <Col N="865" /> farm grantees.  They were not large holders of land, but small farmers working portions of land.  They are in the position of paying rents far in excess of the rents that their neighbours have to pay, because their neighbours were able to go into the land courts or benefited from the provisions of the 1923 Act.  As regards residential holdings, there are many cases of hardship involved following the decision of the Land Judge.  I know one particular case in which a man had been excluded from the benefits of the Land Act on the ground that his holding was a residential one.  He holds about 60 acres of land.  His house is something bigger than what an ordinary farmer would build on a holding of that nature.  All the same he is a bona-fide working farmer.  The house was built by someone who had been in occupation previously, but it is the only house he has to live in.  I think it is a gross injustice that that man should be debarred from the benefits of the Land Act because of the fact that his house contained perhaps two or three rooms more than that of the ordinary farmer.</P>

      <P>I notice that Deputy Gorey agrees with part of what the Minister said in regard to fee farm grants, but that he differentiated a certain portion of them as being more or less equal to Consols.  With that I agree. As far as I know, fee farm grants are divided by a line.  Some fee farm grants would be perhaps 150 years old and are still going.  Some of them are extremely small.  I should think that the largest of them is perhaps 10/- an acre, and mostly for good land.  In the old days these were always looked upon as a first-class security and are still.  Someone remarked that the value of land fell continuously from 1840 to 1880.  I think that is incorrect.  From my own knowledge, I can say that from the year of the Franco-Prussian War up to the year 1878 the value of land produce was extremely high, and farmers in this country did uncommonly well.  At the end of 1878 there was a tremendous slump, followed by a frightfully bad year in 1879, when the land trouble started.  When the Land Act of 1881 was passed there were a large number of future tenants, and I am afraid, unfortunately, <Col N="866" /> advantage was taken of that by the hold a great number of landlords had on them at that time. They gave them, I believe, fee farm grants at exorbitant rates which, I think, was what Deputy Gorey said.</P>

The injustice that he complains is being done to the tenants whose land is resumed for building purposes is not as great as he would have us imagine. It is a fact, and perhaps this has something to do with the decision of the Committee, that a tenant whose land is taken in that fashion is entitled to receive the market value.

      <P>The position was made quite clear.  I will be prepared to argue that question some other time.  We need not discuss it now. With regard to fee farm grants, we have some responsibility for the amendment that Deputy Gorey referred to.  I am sorry he thought it right to say two or three times that some members of the Committee were misled.  Deputy Gorey is in the fortunate position, I suggest, that he has never been misled about anything.  We have no regrets on this matter.  The more we have examined the position since we took a particular line on this amendment the more we are convinced that we were right.  It appeared to us that it would be very unwise to do any thing that would tie the hands of the Land Commission with regard to the acquisition of land.</P>

      <P>The Deputy suggested this amendment: &ldquo;That where in the opinion of the Land Commission. such holding is not required for the relief of congestion, the terms of the 1923 Act shall apply.&rdquo; I suggest that that would mean that the Land Commission would have to decide this question immediately. I also suggest that the whole question will have to be reviewed from time to time.  Those who have listened to the debates on the acquisition of land have realised that the problem will become more pressing every day, and that the amendment, in effect, will have the effect of compelling the Land Commission to come to a decision now. The case for the acquisition of land will be much stronger in a short time because of an amount of land available. Deputy Gorey's amendment would not meet the position of the people he had in mind.  In the main they are people with two or three thousand acres of land, and have no claim whatever.  I suggest that Deputy Gorey's amendment was intended to cover ranchers and people who have no claim for consideration under this or any other Land Act.</P>

      <P>At any rate that was the attitude we took up, and I resent the attitude of Deputy Gorey in endeavouring to suggest to the Dáil that we were misled.  With regard to evicted tenants the Minister has suggested that the amendment of Deputy Cosgrave, which was carried, is unworkable.  The majority of the Committee were influenced in voting for the amendment by a desire to do something towards improving an Act of Parliament that will have something to do with their position. I have a reply to a Question that was asked the Minister yesterday, and it is very convincing proof that the evicted tenants have been out in the cold so far as the Land Act of 1923 is concerned.</P>
      <P>We were anxious to insert some provision in the Bill that would make it compulsory on the Land Commission to do something for the tenants.  I realised when that question was being discussed that there would be a very grave difficulty in dealing with this question on account of the shortage of land for such purposes, and an amendment was suggested under which the Minister would agree to set up a tribunal that would deal with the evicted tenants' question from another angle altogether, granted that the amount of land available would meet the needs of all the people.  It was suggested, in the case of genuine evicted tenants, that the Land Commission would be empowered to dispose of their claims in another fashion, that compensation would be payable by the people who would obtain their lands at a nominal sum&mdash;a mere sacrifice&mdash;and that that compensation would be assessed by a tribunal to be set up by the Land Commission.  Although that amendment received considerable support in Committee, it was not carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to know this whole question, as I understood the Minister to say, can be dealt with when his Bill comes before the House.  I think it is unfortunate that the Minister has not agreed to accept all the recommendations of the Committee.  I do not think the members of the Committee would <Col N="870" /> complain if their recommendations were altered in some respects, but I think the broad principles laid down in the recommendations made ought to have been adopted.  I am willing to say that in some cases, perhaps, the recommendations do not go far enough.</P>
    <P>I disagree very much with the Minister in regard to the amendment carried by a majority of the Committee relating to the prices to be paid in respect of the redemption of fee-farm grants.  The proposal was that the price should not exceed that paid for untenanted land in the district.  The Minister suggested that was a revolutionary amendment; that it embodied the principle of confiscation. I do not accept that, and I do not think the people concerned, the landlords, should get preferential treatment or should get very different treatment such as the Minister suggested. If this is confiscation, well, I stand for confiscation of this kind, and I have no hesitation in saying so.</P>
    <P>That represents the matters I wish to make clear, and I have no regret whatever over the action Deputy Hogan and myself took in connection with this amendment.  I am satisfied we have a clearer conception of our position on this Committee than some of the people who criticised the Committee severely. I think we all did our best, so far as we could do it, having regard to the particular points of view and the particular opinions we held on various questions.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to stress the hardships on the person whose land is being taken as potential building ground, but it would be a very serious position indeed if we did adopt an attitude that would restrict building operations.  We have heard from every platform in this country the statement that housing and building work generally have been neglected and have been backward, and we were not going to be put in the position of talking with one voice in the Dáil and with a different voice in Committee.</P>
    <P>I think the matter has been fairly well met.  With regard to the question of evicted tenants and the amendments covering their cases that the Minister has not seen fit to adopt.  I am glad he has indicated that the matter can be <Col N="871" /> re-opened, if support is obtained for the proposals, when the Bill comes before the Dáil for consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister objected to the motion that I submitted for consideration to-day:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that all the recommendations of the Select Committee appointed to consider the Land Bill (No. 2), 1926, should be included in any future proposal for legislation to amend the law relating to the occupation and ownership of land.</P>
      <P>I want to point out that this Bill is going through an unusual and rather complicated procedure, a new procedure as far as this House is concerned. We are not yet thoroughly conversant with the best methods with which to achieve our ends under this Bill.  The impression I got from the Ceann Comhairle when the Minister spoke on the Report which was made by the Chairman of the Committee, was that the only method whereby we could get the voice of the House on amendments which the Minister decided not to incorporate in his new Bill was by introducing a new Bill on our own account. I conceived the idea of giving the House a chance of expressing its opinion, by vote if necessary, whether certain amendments ought to be incorporated in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Murphy when he regrets the Minister did not accept the recommendations of the Select Committee and so draft those recommendations that they would fit into his new Bill.  Although I am partly satisfied with the statements which the Minister made in regard to how far he has gone, I am strongly of the opinion that the Minister has not gone far enough. We had a hope that at least this Bill would deal with what can be considered the remnants of the Land Acts passed in previous Parliaments.  I am afraid the Bill as promised by the Minister will not completely settle the tag-end of the difficulties connected with the land question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with residential holdings, I regret very much that the amendment which we put down dealing with that question was defeated in <Col N="872" /> Committee.  I still believe&mdash;in fact, I know&mdash;that though the amendment was defeated, it is yet within the power of the Minister to introduce an amendment dealing with its subject-matter. I would ask him to introduce an amendment dealing with the question of residential holdings so as to give the House a chance of expressing its opinion, by vote if necessary.  I am not sure that the Minister will satisfy the House that he has a right to exclude all residential holdings from the provisions of the Land Act.</P>
    <P>There are numbers of hard cases.  I know many hard cases such as those pointed out by Deputy Wilson.  I believe a section could be drafted covering these hard cases.  I believe, as regards the amendment, that we had before the Committee in which we said that if the valuation of the land exceeded the valuation of the residential holding&mdash;and to all intents and purposes that is the case&mdash;the few hard cases that would result from the acceptance of this motion would be fewer than the hard cases existing caused by the non-acceptance of that motion.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the fee farm grantees, I will not traverse the ground already traversed beyond saying I believe a solution of that matter has not been found.  I am in agreement almost altogether with Deputy Gorey and Deputy Wolfe when they said that the fee farm grantees are divided into two classes.  One class, to all intents and purposes, may be regarded as ordinary tenants, and that because of the peculiar form of holding and the peculiar immunity which their landlords enjoy they have not been so regarded, and they are still out for the advantages other tenants gained who purchased.  The real difficulty about the fee farm grantee is this, and the Minister knows it well.  No matter what form of procedure they take&mdash; whether under Section 38, or the form of procedure which is now proposed by the Minister, they will still have to pay a high rent.  There is no indication whatever that a man paying £2 an acre now will get any reasonable reduction when he becomes the owner of his land, either through the operation of Section 38 of the Land Act of 1923 or <Col N="873" /> under the new section, which the Minister now proposes to introduce.  The real grievance of these men is that they have no indication that they are going to get a reduction that will place them on a level with their neighbours who have got the benefits of the Land Acts. That is the reason that the fee-farm grantees are not availing of Section 38, because they have no indication of what reduction they will get, and they are afraid that if they come in under Section 38 they will make themselves owners in fee-simple subject to an annuity which they will not be able to pay in view of the economic conditions. The distinction the Minister draws between a fee-farm grantee and an ordinary tenant is purely artificial and legal and not real or actual.  If the Minister has not accepted the amendment moved by Deputy Gorey, or the amendment moved by me, which was ruled out of order by the Chairman of the Committees, there is still an amendment in the report passed by the majority of the Committee, and I ask the Minister to accept that.  The effect of accepting it will not be to increase the price of land for the purposes of division.  I refer to amendment No. 35, which is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To insert before Section 25 a new section as follows&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 38 of the Land Act, 1923, shall have effect as though at the end thereof the following words were added:&mdash;Provided that the redemption price fixed by the Judicial Commissioner shall in no case exceed the standard price fixed for tenanted land of similar character as agricultural land in same neighbourhood as based on sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the Land Act, 1923.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts that amendment it will have no effect upon the price of land which the Land Commission will have to acquire for the purposes of relieving congestion.  The only effect will be that when the fee-farm grantee applies for redemption under Section 38 the Judicial Commissioner will not have power to fix a redemption annuity any higher than the standard rent in the neighbourhood. That is a reasonable amendment.  I see <Col N="874" /> no reason why fee farm tenure should be regarded as a different form of tenure when the farm as an agricultural holding is held as such for a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>There is one other point in regard to the amendment introduced by the Minister dealing with the re-instatement of evicted tenants.  That amendment, as it stands, only provides for the reinstatement of evicted tenants from the gale day previous to 1st June, 1926. I pointed out to the Select Committee that that does not meet the requirements of the case, and, as a matter of fact, it will only meet very few cases. I suggest to the Minister that he should make this section retrospective as far as the 1923 Act goes, and the reason I suggest that is this.  The Minister well knows that an agitation went on during the troubled times here, in which tenants were advised, some of them to pay no rent, others to pay only 50 per cent. of their rent, and in no case to pay the full rent.  Tenants took advantage of this advice, and when the Land Act was passed many of the tenants, in ignorance of their position, continued in the fond hope that they would be able to purchase their land.  The next thing they found was that when hard times came they were unable to make up the arrears of rent which the ordinary tenant had the advantage of compounding, and the result was that they were evicted.  I know one case in my own county, where a man was evicted in March, 1926, and because the Act only goes back as far as June, that man would not be reinstated.  I suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider his view.</P>
    <P>The only other point I refer to is the amendment introduced by Deputy Cosgrave, and which has been made the subject of joke and laughter by the Minister.  I do not regard that amendment as a joke at all.  I recognise the object Deputy Cosgrave had in mind. The object was to meet cases I mentioned more than once in this House. There are certain people who have not yet got justice under the Land Acts. There are certain genuine evicted tenants who have not been reinstated or given an alternative holding.  These people are standing aside looking at the <Col N="875" /> grabbers and emergency men occupying holdings into which they were put by the landlords.  These men were made tenants of the holdings of the evicted tenants, and later on they purchased them under the Land Act.  They are now ordinary tenants.  In many cases they are quite unsuitable citizens.  They will never become reconciled, and they never wanted to be, and it will take generations before they become reconciled. In fact they never will be while the evicted tenant or his descendants remain in the neighbourhood.  There is no provision made to meet cases of that kind.  Deputy Murphy introduced an amendment to provide for compensation. I think that is a very reasonable suggestion.  Unfortunately, Deputy Murphy's amendment was defeated, but Deputy Cosgrave's was not.  That is still a recommendation of the Committee, and is before the House, and I suggest that something ought to be done, and might be done, in that regard. It is not a foolish amendment. The intention of the amendment ought to be taken into account, as it is a justifiable one.  There are cases in that connection regarding which something ought to be done.  It should not be beyond the Land Commission to devise a means of meeting an amendment of that kind.</P>

      <P>Before I resume, I desire to protest against the way in which this important matter has been dealt with by the Government. Some time ago a day had been arranged upon and set apart to discuss this.  The discussion was postponed in order to permit of the presence of the Minister for External Affairs, and that postponement is so contrived that the debate takes place in a more or less zigzag fashion, as was proposed for the closing day before the Dáil adjourns for the Christmas Recess.  Now, there is no necessity whatsoever&mdash;and I say this with all due deference to the Minister for External Affairs, and without the slightest intention of being offensive&mdash;for his presence.  The matters with which we are most concerned were dealt with on our behalf, as I pointed out in the debate yesterday evening, by the Minister for Justice. The whole tenor of the document which we are discussing, for it is this document rather than the Minister's speech that is in question, betrays the fact that neither Great Britain nor any of the pro-British Dominions&mdash; that is practically all of them&mdash;have the slightest desire to recognise among our Ministry as one of our Executive Council anyone clothed in the character or invested with the title of Minister <Col N="877" /> for External Affairs.  I protest against this all the more because it brings so prominently under one's notice the fact that what we have to protest against as regards domestic operations within the Dáil itself, so frequently, is an uprise of a bureaucratic spirit which is being displayed once more in an intensified form with regard to what I call the intra-Imperial relations. This is an autocracy that is steadily growing in power and influence. This Imperial Conference, ostensibly a meeting of Ministers from the various components of the Commonwealth of Nations, is in reality a super-Cabinet, by various devious intrigues, arrangements and agreements contriving to transform the real character of the status of the components of the Commonwealth, without leaving, in our case at any rate proper room&mdash;ample time&mdash;for submitting this agreement to the full examination of the Parliament. I say that the scandalous way in which this is dealt with in a contemptous fashion is indicative of that spirit which exhibits itself so frequently in this House, and has led me to denounce the members of the Executive Council as constituting a junta of autocrats. It is a junta of autocrats.  When, yesterday. I expressed regret at the minimising of our status by the Minister for External Affairs some members were under the impression that I merely meant a rhetorical device to asperse him.  I wish to assure the Minister that I had no such intention. My regret is sincere.  I believe, and have good reason to believe, had he been our chief representative in these matters he would not have set his name to the document which breathes the spirit which is in the opening page of this report on the status of Great Britain and of the Dominions.  Would the Minister for External Affairs, for example, have allowed to pass unanimously this declaration in regard to the British Empire, &ldquo;That free institutions are its life blood, and free co-operation is its instrument.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the great anomaly, the anomaly of anomalies, in the relations between this country, Great Britain, and the Commonwealth <Col N="878" /> of Nations&mdash;the fact that six counties of Ireland are regarded as a component of the British unit when there is a question of signing a treaty on behalf of Great Britain and the dependencies and colonies that belong to her. I say that that does not express the feelings of the Irish people.  I say, further, that it outrages the sentiments of the Irish people and when a so-called responsible Minister of this Parliament sets his hand to it he falsifies in the face of the nations the position our people take up.  Our co-operation in the British Empire is not a free co-operation. If it is, those who recommended the Treaty to us lied to us, for they told us that they signed that instrument through which we became incorporated with the British Commonwealth of Nations, under duress, a threat of imminent war.  I protest, if there is no one else to protest, against the falsification of our position, leaving the wide world who read this document to believe that we are now, after the second period of coercion that led to the London Pact in December last, willing members of that Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>Surely every opportunity ought to have been made, ought to have been taken&mdash;where it cannot be made it must and should be taken&mdash;to acquaint the nations with the fact that under duress, so recently as December last, we were obliged to part with a portion of our territory that carried with it nationals to the amount of over one million.  I say that this agreement has very considerably altered the status, particularly as regards the foreign affairs of the Free State.  I advanced several arguments last night, drawn from a criticism of various pages of this document, to show that political ascendancy, or hegemony, as it is called, has been claimed on behalf of Great Britain in the Empire.  I did not quite properly hear the statement which the Minister read.  He is only recently here from an illness, and I can understand his difficulty in making himself heard throughout the entire reading of the document.</P>

I re-read it, in fact, and I cannot remember anything in the notes which I quoted from at the time that in any way misrepresents him.  I do not require to misrepresent him to make a case, because the case he made against himself and against his Government is too thoroughly made here to require any additional making.  I will convict him from this report, unless the report is erroneous, of making misrepresentations of the very facts that are stated in this report.  If it becomes a question of misrepresentation.

      <P>With your permission, sir, the Deputy said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The British Empire...bears no real resemblance to any other political organisation which now exists or has ever yet been tried.  Yet, speaking of this peculiar thing, for which there is no place in the International Law text books, as being neither a Confederation nor a Federal State, the Minister for External Affairs says that the document gives exact expression to existing realities. I think the House will admit that the Minister is very easily satisfied if this is an exact expression of existing realities.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I pointed out afterwards that the Deputy suggested that a phrase of mine referred to the whole report as a description of the British Empire.</P>

He quoted my words.  I stand over those words.  I do not retract them.  They are a faithful reproduction of his own words, and, as a piece of criticism, there is no distortion. There must be some element of distortion to make misrepresentation.</P>

He also says that I stated that this thing gave an exact expression of reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister is quoting from, but I have a distinct recollection of what I said.  I read from this document the words of Lord Balfour, presumably:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nothing would be gained by attempting to lay down a Constitution for the British Empire.  Its widely scattered parts have very different characteristics, very different histories, and are at very different stages of evolution; while, considered as a whole, it defies classification and bears no real resemblance to any other political organisation which now exists or has ever yet been tried.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is Lord Balfour's own description of this evolution, this evolved entity, called here the British Empire. It is not mine.  I will deal with that in its own place, but out of courtesy to the Minister I take it up now temporarily. This extraordinary agglomeration of States, which corresponds to no composite State hitherto known, written about, or discussed in text books of International Law, has a great function in its character.  The British <Col N="881" /> Empire has a great function, namely, the making of treaties.  When I discussed its character as a treaty-making body or organisation I alleged that the formula prescribed for it through the Imperial Conference of this year is not corresponding to realities as realities are set down in our own Treaty and Constitution.  The Minister says that it does&mdash;that in its character as an Empire it does correspond to existing realities.  I contend that it does not correspond with the realities set out in our documents.  I hope the Minister is satisfied with his interruption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a persistent effort made from those Benches to talk about the length of <Col N="882" /> speeches when there is a question of affairs of State of the utmost magnitude involved.  No later than last week or thereabouts, when there was no greater item under consideration than the defence of a gardener charged with murder, the newspapers noted with satisfaction that his counsel spoke for four hours and that Mr. Justice O'Byrne addressing the jury on the question, occupied two and a half hours.  But it is a matter of reproach to me that I occupied half an hour last night in a debate on a question which concerned the nation and its future.  I think we have had enough of these cheap jibes.  I permitted the Minister to interrupt me and now I continue my discussion of the Paper.  He says here:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The King is at once the symbol of that association and of that autonomy.  The functions incidental to kingship constitute the sole operative constitutional element in the maintenance of the Association.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That, sir, is not true.  Otherwise, the Imperial Conference would not take place.  It would be meaningless if it did take place and if it provided no bond of Empire or no tightening of the bonds of Empire.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The kingly function is to reign, not to govern.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The King reigns but does not govern. Very good.  Let us apply the test.  In Great Britain the King reigns but does not govern.  Who does govern?  The British Government.  In the Free State the King reigns but does not govern.  Who does govern?  The Irish Government.  In the British Empire, where the King reigns as an Imperial sovereign, who governs?  Can the Minister answer that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not but according to this document, carefully studied, the hegemony of the <Col N="883" /> Empire belongs to Great Britain and the British Government.  And that is claimed for it by Lord Balfour in this document.  Let me read from page 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Equality of status, so far as Britain and the Dominions are concerned, is thus the root principle governing our inter-Imperial relations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That equality is declared in the formula, which has been repeated again and again, that &ldquo;the component parts of the Commonwealth are autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo; That is the formula.  There are trustful, guileless people who will take that formula as sufficient.  If they do, they will have to shut their eyes, and make themselves oblivious to a very important &ldquo;but,&rdquo; upon which Deputy Johnson dwelt at some length last evening.</P>
      <P>But the principles of equality and similarity appropriate to status do not universally extend to function.</P>
      <P>Government is function.  I challenge the Minister to deny that&mdash;the plain meaning of ordinary words in the English language.  Any organised creature that performs a characteristic act, does a particular special class of work, does it in virtue of his special organisation that befits him for it.  The structural organisation is the basis of activity. The operation or function flows from it.  One is characteristic of the other. The function in this case is government, and though the components are autonomous communities within the British Empire, I fasten attention upon &ldquo;the British Empire,&rdquo; which is that for whose cohesion and union so much is said at this Imperial Conference.</P>
      <P>But the principle of equality and similarity appropriate to status do not universally extend to function. Here we require something more than immutable dogmas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What is that &ldquo;something more?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;For example, to deal with questions <Col N="884" /> of diplomacy and questions of defence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Minor and trifling questions no doubt as regards the international relations of the component elements of the Commonwealth. For these little questions of diplomacy and questions of defence.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We require also flexible machinery.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The instruments of government are the machinery of government.  Government is function, and the machinery and instruments of government in these important offices of Treaty-making, of negotiations, and of defence, can from time to time be adapted to the changing circumstances of the world.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This subject also has occupied our attention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And you find the result of the attention it has secured when it is stated that &ldquo;Imperial defence&rdquo; must lie and Imperial negotiations for a long time to come must lie mainly in the hands of the British.  This agreement, it should be remembered, is to be considered in the light of the previous proposals made to Dominion representatives at the earlier Imperial Conferences. Would the Minister tell the House whether or not the idea has been abandoned of a centralised Imperial Navy?  That is soon to become a live question for us under the Treaty arrangements. Is the Imperial defence to be undertaken by a centralised Imperial Navy, in time of war, to be under the control of a high commander, a man the British may appoint?  The answer, so far as I can gather it from this document is, that &ldquo;for a long time to come these matters must rest with Great Britain.&rdquo; So that if a war break out within that period, vaguely referred to as &ldquo;a long time.&rdquo; then one can see where we stand and how we are committed. Our Army, it is to be noted, too, is to have an equipment and an organisation and a mode of training to correspond with that in the other elements of the Commonwealth.  Why, I wonder?  Is it in order that it can operate in the field under a single command? Is not that preparing for an Imperial force?  And we are to agree to all this without discussion, and it is an offence to these sacrosanct, high and <Col N="885" /> mighty personages on the front bench, that plain members like us should dare to criticise these arrangements.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;We went on to examine the possibility of applying the principles underlying the Treaty Resolution of the 1923 Conference to matters arising in the conduct of foreign affairs generally.  It was frankly recognised that in this sphere as in the sphere of defence, the major share of responsibility rests now, and must, for some time continue to rest with his Majesty's Government in Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;It was frankly recognised that in this sphere, as in the sphere of defence, the major share of responsibility rests now, and must for some time continue to rest, with his Majesty's Government in Great Britain.&rdquo; I introduced a reference to that by the history of the previous intrigues conducted in Imperial Conferences.  It took all the skill of the Canadian and of the South African representatives <Col N="886" /> in a previous Conference to stave off that arrangement of a centralised Navy.  When this agglomeration of nations called the British Empire proceeds to make a Treaty his Imperial Majesty is to sign the Treaty with his Imperial title.  On page 22 I read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is recommended that all Treaties (other than agreements between Governments), whether negotiated under the auspices of the League or not, should be made in the name of the heads of States, and if the Treaty is signed on behalf of any or all of the Governments of the Empire, the Treaty should be made in the name of the King as the symbol of the special relationship between the different parts of the Empire. The British units on behalf of which the Treaty is signed should be grouped together in the following order: Great Britain and Northern Ireland and all parts of the British Empire which are not separate members of the League, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Irish Free State, India....  In the case of a Treaty applying to only one part of the Empire it should be stated to be made by the King on behalf of that part.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday evening I showed by an examination of the specimen Treaty on page 29 that it would never be possible for a treaty entered into simply by Ireland or the Irish Free State to become registered in the League of Nations and impress the minds of foreign Powers with being the act of Ireland. Now, the Minister would call that a misrepresentation, I suppose.  This State cannot enter into treaty relations with foreign Powers in its own right or in its own capacity.  It must enter into treaty relations qua member of the British Empire, and that it so enters into treaty relations expressly qua member of the British Empire and only qua member of the British Empire is to be indicated by the unmistakable mark that the treaty bears&mdash;that it is signed by his Imperial Majesty with his Imperial title.  What becomes of the sovereignty in external affairs of the Irish Free State if that is a fact?  If that corresponds, to use the Minister's <Col N="887" /> words, to existing realities, then existing realities are that so far as external affairs are concerned, the Irish Free State is not sovereign.  It is merely incorporate in a larger unit and its power to conclude treaties that shall be binding because of their form among nations will be as a member incorporated in that unit.  That, sir, is why Lord Balfour was so careful to declare in the earlier page from which I quoted that theirs was unlike any other previous compound State.  Every previous compound State was either a federal or a confederate State.  But this is neither one thing nor the other.  And it is recommended that what it actually is should not be defined.  But when it comes to these important matters of treaties it is very clearly defined in its character by your specimen treaty on page 29.</P>
    <P>Now I say that not only is that a derogation from our character as a sovereign State, but it is giving complete recognition in an Imperial Conference to the allegation which I made, and which was repudiated from those benches&mdash;that the partition which the President and the Minister for Justice made was separation.  I was told by the President that I was a dishonest man when I declared his partition to be other than the partition which, in the President's own phraseology, we all knew to be inevitable under Article 12.  What was it, after all, but the concession of local autonomy to the Six Counties, not merely the geographical unity of the country preserved, but its character as a political entity preserved. Now, according to this arrangement, to which the Minister for Justice set his hand in our name, Ireland is not a political entity, and that dreadful fact is obscured from public recognition by the alteration in the King's title.  No one dreams that the King's title was altered for the sake of alteration, or merely to see how it would read in its new form.  It is there to hoodwink the Irish public, to hide from them the fact that, simultaneously with the alteration of the King's title in regard to this country, there is an alteration in the country's status.  Suppose the Irish Free State <Col N="888" /> did purport to enter into treaty relations with a foreign Power, is Northern Ireland bound, is Northern Ireland committed to the engagements that the treaty formulates?  Certainly not, because Northern Ireland is a component of quite a different unit, the British unit.  Is not that separation? There is no meaning in separation if that is not separation.</P>
    <P>I have used this illustration before: in the portion of Europe called the Peninsula you have Spain and Portugal, continuous territory as far as earth and mountains are concerned. One of them is a monarchy and the other a republic.  They are wholly different and separate States, as much so as if a sea one thousand miles wide divided them.  And here, according to this document, you have as big a division, if there is any force in this declaration of autonomy, between the Six Counties and the Twenty-six Counties as if they were distinct kingdoms, not noticeable, because the same Imperial Crown controls them both in their corporate characters as members of the British Empire, but noticeable when one considers these details of treaty-making, that Northern Ireland goes with Great Britain always, and it never can go with the other unit, the Irish Free State.  That is declared to be a state of things to which we assent. &ldquo;The report of this Committee is printed in extenso below.  It was unanimously adopted by the Conference on the 19th November.&rdquo; I have to read that, otherwise the Minister would say that my statement was a misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>Now, on this question of the making of Treaties: &ldquo;The making of a Treaty in the name of the King, as the symbol of the special relationship between the different parts of the Empire, will render superfluous the inclusion of any provision that its terms must not be regarded as regulating inter se the rights and obligations of the various territories on behalf of which it has been signed in the name of the King.&rdquo; Does the Minister for External Affairs approve of that arrangement?  He did not dwell upon that, at least I could not find anything in reference to it specifically in his statement.  The Minister said: &ldquo;Instead of one high <Col N="889" /> contracting party, primarily acting on behalf of the British Government, whose advice covered all the Dominions, we shall have a several high contracting party acting in a distinct capacity on behalf of each State of which he is King.&rdquo; The &ldquo;new system gives exact expression to existing realities. There is a special bond between the States of the Commonwealth consisting, not in a supreme Governmental authority, but in a common kingship.  The exact nature of the relationship outside the common bond of the King is undefined, but it is naturally felt.&rdquo; Imagine, if we can, it being naturally felt by an Irishman in this regard&mdash;that League Treaties and Conventions cannot be taken as applying completely&mdash;as to all their Articles&mdash; between them as if there was no special relationship whatever&mdash;again insisting upon the functioning as by an incorporated member of a larger organisation. Now, try how this works out in respect of our Constitution.  Article I. of the Treaty had stated&mdash;and it cannot be too often repeated&mdash;that &ldquo;Ireland shall have the same constitutional status in the Community of Nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa, with a Parliament having powers to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Ireland, and an Executive responsible to that Parliament, and shall be styled and known as the Irish Free State.&rdquo; More than once in this House I have had occasion to point out that Ireland, as we understood that Article of the Treaty, was something more than a geographical expression; it was a political entity, a political entity with an ancient history and glorious memories for us.</P>
    <P>Now, Article 51 of the Constitution declares that: &ldquo;The Executive Authority of the Irish Free State&rdquo;&mdash;that is, all Ireland&mdash;&ldquo;is hereby declared to be vested in the King.&rdquo; Which King? We who supported the Treaty always believed that the King in that Constitution was the King of Ireland.  The oath imposed upon members of this House was always explained and recommended, <Col N="890" /> as not unpalatable because the King, in the Constitution to which we had vowed allegiance, was the King of Ireland.  Now what does he turn out to be?&mdash;&ldquo;King of Great Britain and Ireland and of the Dominions beyond the seas, Emperor of India,&rdquo; imperial soverign of that agglomeration of nations and states called the British Empire in this document from which I have been reading.  And the executive authority of the Irish Free State that is hereby declared to be vested in the King has no executive authority whatsoever over Northern Ireland.  It ought to be regarded as suspended, that the jurisdiction does not extend over the Six Counties, but, alas for that reply as a sufficient one, we have here enunciated for us, with the approval of the Ministers, that the British units on behalf of which a Treaty is signed, should be grouped together in the following order&mdash;Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and all parts of the British Empire which are not separate members of the League.  That is separation, a separation between Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State, as complete, as thorough, as any separation can be made in political matters.</P>
    <P>When the King's title frightened some of our Northern friends and they rushed to London to be reassured, they were reassured by the British Home Secretary, who sent them home rejoicing; there was no harm done to them by the change in the King's title.  If it had been a living reality they would not have gone home rejoicing.  Now we have the assent of our Ministers to an arrangement by which Ireland as a political entity is not given recognition among the nations, and yet, on the other hand, she has been received into the comity of nations as a member of the League of Nations.  Where do we stand?  I had always thought, and I stated it more than once in this House, that what used to be called the British Empire has, by a gradual process, been freed from many of those elements which made its name and reality so hateful to us, and the flag which was the badge of it so detestable in our sight, that it had become in large part a commonwealth of free nations, and that the only elements of <Col N="891" /> empire which remained were those dependencies over which England ruled from London.  But in the League of Nations, as Deputy Johnson explained yesterday, and as the Minister had earlier explained to us in this House, the British Empire means this, first the British unit of Great Britain and Ireland, and all parts which are not separate members of the League.  In this document we accept our place in the British Empire, we accept the Imperial Crown as the symbol of that, and adopt the position, which I have reiterated perhaps too often, that when there is a question of signing a treaty the treaty is to be signed for us by the King, not as head of this country, as in the Constitution, but as head of the British Empire.  The Minister for Justice is pleased to be amused over this, to utter comments that express his disregard.  I hope the Irish people will take note.  Here is a matter in which their status, that is, their self-respect as nationals, is tampered with, where their whole position is falsified, and that is a matter for jest by the chief culprit in the transaction.  To leave the Minister time for reply I will make an abrupt conclusion.</P>

      <P>The ground covered by Deputy Johnson and Deputy Magennis has been very interesting, and I think it is good that the House has been afforded an opportunity of hearing a point of view that would not have been given expression to had not these Deputies spoken.  The Minister read a statement; he covered the ground over which they had travelled, the work done in London when they represented this country at the Imperial Conference.  I think it is true to say that that statement was received in this House in chilly silence.  I do not think there was any enthusiasm on the work of the Imperial Conference, and I think that that is fairly representative of the feelings of the country.  I would be glad if the report of the Imperial Conference contained something over which we could enthuse.  I have searched for it and I cannot find it. I wish it were there.  I think it is an <Col N="892" /> indication of the good sense of the House, of the spirit of nationalism&mdash;it may perhaps be silent at the moment&mdash; that undoubtedly the work of the Imperial Conference, as represented by the document produced here, has not brought any measure of satisfaction whatever to the nationalists of this country.  There may be a few who see hope.  I do not feel that the sovereignty of this State has been accepted in the way that we understand it.  If we are understood to be in free association with the nations of the British Commonwealth might I ask why instead of the term &ldquo;autonomous community,&rdquo; could we not have inserted in this report the words &ldquo;sovereign states&rdquo;?  What objection was raised, or what objection could there be, to a recognition on the part of those who composed the Imperial Conference to give to this country what this country believes is its full right?  It may be a small matter to them.  It may be on their part an effort to deny to this country the right for which we have always fought and which, whatever their point of view about it may be, we will continue to maintain.  Is there free association in this community of nations as far as we are concerned?  There might be free association if there was a frank recognition of the sovereign status of this State and if there was a preparedness on the part of the other communities, as they are styled here, within the British Empire that the Irish nation is a nation and still lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are free associates in that Commonwealth, are we free to do as we please in the best interests of this State?  Are we free to make what Treaties we desire with foreign countries? Are we free to disassociate ourselves from others in that Community of Nations?  To come down to home matters, to a matter that this House had under consideration only a few months ago, have our Courts the right to decide issues between citizens of this State?  Is the right of our Courts to adjudicate in such matters to be questioned, and is judgement to be passed upon it by a Court in another country? May I here remark that our Ministers thought fit that something so vital to <Col N="893" /> this State as that could wait for another time for the Imperial Conference to pass judgement upon it?  If it were something that had not cropped up, something which might arise in the future, we could understand such an attitude and such a decision as that. I think this attitude and this decision unworthy of the men who went over to represent and maintain the rights of this country at that Conference.  I should like to hear from them the case they made, and whether this was a protesting acquiesence or a voluntary one.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said as to this part of the Report where equality of status is inserted in the first part of the paragraph and taken away in the latter part.  I do not know that our rights in external affairs have been clarified in any respect by that section of the Report. I think our position was clearer before this was written, and I feel that whether it is written there or not the point of view of the people of this country and the representatives in this House must still remain the same as regards what they can do and their rights in dealing with foreign Powers. Let them tell us how free we are in our dealings with foreign peoples and with matters here at home.  Are we at liberty to say good-bye to-morrow to the British Empire, if we so choose? Or is this meant when they say that we are freely associated?  What are the threats?  Are there still threats if such a course is suggested?</P>
    <P>There is to be an amendment or alteration in the King's title.  Deputy Magennis has discussed that at length. I confess that I would much prefer to see the title of the King left as it was. Before the change he was &ldquo;George V., by the grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo; It was always believed by Nationalists in this country that such a thing as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland did not exist, and that such a title was, to use a word that Deputy Gorey used earlier to-day, a fictitious title.  It was unreal, and being unreal, perhaps we might have permitted something to pretend to exist which we did not believe and for which <Col N="894" /> we had little respect&mdash;none.  We come right up now against a new position, against the &ldquo;King's position&rdquo; in this country.  I do not like getting so near the King, and I do not think there are very many people in this country, except a very small minority, who want to get any nearer the King.  If representatives of this country want to outrage Nationalists' opinion, they have only a little bit further to go, when I believe Nationalist Ireland will give its answer and pass judgment on such a policy.  I fear there are dangers&mdash;that this change may bring him very near indeed. There may be people across the sea who would like to see him come to us. There are some here who would be very glad&mdash;a few.  There may be others on whom he might be forced, just as other things have been forced upon people in this country.  A very difficult and dangerous position will then be brought about, and, as somebody said elsewhere, black flags will be hung out when that day comes for the people of this country.</P>
    <P>Might I ask what is the significance in the title for this country of the phrase, &ldquo;Defender of the Faith&rdquo;? What significance has that from the point of view of the majority of the people of this nation?  Was there any plea advanced that that part of the title should be eliminated?</P>
    <P>There are some other points in the Report to which I should like to make reference.  When our Ministers sat at the Conference table with the representatives from Canada, Australia and South Africa, and when they sat down with those would be representatives from India, I would like to ask what was their contribution to the solution of the problem that is confronting the Nationalists of India?  Does this mean an acceptance on the part of the Nationalists of this country of the position whereby Nationalist opinion in India will be subordinated to the interests of a minority, just as existed in this country for generations?  I think that it is not worthy of people like ourselves who know so much about oppression, who have suffered and lost so much, that they should not show sympathy with people in other parts of <Col N="895" /> that far-flung Empire undergoing such an ordeal.</P>
    <P>I want also to be a little clearer as to what the position is with regard to the point mentioned in the Report as to Acts sent from the Dominions to England for sanction.  I want to know if that point has ever been raised, has ever cropped up, and what the position in this country is.  It is new to some of us, as many points that have been debated up to the present in this matter were new.  I think that the Ministers who went to the Conference have done well not to enthuse over what they have done.  The position, as I see it, has not been bettered since the signing of the Treaty.  I am prepared to recognise that work over there is not as simple as it might appear at a distance. I am prepared to believe that men may have been doing their best. I am not in a position to understand exactly what was the outlook over there.  But as far as I am personally concerned, I am not satisfied with the results.  I would be prepared to welcome an effort that was going to bring beneficial fruits.  We have not got it in this document.  Whether men from this country have gone over there, accepting the position as represented to us in this Report, declaring their fidelity and their devotion to the King or not, there is one thing they may make their minds clear about, and I hope it is fairly clear, that no position will be accepted by this country other than the sovereign position which the people of this nation have always fought to establish and maintain as being the rightful position for this State to hold.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>One would think by the tone of Deputy Baxter's contribution, and perhaps to some extent by the tone of others, that the purpose for which we went to London was to negotiate a treaty with the British Government. That, of course, was not the purpose. The Treaty was negotiated five years ago, and at the outset of the few brief remarks I have to make it may be well to refer Deputies to some articles of that Treaty.  The first is this:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" />&ldquo;Ireland shall have the same constitutional status in the community of nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa, with a Parliament having powers to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Ireland, and an executive responsible to that Parliament, and shall be styled and known as the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The second is this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions hereinafter set out, the position of the Irish Free State in relation to the Imperial Parliament and Government and otherwise shall be that of the Dominion of Canada, and the law, practice and constitutional usage governing the relationship of the Crown or the representative of the Crown and of the Imperial Parliament to the Dominion of Canada shall govern the relationship to the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Baxter says he is not satisfied with the results.  After long study of Deputy Baxter in the Dáil I am not surprised at that.  I think it would be a task of extreme magnitude to secure results that would be satisfactory to Deputy Baxter, or that would banish, even temporarily, his settled melancholy. He is not satisfied with the results.  He apparently is under the illusion that we went to London recently to negotiate and conclude a treaty with Great Britain.  I venture to point out that we did not, that the Treaty was made five years ago, and that we went to London as representatives of the Government of the State which is based upon that Treaty of five years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy Magennis reminded us that the Treaty was signed under duress. If that is so, many treaties, almost all treaties, are signed under duress.  I shall not go into the question now how much there is in the statement that that particular Treaty was signed under duress.  I shall not go even into the question of whether or not there was any degree of duress on the British signatories, whether or not it embodied their <i>summum bonum,</i> their ideal conception <Col N="897" /> of Anglo-Irish relations.  We can leave that on one side.  The Treaty was signed, whether under duress on the one side or under duress on both sides, we need not pause to haggle about; it was signed; it was placed before the Dáil; it was approved by a majority of seven, and this State is based upon it.  That is all truism.  It is the kind of truism which it seems necessary to repeat to the Dáil, and which ought not to be necessary.</P>
    <P>What precisely did we go to London for if not to negotiate and conclude a treaty?  We went to take part in this triennial Conference between the governments of a group of states of which we are one.  Before going, we indicated, in broad outline at any rate, the matters which we proposed to raise there as the representatives of this State and of its people.  From time to time throughout the last three or four years matters have come under notice in the constitutional mechanism of this community of nations, in the constitutional practice which, to us, appear incompatible with the conception of complete co-equality of status.  These matters were noted for reference, noted for attention at just such an occasion as offered in this Imperial Conference. Anything, everything, that to us appeared to conflict with the conception of the fullest co-equality of status was raised by us in that Conference.  I make this offer to Deputies, that if they, from their study of the constitutional mechanism of this community of nations known as the British Empire, can direct our attention to other matters, those will be attended to, whether at an Imperial Conference or by direct representation to the British Government. By one or the other course at any rate those matters will have attention. The matters raised by us at the Imperial Conference were exhaustive of the points of practice, the points of constitutional machinery, which struck us as being in conflict with the conception of co-equal status, and they are set out in this Report.</P>
    <P>They were dealt with in detail at the inter-Imperial Relations Committee, presided over by Lord Balfour: not all have been dealt with to a conclusion. Some, for what seemed a good <Col N="898" /> and sufficient reason, have been left over for a fuller examination by a committee which is to be set up in the near future.  But many of the matters have been dealt with to a conclusion, and dealt with to a conclusion satisfactory to those who raised them.  Now, I do not complain overmuch of the state of mind revealed in the speeches, particularly in the speeches of Deputy Magennis and Deputy Baxter.  One has to remember the antecedents of our whole position: one has to remember that for very many centuries we were an unfree people, and that we have borne the fetters so long, they have eaten so deep, that even when they are struck off there are those amongst us, believing or professing to believe, that they are still there: those amongst us who cannot realise their freedom and are unable to raise their heads and look their fellow man in the face, and say we are a free people.  The whine of the slave was in those two speeches.</P>

I am not surprised.  I do not think Deputy Magennis would be satisfied with even an entirely different status, an entirely different form of Government. I think Deputy Magennis would be dissatisfied, profoundly dissatisfied, with a republic, except on the conditions that he were president of that republic.  In a speech which it might be unkind, perhaps, to describe as lingering sourness long drawn out he analysed, or attempted to analyse, this report and by every device of which he is master, of misrepresentation and distortion, he attempted to show that we had been, so to speak, busily engaged for six weeks in London <Col N="899" /> riveting fetters on the limbs of our unfortunate country, and Deputy Baxter shook his head and said he was afraid that was so.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows and Deputy Baxter knows, that that is not the position: that the relations between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland remain unaffected by anything that happened at the Imperial Conference.  They are as they were before that Conference.  Deputy Magennis referred to the change in the King's title.  The change in the King's title is simply something that is now <Col N="901" /> decided, and that has been overdue for a considerable time&mdash;that might have been done and perhaps should have been done any time after the establishment of the Irish Free State.  It was convenient to consider the matter at the Imperial Conference.  With regard to the position of the Governor-General, that is one of the anomalies and anachronisms to which general reference was made prior to the Imperial Conference. The Governor-General dated back to the Colonial phase in the development of the Dominions, retaining, not in fact or in reality, but in form, something of the complexion of being not merely an emanation of the King, but of being to some extent an emanation of a British Minister and a British Department of State.  Attention being drawn to that fact, that state of affairs will no longer continue.  Paragraph C. of the Report of this Inter-Imperial Relations Committee covers the ground of portion of dominion legislation, and sets out in that portion of the report some of the matters which will be further investigated by the special committee which is to be established.  The terms of reference of that Committee are given on page 17 of the Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To inquire into, report upon and make recommendations concerning: existing statutory provisions requiring reservation of Dominion legislation for the assent of His Majesty or authorising the disallowance of such legislation.</P>
      <P>The present position as to the competence of Dominion Parliaments to give their legislation extra territorial operation.</P>
      <P>The practicability and most convenient method of giving effect to the principle that each Dominion Parliament should have power to give extra territorial operation to its legislation.</P>
      <P>The principles embodied in or underlying the Colonial Laws Validity Act,</P>
      <P>and so on.  At the bottom of page 16 of the Report you have the statement that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;it should be placed on record that, apart from provisions embodied in Constitutions or in specific statutes <Col N="902" /> expressly providing for reservation, it is recognised that it is the right of the Government of each Dominion to advise the Crown in all matters relating to its own affairs.  Consequently, it would not be in accordance with constitutional practice for advice to be tendered to his Majesty by his Majesty's Government in Great Britain in any matter appertaining to the affairs of a Dominion against the views of the Government of that Dominion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We were told, from time to time, by critics of the established State and of the Treaty on which it is based, that the King, throughout our Constitution meant, in fact, the British Government. The Governor-General was depicted as a person with one ear to the telephone taking down the instructions of Whitehall to be conveyed to Merrion Street. The King never meant the British Government or any British Minister, but even in form, even under these shreds of constitutional fiction dating back to the Colonial phase of the development of the Dominions, whatever shred of justification there was for that assertion has now to go, and these seven States, composing the British Commonwealth of Nations, stand in form and in fact, and in reality, on a footing of most complete equality of status.  That is a fact which has been realised in all of the Dominions: has been realised in South Africa and in Canada, and that I believe is realised here despite the indications to the contrary in the speeches of Deputy Magennis and Deputy Baxter.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister departs from that point will he clear up the meaning of this proviso &ldquo;apart from provisions embodied in Constitutions,&rdquo; referring to the fact that in our Constitution there is provision made for reservations in accordance with the practice in Canada?  This paragraph says that &ldquo;apart from such provision it is recognised that it is the right&rdquo; and so on.</P>

      <P>I think actually that most of the points that <Col N="903" /> have been raised here were covered by my statement yesterday.  As the Minister for Justice has said, we did not go there to scrap the Treaty or to change it.  We went there to bring practice in form with the Constitutional position.  Clause II, of the Treaty says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions hereinafter set out the position of the Irish Free State in relation to the Imperial Parliament and Government and otherwise shall be that of the Dominion of Canada, and the law, practice and constitutional usage governing the relationship of the Crown or the representative of the Crown and of the Imperial Parliament to the Dominion of Canada shall govern the relationship to the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Magennis quoted, again and again, the co-equality referred to in Clause I. of the Treaty.  We are governed by practice, and when I stated in my report that I considered this eminently satisfactory it was because it had modified the practice, bringing it more in accord with co-equality.  I have not stated that there is anything established in the absolute, but merely that there is a transition from a position which had been fairly good to a position which is much better.  Deputy Magennis constantly conveyed the impression that this report establishes what he calls separation.  He challenged the Minister for Justice to show that he had said that.  The Deputy refuted my statement that a certain Treaty procedure was an exact presentation of existing realities.  As far as I could judge, I may have been wrong, but I gathered that he found the non-exactness of that representation in the putting of Northern Ireland, not with the Irish Free State, but with Great Britain, and he also stated&mdash;I speak from listening to him in a rather casual way&mdash;that Ireland entered the League of Nations, and suggested that we had changed our status.  The suggestion was that the Free State is now in the League of Nations, whereas before Ireland was in the League of Nations.</P>

      <P>No.  Deputy Johnson and I made it clear to an ordinary intelligence that the character of representation in the League of Nations is wholly at variance with the kind of empire to which the Minister for Justice sets his hand in this report. I contend that is a very different statement from that which the Minister professes to quote for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only dealing with that case because I was afraid the Deputy's statement might convey a wrong impression to people outside. As I have the Deputy's assistance in correcting that impression, and if by any chance there might be people outside like myself who might have got that impression, I am glad to have it cleared up.  At the same time I contest that statement.  I will now deal with Deputy Johnson's statement.  The Deputy in one part of his statement said I allowed myself to think of this country as being in the same position as New Zealand believed herself to be in.  That is not so.  Although Deputy Magennis seems to think I am a much ill-used person, I think both he and Deputy Johnson may take me as as good an interpreter of the constitutional position of this country as the Ministers of any other Dominion. Deputy Johnson quoted Professor Berriedale Keith&mdash;I am rather glad he did so because it happens to clear that matter up:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In political matters proper there has been no attempt to obtain separate powers of adherence or withdrawal <Col N="905" /> for the Dominions, and it is clear that such an attempt would be meaningless.  It is impossible so long as the Empire retains any unity for one part to be treated in political questions differently from another part, and the separate adherence to and withdrawal from treaties is only possible as in commercial treaties where differentiation of treatment could be based on difference of locality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The discontinuance of a system of issuing unlimited powers to the British, plenipotentiaries, I maintain, entirely defeats the position as indicated there by Professor Berriedale Keith and represents one of the eminently satisfactory results which I consider this Report indicates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson quoted the League of Nations Act, and I think that Deputy Johnson and Deputy Magennis are rather at sea in this matter.  We entered the League of Nations as a fully self-governing State, and that is not incompatible with the term &ldquo;Dominion&rdquo; as now used.  These two terms are not contradictory; they are not incompatible. In the Covenant the words &ldquo;State&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dominion&rdquo; are used. That does not imply a watertight distinction between the two.  The use of the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; does not conceal &ldquo;Dominion status.&rdquo; On the entry of the Saorstát into the League, the Sixth Committee noted in its Report to the Assembly that the Saorstát was a Dominion forming part of the British Empire upon the same conditions as the other Dominions already members of the League.  Deputy Johnson said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I wonder does the Minister contend that the position of the Irish Free State in the League is in the same way subordinate as that of, say, New Zealand because of the fact that New Zealand went in under the cover, if I may say so, of the British Empire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy is aware we inherited the practice of Canada, which was to be included in all League instruments indented under the British Empire, and with a tangible unity among them that was effected by the unlimited full power of the British plenipotentiary. <Col N="906" /> That was the position implying subordination and possibly capable of an interpretation prejudicial to the whole position of the Saorstát, a position certainly capable of an interpretation of inequality with Great Britain.  That is a position which is now changed. Equality of status has reached its full development.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked did we look for anything beyond that position.  There is now full recognition of equality of status, although there is not full implementation. I have not stated there is.  That does not imply any last word or any impossibility of changing the present position as time and circumstances may permit.</P>
    <P>There was one point that exercised the minds of Deputy Johnson and Deputy Magennis, and I will try to make it clear.  The word &ldquo;active&rdquo; in front of &ldquo;obligations&rdquo; in the section headed &ldquo;Negotiation&rdquo; was referred to by them.  They make deductions from the insertion of that word this year as differing from its use in 1923.  Deputy Johnson quotes paragraph 3:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When a Government has received information of the intention of any other Government to conduct negotiations, it is incumbent upon it to indicate its attitude with reasonable promptitude.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He points out that the British Government, having informed us that it is negotiating for a treaty, may assume its policy is generally acceptable unless it hears from us to the contrary, provided we are not involved in active obligations.  He has mis-read the position.  The exchange of information may be called a courtesy arrangement, and in a general way it exists among all world powers and powers with close geographical and other interests.  The word &ldquo;active&rdquo; is inserted before the word &ldquo;obligations&rdquo; in the interests of clarity.</P>
    <P>I said in my statement yesterday any treaty made by any state may be held to impose possible obligations on other states.  Even to a greater degree is that true of states so closely associated as members of the British Commonwealth. Recognition of the state of affairs brought into being by a treaty <Col N="907" /> is an obligation incumbent on the whole community of states.  The British Government might empower a plenipotentiary to act on its behalf but not on our behalf, in order to conclude a treaty declaring a closed season for fishing in certain waters.  They notify us that they propose to do a certain thing.  If we do not reply they are justified in assuming we have no objection. On the other hand, we might write saying that Irish fishermen fished in those waters.  They might abandon the treaty or decide that the interests they had in mind in making the treaty justified them in going ahead with it.</P>
    <P>Or to take another case, more real to the Dominion position, the British Government might enter into negotiations with China with a view to nullifying or modifying treaties which gave rights not merely to English citizens, but to Canadian, Irish and other citizens.  The annulling or modification of these treaties necessarily affects the status of our nationals in China.  They notify us of the negotiations.  If they do not hear from us they presume we do not consider the obligation as important or that we are nationally involved. On the other hand, we might notify them that we considered the matter of such importance that we wished to participate in negotiations and that we proposed to appoint a plenipotentiary to act on our behalf. It does not imply that all negotiations that we do not demur from we are parties to them.  We cannot be party to any negotiation or treaty except by the act of a plenipotentiary appointed on the advice of this Government. The distinction between &ldquo;obligations&rdquo; and &ldquo;active obligations&rdquo; was necessary in order to make it clear that the general assumption with regard to passive obligations is more obviously justified in the relations of the Commonwealth States <i>inter se.</i></P>

The Ministers here are advised of such <Col N="908" /> a proposal.  Is there any obligation imposed on our Ministry to concur or demur or to keep silent?  If they know of such a proposal and no attention whatever is paid to it, is there not an assumption that the Government of Italy, for instance, would believe that we, too, are participants in that compact?</P>

      <P>I have tried to stress that, which I think is a very important point.  It was necessary there because of this habit existing prior to this date of the issue of unlimited full powers to the British plenipotentiary.  These powers were issued and they have always been issued and that was the practice we have inherited.  Unless that were put in, the powers covered all parts of the King's realm.</P>

      <P>The Ambassador in these places acts for us in his normal capacity.  As regards his normal capacity here, I have a note here on that point.  Deputy Johnson deduces from the system of consultation from the use of the British Foreign Office and from the frequent reference to the British Empire that we are committed to all actions of the British Government in foreign affairs unless we specifically dissociate ourselves. That is a misinterpretation.  The British Ambassadors act as mandatories for us in the exercise of their normal functions.  Their normal functions are the protection of nationals. They act for us otherwise only in so far as they are empowered to do so expressly by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>There will be no need for Clause 9 in future.  I think Deputy Johnson puts that question. There was, as far as I know, during our time no British Ambassador with extra-normal functions.  The Deputy refers to negotiations between England and Italy with regard to Abyssinia.  I hold and presume, and am satisfied that we are in no way included in this.  If we are sent a notification, what would happen is, that we might be interested and we might see we had a particular lot <Col N="910" /> of Irish nationals in Abyssinia that it was intended to put under the Italian sphere of influence, and we would suggest that we should be parties to this treaty, and that these nationals should be included in the British sphere and the Italian sphere.  If we had no actual interest there we would not participate, and we would not share responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Do we not come right up against the question of belligerency? Supposing that negotiations between England and Italy led to warfare, would Italy recognise that we are not participants&mdash;that we are neutrals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that is a particularly difficult thing to answer.  It is a matter that I cannot possibly give a straight answer to now.  Inasmuch as the only Government empowered to advise the King on affairs of this State is this Government, and as it is pre-eminently an affair of this State whether we will be at peace or war, presumably the King cannot declare war on behalf of us except on the advice of this Government.  We know that on these occasions legal forms go by the board, and so far as I can interpret it, it would mean on strictly theoretical constitutional lines that the King could only declare war when he had simultaneous unanimous advice to that effect from all the Governments. That would be the constitutional position.</P>
      <P>We may as well face facts.  We know war usually comes with a rush, and people do not consider the niceties of constitutional practice.  Great Britain, for instance, might advise the King to declare war on Italy, and then there would be a discussion, the nature of which at the moment I could not outline.  One might say, first of all, that the King's subjects are at war when he is at war, and therefore Ireland is at war; and someone else might say that the King has no authority to declare war on behalf of this country when he has no advice from our Government, and therefore we are not at war.  I cannot go any further now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether there has been any understanding that this new position is going <Col N="911" /> to be made a subject of discussion and negotiation with non-British powers with a view to their recognition of our immunity from war until our Government, through ordinary agencies, declares war or commits a belligerent act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that.  Inasmuch as the British plenipotentiary acting in any of these cases has the terms of his full powers clearly defined according to the geographical area of his Government's jurisdiction, we are excluded that much more than we were before, and we are to that extent, presumably, more in the direction Deputy Johnson wishes to go than we were before.  There is that much of an advance.</P>
      <P>Both Deputies Johnson and Magennis seem to gather from the reference to functions at the bottom of the early part of the report that there is such a thing as diplomatic unity.  The whole trend of their discussion was on that point.  Deputy Johnson says government is function.  Yes, but all function is not government.  I refer to a case of function there.  The British Ambassador in any capital, let us say in Vienna or Madrid, acts as our mandatory in his normal functions.  In that way the British Government, who sent him and pay his way, exceed in function our function.  They are not in any way usurping the right of our Government.  Their man acts as our mandatory.  If all function is government, as Deputy Johnson implies, then you might say that the British Consul in Singapore is the real government, and not the British Government.  On the contrary, he acts as their agent, and we can also mandate him, and, as we are on such close terms with the British Government, we let him act as our mandatory to serve our nationals in that area.  Their normal functions are the protection of nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputies seem to have gathered that there is diplomatic unity.  There cannot be diplomatic unity when there are a number of different Governments advising, and when their advice in any one specific matter may be divergent. The Deputy referred to this as the kernel of the whole matter.  He has in <Col N="912" /> the document before him almost all the assurance he requires.  The document, to my mind, represents quite clearly a step in the direction he desires.  He has it clearly laid down that in the affairs of this State no Government but our own can advise.  He has it also clearly laid down that the full powers issued by the British Government to their negotiators will be limited to the area of jurisdiction of that Government.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to exequaturs, Deputy Johnson asks where is the advance in the new practice.  The advance is that the exequatur is now issued on the advice of Irish Ministers, and is received by the foreign representative from the Irish Minister. Against this, he urges that the application is made by the Irish Government to the Foreign Office in London.  The application is made through diplomatic channels.  It happens so far that whereas there are foreign Ministers in London there are none in Dublin, and the only channel for application so far is in London.</P>
    <P>When one argues about this report and complains that it does not make Ireland a republic, complains that the King is there and so on, and that the Treaty position is still the Treaty position, even if a bit better, that there is retrogression rather than advance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was a synthetic answer.  Deputy Magennis was very much concerned that my name did not figure as prominently in the report as that of the Minister for Justice.  He very generously seeks to exculpate me from guilt in the matter.  As a matter of fact, I shared in the drafting of a large and important section of it, and I take full responsibility.

I have consistently refrained, and shall continue to do so, from interpreting what anybody has said.  I cannot see how a debate can be conducted unless a speaker is allowed to say that a speaker on the other side has said so-and-so.  It has constantly been done, and I do not know any way of getting out of it. When a speaker quotes he must quote accurately, but when he says: &ldquo;I gather this impression,&rdquo; he must be allowed to go on.  From the point of view of Deputies who speak against Ministers and against the Government, it would be a serious thing if they could not be allowed to explain what they gathered from Ministers' speeches.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I am speaking immediately after certain impressions were conveyed to my mind.  I do not think that my mind is quite so inexact as Deputy Magennis thinks.  He said yesterday that I spoke about things being settled which were, in fact, referred to a committee for further discussion.  I do not think I did.  I said that certain matters were referred to a committee of experts.  I did not in any way misrepresent the facts on that, whereas, on the other hand, we heard something a while ago about a unified navy, and so on.  I am not aware that we share in a unified navy.  At present we have not any sort of navy worth mentioning, but such as it is, it is all right.  When the Deputy <Col N="915" /> argues by insisting that common methods of training, etc., make a unified army and navy, I cannot follow him.  I gather from the Deputy that he presumes that every time there is fighting going on our army and the other army will be on opposite sides. I do not think so.  I think the whole tendency will be to keep this country at peace, and not to go to war with any country, much less go to war with our next-door neighbour, who is much stronger.  Deputy Magennis spoke about treaties being signed by the King as misleading people abroad.  The King does not sign treaties.  They are signed by the plenipotentiaries representing their Governments.</P>

      <P>In 1924 there was a question of the Lausanne Treaty and a liquor treaty with America and there was a debate on the King's title here.  One of the Deputies said that there was strong objection taken to the misrepresentation in the title, as it did not correspond with the fact, inasmuch as it spoke of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  I may be thoroughly dishonest, I may be a blackguard and so on, but I would certainly consider myself such if I got up now and said that never until I saw this document was I aware that the King was described otherwise than &ldquo;King of Ireland.&rdquo; There was a discussion here, and on the strength of that discussion I saw the then Prime Minister of England, and afterwards I told the House that I had his assurance that steps were being taken to change it. The steps were slow, but they have moved on since then and the title corresponds more now to the political fact than it did.  The political entity here is the Irish Free State.  Deputy Magennis undoubtedly talked about the signing of a treaty by his Majesty. At the bottom of it it says: &ldquo;In faith whereof the above-named plenipotentiaries <Col N="916" /> have signed the present treaty.&rdquo; The Deputy objects that his title used in treaties is given in full instead of his being given separately as &ldquo;King of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Even now, the King has his full title.  I thought the Deputy would prefer his partial title. The King is in the Constitution as part of the Oireachtas and as the Executive. The Deputy accepted that.  When a treaty is made, in the King's name, it is on the advice of this Government, and the plenipotentiary acts as instructed by this Government.  I was rather surprised that the Deputy so much wanted &ldquo;the King of Ireland,&rdquo; as distinct from the rest of his realms, because one of the chief opponents to having the King separately King of Ireland was a man whom, I understood from the newspapers, Deputy Magennis was angling for as an ally&mdash;Mr. de Valera, the man who objected to it most.  I understood from the newspapers that Deputy Magennis was assuring him that they had a common point of view on that.  I was surprised that Mr. de Valera did not bite to the fly.  Deputy Magennis went to the other extreme and was all for the King of Ireland.  I am with the Deputy on that point of view.  The partition of Ireland did not enter into the matter but, so far as I could gather in my stupidity, Deputy Magennis devoted almost all his conversation to the whole question of partition.  Again he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It seems to me if, after the expiration of the month allowed to Northern Ireland to exercise its option, the decision be for partition, <Col N="917" /> the responsibility for that in large measure should be understood by the people of Ireland to rest, and rest heavily, upon those men who have set out to devastate the country and to destroy the body of Ireland in order, as they allege, to save her soul.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Magennis also talks about our status in the League of Nations.  When we entered the League of Nations, we could only do so provided we had full jurisdiction and control over the area that we <Col N="918" /> governed.  Therefore, we entered for the present area of the Free State.  If we had purported to enter for the whole thirty-two counties we would not have been eligible for entrance.  Therefore, I cannot see that there is any change in our status in the League of Nations by the points raised here. There is, in fact, a change by the fact that we are no longer indented under cover of the phrase, &ldquo;British Empire,&rdquo; and there is no plenipotentiary but the one appointed by this Government who has power to act in any way for the Free State, whereas before there was the British Empire with other Dominions indented underneath it and the British plenipotentiary with unlimited powers making a tangible unified representation on it.  That has now gone.  The plenipotentiary appointed by the British Government has no more power to act for this State than our plenipotentiary has to act for theirs.  In that there is actual co-equality. I said yesterday that that was an exact and precise representation of the existing state of affairs, but Deputy Magennis said that it was quite the contrary.  But it was not.</P>
      <P>Every document is susceptible of several interpretations.  I said yesterday something like this: that, in fact, there is no such constitutional organism as the British Empire.  There is a series of States with one unifying feature, the King.  There is no central government or federal Government. Each Government is complete in itself and no Government has control over any other Government, although there are certain forms existing still which, as I have said, are recognised in their temporariness and which will be done away with as time and circumstances permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister undertook to reply to me.  Part of my case was that there was a community of nations known as the British Empire, that it has functions, that the control of them by way of government is the King in his imperial character, and that treaties are signed on behalf of each state with the King's name at the head of the treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says that there is a political entity called the British Empire.  There is not.  He says that it is ruled over as regards government by an imperial King.  That is incorrect.  The King's function is to reign, not to govern. That is done by the Governments of the various countries.  The King acts on the advice of each separate Government. These advices might quite easily be contradictory, and nullify each other.  With regard to one Government he can do one thing, and with regard to another Government a different thing, because in his functions he is several.  Every document is capable of several interpretations. Here we have a series of states, having been one they have grown into several with all sorts of anomalies. There is nothing particularly illogical about it in any direction in the move <Col N="920" /> from chaotically logical into logicality a little less chaotic.  The document in front of you is logical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>But is it satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is eminently satisfactory, inasmuch as it improves the position and makes it clearer than before that there is a root principle, which is co-equality.  That co-equality is co-equality of independence. We could be co-equal in this way: every Government would have to submit or yield to a veto of, say, five other Governments.  That is not so. Each Government is a complete and independent thing in itself.  I made a statement yesterday giving the interpretation of this Government to the document, and I suggested that the only interpretation of the document, which matters to the members of this Dáil or to the people of this country, is the interpretation put upon it by their own Government.  The acts and practice of this Government will be guided by our interpretation.  It is, therefore, quite irrelevant to quote the interpretation of outsiders, and a lot of time has been wasted here in quoting interpretations, most of which were made before the document was written. I think Deputies should be satisfied that my statement represents the interpretation which we are going to follow, and, if Deputies, including Deputy Baxter, who I believe would not wantonly or wilfully misconstrue it, would read the document carefully they would find in it what was the practice before, and what was the practice we got by the Treaty&mdash;that the practice and constitutional usage of Canada should be the practice and constitutional usage here.  That was accepted by Deputy Johnson, Deputy Magennis, and Deputy Baxter.  They will find in my statement yesterday what was the practice we inherited and what are the proposals for altering it.  I am satisfied that the proposals show a definite improvement in the direction in which we wish to go.  Therefore, I say the document is eminently satisfactory. Deputy Baxter spoke of enthusiasm, but I am afraid that my nature at this time of life is incapable of enthusing. <Col N="921" /> I made, as well as I could, a clear statement to enable Deputies to understand the implications of that document.  I do not ask anybody to enthuse about it.  I do not say that we have now arrived at perfection, but I say and maintain that every intelligent reader of the document will agree that it is eminently satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Johnson.  As far as we can, we will speed up the spending of this money.  We will do that.  I can mention one instance where circumstances, over which we had no control, held us back.  Take the Post Office.  Owing to scarcity of coal it was not possible to get steel.  Now I believe steel can be got, but a special price has to be paid for it.  We would agree to that special price, so that the work should not be delayed.  So far as we can speed up the spending of the money we will do so.</P>
