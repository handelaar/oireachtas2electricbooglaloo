      <P>It will, I think, be more convenient to deal with both questions in the one answer.  I take it the Deputy refers to certain men who were formerly temporary sorting clerks and telegraphists in Dublin, and who are now discharging duties proper to postmen under the recent reorganisation scheme.  Proposals for the establishment of certain of these officers are at present under consideration, and it is hoped that a decision will be announced at an early date.</P>

He held a farm of 44 acres statute measure, annuity £14, valuation £24 7s. 6d., which he assigned to his son, William O'Donoghue, by deed dated 30th June, 1921.  That and other contentions made by the claimant were investigated by one of my general inspectors on the 24th July, 1924, and I was not satisfied that the means, for old age pension purposes, of the claimants, were within the statutory limits for the grant of any pension.</P>

I have no information as to whether land is let to a labourer.  I understand, however, that the Clare County Council let portion of the grounds for plots.  Although I inquired from the County Council recently in the matter, I have not yet been informed exactly what part of the grounds is so let.  Any lettings that may have been arranged by the County Council have no legal force, as they were not made in pursuance of the State Lands Act, 1924.  I am not, therefore, under any obligation to provide another plot for the holder mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The claim to the old age pension in this case was disallowed on the 15th of May, 1926, on the ground of insufficient evidence to show that the claimant had attained the age of 70 years.  Her baptismal certificate was not produced, but solemn declarations from two neighbours were furnished. These stated that they had known the claimant from infancy and had no doubt that she was 70 years.  The declarants, however, mentioned no relevant fact in connection with the claimant's life history in support of their belief or opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take advantage of this, the last stage of the Housing Bill, to enter my protest against the fact that the President, who brought in the Bill, or any member of his party, has not seen fit to introduce an amendment for the purpose of extending the provisions for the reconstruction of houses in rural districts. I introduced an amendment last year, and I think on the previous year, for the purpose of having the Bill apply to the reconstruction of houses in rural districts, but the amendment was defeated by a vote of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the introduction of this Bill the President did not state what he has stated since, that the main object of the reconstruction section in the Bill was in order that reconstruction work might be done in regard to certain barracks in the country.  I refer in particular to the military barracks in Tipperary and Clonmel.  Even if this was the original intention in not <Col N="1584" /> applying the reconstruction section of the Act to the houses in rural districts, I think that is not a justification of the action of the Government in that regard.  The Act as it stands is granting from Government funds a subsidy to the builders of houses in towns and also in rural districts, and a subsidy for the reconstruction of houses in the urban districts which does not apply to the rural districts.</P>
    <P>If advantage has not been taken of the reconstruction section in regard to towns and urban centres, the only conclusion I can come to is that the necessity is not there for reconstruction and that the conditions which exist are not such as to lend themselves to the purpose of reconstruction.</P>
    <P>From my experience of the working of the Act in the rural districts&mdash;that is, in the real country&mdash;I do not refer to towns or villages with a population of under 500 but to the actual country districts&mdash;I say that the real demand is in those districts for grants for the reconstruction of houses.</P>

      <P>I am trying to do it.  If the Ceann Comhairle will ask the President to allow me to develop it, I will try to develop it.  The conditions are that there are farmers both small and large who are living in very inferior houses.  Emphasis has been laid on the conditions of the houses in slum areas in the city.  I am quite aware of the conditions in the slums and I am <Col N="1585" /> not saying one word against the advisability of meeting that state of affairs by means of housing grants, though it may be doubted what effect housing grants will have on these dwellers in the slums.  But that does not alter the fact that many houses in the rural districts are as bad if not worse than the houses in the urban districts that are described as slums.  What the people want to do in these cases is to reconstruct.  They want to use the old walls.  They may live in portion of the house while rebuilding the other portion. Very few of them are prepared to start building houses from the ground on a new foundation.  They want to make use of existing walls and portions of old buildings.  Very often they are able to do some of the work themselves and very often they are able to get men who are not members of trade unions, who are more or less handy-men, and can do more than one kind of work.  They wish to make use of portions of the old buildings and to build what would be practically a new house on the old foundation and walls which already exist.  Under the Act as it stands, they cannot do so; they have to build from the ground up. People in the cities and towns can.</P>

      <P>The fact remains, so far as I can see, that people in the rural districts cannot make use of the reconstruction clauses because they do not apply to any place except a town or a city with a population of 500 and upwards.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am wrong then.  Anyhow, they do not apply to the rural districts.  Even if there were no reconstruction clauses with regard to the towns, I maintain that in order to meet the requirements of the country districts a grant should be made for reconstruction purposes, because that is what is required most in these districts.  It is as much in the interest of the State to have sanitary, healthy dwellings in the country as it is in the city.  Even in the country districts there are slums.  The conditions are not quite so bad as in the cities, as the people are able to take more advantage of the open air than they are in the cities, and for that reason do not suffer quite so much from the disadvantages of bad housing.  At the same time, I regret that the President has not dealt with this matter in a more comprehensive manner in regard to the rural districts and that he did not apply the reconstruction clauses to those districts.  I take this opportunity of making that protest.  I do not want to make capital out of this, but perhaps the President would deal with it in some other way, if necessary by introducing another Bill which would give the people in the country districts the advantage of a grant for the purpose of reconstructing and making use of their present premises for that purpose.</P>

      <P>As the President has been so generous in extending the Housing Acts, he might go a little further and have some amendment inserted in the Seanad to enable reconstruction to be undertaken in the rural districts.  Deputy Johnson and the President told Deputy Heffernan that the reconstruction clauses do not apply even to towns of 500 population.  I think that any person living in a town who wishes to build an additional room to his dwelling-house or to raise the roof by some feet is entitled to a grant <Col N="1587" /> under the Act&mdash;at least some persons have received it.  I do not see why the same thing should not apply to rural districts.  I do not agree with Deputy Heffernan when he says that in the country districts they might be able to get non-trade unionists to work for practically anything they liked to offer in order to build houses cheaply.  I think a grant should not be given to any person who intends to employ sweated labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I did not say that&mdash;I did not intend to convey that.  I said that occasionally they can get men to work who will do more than one particular class of work.  A man will often do both carpentry and mason work, and probably he would get as high wages as the trade unionist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy made that clear, as I do not like to see wages being reduced.  The President should at least give the same facilities to those residing in the rural districts as are given to those in the urban districts. If the President would earmark, say, £15,000 out of the £300,000 for the purpose of grants for reconstructing houses in the rural districts it would be a great help.  Very few houses have been erected in Westmeath and Longford, and if grants were given for this purpose there would be hundreds of applicants.  I know many houses in the rural districts where a husband and wife and six or eight children have to live in two rooms, with boys and girls up to the age of 14 and 15 occupying the same room.  The conditions in such cases are as bad as in the slums of Dublin.  It is absolutely necessary that some assistance should be given in these districts to enable additional rooms to be built so as to provide suitable accommodation for large families. These people cannot afford to erect houses, but if they got £30 or £40 as a grant they would probably be able to add one or two rooms and thus provide suitable accommodation for themselves and their children.  In former years it has been represented to the Government that these facilities should be extended to the rural districts, but without <Col N="1588" /> result.  The Government certainly deserve to be congratulated on the assistance they have extended to enable the people to build houses.  They should go a little further and apply the reconstruction clauses to the rural districts so that people can make their homes comfortable with the aid of a grant. I appeal to the President to have an amendment inserted in the Seanad earmarking £15,000 for reconstruction purposes in the rural areas, where improved housing accommodation is very necessary.</P>

      <P>This point has been very much stressed and I should like to emphasise it.  On a former occasion I asked that the reconstruction clauses should be extended to the country districts.  I should like to ask the President whether he has any statistics available as to the number of houses in rural districts which might be condemned as unsuitable for dwelling-houses. If he has any such statistics he might consider this matter and see how many of those houses would lend themselves to reconstruction.  I want to emphasise the fact that a good many houses would lend themselves to reconstruction.  Country life is at the best drab and dreary without having to live in insanitary houses many of which it is almost a penance to live in.  I do not know what difficulties stand in the way of extending these clauses, and I should like to know from the President what they are.  I am sure it is a matter the Government ought to give some attention to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I observe in the report of Friday's proceedings in the Press that the figures given as to the cost of building three-roomed and five-roomed houses are correct.  The cost of building the four-roomed house, however, was given as £456.  Unless I made a mistake, the figure I intended to give was £426.  Now, coming to the question of reconstruction, I think the objection from Deputy Heffernan is in very bad taste, having regard to the fact that his constituency has benefited very considerably from this reconstruction clause.  Forty-four dwellings have been constructed out of barracks in Clonmel and thirty-six flats <Col N="1589" /> have been constructed in Tipperary, so he has no cause for complaint there. If he made a study of what is meant by reconstruction he would realise he has made a foolish statement with regard to the matter.  The rural districts, as a whole, have done remarkably well out of these measures, much better than they have ever anticipated.  A note has just come in from a rural district and it states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Kindly let me know whether the time for completion of 1925 grants extends beyond 18th October, 1926. A large number of my clients have stones.  Lime, timber, slates, etc., ready to start building, but masons and other tradesmen are so scarce they cannot go ahead.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This is due to the large and unusual amount of building resulting from the grants.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Reconstruction would be best described as re-adaptation.  It does not mean repairing a house, and that is, I think, what the Deputy has in his mind.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy wants us to do is that if a house is in bad repair in a country district, advantage can be taken of this Act towards meeting the expenses of those repairs.

      <P>Only a waste of time.  That is all.  Twenty-two thousand pounds, roughly, has been spent under the reconstruction clauses.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no particulars regarding Deputy Hogan's question, unless he takes from me particulars which were compiled in 1909, when an effort was being made to get a further million grant for labourers' cottages.  I recollect that the figures then given for the whole of the country, including Northern Ireland, were to the effect that something like 78,000 persons were living in rural districts in insanitary dwellings.  At that time the same information was available for the City of Dublin alone. Something over 78,000 persons were living in what would be described by a not too fastidious medical officer of health as insanitary dwellings in Dublin. To meet that something like a million pounds was granted at that time under the Labourers Acts, and that made <Col N="1591" /> some impression on that problem. Whatever problem is to be solved in rural areas can only be compared to that of a city something like the size of Limerick.</P>

The debate we have had on this was more in the nature of a Second Reading than the debate on the question: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;  On the Fifth Stage we are considering what is in the Bill, and it is obviously too late to recommend amendments and too late to re-argue amendments which have already been argued and decided upon.  I think if Deputies devoted some thought to the various stages they would see that the kind of debate we have had on this Fifth Stage is by no means the kind of debate we ought normally to have on a Fifth Stage.</P>

      <P>I want to raise one matter on the Report Stage of the Estimates. It is in connection with the regulations to be issued by the Civil Service Commissioners in the case of officers appointed on special recommendations or modified war certificates. Coming over from the British administration, where a number of officers here were appointed on special recommendation, <Col N="1592" /> those officers were to be medically examined after a period of twelve months, and if the Department were satisfied with their health, they were automatically to be appointed established officers on modified war certificates. The transfer of Government took place over four years ago, but nothing has been done by the Civil Service Commissioners here to carry out the arrangements which were entered into between the British administration and those officers.  I can understand some delay, but cannot understand a delay of four years, and while the Minister may not be conversant with the point just now, I ask him to look into the matter with a view to having those regulations promulgated at an early date, and thus meet the case of those officers who have been waiting four years for appointment.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the question of the status of lace instructresses employed by the Department of Fisheries.  I do not wish to go very elaborately into the case on the Report Stage.  Really the matter should have been raised on Committee, but I want to appeal to the Minister for Finance to take into consideration the great hardship inflicted upon these ladies by their unsatisfactory status. The information which I have is that there are about forty-nine of these ladies.  Their positions are temporary, and are terminable on a month's notice. Of these forty-nine, four have service of over twenty-five years; four have service of over twenty years' and twelve have service of over ten years. Most of the Deputies from the congested areas have very clear knowledge of the valuable services these ladies rendered to the cottage industries in these districts.  In Donegal, that is particularly so.  One or two of the ladies there have twenty-five years' continuous service, which has brought them recommendations from their own Department&mdash;the C.D.B.&mdash;for permanent appointment, and which has earned for them, time after time, from the heads of their Department the greatest praise for the public work which they accomplished. The work of these ladies was of a highly technical character&mdash;lace-making of a very special design, <Col N="1593" /> crochet work, and knitting of various kinds, which has been introduced recently owing to the failure of the lace industry.  The women and girls in these districts have been taught by these ladies.  The salaries are exceptionally small for the class of work they have to do.  No provision is made for them in the case of sickness, retirement, or old age.  I need scarcely tell the Dáil that a lady who has given twenty-five years' continuous service&mdash; and there are four of these&mdash;is not in a good position to enter the world market and seek an opening for her services again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a number of documents from public men with regard to the work of these ladies, but I will only read a couple of them.  The first one refers to the Association in which these ladies are combined.  It states: &ldquo;The above Association have repeatedly urged their claims to Civil Service scale of pensions before the Minister for Fisheries but, so far, without result.  A number of the members have been for over 20 years employed in fostering and reviving the cottage industries.  Their salaries are so small as to be just sufficient to maintain them, and they have nothing left for protection against sickness or old age.  The members of above are whole-time servants in the employment of the State, just as National Teachers, Poor Law officials, etc., and these latter receive pensions.  Why are the industrial teachers penalised? They toil and moil during their whole life in the service of the State and, in the end, they are cast aside wholly unprovided for.&rdquo;  That is signed by the President of the Association.  I have another document here from a public man whom I know.  He is a county councillor and he lives in the heart of one of those districts where these cottage industries have attained a high state of perfection.  He says: &ldquo;I have read the application from the industrial teachers for Civil Service pensions and I fully realise that their claim is fair and just.  I have known these local teachers and I know how many poor and necessitous families they have kept from starvation.  They gave, to my own knowledge, their whole time to the business for the last 25 years and I am confident that no just Government <Col N="1594" /> could see its way to throw them on the streets in their old age, seeing that teachers, civil servants and employees of country councils receive pensions.&rdquo; I do not wish to labour this question any further.  I merely wish to state that Deputies from the maritime districts had an interview with a deputation from this Association.  We went into their case as fully as possible and we came to the conclusion that it would be a just and fair thing for the Minister for Finance to take into consideration, as I believe he did before, the particulars of these cases and see if something could not be done for these unfortunate ladies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, put down by Deputy Johnson, is on the lines of extending the operations of the Act.  Deputy Johnson, last night, in presenting his amendment, based his arguments on the Interim Report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  He gave as a reason for this amendment to extend the powers of the Minister, cases which were queried in the first instance by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and then commented upon by the Public Accounts Committee.  I think the argument Deputy Johnson put forward for his amendment was that the Minister himself must have intended that the scope of the Bill should be greater than the original Act seemed to contemplate; that in connection with the advances made under the Trade Loans Act the Minister had gone beyond the Act by advancing money for capital purposes.  It does not seem to me that that is a sufficient justification, nor is it desirable, I think, that <Col N="1599" /> the powers under the amending Act should be extended.  I think the reverse ought to be the case, and when Deputy Johnson argues on the lines of what has been done under the original Act he must take cognisance of the fact that everything done under the original Act is claimed by the Minister to be within the ambit of that Act. The Minister is, of course, fortified by the opinion of the Attorney-General on the matter.  The purport of Deputy Johnson's amendment really is that he himself considers that it would not be undesirable that a large number of concerns should come within the Act which at present are obviously ruled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not specify a large number or a small number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected. Shall I say some?  I do not think it would be desirable to hold out such a hope.  After all, I think it is a hope that would not be fulfilled, because I think the Minister and the Advisory Committee would take a prudent view of any application that came on for a loan or an advance.  I do not think it would be wise to hold out a hope to all and sundry that an application, on account of a concern needing money, would be accepted by the Advisory Committee, and agreed to by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance, unless the specific object of the loan was for a new undertaking or extension.  I look upon this Act as an entirely temporary measure to deal with a temporary state of affairs.  The limitations that ought to be put upon advances made in this way ought to be very strict and very stringent.  I do not think it is desirable the State funds should be made available for trade purposes generally speaking.  In fact, I go further, and say it ought never to be the case. When one considers the original object of and the atmosphere in which the Trade Loans Act was passed, in the first instance, in Great Britain, one must make the reservation that the situation that called for that Act was really a state of desperation caused through the collapse of the general commercial <Col N="1600" /> routine.  One must remember, in this connection, that Great Britain is an industrial country, and that the depression in trade there bore very heavily in connection with the unemployment question with which they were faced. Any measure that could hope to deal in some way with the position of affairs as it then was would be welcomed and accepted as an exceptional measure dealing with exceptional state of affairs.  But when we in this country passed our original Act, I do not know if the intention in the mind of the Minister was to create a large body of credit, in other words a large inflation of capital.  I think the necessity did not exist to the same extent here as in Great Britain.  If I was asked my opinion about the continuance of this Act I should have to say that on commercial lines I think it is unsound. Deputy Johnson's amendment to extend the operations of the amending Act beyond the terms of the original Act seems to me to be a retrograde step, and for that reason I do not think the House ought to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In extending the original Act for a further period a closer examination of applications for grants should be made by those responsible.  I do not think Deputy Johnson is entirely in favour of his own amendment.  I think the principal object in moving the amendment is to get a pronouncement from the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to the scope of the amending Act, when it comes into force.  I think we would also expect from the Minister some reference to the guarantees that have already been given.  I think it is not unreasonable for the House to expect that the Minister will outline a policy as regards the future operations under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act and whether the policy is to be a continuance of that already adopted.  Does the Minister think these operations should be extended, or do his views coincide with mine in thinking that the operations of the Act should be curtailed? In any event, the circumstances surrounding applications should be very closely examined.  We must recognise that, throughout the country, there are many traders who would be very glad to get the assistance <Col N="1601" /> of the Government in raising money in order to extend operations or to carry on.  In many cases, even where there were excellent applications, when examined into, it is doubtful if these concerns would be in a better position ultimately.  The extension of the guarantee in such cases might probably not be in the interests of these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a position in relation to this Bill somewhat midway between the position of Deputy Johnson and the position of Deputy Hewat.  I do not feel that the Bill is one which we can abandon now.  I think such facilities as it does give are necessary until better arrangements can be made.  I hope a very much better arrangement will be made before any great interval of time.  On the other hand, I would not like to extend the scope of the Bill, as suggested by Deputy Johnson, and I see no need for doing it.  As regards what is meant by a capital undertaking, the position is perfectly clear now and requires no amendment of the Bill to clarify it.  It may be that when the British passed their Act they attached a certain meaning to &ldquo;capital undertaking.&rdquo;  That meaning may or may not have been present in the minds of Deputies here when our original Bill was being passed.  But, when a question arose in regard to the interpretation, as to whether capital undertaking included the acquisition of some sort of concern as well as the creation of a concern, we had advice from the Attorney-General in relation to that, and when the Bill has been so far administered on the basis of the wider interpretation of capital undertaking, we do not require any amendment at the present stage.  We know what the section means.  We know to what it can be applied, but, if we adopt a new section, we may have once again all the difficulties raised in regard to this; we may have on a new section some question of interpretation.  We may have the Attorney-General giving an opinion, and we may have the Comptroller and Auditor-General disagreeing with that opinion.  We may have proposals for further amendment.  I think all this <Col N="1602" /> has occurred is an argument for sticking to the section as it stands.</P>
      <P>We are satisfied that the section as it stands enables us to do what we think it desirable to do at the moment. To some extent it would, perhaps, be easier to administer the Bill if we narrowed the meaning of the section and put in words to bring it back to the meaning that, perhaps, the British gave it.  On the other hand, to widen it, as is suggested by Deputy Johnson, would increase the difficulties of administering the Act.  I think it is an extremely difficult Act to administer rightly and in such a way that no exception can be taken.  If we were to include the provision of working capital for undertakings, in my view it could not be in any reasonable way administered by the machinery available. Some other sort of organisation rather than a Government Department, and civil servants who are not dealing with ordinary business problems, would be necessary for dealing with the guaranteeing or the provision of working capital.  As a matter of fact, the facilities given under this Bill can only be regarded as just the best we can do now.  I hope that, as a result of the work of the Banking Commission, proposals will be put forward which will meet the requirements of long-term credit that are not very well met at present.  I would not like to be in the position, as Minister for Finance, of having to sanction or in any way deal with proposals for the guaranteeing of money to be used for working capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Really, because the Act cannot be administered at all on the rigid basis on which an ordinary Treasury matter would be dealt with. I believe if the Act is to be worked at all discretion has to be exercised, something like the discretion that a business house or a banker would exercise. That is not easily exercised by a Minister or by a civil servant, and it would be distinctly more difficult to exercise if you are dealing with working capital.  If you can guarantee a working capital you are in a position where the Act would enable you to run a business and simply appoint a manager. <Col N="1603" /> You have no definite line laid down which is the condition under which a Government Department can best operate.  Where there has to be some sort of personal discretion that is better dealt with by a financial or banking corporation of some sort.  A Minister, where he has a rigid line laid down, where one side is right and the other side wrong, can deal with it very easily and need not pay any attention to any pressure that may be put on him.  But to have the position as I remember it when discussing one of these loans and the giving of sanction &mdash;having the corridor outside my door filled with a deputation&mdash;does not create the best atmosphere for dealing with these things.  If we are going to extend the scope of the Bill and enable loans to be given for working capital, I have no hesitation in saying that the Act could not be properly administered. You never could get it administered properly.</P>
      <P>The interpretation given by the Attorney-General of a capital undertaking made it as wide as any Act that could be worked successfully with the Government machinery, and with the machinery that this is to be worked by.  As I say, even that, I would hope, could be dealt with by some other provision than this.  In the meantime, as against what Deputy Hewat said, we had no other provision to deal with these cases.  There were a certain number of businesses that would never have been undertaken, and a fair number of businesses that would perhaps have collapsed if we had not this, and until some other arrangements are made I am in favour of working this as we have been working it heretofore.  I see no objection to letting the wording stand.  Now that we have a legal opinion as to what the section means there is no objection to letting it stand as it is, but there is objection to altering the words, because in the past there has been a dispute about it.</P>

      <P>We are discussing an amendment by Deputy Johnson to insert the words &ldquo;and to modify the conditions&rdquo;<Col N="1604" /> after the word &ldquo;time&rdquo; in line 3 of the motion by the Minister for Finance.  I have not heard any ruling and would like to know how far does the further consideration of Deputy Johnson's amendments to the Bill depend upon the passing of this amendment to the financial motion. I take it that these amendments could still be discussed even if this amendment to the financial motion were defeated.</P>
      <P>The following amendments stood in the name of Deputy Johnson:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 3 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Sub-section (1) of Section 1 of the Principal Act is hereby repealed and in lieu thereof the following is hereby enacted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Minister for Industry and Commerce after consultation with an Advisory Committee nominated by him in conjunction with the Minister for Finance for the purposes of this section, is satisfied that the proceeds of any loan proposed to be raised, whether within or outside Saorstát Eireann by any public authority or by any corporation or by any body of persons corporate or unincorporate or by any person, are to be applied towards or in connection with the carrying out of any capital undertaking or towards or in connection with the carrying on of any manufacturing industry or in connection with the purchase of articles manufactured or produced in Saorstát Eireann required for the purposes of any such undertaking or industry, and that the application of the loan in the manner proposed is calculated to promote employment in Saorstát Eireann, the Minister for Industry and Commerce may guarantee in such manner and from and on such terms and conditions as he shall think proper, subject to the limitations hereinafter imposed and subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance, the repayment of the principal of such loan and the payment of the interest thereon or the repayment of such principal or the payment of such interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Sub-section (4) of Section 1 of <Col N="1605" /> the Principal Act is hereby repealed.</P>
    <P>Before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Principal Act shall be construed and have effect as if Section 8 were amended as follows, that is to say, by the deletion of the words &ldquo;capital undertaking means an undertaking involving expenditure for or in connection with&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) constructional works of public utility calculated to produce revenue or (2) the creation of new assets of the nature of plant, premises or machinery intended for use in the production, transport or distribution of commodities.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have proceeded on the assumption that the two amendments which would enlarge the powers of the Minister would not be discussable if this amendment on the motion were defeated.  But, I think, on the other hand, that the amendment to the definition would be discussable on the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I put it this way: The financial motion has reference mainly to an amount of money and the granting of money.  It says: &ldquo;That for carrying out the provisions of any Act of the present session to extend the limit imposed by the Trade Loans (Guarantee) (Amendment) Act, 1925, on the giving of guarantees.&rdquo;  It says nothing about different conditions. Does the absence of any phrase in the preamble to the financial portion preclude amendments later to modify the conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, might I explain? The position I have taken in the matter is that inasmuch as the present Bill is merely an extension of the amount of money and the time during which the Principal Act will operate, an amendment to the Bill in Committee which would really be an alteration of the Principal Act would not be in order.  That is the view I have taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, There are two separate questions.  One is as to whether an amendment to the Bill would be in order, in view of the terms of the money resolution.  The other is, whether a particular amendment in Committee to this amending Bill would be within the scope of the amending Bill.  It has been laid down over and over again that when you bring in an amending Bill, that is a Bill intended to amend a Principal Act, you cannot, in Committee on the amending Bill, introduce amendments which, while amendments of the Principal Act, are not within the scope of the amending Bill which has received a Second Reading.  On that basis, given the title of this Bill, and give the substance of this Bill amendments to alter the conditions under which guarantees may be given would appear to be out of order.  But, if in authorising the expenditure of the money the Committee thought fit, and the House approved on Report, to alter the money resolution so as to give authority in the way sought by Deputy Johnson, that would alter the matter in Committee on the Bill.  What is happening now is that I am allowing Deputy Johnson's amendment to the money resolution, and since his amendments to the Bill might be held to fall&mdash;at least one of them will certainly fall&mdash;on this amendment, the explanation of this amendment to the money resolution involves a discussion of the proposed amendments to the Bill itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to have that point made clear, because I would like to take Deputy Johnson's three amendments together.  I imagine from what Deputy Johnson has said that his first position would be that he wants all the three passed, that the three have to be put together to give a Bill which in its entirety would be up to what he thinks is proper.  I put it to him, for instance, that he could definitely move to take away sub-section (4) of Section 1 of the Principal Act, and that he need not necessarily go on to move, what <Col N="1607" /> really is an amendment to sub-section (1) of Section 1 of the Principal Act, the words &ldquo;towards or in connection with the carrying on of any manufacturing industry&rdquo;: that there are, in other words, two positions in regard to the Principal Act.  You might simply wipe out sub-section (4) of Section 1, which would mean that you take away the prohibition against guarantees for working capital.  That is the position taken up in the corresponding legislation in Britain.  Deputy Johnson has, however, gone further; he wants to put in sub-section (1) of Section 1 of the Principal Act an addition by inserting the words &ldquo;towards or in connection with the carrying on of any manufacturing industry.&rdquo;  Then later we have a definition of the words &ldquo;capital undertakings.&rdquo;  There are three propositions and they may be looked at simply from two points of view; they simply take out the prohibition against guaranteeing working expenses, and not merely do that, but say positively that the proceeds are to be applied &ldquo;towards or in connection with the carrying on of any manufacturing industry.&rdquo; I presume that there is bound up absolutely and entirely with that second amendment, the amendment to sub-section (1) of Section 1 of the Principal Act, which is limiting the amendment of Deputy Johnson by way of definition.  I would like to be clear on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I make a clean breast of it.  The definition that I put forward was anticipatory of the Minister refusing to enlarge his powers by my earlier amendments.  If he refuses to enlarge his powers I want him to be confined to what I conceive to be the real meaning of the section as it stands in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am definitely against repealing sub-section (4) of Section 1, which introduces this matter of guaranteeing moneys that are going to be used for working expenses. While that is so, I do not want to speak too strongly against it, because in certain contingencies I might find myself coming to the Dáil asking for some such amendment as Deputy Johnson is <Col N="1608" /> now proposing.  I would consider that an unsatisfactory way to meet certain difficulties which we found arising out of many application that have had to be withdrawn from before the Committee because they dealt with working capital.  We have already appealed to the Banking Commission, and put up to it that the working of this Act has been disappointing in its results.  The number of applications that have come before us under it, and that have had to be withdrawn by reason of working expenses being a necessary item, as well as the big number of applications we have received show the necessity for some provision by way of long-term credits for business or industries. In the last eventuality, if there does not proceed any suggestion from the Banking Commission, it might be taken up by financial houses here. Then, I believe, I would have to come later to the Dáil&mdash;possibly explaining it as the worst means of meeting it&mdash;but asking them, nevertheless, to grant some such liberty as would be given if Deputy Johnson's second amendment were carried.  At the moment I would urge against that.  I would have great hesitation at any time in asking for it, and I certainly do not want to ask for it this time, until, if I may put it without offence, the Banking Commission has failed me in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third amendment is to interpret capital undertaking to two very limited points.  Deputy Johnson thinks that this is what was meant when the original Act of 1924 was passed.  I doubt very much if that was the clear intention of anybody in the House when the 1924 Act was passed.  For instance, let me take a point on which it was argued that it should be merely for the purpose of increasing employment&mdash;in other words, if you saw a place of business that had been giving employment to a considerable number of men had closed down, or was running on short time with the result that only one-tenth of the former employees were at work, that you should not consider that as within the terms of the Bill, but some better handling of that business which would give employment to the fullest number <Col N="1609" /> ever employed on that undertaking before&mdash;I doubt if anybody ever had that clear distinction put before him when we were passing the 1924 Act.  I doubt if the 1924 Act would have been accepted if any limitation had been put upon it in that way.  I do not think that any such limitation should be accepted now.</P>

He must mean that the only reason why an undertaking was not running to its fullest capacity and was not employing the fullest number of people that might be employed in it, was the failure of money for working expenses, but that is not the case.  I do not think there is anything contradictory in what I have said, and in still keeping in sub-section (4) of section 1.  You can be very definitely against the provision of money for working expenses, and yet see such a thing as has happened in the Alesbury case, which I still hold, despite all that has been said about it, was not the provision of money for working expenses.  I do not see any necessity for tying us up so tightly.  I do not think it was ever meant as the position of people who hoped that not merely was it meant, but that actually there was something corresponding to this in the 1924 Act, and that there has been some enlargement of it by the Alesbury transaction.  By the opinions that have been given upon it there is something to be said for that type of person seeking to bring it back to the original and having it more clearly defined, so as to prevent a thing of that kind occurring again.  I am still of the opinion, and I am fortified by the opinions of two holders of the office of Attorney-General, that the thing was right and that it was within the Act.  We have a definition now of what the Act meant.  I say we should be in a position to continue the grant of loans to cases of the same sort, and we have that power under the Act without any enlargement such as <Col N="1610" /> Deputy Johnson wants to put in, but not if you put in this limitation proposed by amendment 3.  Deputy Johnson moves beyond the British limitation to which he has referred so frequently by inserting in the main section &ldquo;towards or in connection with the carrying on of any manufacturing industry.&rdquo;  The British legislation has no provision against guaranteeing moneys to be used for working expenses. They have no provision corresponding to sub-section (4) of section 1 of our Act.  The fact is, no money has been guaranteed under that except for capital undertaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We have it defined in a particular way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is we have it defined there.  Although we have no provision against working expenses which is not found in the British Act we have still got an Act which apparently is more flexible than the British Act.  I take it that Deputy Johnson is putting in these words for a very definite purpose, for &ldquo;carrying on manufacturing industries.&rdquo;  If we merely dropped the section which is against working expenses, we might then still carry on as before, and our Advisory Committee might always refuse to consider any application when they found that the money was really to be loaned for working expenses. Deputy Johnson wants to take that out and to insert: &ldquo;Towards or in connection with the carrying on of any manufacturing industry.&rdquo;  That would have this effect, that it would be almost impossible either for myself or the Minister for Finance to refuse an application no matter how firmly convinced we were that the whole money was going to be used for working expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the security?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am granting some type of security, but it would never be of the type of rigid and good security of fixed assets.  Again when you give money for working expenses you have the security to a certain degree lessened.  That is the difficulty we have, that we cannot understand just what security there would be for money advanced in that way.  To leave out sub-section (4) of Section 1 would still leave a certain very big discretion with the Advisory Committee, the Minister for Finance and myself, and we could make it a rule in our dealings with these applications where working expenses were really in question that we were going to have nothing to do with them.  If we have to take it as the wish of the Dáil that we should consider the provision of money for working expenses on pretty much the same footing as the guaranteeing of money for capital expenditure purposes again I do not want to be put in that position&mdash;very definitely not&mdash;but to a certain extent I lean towards some of these amendments, but for a different reason to what Deputy Johnson has put forward.  I am afraid that the net effect of the comment of the Auditor-General, with the addition of what the Public Accounts Committee had to say about the particular case, will be this, that the Advisory Committee for the future will probably operate more rigidly and in a more conservative way than any bank; that to a certain extent the comment of the Auditor-General has pretty well spoiled the effect that might be looked for under the continuance of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that will be the result, and I think it is bound to be the result, upon the new Advisory Committee who will have heard of this thing, and certainly will have to be advised of it. The new Committee will, I believe, react to it in that way.  There will be the further result that the new Advisory Committee will have to have everything looked at in the most rigid and conservative way.  I do not suppose there is any Act about which I have received so many representations and complaints from Deputies as this Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  I have not the exact figures here, but if one were only to take the number of applications received, and set against it the <Col N="1612" /> number of application considered by the Advisory Committee, to see just what was the cause of complaint with Deputies here, I should say that more than three-fourths of the entire number of applications received were only what I might call considered by the Advisory Committee&mdash;using &ldquo;considered&rdquo; in this sense, investigated with the view of getting the fullest facts to see whether the security was good enough or the proposition a sound business one.  Preliminary investigations showed there were certain difficulties, that it was money for working expenses that was required, and so on, and on that account a number of applications fell.</P>
    <P>A small fraction of cases simply went by the board, and in any event the type of applications we got in the first few weeks after the Bill became law were somewhat of the nature of &ldquo;I hear you are advancing money for certain purposes and I want some of it.&rdquo; They simply stated an amount that they wanted to go on with.  Outside this sort of foolish case which would have gone by the board anyway, there were a number of good applications which were ruled out because of things that came to light in the first investigation. Only a limited number came in for detailed consideration at all.  It may be that when the new Advisory Committee gets working, investigates the cases that have already been passed, sees how these loans are working and how far the State guarantee is likely to be called on, they may then begin to operate the Act, as it had been operated by the old Advisory Committee, and that is what I would aim at.  I think the old Advisory Committee did their work well and safeguarded the State by putting up propositions only after they had considered them carefully, and passed good judgment upon them.  While they did not act in any haphazard way, or give recommendations on loose cases, they certainly did not act at all with the same sort of rigid conservatism that generally marks the financial houses of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hewat asked as to the scope of the amending Bill, and as to my opinion on the guarantees already given.  I cannot give any further incations <Col N="1613" /> received, and set against it the number of applications considered by formation on the guarantees already given, except this, that they have met with the approval of the Advisory Committee, of myself, and of the Minister for Finance, and our opinions are more or less expressed by the fact that we have given our approval to them. I do not think Deputy Hewat would ask me to take any single one of them, and say with regard to it whether I think it likely or not the State will be called upon at any time to meet its secondary liability on the matter.  I do not think the Deputy would ask me to advance to that point.  Another question was on a matter of policy under the Bill: Is the extension proper, are the operations of the Trade Loans Act to be enlarged or diminished and should applications be rigidly examined?  As regards the letter, I can answer it easily. Applications have been very carefully examined, I will not say rigidly but carefully examined, and have been subjected to very definite criticism in the two Departments after they came from the Advisory Committee.  As to its operations being enlarged or minimised, I feel that its operations are going to be minimised, and that the Bill is going to be defeated to a certain extent by what has happened.  I never expect to get back to the state of progress that had been attained before the old Advisory Committee went out of existence.  I would not call for any enlargement in the sense of Deputy Johnson's amendment or any curtailment of the powers under the Act such as would be given by Deputy Johnson's third amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated on the Second Reading that at about Christmas time I had made up my mind that it should not even be extended to this year.  Then I came to the conclusion, because a number of applications began to come in, and because it was seen that the applications already in <Col N="1614" /> hand could not be completed before the expiry of the present Act, that some extension was necessary, and inasmuch as the report from the Banking Commission, which may establish a new state of things, could not be expected before the expiry of the present Act, I decided to move forward for an extension to this year.  I think that shows my mind.  I did not by any means regard it as a thing to be continued from year to year.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Deputy Hewat asked me are we going to look on the Trades Facilities Act as a measure which may be limited by amount and by a period of time, and whether it may be considered as one of the Bills to be renewed from year to year.  In other words, does he mean that when we limit a single Act as to time we will always consider the grafting on of the new Act to the expiring one?  I do not think that ought to be the case.  It is only to meet an emergency that this type of legislation ever came about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not exactly what I mean.  The Minister gave the figure of £111,000 as regards loans in which a guarantee was given.  The Minister says he divided the loans into four sections, putting first those on which a guarantee was given and he explained £111,000 had been guaranteed under that.  Then there are loans in which guarantees are not given, but in respect of which there was approval and recommendation sent by the Advisory Committee, as well as approval given by the two Government Departments concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My figures differ according to the different dates.  The figure for the 22nd April is a little bit old.  The figure for the first lot is £106,000.  That has since been increased by £5,000, so that it becomes £111,000. On the 22nd April, the amount under the second category approved by the two Ministers, but awaiting completion and legal formality, was £108,000. Whether the £5,000 from the 22nd April means that one £5,000 loan was a guarantee which advanced from the second category to the first, I cannot say.  I presume it was.  The combined amount would not vary, so it would be £214,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can you now give the figure for the third category, where recommendations came from the Advisory Committee and were passed by the Department of Industry and Commerce but were not sanctioned by the Department of Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>£390,000.  I can get these figures absolutely correct at very little notice.  The only benefit envisaged by Deputy Johnson in this type of legislation on the other side was the lower rate which might be charged to investors for money if they had a Government guarantee, as opposed to what they would be charged if they had not.  That was looked to here, but it has not turned out to be a big advantage.  The rate does not vary greatly.  There is some variation, but the advantage is mainly the extension of time for which repayments would run.  The combination of these two things does give some benefit under this Act over what would be got from ordinary banking transactions.  As to its future and on the question of working capital, I fail at times to understand the mentality of this House with regard to public money.  We have had at times the old demand that used to be made so strongly not merely for the extension of unemployment insurance but even a grant of money beyond what would be due on a contributory basis.  Money is often demanded in the <Col N="1616" /> way of grants to local authorities, relief grants of one type or another.  You would have in the third step this provision of guarantees against working expenses, and in the fourth remove, getting towards the ideal state, you would have the Trade Loans Act as it stands with this allowance of a guarantee only for the capital undertaking. The last stage, towards which we should move and which we should hope to approach soon, is that in which there would be no Trade Loan Facilities Act at all, but in which there would be such a definite rehandling of financial institutions here and such a facing up to the newer conditions, that the necessity for trade loans would be done away with, and in which the State would not come in and assume even a second liability.  I think that is an answer to Deputy Hewat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a very complete reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we will get from the Banking Commission some suggestions, and that these suggestions, if adopted&mdash;there is another &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash;will relieve us from the necessity of having any type of legislation of this sort, even as a temporary measure continued from year to year. Looking at it, however, as a temporary measure to be continued for this year, we should neither enlarge nor restrict it in either of the ways suggested by Deputy Johnson.  I would urge against the other amendment that, although it is difficult to define, in so many words, what &ldquo;capital undertaking&rdquo; means, we have some idea as to what it means. We have cases on the point and we know what these cases mean.  If these cases are going to be used as precedents, and if they may be followed, the House, in voting for the Bill, will be ensuring that no matter what has happened in the past, it will not be repeated in the future.  As regards the second amendment, I would urge against this, that although the applications showed that there is considerable need by way of a provision for working expenses, that should not be done under this Act.  We should leave firms to find moneys for working expenses as best they may, if we are <Col N="1617" /> going to give them help by way of guarantees on fixed assets.  On the other hand, I would urge against two points in Deputy Johnson's amendment. He wants to enlarge this by saying: &ldquo;In connection with the carrying on of any manufacturing industry.&rdquo;  That in itself, with the working-expenses section deleted, I would not consider of much harm, because I do not consider it an enlargement.  I think what the Deputy wants is in the Act.  I would object to the other point where he amends the Bill so as to read: &ldquo;By any public authority or by any corporation or by any body of persons, corporate or incorporate, or by any person.&rdquo;  I have a technical reason against that, the point being that you cannot get any great charge upon the assets of an individual and that the only way to get after him is by way of bill of sale.  No advisory committee, given that as a method of getting after an individual's assets, would ever put up a recommendation for the acceptance of the Government. If that were passed, I do not think that the advisory committee would act on it, and the only effect would be to throw on myself and the Minister for Finance the onus, at times, of over-riding the committee.  If you found that the committee was simply turning down a case because it was a single individual and you had that technical point of the bill of sale coming in, and also had this expressed approval through the passing of this amendment for considering such individual cases&mdash;on those grounds I would urge against that amendment also.</P>

      <P>I confess that it is rather difficult, in face of the arguments of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to stand on the case which Deputy Johnson has made, and to say that there ought to be such amendments to the existing Trade Loans Facilities Act as would enable that Act to operate in such a way as to give, in addition to a loan for capital expenditure, a loan for working capital.  They have, admittedly, the experience of twelve months through the working of the Act, and they have pointed out the difficulties, which are, undoubtedly, real difficulties, <Col N="1618" /> but, on the other hand, I do not think that it is a case which should be accepted.  It is not a case for refusing Deputy Johnson's amendment because the difficulties in the administration of the Act are such that they are not prepared to face them.  I gather that, in principle, there is an acceptance on the part of both Ministers, to a very great extent, of the point of view which Deputy Johnson put forward for the extension of the capital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  I may have made a mistake or I may have misled the Deputy.  I said I may have to come forward later if the Banking Commission does fail in the sense of not making a suggestion which would be adopted by the financial houses, but until that time I am against wiping out sub-section (4) of Section 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just the point. So the Minister does recognise that the difficulty exists at the moment.  He is pinning his faith, as is the Minister for Finance, on what the Banking Commission will do, but in the event of failure on the part of the Banking Commission to make such a report and in the event of the failure of the banking institutions to do what even the report of the Banking Commission suggests they should do, the Minister will have to reconsider the position, so that actually Deputy Johnson is facing up to the position that the Minister for Industry and Commerce may have to face up to later.  It seems to me in that there is acceptance of the principle, and while I feel it is undoubtedly difficult for me and for our Party to advocate the entrance of the Government and the State into business&mdash;difficult indeed to visualise a condition of things where the State might be part proprietors of a number of businesses&mdash;one recognises the purposes of this Act and understands that it was meant to relieve unemployment, that it was meant to <Col N="1619" /> enable industries that might have been in difficulties to continue in existence. One has to recognise that there are industries to-day in difficulties, industries that should under ordinary normal conditions be able to live against competition but because of the fact that the amount of money available for the running of business is so restricted, difficulties are here placed in the way of industries that we do not find elsewhere.  Under such conditions as those the State has in another way attempted to order the running of industries here, to provide employment, we might say almost to compel the citizens to purchase from certain industries working in the country.  Citizens are compelled to purchase commodities manufactured here and sometimes to purchase them at a higher price, and the purchaser pays.  The State through Deputy Johnson's amendment is invited to intervene and the citizen is in another way asked to assist these industries to live against the difficulties of the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interim report of the Committee of Public Accounts pointed out a weakness in the operation of this Act.  I confess that I feel in agreement with the Minister in his point of view on that, and I am prepared to go so far as to say that there are even possibilities of the State losing in some instances, but, everything considered, in the interest of the State and industry I think the State should take its chances. While one would not be prepared to counsel a policy that would allow the finances of the State to be put at the disposal of industrialists or business men without adequate security, we recognise that money is paid out day after day and week after week through the Unemployment Fund.  We have to ask ourselves is it possible to spend money in any other direction whereby men can be employed and can give services for the money they get, services that will be beneficial to the State from the moral point of view and very much better for themselves than the methods by which they obtain money at present? Under conditions such as these. what is the wiser policy for the State? Is it better to take a chance that even in some instances the State might lose <Col N="1620" /> or that the State should stand rigidly for giving no aid whatever to a struggling industry that might be kept in existence if certain facilities were given to it by the State which it cannot obtain from other sources?</P>
    <P>Putting one argument against another, it seems to me it would be a much sounder policy for the State, where security can be obtained, that industry should be aided by such a measure as the Trade Loans Facilities Act than by the other policy that is being adopted.  When a man in business comes forward for a loan there is a recognition on his part at once that he is going to get something that he has got to repay.  He knows that if he is to repay that money, if his credit is to be maintained by himself, he must work and he must give good service. He recognises that he has got to live against competition.  He must, if he is to succeed, do his work well, and I am convinced that we would get a much better spirit amongst our industrial population, that we would get the work much better done, and that all-round we would get industry established on a better foundation by such a method as is here suggested than by any other policy the State can pursue. If the Minister is not prepared to accept Deputy Johnson's amendment to extend &ldquo;capital&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;working capital,&rdquo; I would urge on Deputy Johnson that any alteration of the Act at the moment is inadvisable.</P>
    <P>What is the case for the extension of the Act with regard to working capital? Can we visualise a condition of things where an industry stands every chance of succeeding on condition that further capital may be made available for it to extend its fields of operation? We may even in agriculture see a trade organisation brought into existence. We may see capital expenditure in the shape of buildings, but conditions may arise when further capital is essential for the running, management and success of the industry.  We may see possibilities of an industry prospering on condition that not alone is it given capital expenditure for buildings or plant, but also some additional sum for working capital.  Is it wise that there should be an extension of the Act <Col N="1621" /> in that direction?  I think there is an acceptance of the principle that it is better.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hewat argues to the contrary. He may be possessed of the individualistic mind that feels that combination for business purposes on the part of a community other than the strictly business community is not to be encouraged; but, considering the conditions in the country, it is, I feel, the duty of the State to encourage industry and business by whatever legitimate means it can employ.  We might, for instance, see possibilities for the extension of a bacon factory, but it will depend on two things, the ability to secure money for the extension of premises or machinery and the ability to secure money as working capital.  There are opportunities in that field to-day, but under the Act it is not possible to obtain a loan that you can put into plant and buildings.  The restrictions, such as they are, prevent any further effort on the part of the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce to help an industry like that.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Johnson that there is a good case for an amendment of the Act.  The defence of the Ministers is that they are thrown back on the report of the Banking Commission. I am not in agreement with the Minister for Finance that the difficulties of administration are such that an extension of the Act is not to be countenanced. I do feel that whether the Minister decides now or at a later stage to extend this Act, beyond question it would be a much sounder method for the Government to adopt for the encouragement of industry than any method that has been pursued so far Existing methods certainly have had very limited success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On another occasion I stated that the responsibility for dealing with a matter of this kind must rest with the responsible Ministers, and if Ministers were prepared to come to the House and ask for an extension of their powers in the direction I have now indicated in the amendments put forward, I would be prepared to support them.  I think it would be wrong for me to say that, notwithstanding the <Col N="1622" /> Ministers' disavowal or even refusal to seek these enlarged powers, we are going to impose such powers upon them.  That would be a wrong attitude for the Dáil to take.  Ministers know the situation industrially; they know the requirements; they know whether the circumstances are such as would warrant them in calling for these extended powers or refusing to call for them.  It is a responsibility which must be placed upon the shoulders of Ministers to ask for, or refuse to ask for, such powers as are under discussion. In view of the fact that Ministers are not willing to seek these powers then I, for one, am not going to try to force the powers upon them.</P>
      <P>I think there has been some satisfaction derived from this discussion.  We know more clearly what the views of the Ministers are regarding the continuation or extension of this method of assisting industry.  I am not convinced by the argument that it is well to continue for twelve months on the course we are now on.  I think even for twelve months it would have been desirable to have made some change in the conditions under which this Act is to be administered.  A good deal of importance has been attached to the fact that the difficulty facing business houses has been to obtain money for long terms from banks; it is largely to meet that difficulty that the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act was intended. Having that in mind, what is the objection to repealing the section relating to working expenses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is necessary for a firm to raise money for working expenses, and it cannot raise that money for a long term, and it can give ample security to satisfy the Advisory Committee, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance, where lies the objection to providing money for working expenses under the provisions of this section?  Hitherto Ministers had said that the difficulty about raising money for working expenses was that there was not a tangible asset.  Surely that is not accurate?  At least it is not consistent with the attitude of Ministers regarding this Act.  It was stated more than once by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the moneys to be raised for working expenses <Col N="1623" /> would not be balanced by the creation of a tangible asset.  Therefore, security was not created.  But if the Advisory Committee and the Ministers in question were going to be careful and rigid in the carrying out of their powers and not lend moneys unless they saw fair and valuable security, it really would not matter very much, if at all, whether the money raised was to be used for working expenses or capital undertakings, provided the other conditions were complied with, in view of the Minister's interpretation of the Act as it now stands.</P>
    <P>The Ministers interpret the Act in a way which is not consistent with that view, because they have told us that they are prepared to guarantee a loan which is not necessarily to be used in the creation of a new fixed asset.  They are prepared to guarantee the loan which is to be used for the acquisition of an already existing asset, which does not mean the employment of labour, and quite clearly in the Act the object is the employment of labour.  But they defend it by stating that the acquisition of the existing premises by a new company will enable that new company to raise capital for working expenses and that by the expenditure on working expenses they will be able to create employment.  That is the position Ministers have taken and are contending that they are authorised to take under the provisions of the existing Act.  It seems to me that that position is entirely unsatisfactory.  It is entirely unsatisfactory if we are to maintain the existing Act in its present form.  And though Ministers have told us, and we how know what their interpretation of the Act is, and that we need to be no longer under any misapprehension as to what their intentions are, I think it is very unsatisfactory that a sum of £900,000, or the balance between £200,000 or £230,000 and £900,000, may be guaranteed in the manner which has been adopted in at least one case in the past.  The Minister is entirely opposed to giving a guarantee for a loan for the purpose of working expenses.  But under the interpretation of the Act which now exists and which we are warned may be followed in the future, this is possible: a firm seeks a <Col N="1624" /> loan for working expenses of, say, £7,000 or £8,000.  That is prohibited by sub-section 4 of Section 1, and it cannot be granted.  The firm may then say: &ldquo;We must have these working expenses to keep our factory, our mills, our workshops going, and by that means to employ a considerable amount of labour.&rdquo;  Ministers are naturally desirous of facilitating that operation, but they cannot provide the working capital when they are prohibited by the terms of sub-section (4), and the bank will not advance the working capital for the purpose and the company is faced with closing down.  But it is possible under the section as interpreted by the Ministers, for that company to say: &ldquo;We will turn our company into a limited liability company (it has hitherto been a private company) and we will then purchase from the existing company, the old company, the assets, out of the loan of £20,000 or £30,000 which we may borrow under the provisions of the section and which the Government may guarantee.&rdquo;  And having purchased the assets of the old company and got the guarantee it is then for them to go to the bank and get the working capital.  It may be within the letter of the section, but in my view it is distinctly against the spirit of the section, and it is a mere invitation to companies to devise ways and means to over-ride the intentions of the section; and the Minister becomes a party to that device.  I think it is undesirable, and I think it is most unsatisfactory that a firm seeking to get guarantees under the provisions of this section, however sound and satisfactory the prospect may be to them to stretch and enlarge and extend what was clearly the intention and go to a good deal of trouble for reconstructing &mdash;legal and accounting trouble&mdash;so that the business may be fitted into the Act.  I think it is undesirable, and it was with the object of trying to make it possible for the Minister to do the thing which he has done easily and without stretching the intention of the Act that I put down these amendments.</P>
    <P>I admit at once that if the Act were amended as I have suggested it would place an immense power in the hands of Ministers.  I think it is very doubtful whether it is the kind of a power <Col N="1625" /> which should be permanently exercised by Ministers.  I say definitely that it is not the kind of power which should be permanently exercised by Ministers. If Ministers can assure us that the need for this kind of emergency legislation has passed nobody will be more delighted than I, but I have no evidence of the truth of that suggestion.  I hope it is a fact and that it will be possible to learn of that fact, if it is a fact, before many days have passed.</P>
    <P>An important figure was given by the Minister which, I think, ought to be placed in the possession of the Dáil and emphasised.  Bear in mind the process under which loans are granted under this Act.  In the first place an application is made to the Advisory Committee.  The Advisory Committee inquires into the business possibilities, needs, and so on, examines the securities and generally investigates the question from the industrial and financial point of view.  The Committee makes its recommendation to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He in turn makes his decision and seeks the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  It should be understood in this regard that when the Bill on which our Bill is based was being discussed in the British House of Commons it was very strongly insisted upon that the Advisory Committee was to be the actual deciding authority except for the final formal approval of the Minister; the undesirability of any political or even Civil Service touch upon the question was evident, and they wanted to dissociate as clearly as possible all political or even Civil Service command of this question.</P>

      <P>There was some reference to the Civil Service end also, but it was mainly political.  It was probably not possible to adopt that attitude here.  I am not quite sure if it has been possible to adopt it even there, but that was the mind of the Ministry when introducing the original Bill.  It certainly was not possible to adopt that <Col N="1626" /> very rigid attitude in this country.  But, as I explained, you had the three stages: the inquiry by the Advisory Committee, the approval or disapproval of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and, after approval, the reference to the Department of Finance. The Minister has told us that under the existing Act loans have actually been given amounting to about £111,000; that loans have been recommended and approved to the extent of another £111,000.  That is to say, £222,000 or £223,000 have been passed by the Advisory Committee and the Departments concerned, but that £390,000 have been passed by the Advisory Committee and the Minister for Industry and Commerce but not sanctioned.</P>

      <P>Not yet sanctioned by the Department of Finance.  So that out of £900,000 sought for, only £222,000 are already sanctioned and granted.  I do not know whether the prospects are good for the balance to be guaranteed within the next twelve months.  The process must be very much quicker than it has been for the last twelve or eighteen months if that is to be the case, or the sums in question will have to be very much greater. My amendment referring to the extension of the powers to include a loan for the carrying on of a manufacturing industry, was intended to give clear effect to what I conceive to be the intention of the Minister.  A manufacturing industry might desire to continue its business on money raised under a guaranteed loan even for the manufacture of stock, which might be called working expenses&mdash;might be capital required for working expenses &mdash;but it might be the means of giving effect to the intention of the Act as interpreted by the Minister in a way which an expenditure on a capital undertaking would not be clearly intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ministry does desire, in fact, by the evidence of the history of these loans that have been guaranteed, to enable a manufacturing industry to carry on, even though it is not engaged in the production of new fixed assets.  The <Col N="1627" /> object of the amendment I put down was to give a clear expression in the Bill of the intention of the Minister. However, he is not prepared to seek those powers.  He insists that the interpretation that has already been placed on the Bill by himself and the Ministry generally is satisfactory to him and he is prepared to go on in that way.  He tells us, however, that the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor-General may have the effect of slowing up activities under the Act. I do not know quite what that means, but if it means that there will be a greater hesitation in guaranteeing loans for businesses which must needs alter their construction to enable them to fit into the Act then I do not think it would be by any means a disaster that there should be such a slowing up.  On the contrary, I think it is better that such loans should not be guaranteed if it becomes necessary so to alter and vary and change the form of the business to fit into the Act, and, if one may say so, to avoid and evade the requirements of the Act.  I think the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, if they do put a check upon that, will have been very good in their results.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  It has been initiated by the General Council of County Councils, who have been unanimous in favour of the introduction of a measure on those lines, and to that extent it is not purely a departmental measure.  It has been apparent for a considerable time that the system under which local authorities insure their property against fire risk in this country is extravagant, and in other respects not altogether satisfactory. It is not an easy matter to collect figures showing the risk ratio for property of local authorities, but such figures as can be got indicate pretty clearly that the risk ratio for the property of local authorities is very much lower than that of other property. Researches along those lines have been made by the General Council of County Councils, and they go to show that the risk ratio of the property of local authorities in Ireland only amounts to 7 per cent., whereas the normal rate for ordinary property is 55 per cent.  I cannot stand absolutely for those figures, but I believe they are substantially correct. <Col N="1629" /> On the other hand, as regards the position of insurance companies, they are not altogether pleased with the existing arrangements either.  Competition for the business of local authorities, owing to the fact that the risk ratio is so low and also to the fact that the securing of such business is a kind of advertisement for the company, is very keen between the different companies. The result is that so much money has to be expended in paying the salaries and travelling expenses of canvassers that it is a moot point whether this business is worth securing at all.  Some authorities on insurance in this country are of the opinion that this business does not pay companies even at the very favourable premiums that exist at present.</P>
      <P>Early in the present century a similar state of affairs existed in Great Britain, and local authorities in that country were also paying unnecessarily high premiums when the relatively small risk involved is taken into consideration and also the complete absence of moral hazard.  In that country certain individuals very much interested in local government, realising the state of affairs that existed, determined to correct it by forming an association of municipal authorities which would arrive by experiment at the arithmetically correct premium and insure its members at that premium. As a result of their efforts the Municipal Mutual Insurance Company, Limited, was incorporated in 1903, as a company limited by guarantee and not having a capital divided into shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That company has been an unqualified success.  Since its establishment premiums have been reduced in Great Britain and a reserve fund established from which loans are made to the local authorities in Great Britain at low rates of interest.  The new system was applied to the employers' liability insurance in 1918.  The General Council of County Councils has been for some years examining the position in Saorstát Eireann with a view to establishing here a body on the lines of the British company and with the same advantages for local authorities.  Their efforts have been hampered by one <Col N="1630" /> difficulty which did not affect the British company.  Since the inception of the latter the Assurance Companies Act, 1909, was passed requiring large deposits by companies not in operation when the Act was passed.  The only exceptions made by that Act are in respect of associations the purpose of which is wholly or mainly the mutual assurance of their members.  The Government has been advised that, as the law now stands, local authorities cannot become members of such an association, so that before such a company can be formed in Saorstát Eireann it would be necessary to make a very heavy deposit which it is not in a position to make.  Accordingly, if we are to make it possible for a company with those advantages over local authorities to come into existence it is necessary to pass some such measure as this.</P>
    <P>The main object of this Bill is to enable local authorities in Saorstát Eireann to become members of mutual assurance companies and to exempt such companies from making deposits in the same way as other mutual assurance associations are exempted.  Restrictions are placed on the nature of a company to which the Act applies by Section 2 of the Bill, in order to secure that the bona fide objects of the company should be mutual assurance by local authorities and that private persons should not obtain personal advantages or profits from its operation. The local authorities are themselves to promote and direct the company through members or officers appointed by them for the purpose, and may pay subsistence and travelling allowance to their nominees.  It is as well to point out that the Bill leaves it at the entire discretion of the local authorities to promote or belong to such a company. Unless they are satisfied with the advantages they gain and the security they enjoy they need not become or continue as members.  Any company, therefore, formed under the Bill must stand or fall on its merits.  The Bill enables companies of this kind to be formed but does not ask the Oireachtas to approve of any such company or make it difficult for a local authority to refuse to join.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>We are favourably impressed with the necessity for this Bill.  By its means constructive effort can be made by local authorities to reduce expenses in connection with fire insurance.  The Minister has explained the working of the Bill, and to ratepayers and farmers anything that will give relief and lessen expenses is naturally very acceptable.  The general body which is more or less acting on behalf of the ratepayers, in this case the General Council of County Councils, are the people who brought pressure on the Minister to bring in this Bill, or rather, he has facilitated them in the formation of a mutual assurance system. I have not sufficient knowledge at my disposal to venture on the expression of an opinion adverse to the principle involved.  But having regard to the success which has attended a similar movement in Great Britain, we believe it is a Bill we ought to support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I cannot support the last speaker in his approval of the principles of this Bill. The Minister for Local Government takes responsibility for this measure, although he has to some extent disclaimed responsibility by saying that he is introducing the measure to meet the wishes of the local authorities who are in favour of setting up a mutual assurance company to cover their own property. The principle that underlies this Bill is, I think, absolutely unsound. There is no reason why any body of people should not co-operate in their own interest, if it is in their own interest. But here we have the Minister for Local Government advocating that the ratepayers should practically leave their property uninsured.  The basic principle of insurance is provision for contingencies that may not arise.  The foundation of the whole principle lies in the capital which is provided to meet those contingencies if they do arise. The insurance of property by a company, or a number of individuals, without anything to fall back upon in case of loss by fire or loss through the operations of unemployment insurance, is a perfectly unsound principle, from every point of view.  A person who takes a risk of that sort is, of course, only courting disaster.  The proposals in <Col N="1632" /> this Bill are that the various local authorities should join together to insure their own property.  If this scheme is in operation to-morrow, if there is nothing to fall back upon, and if a valuable building is burnt, involving a loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds, is it proposed that the ratepayers should bear that loss, simply because there is no provision made to meet it.</P>
      <P>A document has been circulated by the promoters of this proposal in which they make much of the fact that an insurance movement of this sort has accumulated in England, after twentyseven years' working, a sum of £225,000.  In the first place, assuming that the departure in England has been a success, we must recognise that insurance, which is based on large numbers and large values, is different in Great Britain, which has a great number of municipal undertakings, from what it is in the Saorstát.  To build up a fund of any proportions in connection with the insurance of property which would come within the purview of this organisation would take a very long time here.  In the meantime, the risks are very considerable.  Take the value of the property which, it is indicated, may come under this Bill.  No insurance company would take that risk.  It is only a large combination of insurance companies that would take the risk. The largest insurance company in the world would not undertake the insurance that will be offered this association, which is without any backing or security, without distributing it amongst other companies.  That is the practice and it is a prudent precaution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that a Bill of this sort is in the nature of a Private Bill.  It is really Private Bill legislation, rather than public legislation.  A proposition of this sort ought to be examined by a Committee on Private Bill lines.  Then, insurance companies are required to deposit £20,000 before they can operate in the Saorstát.  That is quite a reasonable requirement, but it has had the effect of driving a good many insurance companies out of the country, because the amount of their business here did not justify the lodgment of £20,000.  If a private company is bound to safeguard <Col N="1633" /> the interests of its customers by depositing this amount, surely the same provisions should apply in the case of any other association engaging in the same work.  Why is an exception made? What is the difference between municipal or other authorities joining together for the purpose of insurance business and a private company carrying on the same class of business?  It does not seem to me that it is right that this House should extend preferential treatment to an association of this class as contrasted with a business organisation. I do not think it is wise that legislation should take that form.  The companies carrying on business here have certain expenses to bear.  Should they be put in the position of having their business jeopardised by legislation favourable to an association of persons carrying on exactly the same work?  The Bill deals very lightly with the question of risk.  It says nothing about re-insurance, and the Minister is silent about re-insurance likewise.  We can only assume, therefore, that the different authorities are going to take their own risk and are going to provide for the building up of reserves from premiums.  That is all right if everything goes well.  We are told that the premiums payable to the insurance companies will go into the ratepayers' pockets.  That ignores the risk which is incurred in the meantime.  It is not a novel proposition at all. There are many cases in which the same sort of thing has been in operation and in some they have proved very expensive to the people concerned.  After all, insurance business does not consist in merely taking in premiums and having nothing going out.  As a matter of fact, all general experience is that in insurance it is laborious business to build up reserves. A great many companies have failed to carry on for very long, but, generally speaking, the risk covered by policies has now been reduced to a fine art.  It is a question of averaging losses over a certain period of years.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, at any particular time companies may be called upon to face exceptional losses owing to exceptional circumstances.  They have provision made in the matter of reserve and <Col N="1634" /> capital to meet contingencies for which there is no provision in the Bill before us.  I ask the House to consider if that is sound business.  It may be very attractive to Deputy Wilson to think that we are going to stop paying premiums and that, instead, we are going to put the money in our own pockets.  But is that business?  Is there any risk?  It may be easy to put the money in one's pocket but it is not easy to keep it there.  The Government tax collector comes along and takes the lot of it.  I do not want to make any special point about this Bill.  If it is considered that this is a form of legislation which is proper for the Minister for Local Government to bring in, well and good.  But remember it is going to form a precedent.  I say, firstly, it is unusual, and if I am told that it is not unusual, then I come to a second point and ask: Is it desirable?  The Minister may say it is a matter for the local authorities, and if they are prepared to take the risk he is prepared to sanction it.  I would advocate sufficient grandmotherly legislation to prevent any such scheme coming into operation without due and proper consideration of what the project really means.  The whole question does not seem to me to be a sound insurance proposition unless you have a reserve to fall back upon in the event of loss.  It is the negation of the principle of insurance altogether.</P>

      <P>Then we come to the question of the £20,000 which insurance companies are required to lodge before they can operate in the Free State. This Bill aims purposely at getting over legislation already passed by the Dáil providing that any company, before it can carry on insurance business in the Free State, must deposit £20,000. Do the circumstances in this case justify the nullifying of that legislation? I venture to say the Minister has not made out a case and I do not think that the Bill, on the face of it, makes out a reasonable case for the powers which it proposes to give to local authorities in connection with insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The implication is that Deputy Hewat is opposed to this Bill because it is not in conformity with the business usages of the country &mdash;because it is not going to continue to put premiums into the pockets of the shareholders of the insurance companies. I say it is going to save the ratepayers money that they would otherwise have to pay.  Deputy Hewat is very concerned about the neglect of the £20,000 deposit which insurance companies are bound to put up before they can start to do business.  It should not be necessary for me to point out to Deputy Hewat that the reason that this reserve fund is in existence is that there may be a certain State guarantee that the people who insure will obtain payment for any losses they may incur from fire or any other risk against which they have insured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should a reserve fund be necessary in this case?  Have we not the best assurance of the payment of losses in the ratepayers themselves, the assets of the local authorities and the rates? We may have great respect for business interests, but business men have no right to have a monopoly of profit-making and to deny the rights to public bodies to combine mutually and to cooperate to effect savings.  It has been clearly shown in the circular issued by the General Council of County Councils that a project of this kind in which thirteen local authorities in England were concerned has proved a very great success, and has resulted in very considerable savings to them.  They have built up a very large reserve fund in the comparatively short time since they started.  Undoubtedly the premiums that they pay are less than the premiums paid to insurance companies. By means of mutual assurance local authorities will be able to save a great <Col N="1636" /> deal of expense which insurance companies are obliged to incur in order to keep their interests before the people. A large amount of canvassing has to be done by their agents.  When the insurance of the property of any local authority becomes open, canvassing is carried on by representatives of the different companies, and evidently there is a good deal of expense incurred in order to secure the business.  I need not point out to Deputy Hewat, who is a business man, that expense of that kind will not be borne by the companies but by the local authorities, and that it is added to the premiums.  I am inclined to think that Deputy Hewat will find himself almost alone in his opposition to the Bill, and while at the present moment I cannot foresee how it is going to work out, it seems to me to be a simple business proposition.  In my opinion re-insurance should not be necessary, because, from my understanding of it, the necessity for re-insurance would be in cases where a company would find itself involved in risks where, owing to some possible catastrophes, it might be called on to pay more than its resources would allow.  The property of local authorities is not likely to be attacked at any time by a catastrophe.  It is not likely that there will be fires in the premises of local authorities all over the country at the one time.  This class of business is not to be compared with the case of an insurance company which might have insured a number of ships which would be involved in a storm in the Atlantic Ocean when two or three might be wrecked.  That would place a responsibility beyond its resources on a company.  I have every confidence that this project will be a success and that it will result in a considerable saving to the ratepayers.  I believe that business interests are not so sacrosanct as to deserve special consideration in a matter of this kind.</P>

      <P>There are two outstanding sections in this Bill. Section 4 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such of the provisions of the Assurance Companies Act, 1909, as relate to deposits under that Act shall not apply with respect to fire <Col N="1637" /> insurance business or employers' liability business carried on by a company which satisfies the Minister for Industry and Commerce that it has complied with all the conditions prescribed by Section 2 of this Act.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with that, Section 2 becomes of importance.  I have brought here, if you will permit me to read them, the sections that are referred to in the Insurance Companies Act of 1909.  In that Act it is provided that if any company or body of persons does insurance of certain classes they must make a deposit&mdash;£20,000 for life insurance, and when fire and accident insurance is carried on, but not insurance against employers' liability. If such a company does not do life business and wants to do fire business, it must forthwith deposit £20,000, and if, further, it is to engage in insurance against liabilities under the Employers Liability Act it must deposit a further £20,000.  Here are the exception clauses.  Section 31 provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Such of the provisions of this Act as relate to deposits to be made under this Act shall not apply where the company is an association of owners or occupiers of buildings or other property which satisfies the Board of Trade that it is carrying on, or is about to carry on, business wholly or mainly for the purpose of the mutual insurance of its members against damage by or incidental to fire caused to the house or other property owned or occupied by them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a similar provision in Section 33 as regards employers' liability. Sub-section (a) provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Act shall not apply where the company is an association of employers which satisfies the Board of Trade that it is carrying on, or is about to carry on, business wholly or mainly for the purpose of the mutual insurance of its members against liability to pay compensation or damages to workmen employed by them either alone or in conjunction with insurance against any other risk incident to their trade or industry.&rdquo; Section 2 of this Bill states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Act applies to every company registered in Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; &amp;c., &ldquo;which complies with <Col N="1638" /> the following conditions, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the objects of the company must be wholly or mainly one or both of the following, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the mutual insurance of its members against damage by or incidental to fire caused to the houses or other property owned or occupied by them, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the mutual insurance of its members against liability to pay compensation or damages to workmen employed by them, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the liability of its members must be limited by guarantee and the amount to be guaranteed by any one member must not exceed ten pounds, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the company must not have a share capital, and</P>
    <P>(d)  all the members of the company must be local authorities.</P>
    <P>These two provisions, taken together, are practically an insistence on the type of insurance to be provided by this combination of local authorities&mdash;this mutual insurance.  It is mutual insurance with a guarantee but without share capital and &ldquo;whatever expenses are incurred&rdquo;&mdash;and of course expenses will be incurred&mdash;&ldquo;by a local authority under the Act are to be defrayed and paid as part of the general expenses of such local authority in the performance of its duties.&rdquo;  So that by this clause all the expenses to incurred, the payment of officials and, in case of re-insurance, the payment of premiums, would also come out of the rates raised by the local authority.  While the Bill is so careful to insist upon mutual insurance, it conveys the impression that, because it speaks of a guarantee, and that each local authority is limited to a guarantee of £10, the total risk incurred by any given local authority is limited to £10.  So that on the face of it, to a superficial observer&mdash;to Deputy Wilson and to Deputy Heffernan&mdash;it appears a highly attractive proposition because, in lieu of the previous method of paying annual premiums to an insurance company, they are, as these <Col N="1639" /> Deputies stated, to pocket the premiums and lead a serene life with the quiet assurance that all is well; if the worst should happen the local authority is limited only to its guarantee of £10, and that is a mere trifle in the finances of a local authority; so again all is well.</P>
    <P>I direct the attention of Deputy Heffernan to a very important judgment of the British courts on this matter. Deputy Heffernan told us that he has not considered the proposals to see how they would work, that he has not gone into the matter at all analytically but, in an airy fashion at the end of his speech, he assured us that he was quite confident the Bill will work out well. He gives this proposal a general benediction while he confesses that he does not understand the measure or how it will operate.  The question I put is: Will this be mutual insurance?  What is mutual insurance, and what does it involve?  Here is a leading case of the Lion Insurance Association v. Tucker, Law Reports, 1883, Queen's Bench Division volume 12, page 176.  That was a Mutual Marine Insurance Company, and its Articles of Association were not very unlike the terms of this Bill.  There was provision for mutual insurance of shipowners, and there was a guarantee.  They were mutual assurers liable amongst themselves for a guarantee to the amount of £5.  That was to cover costs and expenses.  The company was wound up and one of the members claimed that though ships were insured at the time when the company was wound up his total liability was limited to £5.  I would ask the attention of Deputy Wilson and others interested in the well-being of local authorities to the judgment in this case. This Mutual Insurance Company with regard to ships is on all fours with the mutual assurance of property against fire or of each local authority against its liability as an employer.  The court defined the position of a member of a mutual assurance society such as this on page 188 as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no doubt that he (Tucker, the defendant) is a member of the association, but he is something more: he is a person insured <Col N="1640" /> by some of the members of the association, and he is an insurer of some of the members of that association. Therefore he is not only a member, but also an insurer and an assured: he is all three.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not only under this Bill is it contemplated that the local authority would be a member, but it would be insured and an assurer.  What follows?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A member of such an association,&rdquo; the judgment continues, &ldquo;is liable to the full extent of his property for contribution towards the losses which other members may incur by reason of loss of ships insured in the said mutual association, and that liability has no reference to his guarantee at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the law.  Once a local authority under this Bill becomes a member of a mutual insurance society it is more than a mere member, more than an authority insured: it is an insurer and co-insurer, liable to the total extent and to the last shilling and the last article it possesses for losses of the other insured.  This is the proposal that meets with the optimistic assent and the hearty approval of Deputy Heffernan.</P>

      <P>Very good. Then the mutual assurance society, according to that, will only be a society of such local authorities as combine. That lessens whatever value there was in the way of massed assets to provide security.  Deputy Wilson is now giving a formidable argument against the value of the proposal.  It is strange that he omitted that from his speech.  It may be said that this terrible weight of liability may be removed from the shoulders of a local authority or authorities through the simple process of reinsurance.  What does that amount to?  That these county councils and other local authorities are to combine in order to become agents for foreign insurance companies, to take out policies under this and pay premiums upon them with the ratepayer's <Col N="1641" /> money.  Under this Bill insurance and reinsurance by way of paying premiums on policies is quite open.  There is no law prohibiting it, but there is every inducement for the local authority to act as any private citizen would act when he insures his property against fire and himself against employers' liability.  He takes out a policy for the proper amount, pays his premium and is protected.  That is the position of any local authority.  Now, when this association is formed and it seeks to save itself by reinsurance, what is it doing but, by way of reinsurance, repeating the original position&mdash; that is provided it can get other companies to reinsure with.  Anyone who knows how insurance companies deal knows that no tariff company would reinsure them at all except upon such terms as would make their reinsurance exceedingly costly.  The result is that they will have to go abroad, they will have to go to the Continent of Europe, and you will have more exportation of Irish capital and more sending away of Irish money to prevent Irish insurance companies from operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose they do not re-insure, what then?  Some disastrous fire breaks out in one of the buildings of these local authorities.  All the others, thanks to being insurers, must pay up.  That comes out of the ratepayers' money. Will Deputy Heffernan or Deputy Wilson guarantee the country against the outbreak of fire?  No one could do so. What happened in Chicago might happen in any of the towns.  In one night the whole place might be burned out. Deputy Wilson thinks it is a splendid thing to contemplate that possibility and to incur the ensuing liability.  The fact is, there never was any demand for this.  To my mind, it is the worst measure that the Government has introduced, and it is difficult to believe that they are serious in desiring to push it through.  There is not a single solid argument in the name of business that could be urged in favour of it. At one moment we have measures curtailing the powers of local authorities and the next moment we are asked to support a Bill which will give them new power to incur liabilities from which they ought to be exempted if <Col N="1642" /> there was any contrivance for securing that exemption.  The fact is that the Government have no settled policy whatsoever with regard to local authorities.  They have been speaking with two voices.  At one time they are democrats and at another time, in an autocratic spirit, they would suppress local responsibilities.  Now they want to create local responsibility of a financial character and of a terrible nature in point of extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I come under the castigation that Deputy Magennis has aimed at Deputy Heffernan.  I have not given any particular study to this Bill or to its implications, but I have listened to Deputy Magennis and have learned the reasons why he thinks the Dáil should oppose this Bill.  I have listened carefully to his leading case and to the arguments that he has adduced, but I have not heard any arguments in favour of the Bill except those put up by Deputy Heffernan.  I regret I did not follow the arguments that the Minister put forward when introducing the Bill.  Deputy Magennis's argument against the Bill has gone a long way to convince me of its desirability.  I learned that under the law there are responsibilities upon the local bodies who would become members of mutual assurance societies which are practically unlimited: that is to say, the liability is not at all affected by the amount of this guarantee, but being a member of a mutual association each member is responsible to the extent of its full property holding to fulfil its promises&mdash;promises to insure its fellow-members.  The Deputy also gave us some outline of what was meant by insurance, but he distinguished between a mutual assurance society and the tariff companies.  Apparently he is in favour of making this business of insurance purely a financial matter, or rather a private financial matter conducted for the profit of the shareholders of the company.  The idea of mutual help appears to be anathema when it comes to fire or to workmen's compensation insurance: that this is a function that ought to be and must be conducted for private profit and should not be a mutual obligation&mdash;one person <Col N="1643" /> or one local authority with another.  I dissent absolutely from that proposition. Of all the public functions that could be named, outside of public health and the preservation of public health, I think insurance is one that ought to fall upon society, upon the social organisation, whether that is a voluntary association or an inevitable national or municipal association, and to the extent that we proceed towards making this liability for mutual help general, without the intervention of private profit-seekers, I am in favour of that process.  The objections that are given by Deputy Magennis are that inasmuch as it might be difficult to find tariff companies to enter into ordinary business relations with the mutual society composed of local authorities, they would charge too high a rate for the risk they were prepared to run, it would oblige the mutual society to seek its covering insurance abroad and there would be a consequent exportation of Irish capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the alternative?  Are the Irish companies able to bear all the risks that they are running, or do they not export capital?  Is it not inevitable that they shall export capital exactly in the same way that the proposed company would do?  Or is it contended that the companies which we have are able to bear all the liabilities without any reinsurance.  It is certainly not a fact.  They cannot find companies in Ireland sufficient to enable that burden to be borne by Irish companies, and they must export the capital. I am not sure whether it was intended, but I thought there was a reference to the deposit that the ordinary companies were obliged to make, and there was an echo of the notion which many people have, people who are not very observant or analytical, that that deposit is really an assurance to the policy-holders, and that it is of importance they should take it into account.  Well, I think the sooner that notion is dispelled the better.  The value of a deposit of £20,000 is very small indeed. I am afraid when you come to consider the security of the policy-holders it is undoubtedly a fact that insurance companies of all kinds must spend, and I <Col N="1644" /> say waste, a great amount of their revenue in seeking business, and that that money which is wasted, or, if it pleases the Deputies better, which is spent in seeking business, must come from the premiums the policy-holders pay. Surely it is reasonable to say that if an association of public bodies, such as municipal corporations, can come together and say: &ldquo;We are going to bear our own insurance,&rdquo; it is just as valid and economical as for a big steamship company to bear its own insurance, or a big railway company, or the State? Big steamship companies, big corporations, that have a great variety of risks, and a great amount of property in their charge, bear their own insurance, and they do it for economy.  They re-insure special risks, but they do it for economy sake.</P>
    <P>If that is allowable in the case of big private corporations why is it objectionable when we come to public bodies?  Of course I think the real objection to this Bill is that it is decreasing the amount of cash that is available for the business of insurance companies conducted for private profit. But when, as a community, we have allowed this business, a very important social function, to be carried on by individuals and groups of individuals for their profit, I think that we ought to encourage public bodies at least to relieve themselves of the charge, which excessive advertising and excessive commissions, and excessive administration expenses in any direction impose upon the policy-holders and premium-payers. I know nothing about the practice, but I am prepared to say that it would be possible to find companies either in or outside the country quite prepared to relieve this proposed association of some of its risks at reasonable premiums until it is able to bear its own liabilities.  The suggestion of a threat that tariff companies will boycott such an organisation as this can be met, I think, by a grouping together of similar organisations.  I think it is a movement that is distinctly in the right direction, but I shall not be satisfied in regard to this whole question of insurance, certainly for public bodies, and also I hope for private citizens, until the time comes, I hope <Col N="1645" /> not far hence, when fire and workmen's compensation insurance and life insurance will be undertaken by a national organisation not run for private profit. I think that it is the kind of a risk&mdash;I am not speaking now of speculative or betting risks but the ordinary risks of community life&mdash;which should be borne by a national organisation as serving a social purpose and not for profit-seeking, and because this Bill seems to move distinctly in that direction I shall give it my support.</P>

      <P>May I say by way of explanation, that Deputy Johnson gathered from my criticism that mutual help and co-operation are anathema to me.  The reverse is the case.  I am quite as strong, but not as worthy or admirable a champion of these excellent things as Deputy Johnson. There is nothing to prevent an association of local authorities from depositing £20,000 and doing business themselves.  My argument was against their exemption from the necessity of lodging £20,000, because there is no actuarial calculation given on the side of the Government to show that the ratepayers would save, or that the advantages they would get would be provided for them on better terms and more security.  I argued not against permitting local authorities joining together and carrying their own insurance, but against allowing them to do it without lodging money, and without their being in the position to save the ratepayers from an illimitable burden.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the proposal embodied in this Bill has been initiated by the General Council of County Councils.  It is surely time that our public bodies interested themselves in a constructive proposal, such as this, as its operations cannot be but of great economic benefit to the country and, incidentally, a source of substantial relief to the ratepayers.  The General Council of County Councils has been considering a scheme of this kind since 1907, and I understand that the members of that body are now unanimously in favour of this Bill, in the light of the experience which they gained in the intervening years.  The Bill, as I understand it, provides for the absolute control of insurance by public bodies in <Col N="1646" /> the Saorstát, so that, even when the company reaches an assured position of prosperity in the insurance world, there will be no danger of this control being alienated.  Hitherto the public bodies have done more than any other class to build up the prosperity of insurance companies, with the result that, when our Irish companies reached the pinnacle of success English corporation stepped in and gobbled them up. I happened to be a member of the General Council of County Councils in 1923 when a return was asked for by the secretary of that body from the various councils in the Saorstát.  Out of 326 councils, returns were received from 199.  According to these returns it appeared that during a period of eleven years 199 local authorities expended a sum of £79,848 in premiums and recovered £5,796 in losses.  In other words, as the Minister pointed out, the ratio of fire losses to premiums paid-up was only 7.3 per cent.  That shows clearly the enormous profits which the companies make out of the insurance obtained from local bodies, and it also shows the large saving that could be effected if an insurance association, such as that proposed in the Bill, were functioning.  It seems to me that the experiment in England, outlined in the circular letter which has been sent to Deputies by the Secretary of the General Council of County Councils, indicates the degree of success that would attend a similar experiment here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding what Deputy Magennis has said, I fail to see why such a scheme in this country should not be a success, and I feel that public bodies are now in the humour to make it a success.  Like Deputy Johnson, I am not well versed in the intricacies of insurance business, but I understand that the reserve funds of insurance companies are a mere fraction of the risks incurred, so that even the oldest of them must resort to re-insurance, which is, in my opinion, the only safeguard to public bodies in the system of insurance we have.  I do not think that it can be argued that the Bill will interfere with existing Irish insurance companies.  There is no doubt that a mutual insurance association, under the control of public bodies, will at all <Col N="1647" /> times be only too anxious to give preferential treatment as regards re-insurance to Irish companies of proved standing and stability.  I have been associated with a proposal of this kind for a number of years as a member of the General Council of County Councils. I feel that it contains the elements of success, and for that reason I have great pleasure in supporting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is very much to say on the points raised. Deputy Hewat has rather taken exception to my bringing forward such a measure and maintained that it should be a Private Bill, but I think a measure that has the unanimous approval of the General Council of County Councils is pre-eminently the kind of measure that should be dealt with by the Minister for Local Government.  For that reason I felt it incumbent upon me to introduce the Bill.  As regards the merits of the Bill, I think that there can be no doubt that it will work out a highly beneficial measure.  The company or companies formed as a result of the Bill will proceed exactly on the same lines as the English company, which was in all respects a conspicuous success. The risk ratio for the British local authorities in respect of fire insurance is only 16 per cent., and the risk ratio as regards other classes of property for fire insurance is something like 55 per cent.  It is not a case of taking a plunge in the dark.  The way has been already mapped out for us by the English company and we know exactly where we are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, of course, the company that will be formed as a result of this measure will be only able to retain a very small part of the business it will secure.  It will have to re-insure practically <Col N="1648" /> up to 90 per cent. or more of its business, and in that way local authorities will run no undue risk. The funds that the company will have in hands will be able to meet any liability. It is the intention of the company also to re-insure as far as possible with Irish companies, but even at the present time the Irish companies only retain a very small portion of the business they secure from local authorities. They have to re-insure by far the greater portion of that.  As reserve funds are accumulated, the company will be able to carry a larger share of the risk.  Incidentally, I believe that it will probably tend towards giving more business to the Irish companies than they are able to get under present conditions.  I am not insisting upon this as a Government measure, but I think that the general feeling of the House is very much in favour of the principle of the Bill and I commend it heartily to the Dáil.</P>
