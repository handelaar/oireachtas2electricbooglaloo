      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the difficulties of local authorities in their efforts to secure loans for the purpose of building houses; and if, in view of the serious shortage of houses in the various cities and towns in the Saorstát, he would bring forward legislation which would enable the Government to advance loans to local authorities for long periods, so that houses could be let at an economic rent.</P>

      <P>In the present year a Grant in Aid of the Local Loans Fund has been provided up to a limited extent.  Many important sanitary schemes have been in abeyance as the only borrowing facilities have been those afforded by the banks, and the short periods of repayment have involved high repayment charges.  In availing of the Local Loans Fund in the present year priority must be given to schemes shown to be urgently necessary for waterworks and sewerage.  With few exceptions the arrangements made with the banks for housing loans are being maintained.  The Minister recently made representations to the banks concerned with a view to removing the difficulties in these cases.  It is not feasible at present to make advances out of the Local Loans Fund for housing, but even if the Fund were so available it does not follow that lettings at economic rents would be possible having regard to high costs for wages and materials.</P>

      <P>At 10 p.m. on Saturday, 3rd April, the premises of Miss Wallace were searched by three members of the Detective Branch of <Col N="133" /> the Gárda Síochána, on a Search Order under the Firearms Act, 1925.  Miss Wallace was the only occupant of the house when the search was made. Nothing incriminating was found. There is no truth in the allegation that the lady's house has been searched repeatedly, the above occasion being the only time such action was taken.  Miss Wallace is about 35 years of age, and enjoys good health.  She did not present the appearance of a person in delicate health when her premises were searched.  In fact, she was particularly energetic and vehement in her denunciation of the police.  There is no unnecessary attention being paid to the premises.  It is not proposed to search them on any occasion unless the Gárda are in possession of information that would lead them to believe that conduct prejudicial to the safety of the State is being carried on there.</P>

      <P>In the past financial year there were no political events which produced any unfavourable financial or economic reaction.  The elimination of Article 5 of the Treaty relieved the country of a contingent liability which might possibly, at a later stage, have become a serious burden.  During the <Col N="136" /> year the price of National Loan rose gradually and more than once in recent months it has touched the peak figure of 99.  Deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank rose during the twelve months ended 31st March from £2,177,000 to £2,402,000.  In the same period the amount for Savings Certificates rose by nearly £600,000.  The present financial year opened with a debt outstanding of £13,653,270, made up as follows:</P>

    <P>The total thus obtained does not include the liability assumed under the Agreement of December, 1925.  Against the debt outstanding there may be set a figure of £1,267,700 due to the Exchequer by the Unemployment Fund. A couple of years ago I described the sum due by the Unemployment Fund as an asset of doubtful value.  The position now is that there is every prospect of the amount being repaid.  The Exchequer balance on the 31st March, was £233,250.  The State debt outstanding at the beginning of last year was £13,360,353 and the Exchequer balance was £1,681,192.  If we deduct the amount of the Exchequer balance on the 31st March last from the debt outstanding at that date we get a net figure of £13,420,020.  The corresponding figure for the previous year was £11,679,161.</P>
    <P>The original estimate of the tax revenue for the year 1925-26 was £22,554,000.  Deputies will remember, however, that the Budget provisions last year included not only the relief of local rates to the extent of £599,011 and a remission of postal charges, but also the reduction of taxation by £1,189,000.  The revised estimate of tax revenue, therefore, was £21,365,000. The amount actually collected exceeded the estimate by £232,000, reaching a total of £21,597,000.  The yield of the various Customs duties was £6,958,000, or £38,000 more than the estimate.  In the case of the Excise duties the yield was substantially less than the sum anticipated.  The aggregate collected <Col N="137" /> under this heading during the year was £6,336,000, against an estimate of £7,120,000.  The deficiency arose from a decline in the yield of the beer and spirit duties.  In the case of spirits the yield of the Excise duty was £2,347,000, against an estimate of £2,600,000, showing a deficit of £253,000.  As compared with the previous twelve months, the duty collected was down by £349,000.  A substantial portion of the decreased yield of tax was due not to reduced consumption but to anticipation of a decrease in duty and a consequent diminution of the quantities taken out of bond during the last two months of the financial year.  The latter cause reduced the amount of tax paid by £130,000.  In my Budget statement last year I mentioned that the yield of spirit duty in 1924 had fallen short of the estimate by £540,000.  In 1925-26, but for abnormal restriction of the stocks held by traders at the end of the year, it would have been only £123,000 below the estimate and £220,000 below the actual yield of the previous year.  The collection in 1924-25 was less than the collection in 1923-24 by £490,000.  It is apparent that the decline in the consumption of spirits was much less rapid last year than it was the year before. It is calculated that the yield of spirit duty in the present financial year will about equal the actual receipts of last year.  Such a result would of course represent a further decline in consumption to an extent equivalent to £130,000 of duty.  The Excise duty on beer was expected to produce £4,020,000 during the past twelve months.  The sum obtained was £3,449,000, or £571,000 less than the estimate.  As compared with the previous year the decline in yield was £770,000.  Here again an abnormal factor has to be taken into account. During the year certain brewers decided to reduce the amount of stock held as export reserve.  The result was that for some months payments of drawback were normal while receipts of duty were unusually low.  The resultant loss to the Exchequer was about £250,000.  The decline in yield was therefore ascribable to a fall in consumption to the extent of about £520,000.  It is not considered that the <Col N="138" /> sum obtained from beer duty in the present year will be less than the amount actually collected last year. That means that the estimated fall in consumption in the Saorstát will not exceed 50,000 standard barrels against a fall last year of 104,000 standard barrels.  The direct taxes all gave results better than were anticipated. Estate Duty yielded £125,000 more than the estimate.  Income tax and super-tax produced £325,000 more than the estimate, but £245,000 less than in the previous year.  Corporation Profits Tax gave £488,000, or more than double the sum anticipated in the Estimates; but the figure was swollen by a large amount of arrears.  The motor vehicle duties produced £517,000 as against £458,500 in the previous year.</P>
    <P>On the whole the revenue figures are satisfactory.  The duty collected on motor cars and parts was £10,000 more than in 1924-25.  Tobacco yielded £20,000 more than the estimate. Although the scope of the entertainments tax was somewhat restricted last year the amount obtained was down by only £5,000.  The fall in the amount obtained from income-tax and supertax resulted partly from the reduction of the rate from 5/- to 4/- last year and partly from the fact that the pool of arrears is nearing exhaustion.  The sole indication in the revenue returns of serious economic depression in the country is to be found in the figures relating to the beer and spirit duties, and even they show that the people of the Saorstát were able to spare about £17,500,000 for the purchase of alcoholic liquor last year.</P>
    <P>Last year I divided the expenditure set out in the estimates into expenditure which might be defrayed out of revenue and expenditure for which borrowing might take place.  By so doing it was possible to give relief in local and national taxation, including postal charges, to the extent of almost £1,850,000.  This figure allows for the fact that the reduction in the rate of income tax could be only partially effective in the first year.  Consequently the remission announced in April, 1925, will further relieve the taxpayer to the extent of £450,000 or £500,000 this year. The position therefore is that apart altogether from any fall in yield at the <Col N="139" /> existing rate, we are taxing to produce nearly £500,000 less than last year and something like £2,300,000 less than in the year 1924-25.</P>
    <P>In deciding last year that outlay of an abnormal and non-recurrent character, even though it was not, strictly speaking, in the nature of capital expenditure, might properly be provided for by borrowing, the Government was quite clear that it would be an error to pick out all expenditure which was of other than an entirely normal character and add it to the list of items for which debt might be incurred.  It would be possible on a close scrutiny of the Estimates to find in any year a considerable number of sub-heads which were temporarily swollen by some unusual set of circumstances.  By adding together the abnormal amounts shown in all such sub-heads, a substantial sum might be obtained, which, if deducted from the total estimated expenditure of the year, would enable us to calculate the amount required to be raised by taxation at an appreciably reduced figure.  But such a procedure would put us wrong by giving a false result, and would, in a comparatively short time, prejudice very seriously the interests of the State and the people.  Abnormal expenditure under particular heads in one year is likely to be followed by abnormal expenditure of somewhat similar amounts under different heads in the next year.  Moreover, even in the same year unusual costs in one direction are frequently balanced to some extent by exceptional savings in another.  These considerations do not, of course, apply to expenditure such as arises under our Property Losses Compensation Vote, nor to excess Army charges in the first few years after a violent civil struggle.  But if they are not borne in mind in regard to other abnormal spending, the country may find that, without intending to do so, it has begun to pile up debt to meet the ordinary costs of Government.  If such a position were reached it would very speedily produce banking and currency difficulties of a serious character, and it would, for a time at any rate, provide an irresistible inducement to reckless expenditure.  The present <Col N="140" /> Government is not prepared to reduce or keep down taxation by resort to methods which would be unsound and dangerous to national credit and stability.  At the same time, it is fully alive to the necessity of not charging the taxpayer in the coming year with any sums which he might reasonably be allowed to pay by instalments.  We are therefore prepared to cut close to the bone in separating capital and abnormal charges from those which must be met out of current income.  An examination of the Estimates gives us the following list of items that might rightly be deducted from the total for the purpose of arriving at the amount we must pay out of revenue:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A.  Vote 8.&mdash;Local Loans, £500,000 provision in respect of new capital.</P>
    <P>B.  Vote 11.&mdash;Public Works and Buildings, £560,000 out of a total provision of £714,790 in respect of sites and buildings, new works, alterations and additions, £15,000 being the total provision in respect of compensation for commandeered premises, £108,000 the total provision in respect of drainage works and acquisition of a dredger.</P>
    <P>C.  Vote 14.&mdash;Property Losses Compensation, £2,170,500, the entire provision.</P>
    <P>D.  Vote 28.&mdash;Universities and Colleges, £40,000 being capital grants.</P>
    <P>E.  Vote 52.&mdash;Department of Agriculture, £56,800 in respect of the proposed new faculties of General Agriculture in Dublin and Dairy Science in Cork.</P>
    <P>F.  Vote 54.&mdash;Land Commission, £200,000, being that portion of a total provision of £300,000 for the improvement of estates which may fairly be regarded as abnormal.</P>
    <P>G.  Vote 55.&mdash;Advances to Agricultural Credit Societies, £75,000, the whole of the estimate.</P>
    <P>H.  Vote 63.&mdash;Army, £475,470, the amount by which the Army estimate exceeds £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>I.  Vote 64.&mdash;Army pensions, £179,000, being amount by which the provision of £430,000 exceeds the sum expected to be required in a normal year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> J.  Central Fund Services, £50,000. Capital subscription to the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The aggregate of the deductible items under these ten heads is £4,429,770, and I am not satisfied that there are any other items which should be set aside with them.  The provision in this year's Estimates for Relief Works is only £50,000, and I think it would be taking too optimistic a view to hold that we are not likely to have an average expenditure of at least that amount for some years ahead.  If, however, a supplementary estimate for relief works has to be taken before the 31st March next, I think we may agree that the excess sum required should be borrowed.  The provision for housing in the Local Government Vote is very large, £348,000, and there is some support for the contention that £100,000 might be regarded as abnormal.  On the other hand, housing is a great and urgent problem about which no more can be said than that we are making a little impression on it.  On balance it seems preferable to regard the whole provision for housing as normal and recurrent.</P>
    <P>The total estimate of expenditure on supply services is £25,567,909, and on Central Fund services £3,069,519, making an aggregate of £28,637,428.  If from this we deduct £4,429,770, we get an estimated sum of £24,207,658 to be spent on purposes for which the State ought not to borrow.  Deputies have had in their hands the White Paper showing the estimates of Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending 31st March, 1927.  The estimated yield of taxation on the existing basis is there shown at £20,578,000, to which must be added £3,134,430 estimated income from non-tax sources, giving an aggregate of £23,712,430.  If this figure is compared with the estimate of normal recurrent expenditure already arrived at, we get an estimated deficit of £495,228.</P>
    <P>Perhaps at this point I might interpolate a word with reference to last year's figures and certain calculations published by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  I might say that during the past couple of years I have received many helpful suggestions from, and <Col N="142" /> have had many useful discussions with, the Chamber of Commerce, for which I am very thankful.  I just want to point out, however, that the calculations with regard to last year's figures, which they published, unfortunately contain certain omissions which throw them out very seriously.  They give the total of abnormal expenditure last year at £2,678,491.  Now, a portion of that was not really our expenditure; so far as £709,000 of that sum was concerned we simply acted as a conduit pipe, receiving the money from the British.  There are also omissions in regard to the misdivisions of expenditure on public works and buildings.  The expenditure on the abnormal portion of the activities carried on under this vote was something like £200,000 less than the sum shown; so that at once there may be deducted from the £1,890,000 odd shown in the table prepared by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, a sum of £900,000 odd.  I had a few moments' conversation with the members of the Sub-Committee, and as our conversation was too brief sufficiently to go into matters that we were dealing with, a certain misunderstanding occurred.  I do not say that any abnormal expenditure has been incurred out of normal revenue.  As a matter of fact, the £900,000 which I referred to as abnormal expenditure defrayed out of revenue was fully covered by abnormal revenue contained in the income tax vote alone.</P>
    <P>I was at the point where I said that on a calculation already made we got an estimated deficit of £495,228.  Before deciding whether it is necessary to increase taxation we have to consider whether it is likely that the total of £24,207,658 will all be required for actual expenditure in connection with those services for which we must provide out of revenue.  Experience shows that even estimates containing no sub-heads devoted to special or abnormal objects often prove at the end of the year to have been appreciably in excess of requirements.  With the closest estimation that could ever be looked for, the margin of excess on the supply services as a whole would not be negligible. There are 66 Votes comprising 529 sub-heads of expenditure.  It is the <Col N="143" /> duty of a Department in framing its estimate to ask under each sub-head for sufficient money to provide for the purpose of the sub-head and more particularly it is its duty to ask for a total sum sufficient to meet the probable expenditure from the Vote as a whole. The idea is that neither should the Dáil have to be asked for a supplementary sum nor should any great percentage of the Vote remain unexpended. In practice some Votes prove insufficient and some prove too ample. But Departments naturally and not improperly lean against putting down a figure that may involve bringing in a supplementary estimate.  Some of our Departments have not yet been able to estimate as closely as would be desirable. In consequence, the substantial marginal sum which the supply estimates in the aggregate must always contain is at present somewhat swollen. In Great Britain no account is taken for budgeting purposes of this marginal sum.  The system there is to use the realised surplus of the year for the reduction of debt.  Any portion of the surplus due to the margin of overestimation goes with the rest.  Our position requires different treatment. We have a comparatively small National Debt with already adequate sinking fund provisions.  It is neither necessary nor desirable in our circumstances that the taxpayer should be obliged to provide anything additional towards keeping our debt total at an abnormally low level.  In the opinion of the Executive Council it is absolutely sound in principle when we are trying to get at the amount of revenue required to deduct from the estimate of recurrent expenditure such amount as probably represents the margin of over-estimation.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult, owing to the number of new services that have been undertaken since the establishment of the Free State and the abnormal conditions under which Departments have been working until comparatively recently, to arrive at a figure.  I am satisfied, however, that the margin of over-estimation, together with such economies as may safely be counted on, <Col N="144" /> will not be less than £650,000.  Such a figure would seem to indicate the possibility of a small amount being available for minor reliefs in taxation.  But account must be taken of two unfavourable factors which have not yet been mentioned.  As the Exchequer balance is now very low, it must be anticipated that borrowing in some form will soon have to be undertaken, and that the greater part of the £4,429,770, estimated to be required for capital and abnormal expenditure, will actually have to be got from the banks or the public before 31st March next.  Consequently the provision made in the estimate for Central Fund Services for interest and sinking fund will have to be exceeded. On the other hand the revenue collected is almost certain to fall short substantially of the estimate shown in the White Paper.  A new arrangement, which I shall explain later, is being adopted in regard to double income tax relief.  The change-over from the old system to the new will involve delays in collection of this year's tax.  Consequently, although it is expected that the old arrears will be almost completely wiped off this year, certain new arrears will arise and thereby bring the yield of tax down below the estimate in the White Paper.  Taking everything into consideration, it is fairly clear that while we need not increase taxation we would not be justified in reducing it.</P>
    <P>It must be obvious to Deputies that there can be no question of gambling on the yield of taxation being better than the estimate.  Hitherto we have had excess yields of income tax, because arrears were got in more rapidly than was expected, but now the pool is near exhaustion and rapid collection will only mean that we will get more in the earlier part of the year and less in the latter.  Estimation of the yield of beer and spirit duties at the figure actually collected last year hardly errs on the side of conservatism.  On the other hand it is not possible to reduce tax rates in anticipation of steam-saw economies.  I do not want at this point to deal at great length with questions of expenditure.  I should like, however, to repeat my statement of last year that economies in the public services can only be effected by detailed restriction and adjustment and by gradual <Col N="145" /> simplification of machinery.  I should add that they can be effected very slowly indeed in face of a persistent popular demand for new services and further State activity.</P>
    <P>The institution of new services not only means that additional expenditure is incurred, but it also means that officers whose special business it is to restrict expenditure have their energies diverted from pruning the old services to merely checking the growth of the new.  The new services that have been undertaken since the Free State was established were essential, because under the old regime so many of the things that ought to have been done long ago were left undone.  The point, however, has now been reached when even very desirable and much-desired developments must be postponed to the task of tightening up the existing machine. At the same time it cannot be too clearly stated that any appreciable reduction in tax-rates can be brought about only by increased national productivity. This time next year the yield of income tax at 4/- will have to be estimated at from £750,000 to £1,000,000 lower than I am estimating it for the purpose of this Budget.  The probable yield of the various protective duties will also have to be put much lower next year than now.  In view of these facts it will be a great accomplishment merely to keep taxes at their present level next year.  If Deputies will consider the objects on which State expenditure takes place, they will see that while certain small reductions in expenditure can be suggested easily enough and ought not to be neglected, the big reductions that would give relief of any importance to the taxpayer are hard to find.  I have already indicated £24,207,658 as the estimate of normal recurrent expenditure for the year.  Let us look for a moment at some of the heads under which that sum is paid out.  The amount to be paid out in relief of local rates, including Road Fund grant, is estimated at £2,510,000.  Debt charges, including payments to the British Government in respect of local loans, will absorb £1,660,150; old age pensions, £2,557,300; superannuation, £1,800,326; police, £1,517,074; education, not including <Col N="146" /> universities and colleges, £4,319,503; Post Office, £2,462,850; Army, £2,000,000; and revenue, £698,980.  The aggregate estimated expenditure under these nine heads is £19,526,189, and it is a total which does not seem susceptible of any very rapid reduction.  The figure representing grants to local authorities leaves out of account very substantial sums paid in respect of child-welfare schemes and the treatment of tuberculosis.  The amount required for debt charges will increase as fresh borrowing is effected.  Superannuation payments will probably increase in consequence of the so-called economy campaign.</P>
    <P>As the Gárda Síochána is composed mainly of young men who are at low points on their incremental scales, the cost will increase for a number of years. Education costs will probably increase somewhat.  In view of the dearth of suitable candidates for training as teachers, salaries cannot economically be further reduced.  The increased expenditure which compulsory attendance will entail will exceed anything that can be saved by súch economies as amalgamation of schools.  Post Office wages are low, and any big fall in total expenditure can hardly be expected. Revenue staffs cannot be reduced, and if there were new protective tariffs they might have to be increased.  Army expenditure may be brought a little below £2,000,000, but until the country is settled enough to admit of a militia system being established, it cannot be very greatly less than the figure mentioned. The position broadly is that, out of the remaining figure of £4,681,469 we must, as well as affording relief to the taxpayer, provide for the services of Government represented by 49 out of our 66 Votes.  Out of this figure we have to provide for the Oireachtas, Ministry of Finance, Public Works and Buildings, Office of Public Works, Rates on Government Property, Stationery Office, Valuation Office, Law Charges.  Beet Sugar Subsidy, Universities and Colleges, Ministry of Justice, Prisons, all the Courts and all Judicial Salaries and Pensions, Ministry of Local Government, National Health Insurance, Department of Agriculture, Land Commission, Ministry of Industry <Col N="147" /> and Commerce, Ministry of Fisheries, Army Pensions, Ministry of External Affairs, and all the minor services.  Anybody who can provide adequately for all these services out of £4,683,000, and at the same time devote over four, three, or even two millions to the relief of taxation, owes it to humanity to make himself known.  There is an idea abroad that the way to reduce taxation is to reduce the salaries of higher civil servants.  Without discussing questions of efficiency or Treaty rights, I shall say a word or two about the financial aspect of the matter.  If all civil servants whose salaries, including bonus, are £500 and over&mdash;that is basic salaries of £330&mdash;suffered a 20 per cent. cut, the saving would be nominally £180,000.  If, in addition, the civil servants whose salaries, including bonus, are £750 and over, suffered a further 20 per cent. cut, making a total cut in their case of 40 per cent., there would be a further nominal saving of £86,000, or a total of £266,000.  But the reduction of salaries would mean a reduction in income tax yield amounting to something very near £50,000.  So that the real saving to the State would be about £216,000, representing a relief in taxation equal to almost a ¼d. in the lb. on sugar.</P>
    <P>Whatever economies may be effected during the year, there is clearly no prospect of savings of such a sensational character as would justify refusal to accept the estimated total required for recurrent expenditure as the figure upon which our taxation provisions must be based.  Therefore, the changes in taxation which we recommend have not for their object a reduction of the sums to be taken into the Exchequer.  But we hope that some of them will be welcome at least to some tax-payers if not to others.  The most important of them relates to a very vexed matter.</P>
    <P>The difficulties arising out of double taxation of incomes have been the subject of discussion since the Saorstát became a distinct fiscal unit in April, 1923.</P>
    <P>The income tax code which we inherited provides for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The taxation of all income accruing to any person resident in <Col N="148" /> the area of jurisdiction wherever such income arises, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the taxation of all income arising within the jurisdiction to any person wherever resident.</P>
    <P>In consequence, directly the Saorstát became a separate fiscal unit, double taxation became operative in the case of income arising in Great Britain to a Saorstát resident and also in the case of income arising in the Saorstát to a British resident.</P>
    <P>Owing to the introduction of income taxes into the fiscal systems of several of the overseas Dominions the British legislature had, in 1916, granted a measure of relief from United Kingdom income tax to any person who proved that he had also paid &ldquo;any colonial income tax&rdquo; in respect of the same part of his income.  Following the report of the last Royal Commission on the income tax a more comprehensive system of relief in respect of income which was liable both to United Kingdom income tax and to Dominion income tax was enacted in Section 27 of the Finance Act, 1920.</P>
    <P>Early in 1923 we were faced with the necessity of effecting an immediate arrangement with the British Government for double income tax relief, and it was practically inevitable that the arrangement concluded should follow the lines of the British scheme embodied in the 1920 Act for the following reasons:&mdash;(1) The British authorities were at that time unwilling to consider an arrangement on any other basis, and (2) the matter was too urgent to permit of any prolonged consideration of alternative schemes. Double income tax was being levied as from the 6th April, 1923, and a scheme of relief had to be evolved at once.</P>
    <P>The agreement with regard to income tax embodied in the Double Taxation Relief Order (No. 1 of 1923) was accordingly concluded.  It was never regarded by the Saorstát Government as being a completely satisfactory arrangement, because whilst in the vast bulk of cases it did give complete relief from double income tax the procedure was necessarily complicated, and it was very difficult for the individual taxpayer to understand the technicalities which were inherent in the system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> In September, 1921, the Financial Committee of the League of Nations, which was entrusted with the study of double taxation, decided to ask certain economists to prepare a report on the matter.  Four eminent economists&mdash; Professor Bruins (Commercial University, Rotterdam), Professor Senator Einaudi (Turin University), Professor Seligman (Columbia University, New York), and Sir Josiah Stamp, K.B.E. (London University)&mdash;were invited to undertake the work, and their report, which was submitted in April, 1923, will be found in the League of Nations Booklet (E.F.S.  73 F. 19) published by the League, a copy of which I have caused to be put in the Library.</P>
    <P>In April, 1925, I wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer suggesting that arrangements be made for the Revenue authorities on both sides to get into touch with each other and explore the question of double taxation afresh in the light of the report of the economists to the League of Nations.  This suggestion was adopted and I informed the Dáil in the course of the debate on the Report Stage of the Financial Resolutions on the 6th May, 1925.  Since then the matter has been receiving the close attention of the Revenue authorities on both sides and the result is the agreement which will be placed in the hands of Deputies to-day.</P>
    <P>In concluding their report the Committee of Economists appointed by the League of Nations state:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the subject of income taxation in its developed form, the reciprocal exemption of the non-resident... is the most desirable practical method of avoiding the evils of double taxation and should be adopted wherever countries feel in a position to do so.&rdquo; (Booklet, p. 51.)</P>
    <P>The new agreement to which the House will be asked to give legislative effect in the Finance Act is based on this principle.  It aims, in fact, at the avoidance of double taxation as far as possible and in this respect differs radically from the existing arrangement under which double taxation is accepted, but each country gives partial relief from its own tax.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangement, a person <Col N="150" /> who, for any year, is resident in the Saorstát, but not resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, will be entitled to claim exemption from British income tax in respect of income arising in that year in Great Britain or Northern Ireland and, conversely, a person resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, and not resident in the Saorstát will be entitled to claim exemption from Saorstát income tax in respect of income arising in that year in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>As a corollary a person exempted in either country will be chargeable to tax in the other country to the extent of the full income exempted subject, of course, to the usual deductions and allowances.</P>
    <P>For example, the Bank of Ireland, which at present pays both British income tax and Saorstát income tax (less double taxation relief) on a large part of its profits, will, under the new arrangement, be chargeable to Saorstát tax only.  It will deduct Saorstát tax at the full standard rate from its dividends, and a Northern shareholder who is not resident in the Saorstát will be entitled to claim from the Saorstát revenue repayment of the full tax deducted from his dividends by the bank. He will be liable to return the dividends for assessment to British income tax in the ordinary course, and no question of double income tax relief will arise.</P>
    <P>There remains the case of a person who, within the meaning of the Income Tax Acts, is in any year resident both in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, and in the Saorstát.  The case of these people is dealt with in Article 2 and Article 3 (c) of the agreement.  The broad principle, stated roughly, is that such a person should be assessed in each country on the whole of his income, as if he were resident in that country only, and that double income tax relief, to the extent of the lower of the two taxes, should be given, such relief being borne equally by the two Exchequers.</P>
    <P>The administrative arrangements to give effect to the scheme are still under consideration.  I would call the attention of Deputies to the provisions of Article 5 of the agreement, which authorises the Revenue authorities on <Col N="151" /> both sides to make arrangements for carrying out the agreement and in particular to make such arrangements as may be practicable to avoid the collection of both British and Saorstát income tax on the same income without allowance for any relief due under the agreement.  At the moment I am not in a position to give detailed information as to the arrangements beyond saying that we contemplate the setting up of a clearing house to give all possible assistance in the case of double residents, and also to facilitate the settlement of disputed claims by single residents.  It will, I hope, be possible to give more detailed information by the time the Finance Bill is in the hands of Deputies, and I will consider the practicability of having an explanatory memorandum as to the new arrangement circulated at the same time as the Bill.  Deputies will understand that in the meantime it is not possible for me to give detailed information concerning matters which are still under discussion with the British authorities.</P>
    <P>Just a word as to the financial results of the new arrangement.  On the one hand we give up the revenue we at present obtain from companies controlled in England in respect of profits earned here, and generally we give up tax on income arising in the Saorstát to British residents, who are not resident in the Saorstát.  On the other hand, we get full tax, instead of part tax, from our own residents who are not also resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland on the whole of the income arising from their investments in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  The probable effect on our Exchequer of the whole arrangement has been given careful and prolonged consideration, and it is calculated that the result to our revenue will be to leave us approximately where we are at present.</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that in other respects the scheme will give us very substantial advantages.  It will be much more convenient to administer.  It will eliminate a great deal of the irritation incidental to the present system, and it will do away with the hardship which the present system admittedly inflicts <Col N="152" /> on the smaller shareholders in Guinness's and one or two other companies. Finally, we hope that, after the initial difficulties and the difficulties incidental to the change over from one system to the other have been overcome, it will enable us to create the nucleus of a staff to take in hand the question of income tax evasion in the Saorstát, thereby resulting in a substantial gain to the Exchequer, and a more equitable administration of the tax as between one citizen and another.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the residence basis for charging income tax makes it necessary in the view of the Executive Council to follow the changes made in the British Finance Bill last year in regard to the rates of estate duty and super-tax. The position at present is that on estates valued from £12,500 to £500,000 our rates of death duty are from 1 per cent. to 6 per cent. lower than the rates in force in Great Britain.  For instance, an estate valued at £19,000 would bear duty in the Saorstát at the rate of 6 per cent.; in Great Britain the rate would be 8 per cent.  An estate of £60,000 would pay 11 per cent. here and 16 per cent. in England.  At the top of the scale the difference falls to 2 per cent.  It is not proposed to follow the British scale up to its maximum of 40 per cent., but merely to substitute 27 per cent. for our present maximum of 25 per cent.  At present our super-tax scale is distinctly stiffer on incomes up to £10,000 than the British scale. The first £500 liable to super-tax pays at the rate of 1/6 here and at the rate of 9d. in England.  The next £1,000 pays at the rate of 2/- here and 1/- in England.  Our scale and the British scale were the same until last year, except that our maximum rate was 4/6 while the British maximum ran up to 6/-.</P>
    <P>When the two taxes were changed in Great Britain it was calculated that the revenue position would not be affected. It was considered, however, that there were economic advantages in taking smaller annual sums from people who had incomes of from £2,000 to £10,000, even though the deficiency had to be made up by taking, at longer intervals, from the same class of people, much larger sums in the form of death duties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> So far as we are concerned it is not necessary to consider the relative theoretical merits of estate duties and super-tax as methods of obtaining from people of substantial means a proper contribution towards the maintenance of State services.  Since the setting up of the Saorstát it has been generally recognised that to have a higher rate of income tax than that prevailing in England was likely to have a deleterious effect upon the economic position of the Saorstát by causing people of wealth to quit the country altogether. In the past a person could not escape the Saorstát tax by merely taking the boat to Holyhead.  He had also to dispose of all his property here. Under the new arrangement he has simply to get right out and he will become exempt from our tax.  People who are at present regarded as resident both in Ireland and England are generally, or perhaps in all cases, super-tax payers.  In most cases they are not bound to the Saorstát by professional or business ties, and it would be easy for them to cease to be resident here. In all the circumstances we are satisfied that to maintain a super-tax scale substantially higher than that in existence in Great Britain would, of itself, in the long run, involve a loss to the Exchequer. On the other hand, we shall not prejudice the interests of the Exchequer or drive people out of the country by bringing our estate duties up to the level adopted in England last year.  At present our lower rates involve us in substantial loss under the arrangement for the relief of double taxation as it applies to estate duty. If a person domiciled in the Saorstát dies leaving an estate of which five-sixths is situated in Great Britain, we get tax on the whole estate, but allow relief to the extent of the entire British tax paid on the five-sixths of the estate situated in Great Britain.  Prior to last year's British Finance Act our rate on the whole of the estate was higher than the British rate on their part of the estate, and, accordingly, our share of the total tax paid was always greater proportionately than the part of the estate situated in the Saorstát.  During the past year the British rate on their portion of the estate of a person who had died domiciled in Saorstát Eireann <Col N="154" /> was sometimes equal to or actually higher than the Saorstát rate on the whole estate.  Thus it has occurred that our share of the tax in certain cases has actually been has proportionately than the part of the estate situated here.</P>
    <P>In the case of all estates within the limits of value to which the charge applied we are now obliged to give greater relief than previously at an estimated annual cost of £40,000 to £50,000.  Let us now turn to the estates of persons dying domiciled in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, and leaving property situated in Saorstát Eireann.  The arrangement is that the British authorities charge duty on the whole estate while we charge on the portion situated here.  The result of our rate of duty being lower is not that the estate pays less, but that the claim against the British authorities for relief is less.</P>
    <P>Examination of the figures of last year and the year before made it possible to estimate with a considerable degree of certainty the effect upon the Revenue of adopting the present British scales for super-tax and estate duty.  The reduction of the super-tax rates will involve a loss of income of £115,000 per annum.  The increased estate duties will bring in an additional £200,000 per annum.  This leaves a balance of £85,000, which it is proposed to use in relief of the burden of Corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>I explained in last year's Budget statement that we could not propose the abolition of the Corporation profits tax at any rate until some scheme had been devised which would give us a fair equivalent of an average yield of estate duty in respect of property owned by foreign companies in the Saorstát.  On the other hand, it is recognised that the Corporation profits tax does not tend to check the investment of capital in industrial enterprises in the Saorstát.  It is proposed in the forthcoming Finance Bill to increase the tax free allowance for the purpose of Corporation profits tax from £1,000 to £10,000.  The adoption of this proposal will have the effect of reducing the number of companies <Col N="155" /> liable to Corporation profits tax from 676 to 91.  The loss of revenue will be £85,000 a year.  The exemption of railway companies and certain other public utility companies from Corporation profits tax expires this year.  It is proposed to renew the concession.</P>
    <P>I promised last year in the course of the discussions on the Finance Bill that the question of the application of protective tariffs to agricultural products would be further considered.  I may say that during the past twelve months the promise has been most amply fulfilled.  The matter was approached in a most sympathetic spirit and various proposals for tariffs were examined.  Suggestions had been put forward from various quarters that agriculture in the Saorstát might be assisted by tariffs on flour, bacon, butter, oatmeal, oats and even maize, and also, needless to say, on malting barley.  Some of these suggestions, obviously, were not difficult to deal with.  The suggested tax on oatmeal, though of comparatively small importance having regard to the value of imports, was one which we felt would benefit agriculture in some areas.  We propose therefore to impose a Customs duty of 2/6 per cwt. on this commodity. The yield of tax is expected to be small, perhaps £12,000.  Mills which would otherwise be in danger of closing down will be kept going, and about 300 extra hands employed. Farmers will be given a market for an additional 20,000 tons of oats.  The proposal for the taxation of imported bacon was recognised to be one in favour of which certain good arguments could be advanced, and it was gone into at great length.  The Government is satisfied, however, that in refusing to propose a tariff in this case it is acting in accord with the economic interest of the people.  We are convinced that a tariff on bacon would not improve the farmers' prices or increase pig-production.  The suggested tax on oats was not agreed to, because it would have had to be charged on seed oats as well as other oats.  Of the other proposals I need only say that they did not seem likely to be of any advantage to agriculture.</P>
    <P>We have not included in this Budget <Col N="156" /> any proposals for protective tariffs on manufactured goods.  In taking this line we are adhering to the declaration of policy which I made on behalf of the Executive Council last year.  It seems to us to be clearly undesirable to commit the country to a policy of all-round protection in advance of a general election. It would be even more undesirable to drift along imposing one series of protective duties after another, until we found that without definite design we had created a general tariff.  The present tariffs are, I think, looked upon by all sections of the House as experiments which are entitled to a fair chance, and I believe that no matter what change of parties might result from a General Election, a new Dáil would almost unanimously agree that they must be given a further run of, say, eight or ten years.  If, however, a great number of additional duties were imposed this year and next, the position would be changed, and even manufacturers who are investing money on the strength of the existing tariffs, would not be able to feel sure that whatever happened politically their industries were safe for a reasonable period of years.  For this reason, and because as further tariffs are added they would give a diminishing return, it is certain that additional tariffs imposed now would not give a proportionate increase in development and employment.  It is perhaps advisable to say once again that the tendency of tariffs is to increase the cost of living. When a new industry is developed by means of tariffs, it is developed generally speaking, at the expense of the public.  We believe that it is worth while incurring expense to initiate, develop and preserve manufacturing industries in this country; but we believe that with the present depressed state of agriculture it is necessary to hesitate before heaping expense upon expense. In the months immediately before a Budget, the majority of our manufacturers show great zeal and ability in trying to prove that they cannot possibly carry on without a tariff.  It is impossible to help feeling that in some cases at least if they were as strenuous about producing and selling the right class of goods, they would not need to trouble about protective duties.  When <Col N="157" /> we said last year that our policy was to have no more tariffs until we had some sort of mandate from the people, we hoped that some of those who had been besieging us without effect would turn back to their factories and see what they could do for themselves.  I know at least one case in which a manufacturer, who said that he would be driven out of business if he did not get protection, and to whom we turned a deaf ear, has managed, unaided, to hold his ground against foreign competition, and even to improve his position a little.  We want it to be got out of the heads of a great many manufacturers that the natural and only way out of an industrial difficulty is a new tariff, by means of which the public will be made to pay.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we are prepared to admit that at present conditions in trade and industry are abnormal, that there may be Irish manufacturers who are in danger of being overwhelmed because of difficulties arising from world disturbances of an economic character.  We do not wish to take up a coldly puristic attitude about any industry.  While we are determined not to be rushed by a clamour into great extensions of our existing list of protected industries, we are prepared to concede that there may be cases in which it would not be wise or right to hold our hand for another two years. A particular industry may be beset by such special and peculiar dangers that there is grave risk of its being lost for want of a comparatively small measure of help promptly given.  We admit that in such a case the value of the industry as a national asset should be weighed against the probable cost of saving it and a decision taken on the merits.  Accordingly, we propose to set up a Tariff Commission, to which proposals for protective tariffs will be submitted. The Commission will hear evidence for and against every proposal which it investigates.  Its proceedings will be public.  Having explored the facts fully it will report to the Government upon the need of a tariff for the preservation of the particular industry, upon the amount of protection that would be required, upon the results which the imposition <Col N="158" /> of a tariff would have on other industries and on the cost of living.  Having received the report of the Commission recommending a tariff, the Government would, if it were satisfied that such a course was expedient in the general interest, submit to the Dáil a resolution imposing the necessary tax.  As the evidence before the Commission would enable the public to form a pretty good idea of what its report was likely to be, a tax would seldom be proposed in respect of which there had not already been extensive speculative forestalling. It would be possible, therefore, to ignore the revenue effects of any duty in the first year.  Consequently it is intended that reports of the Tariff Commission with which the Government found itself able to agree, should be acted upon as they were presented, whatever the period of the year.  Under the suggested arrangement the Executive Council would not part with its responsibility for policy.  It would not be bound to accept any recommendation of the Commission.  At the same time it is clear that if the Commission forwarded a recommendation supported by published evidence in favour of a tax, the Executive Council would have to have very strong grounds for declining to bring the necessary proposals before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Before passing away from the question of protective tariffs I must refer to the Customs duty on motors and motor parts.  Deputies, I am sure, are aware that, following the British decision of last year to re-impose what are called the McKenna duties, representations reached the Executive Council to the effect that it was essential to the success of the Ford industry in Cork that some arrangement should be reached with the British Government whereby motor parts manufactured in the Saorstát should be admitted free of duty into England.  I need hardly say that we were, and are, most anxious that an important industry, unique of its kind in the Saorstát, should be facilitated in every way.  The representations made to us were sympathetically considered and the possibilities of the position were thoroughly explored.  It became apparent, at an early stage in our examination of the <Col N="159" /> matter, that the only basis on which we might hope to get what those who spoke on behalf of the Ford Company wished for was the reciprocal exemption from duty of Saorstát and British motors on their entry into Great Britain and Saorstát Eireann respectively. After many months of consideration the Executive Council felt compelled to decide that the basis was not one which they could recommend to the Dáil.  It would have involved the ultimate loss of most of the £300,000 annual revenue derived from the import duties on motors.  It would also have involved some unemployment by worsening the conditions under which firms engaged in the production of commercial or other motor bodies are carrying on.</P>
    <P>If the Executive Council have felt unable to adopt measures which would relieve the only motor industry in the Saorstát from difficulties which the taxation of another country has placed upon it, we feel that now the time has certainly come when anything in our own scheme of taxation which can be said to operate unfairly in relation to the Ford car should be removed.  In my last Budget statement it was indicated that the basis of the road tax was being examined with a view to revision. It was hoped at the time that an early decision would be reached.  But the subject is full of difficulties, and the much-desired equitable basis is very hard to find.  The proposal suggested by the Sub-Committee of the Roads Advisory Committee did not commend itself to the Government.  It involved the retention of the horse-power tax at a reduced rate and the addition of a petrol tax.  It represented what I may call an unhappy compromise.  There are many who favour feeding the Road Fund from a petrol tax alone.  Such a policy would involve a tax of about 1/- a gallon on petrol.  I do not know whether there are other countries which tax petrol at such a rate, but the State Chemist is of opinion that if such a high duty were contemplated it would be necessary to investigate further the possibilities of evasion by means of split cargoes or by the use of special grades of kerosene or lighting oil <Col N="160" /> which it might become profitable to import. A proper examination of the subject could be carried out only by chemists and engineers working together. But even if we were sure that we had a specification which would include all spirits capable of being economically used to drive a car, and at the same time exclude kerosene, it must be acknowledged that a high petrol tax has many disadvantages.  It would involve expense and difficulties in connection with drawbacks, which would not be refused to people using petrol for lighting, driving stationary engines, or boats, or for any purpose other than propelling road vehicles. On the Border it would give rise to additional customs formalities and delays. With a tax of anything like a shilling a gallon it would not be possible to ignore the petrol in the tanks of cars entering the Saorstát.  Moreover, the petrol tax, like the horse-power tax on its existing basis, would be unfair to the Ford car.  In view of all the considerations I have mentioned, we have decided not to propose a petrol tax.  A road tax based on the unladen weight of vehicles was suggested and seems to have certain advantages.  But data are not at present available to enable a clear opinion to be formed as to how it would work out in practice.  In considering various suggestions for changes in the road tax, the Executive Council kept in mind the desirability of some increase in the revenue of the Road Fund and some consequent relief to local rates.</P>
    <P>Finally, proposals were formulated which, if accepted by the Dáil, will at once relieve the Ford car from its handicap, compel the heavier commercial vehicles to pay a substantially increased tax, and provide an enhanced annual sum for road improvement.  The horse-power basis will be retained. Private cars and hackneys, other than 'buses and char-a-bancs, which have been manufactured in Saorstát Eireann will bear a maximum tax of £10 per annum.  In the case of other cars the formula for calculating horse-power in use prior to January, 1923, will again be adopted.  This will mean in most cases an increase of the tax to the extent of 15% to 20%.  The minimum <Col N="161" /> charge will be increased from £6 to £8. Hackneys up to a capacity of six seats will be taxed as private cars but with a maximum of £20.  Goods vehicles, 'buses and char-a-bancs will be charged on a new, and in the case of the latter, a more steeply graduated scale as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The proposed new scale, which is only slightly different from that recently adopted in Northern Ireland, will give an increase of about 50 per cent, in the total revenue from the class of vehicles to which it applies.  The tax on trailers to goods vehicles will be increased from £2 to £12.  Finally, the charge for drivers' licences will be increased from 5/- to 20/- per annum. The new charges will increase the annual gross income of the Road Fund by about £133,000 up to a total of £673,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> I now come to deal with what has been designated the &ldquo;road problem.&rdquo; It is a healthy sign to find that the public generally have evinced a marked degree of interest in our roads, but it is necessary to clear up some misapprehension which apparently has arisen as a consequence of vigorous propaganda.  The belief that the roads of the Saorstát are in an unsatisfactory condition is not correct. Compared with other countries, the principal roads of the Saorstát are, in fact, in a fairly satisfactory state.  One of the evidences of the rapid return to normality has been the great progress made in the re-conditioning and re-surfacing of our highways.</P>
    <P>While devoting themselves to this work, road authorities here, as elsewhere, have necessarily to take cognisance of the fundamental change in road user, arising from the expansion of mechanically-propelled traffic.  The adoption of entirely new standards of road construction and maintenance has been necessitated.</P>
    <P>The total cost for county roads in 1914 amounted to £695,000, all but £25,000 of which fell to the charge of the local ratepayers.  At the present time the cost is £1,750,000, of which £500,000 represents the contribution from motor taxation.</P>
    <P>When it is remembered that the total mileage of roads in the Saorstát amounts to 46,700 miles, it cannot be held that an expenditure of 1¾ millions is an excessive amount.  We hope, however, that in a year or so, the annual revenue of the Road Fund may run to £750,000 or over, and that by a suitable policy of reconstruction and improvement the cost of maintenance may fall, and the local ratepayers be appreciably relieved.</P>
    <P>It is, no doubt, within the recollection of the Dáil that the Department of Local Government submitted a proposition to involve expenditure on 1,500 miles of trunk roads of £3,820,000. This proposal would, of course, involve a borrowing policy.  In the present circumstances no portion of a loan repayment should fall on the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>I understand that those who are most intimately conversant with the facts relating to modern methods of road <Col N="163" /> construction and surfacing find it difficult to speak authoritatively as to the savings to result in future maintenance. But it is manifest that the re-conditioning of important roads, both as regards foundations and surfacing, will produce very considerable economy.</P>
    <P>To capitalise the Road Fund fully would mean that over a period of years the cupboard would be left completely bare for the purpose of a large mileage of our roads which although not of first importance are much too important to be completely ignored.  It is felt, however, that a sum of £2,000,000 might be borrowed for reconstruction and improvement work of a somewhat lasting nature.  This would involve an annual charge for ten years of £310,000. Such a figure, especially as it would decrease year by year, would leave a sufficient annual sum available for distribution on the same principles as heretofore.  The details of a scheme of expenditure of the sum of £2,000,000 will now be a matter for determination by the Minister for Local Government. I hope I interpret his views correctly in stating that he has no intention of announcing any grandiose proposals. Capital expenditure will be cautiously undertaken.  The exact condition and life of existing road surfaces will be determined, the aim being to bring the 1,500 miles of roads already mentioned into a generally satisfactory condition for modern traffic.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government will be in a position to proceed with a substantial proportion of the work within a very short time.  He anticipates that having regard to the recent additions to road plant, schemes can now be initiated much more rapidly than heretofore, and there is reasonable expectation that within the present financial year a sum in advance of at least £1,000,000 may be reached.</P>
    <P>During the last few months strong appeals have been made to the Government to reduce the excise duties on beer and spirits.  I can say that though the case presented was not unsympathetically considered we cannot see our way to recommend any change. As the brewing industry is one of the biggest and most profitable industries <Col N="164" /> in the country, and as Irish distilling is suffering from the loss of the major part of its outside markets, it seems impossible to reduce the duty on beer and leave the spirit duty untouched as was done in England.  On the other hand, it would be indefensible to reduce the spirit duty and leave the beer duty at its present level.  If a reduction were decided on, it ought to apply to both taxes, and to be of any use at all it would have to be a substantial reduction. It is not believed that reductions which would result in stout being brought down to 6d. and whiskey being retailed at 3d. or 4d. a glass less than at present, would bring about any appreciable increase in consumption.  Consequently the loss in revenue would not be far short of £1,400,000.  This sum would have to be got by fresh taxes levied on articles of necessity whereas both beer and spirits are mainly articles of luxury.  It would, it appears to the Executive Council, be indefensible to take steps such as reimposing the teaduty and increasing the sugar duty in order to have cheaper stout and whiskey. It has been argued that a reduction in duty would at any rate prevent a further decline in consumption and that a continuance of the existing duties will cause the demand to contract so sharply that in, say, three years from now the yield will be considerably more than £1,400,000 below the present estimated yield.  But against this, the figures of the past two years makes it clear that the fall in the consumption of whiskey is becoming slower.  If there were an improvement in agricultural conditions, the consumption of beer and spirits would go up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot afford it at present.  If conditions continue, as at present, it is not right economically to arrange and hope that people will pay out even more than £17,500,000 a year for liquor in order that the Exchequer may still receive £6,895,000 in tax.  The position is that the people have not been able to continue paying the amount of about £17,500,000 which they were paying prior to last year, <Col N="165" /> and it would not be possible for them in the coming year to spare the excess sum which would be necessary to give the Exchequer the same revenue at a reduced rate of duty.  If we were to adopt the policy of frankly taking taxes off alcoholic liquors and putting them on such a number of other articles of common consumption as might provide a big sum such as £1,400,000, the result could only be increased financial stringency resulting in a still further fall in the consumption of beer and spirits.  The suggestion that a reduction in the two taxes we are discussing would benefit the farmer seems to be without foundation.  The brewing industry has an enormous export trade, and small variations in the home demand are not going to affect the farmer.  In regard to distilleries, it has been solemnly suggested at meetings through the country that a reduction of the spirit duty would increase the requirements of grain no less than twenty-fold.  In reality an increase or decrease of 50,000 proof gallons consumed is not going to mean a use of more than 375 tons of grain more or less, perhaps 400 acres.</P>
      <P>Whatever may be the prospects of our revenue from beer duty, the brewing industry is able to take care of itself.  In regard to the distilling industry, there seems to be one thing we can do to assist it in recovering lost ground outside the Saorstát.  Competing whiskeys are produced by a cheaper process than Irish pot-still whiskey, which therefore can compete only by maintaining the highest reputation for quality and character.  As a contribution towards keeping the reputation of Irish whiskey right at home, we propose to increase the period for which spirits must be matured from three years to five.  This change will not involve any increase in price as the great bulk of Irish whiskey is actually bonded for five years or over at present, and only about 15 per cent. goes into consumption under five years old. Lengthening of the legal maturing period will involve certain increases of the additional duties payable in respect of those classes of spirit to which the Immature Spirits Act, 1915, does not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> In representations received from the distillers attention has been drawn to the very low rates at which alcohol in wine is taxed as compared with alcohol in spirits or even beer.  We are not convinced that an increase in the wine duty will necessarily induce people who now consume wine to substitute spirits or beer; but we do feel it undesirable that our scheme of taxation should discriminate heavily against the home product.  For the past three years wholesalers and retailers of wine have been put to great trouble and expense in forestalling anticipated increases in duty.  It would be cruel to prolong the suspense another year.  We propose that the duty on wine be increased by 100 per cent.  Owing to the enormous rates of profit in the trade, 100 per cent. increase in the duty should afford no excuse for any increase in the price to the public.  The quantities of wine taken from bond have been so large during the past seven or eight weeks that no appreciable increase in revenue is expected from the higher duty this year.  Next year it should yield an additional £150,000 to £200,000 according to whether the duty is or is not passed on to the public.</P>

      <P>No; I am thinking of increasing it.  During the past financial year a State broadcasting station has been established in Dublin.  A relaying station will be erected in Cork. It is probable that provision will have to be made for crystal set users elsewhere. The yield from licence fees even when better legislative provision has been made for collection is not likely for some time to meet the cost of the service.  Moreover, we think it is not desirable to adhere to the recommendation of the Dáil Commitee on Broadcasting that a uniform fee of £1 should be charged on all sets.  We believe that the fee for crystal sets should be reduced to 10/-.  The reduction in the long run will yield greater revenue. In the meantime we propose the imposition of a Customs duty of 33? per cent. on transmitting or receiving sets and parts thereof.  The yield is expected <Col N="167" /> to be about £20,000 a year.  It is not intended to make a profit out of broadcasting, but to use whatever revenue may be available for giving listening-in facilities to the greatest number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Executive Council has from time to time been urged to institute a tax on betting.  The arguments in favour of the duty are very sound.  It would certainly be a luxury tax, and if it yielded substantial revenue it would be very useful in making possible the reduction of some other impost which affects industry or the cost of living. It is also to be looked upon as a good tax because it would provide a suitable way out of the present ridiculous state of affairs under which, though cash betting is illegal, yet the law is not enforced, and, owing to the state of public opinion, is not enforceable.  The yield of a betting tax can not be estimated in a satisfactory way, and the estimate which the Revenue Commissioners have ventured to make might easily prove to be very much wide of the mark.  It has been decided, however, that the tax should be tried.  The intention is that the existing ban on betting be removed.  Book-making whether on a cash or credit basis will be legal for persons who have paid a £10 excise licence duty.  It may be carried on only on racecourses or in premises in respect of which a £20 licence duty has been paid.  All betting transactions will be liable to a tax equal to 5 per cent. of the sum staked. Tax will be paid either on certified returns, the book-maker giving bond as required by the Revenue Commissioners, or by the use of stamped slips or recording pads.  Although the carrying on of betting will be legalised, the provision of the Gaming Act, 1842, in regard to the irrecoverability of betting debts will remain.  It will be made an offence to attempt to bet with a bookmaker outside Sáorstát Éireann, and the Post Office will be given powers to stop communications by telegram, telephone, or letter to such bookmakers.  It will be illegal to carry on any other trade or business in a bookmaking establishment.  It is anticipated <Col N="168" /> that the tax may yield from £150,000 to £200,000 in a full year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  A special Committee of the Dáil during the latter part of the past financial year considered the question of duty on home-grown tobacco.  The Committee unfortunately was appointed rather late in the year and had, consequently, very little time for the hearing of evidence or the consideration of findings. The Committee recommended that the Excise duty be further reduced from 6s. 8d. to 5s.  The Executive Council are unable to agree with the recommendation. They are satisfied that a sufficiently large proportion of Irish tobacco would not be used in mixtures to enable any part of the reduction in duty to be passed on to the public. This was the view indicated by the only manufacturer who appeared before the Committee, and it is the view of other manufacturers.  Consequently the Exchequer would lose 3s. 2d. a pound, which would be divided between grower and manufacturer.  The cost to the general taxpayer of every acre of tobacco grown would be from anything in the neighbourhood of £128 to £150 and this after 20 years experimenting. It would cost the State 3s. 2d. a pound to find a market for a commodity, the competitor of which grown abroad could be sold for 7d.  The alternative proposal put up by the tobacco growers that the Excise allowance on export should be increased from 2d. to 1s. a lb. was not considered by the Committee because of its terms of reference.  On the merits it did not deserve consideration.  It is really a proposal that the Saorstát taxpayer should pay a subsidy equal to £40 or £50 an acre in perpetuity in order to have the honour of helping, in a small way, to provide Britain's millions with cheap smokes.  I venture to say that if that proposal were agreed to, we should have the tobacco growers back next year asking to have the subsidy increased to 1s. 6d.  It seems to me that the only proper course to take is to recognise that tobacco growing on an <Col N="169" /> economic basis in the Saorstát is not feasible, and to stop throwing good money after bad.  If the experiment could be wound up the Executive Council would be prepared to consider any losses that may have been incurred by growers or others, and, if necessary, to make recommendations to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Minor changes and adjustments will be proposed in connection with various taxes, but it will be more convenient to discuss them in proposing the appropriate resolutions or during the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I will only say that while the present economic position of the Saorstát is such as to give ground for anxious thought and to call for earnest endeavour, there is no reason for despondency.  The depression we are experiencing is mainly the result of world conditions and is shared by numerous other countries.  But while the principal causes of trouble are outside this country, it is possible for us by organised national effort to overcome many of the difficulties that confront us.  The existing tendency to look entirely to the Government and to State activity for all development and for the remedy of every ill is a great obstacle to progress.  We hear a lot of grousing about profiteering; the merest suspicion of public indignation would more effectually check profiteering than any action by the Dáil or the Government. There are people who would not walk round the corner to avoid profiteering, but who heartily curse the Government for not doing something about it.  In regard to nearly every problem the public attitude is, unfortunately, somewhat similar.  When the company to carry on the sugar-beet scheme was being organised, it was found in the earlier stages that no Irish money could be obtained.  One of the things shown by the working of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act is that, broadly speaking, people would be horrified at the idea of investing in any new industrial venture here the sums that they would readily wager on a horse race or put into a wild-cat scheme in Timbuctoo or Honolulu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thing most wanted at the moment is to have it thoroughly realised that the country cannot be made to prosper by legislation or official activity, <Col N="170" /> that the active co-operation of the citizens with the Government and of one class of citizens with another is essential.  Deputies will remember that when the National Loan was being issued in 1923 we had for a week or two a striking display of public interest in the financial future of the country and of co-ordinated effort to achieve a national purpose.  The banks, without commission, undertook, if necessary, to apply for 40 per cent. of the issue; the Chambers of Commerce held meetings asking for public support; newspapers of practically all shades of opinion urged the duty of subscribing: the most important firms in the country took up large amounts; churches and charitable foundations did likewise.  Trade Unions, too, came forward with their subscriptions.  The Irish National Teachers' Organisation which at that juncture entertained a strong sense of grievance against the Government in office, nevertheless took up a substantial block of loan.  Public support was so general that although individual applications were received for amounts like £300,000, £250,000 and £100,000, the average allotment was only £600.</P>
    <P>If some fraction of the spirit of general co-operation which was then aroused could be brought into play in dealing with day-to-day economic problems, substantial advances could be made.  To-day the industrialist who clamours for protection too often takes no trouble to get his own requirements of home manufacture even though they may be available at competitive rates.  The people who blame the banks for not lending more readily on land are the very people who would be amused if a bank, in consequence of a sale being prevented by intimidation, lost money that had been lent on a land mortgage.  They are the people also who if they heard that a particular bank was lending freely on land would slip away quietly and remove their deposit accounts to another bank.  They would never think, for instance, of trying to come together and concert with the banks means whereby land might be made a really good security for loans.  I am not saying for the moment that such an arrangement could be easily achieved.  I merely <Col N="171" /> urge that the policy of leaving everything to the Government be abandoned. There is nothing I am more clear about than if people will not help themselves no Government can effectually help them.  And while a reasonable amount of criticism of the Government for what it has done or not done, may perhaps be counted as self-help, by itself it will be about as beneficial as the tablespoonful of water to which it has been forgotten to add the medicine. The real cure for the ills of to-day, so far as they can be quickly cured, lies in the people as a whole making an effort to pull together economically with due thought of the common interest. I think I may say that in regard to the question of national development, the policy of the Government has not been lacking in enterprise and courage and that the schemes it has initiated will, as they mature, give great results in increased productivity. If we could bring to the better organisation of commerce and agriculture a fourth of the popular interest and enthusiasm that has been evoked for political purposes, we could really get ahead.</P>

    <P>(3)  That the several statutory and other provisions which were in force during the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1925, in relation to income tax and super-tax shall have <Col N="173" /> effect in relation to the income tax and the super-tax to be charged as aforesaid for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1926.</P>
    <P>(4)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated what the effect of the change which is proposed will be.  It is proposed that income tax be charged at the same rate as last year, but the effect of the reduction in super-tax will be about £115,000 per annum less into the Exchequer.  I will give one or two illustrations, assuming in each case that the taxpayer has only unearned income, that he is married and has two children.  At present a person having £2,500 income pays £37 10s.  super-tax; under the new provisions he will pay £18 15s. 0d.  A person with £4,000 income at present pays £212; in future he will pay £118.  A person with £7,000 income pays £737 10s. at present; he will pay £556 5s. in future.  A person with £10,000 pays £1,412 10s. at present; he will pay £1,131 5s. in future.</P>

      <P>I am not able to discuss this matter very fully, or almost to any extent, in the absence of a general summary of the estimates of the cost of these various taxes.  But I think, right at the beginning, in respect of this income tax proposal which involves a reduction in favour of the super-taxpayer of £115,000, that I must draw attention to the speech of the Minister, in introducing his Budget last year, with respect to an item which is of immediate interest to a very large number of people in the Saorstát.  The Minister said that no increase in the old age pension Vote was allowable because</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;the situation does not permit of any increase in recurrent expenditure; that, in fact, existing expenditure can continue to be borne only if conditions improve.  Substantial reduction in taxation is, consequently, necessary above all else.  But, if the situation is found to have improved at the end of the year, we believe some revision of the Old Age pensions <Col N="174" /> Act, 1924, will have to be given precedence of any further reduction of taxation, however much required.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is these last words to which I am drawing attention, that &ldquo;if the situation is found to have improved at the end of the year we believe some revision of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1924, will have to be given precedence of any further reduction of taxation, however much required.&rdquo; I am not going to enlarge upon the position of the old age pensioners at this stage or deal with the effect of the cut in their pensions. It may arise later on.  But in view of the proposition contained in this resolution, involving, as it does, a reduction in super-tax of £115,000, I remind the Committee of the Minister's very definite statement last year, that before any such reduction could be thought of, particularly in respect of super-taxpayers, old age pensioners should have a refund of the cut of ten per cent. in their pensions.  I think it is rather a pity that the first proposition in this year's financial proposals should be to reduce the charge upon the super-taxpayer, when we have not had any suggestion from the Minister with regard to making provision for an improvement in the position of the old age pensioners, or any proposition which would seem to make provision for dealing with the case of unemployed men, whether by means of direct employment or by means of an extension of the provisions of insurance. I put in my protest right at the beginning of this series of discussions on that count.</P>

      <P>This is one of a set of three proposals which involves no reduction in taxation.  It simply means that the burden of taxation is proposed to be shifted in a certain way to get the same result.  If we let off a certain class of fairly wealthy people from paying super-tax to the extent of £115,000 per annum, we are proposing to get out of them in death duties £200,000 per annum.  As to the provision for the unemployed, we are, at any rate, going to make a big advance to the Road Fund to carry on a great deal more work than could be carried on out of current income.</P>

      <P>I move Resolution No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That for the purposes of the Agreement relating to relief from double income tax made between the Government of Saorstát Eireann and the Government of Great Britain on the 14th day of April, 1926, persons who are resident in Saorstát Eireann and are not resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland and persons who are resident both in Saorstát Eireann and in Great Britain or Northern Ireland shall respectively be chargeable with income tax (including super-tax) in respect of property situate and profits or gains arising in Great Britain or Northern Ireland in such manner and subject to such rules as the Oireachtas shall provide in and by any Act relating to finance passed within four months after the passing of this Resolution.</P>
      <P>(2)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913.</P>
      <P>This resolution arises out of the proposed new arrangement for dealing with the problem of double income tax. In the Agreement with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer which has been circulated, Deputies will find that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 3 of it provides for the charging of Saorstát tax to any person who is entitled to exemption from British tax by virtue of Article 1 (a) of the Agreement in respect of property, profits or gains exempt from British tax.  Unless alterations were made in the law, the result would be that certain profits or portions of profits would escape income tax assessment altogether. To take one example: A person wholly resident in the Saorstát who is a sleeping partner in a business controlled and carried on wholly in Northern Ireland, is not at present liable to assessment in the Saorstát on any portion of his share of the profits of the business in Northern Ireland which is not remitted to the Saorstát.  For the <Col N="176" /> future, a person resident in the Saorstát and not resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland will be entitled, under the agreement, to claim exemption from British income tax, so that if we did not legislate to assess income tax arising from his partnership in the business in Northern Ireland that portion of his income would escape tax altogether.</P>
    <P>There are other cases also that are provided for.  The broad principle that is being applied is that the full income which is exempted under the new arrangement from tax in the country of origin shall be chargeable in the country of residence.  There is one special provision which may be referred to.  At present the dividends from a British limited company are, in effect, assessed to British income tax by deduction on the basis of the income in the year of assessment.  Such dividends, when they accrue to a Saorstát resident, are assessed to Saorstát taxes on the basis of the average of the three preceding years.  It is proposed to make the ultimate basis of charge the actual income of the current year in future, so that, broadly speaking, the charge in the Saorstát will correspond to the tax in respect of which exemption is given by the British.  We are bringing two different bases into conformity there, so that there may be no escape from tax under the new arrangement. Under Article 3 (c) of the Agreement it is intended that the liability to Saorstát tax, in the case of a double resident, shall be computed as if he were a single resident.  The principle for the single resident, as I have already explained, will be applied by both countries in computing the liabilities of the double resident, who will then be given double tax relief in accordance with Article 2 of the Agreement.  I may say that the whole of the new Agreement will provide the utmost simplicity in the case of persons who are resident only in the Saorstát or resident only in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, but that complications will exist, though they will be lesser complications, where the person is resident in the two countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like more information respecting the outcome of this arrangement.  I have no doubt we shall have more discussion upon it and, in the course of that discussion, a great deal more light, but it would be also better if we could have more information from the Minister as to what he expects from these arrangements.  He tells us that we will be left where we are at present.  I should like a little more light as to what are the expectations on the economy of the country.  I <Col N="178" /> expect that one of the inevitable outgrowths of this proposal is that the income tax rate in the Saorstát, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, year by year, will be found to be about the same.  Between Government and Government the fear will be that if there is too great a reduction in one case it will tend to throw the passenger traffic between one country and the other in order to evade the income tax of that particular year, and it seems to me to have the consequence that the income tax arrangements between the respective countries will more or less approximate to equality year by year. Whether that is desirable or not I will not argue at present; whether it is the intention or not I am not going to suggest, but I should like to know from the Minister whether there is more involved in this proposition than mere convenience to the income taxpayer. Then, and appertaining to that, there is the question of what is going to be the effect on income tax payers who are only dividend receivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another part of the Minister's speech he referred to the lack of enthusiasm of investors towards Irish industries and investments, and said that they were prepared to look towards Honolulu or Timbuctoo rather than towards Ireland for investments. On another occasion the Minister told us the sum of Irish money invested in Great Britain or Ireland runs into 150 or 160 million pounds.  It is to be anticipated that the effect of this proposal will be to stabilise that position, and to continue the encouragement to Irish investors to send their money into Great Britain for investment in British ventures, and, perhaps, also to encourage Irish companies to have their headquarters in Great Britain if it were to happen that the rates of income tax in Great Britain were lower than in Ireland.  On the other hand it may be said, and this I should like some light upon, that the effect of this proposal will be to induce British investors to invest their savings in Irish industries; we are to have that kind of re-arrangement or rather a continuation of the present arrangement, with the added expectation that British investors would send over more of their money to establish industries <Col N="179" /> in Ireland.  I do not know if that is the intention.  I question if it is more desirable than a policy which would induce Irish investors to invest their money in Irish industries, and, on the face of it, as much as I can understand it, from the hurried reading or the slight consideration one has been able to give to the proposals, the effect of this arrangement is to encourage an Irish investor to invest his money in British securities and the hope that there would be a reciprocal response from British investors so that British investors would chance a little more money in Irish industries.  I do not think that is a desirable arrangement, and it seems to me to be likely to effect the amalgamation or the reamalgamation of the financial interests of the investors of the two countries. Whether that is desirable is certainly very questionable.  In any case, without attempting to pronounce any final judgment upon this question, I hope the Minister will be able to give us a little more light as to what is in his mind as to the economic bearing of this proposal, apart from the question of revenue on the individual investors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question with regard to paragraph four of the Agreement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of this Agreement a company, whether incorporated by or under the laws of Great Britain or Northern Ireland or the Free State or otherwise, shall be deemed to be resident in that country only in which its business is managed and controlled.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object I have in asking this question is that there is a huge brewing concern in this country, and to my mind it is managed and controlled in another country, and it would, obviously, be a great loss to this country if that concern were to be free under the arrangements which have been effected.  The whole question of double income tax is one which has caused a great deal of trouble, and any arrangement which would simplify methods is to be accepted with favour. Deputy Johnson need not be worried about Irish investors, because any investor will go to the place where he <Col N="180" /> will get the best return for his money, and if this is a country which offers people a greater return than Honolulu money will be invested here rather than in Honolulu.  That is the way I look at the matter, and if we wish to lose money by being patriotic, that is nothing to complain about.  Let us hope that stability will be brought about by a better sense of patriotism amongst our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated quite clearly that in the case of an ordinary resident in Saorstát Éireann who has shares in a British company, the income tax will be payable here entirely.  I should like to ask him if an ordinary resident in this country who owns lands in England, without a residence, will have to pay income tax there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is not resident in England he is exempt from all British taxes.  In part, I think that Deputy Wilson gave an answer to Deputy Johnson.  I would like to disagree, however, with one point of view which Deputy Wilson expressed.  He indicated that investors look solely to profit; that they try to look to profit only, but they do not always succeed and are often misled by bad fashions and bad habits.  The position really is this.  This country is stated to own in foreign investments a sum of between a hundred and fifty and one hundred and sixty millions.  That sum is owned by individuals here, and the country would lose a substantial part of that foreign investment, although the money was made here, if those individuals who own that money went out of the country.  The difficulty we experienced during the continuance of the double income tax was that the ownership of that money might be lost to the country, and no doubt a substantial portion of it would be lost if the people owning it left the country. I do not think that you are likely to prevent anybody investing in British securities or industries because of the double tax difficulty.  People will look to profit largely and will ignore the other element.  If you get a position in which a person has most of his wealth in British securities, and if he <Col N="181" /> is subject to great difficulties about tax, he may decide to leave, and there are people who would so decide.  We expect that the new arrangement will benefit the State in this way, namely, that the people who have been inclined to go will not go and that those who have gone will be inclined to come back so that their wealth will again become Irish-held wealth and the income tax from it will flow into this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true, I believe, as a necessary consequence of this arrangement, that the income tax rates in the two countries cannot be very far apart.  In paragraph 8 Deputies will see that the arrangement is subject to legislative confirmation and will remain in force only as long as the confirming legislation remains in force.  If the British reduce their income tax to 2s. 6d., and if we could not follow suit, our only way of saving our revenue position would be to abandon the agreement and revert to the old practice.  On the other hand, if we reduced our tax so low that very serious loss would be suffered by the British Exchequer by people coming here, they on their part might terminate the arrangement.  I believe that there might be a certain limit within which both taxes might differ without the agreement being abandoned, but if they differed widely the result would be that the agreement would be abandoned.  I do not think that Deputy Johnson need fear or believe that it is going to have any great effect on future investments.  Last year I was told, when I was making inquiries in reference to the adverse balance of trade, that a great number of stockbrokers were very busy buying British securities for their clients in spite of the double income tax.  I think if people see opportunities of a rise in the value of shares they will buy first and trouble about double income tax afterwards.  It may affect them, if they come to a position in which they have considerable investments in England and the smaller portion of them held here.  With regard to the Guinness company, which Deputy Wilson mentioned, the position will be that in future the company will not be taxed by us.  At present we tax the company, not on its whole profits but on a great <Col N="182" /> portion of them.  We then gave double taxation relief.  We remitted a little more than half what we got.  In future the company will not taxed, but all dividends coming here will pay the Saorstát income tax in full.</P>
    <P>Supposing the shares are equally divided between those held in England and those held here, the position would be that we would get the same tax as in the past, because we get full tax on that portion of the dividends which comes into the Saorstát.  So far as the company are concerned they will not be taxed by us in future.  They will deduct from their shareholders British tax in full, but when the taxpayers reside here they will be exempt from the British tax and we will get the full tax.  The new arrangement will meet the case of the smaller shareholders of Messrs. Guinness.  A grievance has existed in their case.  What happened was that, legally speaking, although Guinness bore the Saorstát tax, it was not legally entitled to deduct the Saorstát tax, and from the point of view of the taxpayer the income tax that had been paid to our authorities was an expense like that of the corporation profits tax or rates. In consequence, we had to refuse to repay any tax, so that if the Guinness shareholder was a wealthy man, a man with considerable income, our position in regard to his Guinness dividends was that they bore our tax.  In the case of a poor person who should have been entitled to a rebate we had to say that Guinness had no legal authority to deduct the tax and such a person could not get a repayment. The result was that the poorer shareholders could not get a repayment. Now as this company will be resident in Ireland such person will be able to get full repayment.</P>

      <P>We are to make special arrangements to avoid that, as far as practicable.  I believe the clearing house, which it is proposed to set up, will enable us to do so.  It might be agreed, for instance, in some cases that the tax would be paid over by the British to us.  The detailed arrangements, however, are as yet only being worked out.</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister mention the clearing house, because that goes to the bottom of the whole difficulty.  At present, there is not supposed to be such a thing as double taxation at all.  Although one is resident here and legally has to pay a certain amount of tax to Great Britain, where he has property, and also to the Saorstát, he is not supposed to pay double income tax.  He is not supposed to pay more than the requisite proportion of the total tax to one country or to the other.  The difficulty in this question has always been the making of the original demand on the taxpayer and his having, whether he was a man of small income or of large income, to make a personal demand for a rebate.  As the Minister has said, it is very hard to explain this question briefly.  But I think the difficulty is not going to be removed except by something in the nature of a clearing house.  While the Minister has not been able to assure the House that a clearing house is in existence, I was pleased to hear that negotiations are proceeding whereby something in the nature of such an institution will be <Col N="184" /> brought into being.  As Deputy Thrift has explained, if the income tax is still to be deducted in the first place and a resident in this country is put to the trouble and inconvenience, with delay in many cases, of applying to Great Britain for a rebate, the difficulties will not have been overcome.  I quite see that the procedure will be simplified to some extent by the proposal that mere residence in the country will be sufficient to secure this rebate, but I am rather doubtful as to the facility with which the small dividend receiver will obtain his rebate.  The real and only practical means, therefore, of dealing with this double taxation difficulty, as it has been called, will be the institution of a clearing house.  I pointed out that previously, and I am delighted to find the Government taking that line. In a matter of this kind, between two Governments, I do not think all the duty and responsibility should be cast on the individual.  Only one demand should be made on the individual taxpayer. He should not have to pay twice and he should not have to make application for a rebate.  I hope the proposal as to the setting up of a clearing house will be proceeded with.</P>

      <P>I should not like Deputy Redmond to take it that all the classes of work he refers to will be dealt with in a clearing house.  A clearing house might be of little utility if too great a burden were thrown on it.  I do not want it to be taken that all sorts of ordinary cases will be dealt with in the clearing house.  As I have said, all that has been arrived at is a general agreement.  There have been discussions of administrative details. These discussions are proceeding, and I am not in a position to say how they will work out.  There is all the difference in the world between the old system, whereby the person claiming relief had to go into all the details, had to give all the particulars, and had to satisfy the authorities and the proposed system, whereby a simple form is substituted in which all that is necessary to say is &ldquo;I am a resident in the Saorstát. You have got £5 tax from me; please return it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that a tremendous advance <Col N="185" /> has been made inasmuch as we shall no longer have to fill up the assessment form giving our entire income, enclosing our receipt for income tax paid here, and particulars of the claims we are making.  Even when making the claims, many of us were quite unable to arrive at the actual proportion that was allowed as far as the remainder was concerned.  Even if the clearing house were set up, it seems to me that it would be very difficult for people with small incomes from which deductions have been made to get refunds of the deductions inside three months or six months.  If the deduction is made from the dividend in the first instance, it would throw a tremendous amount of work on the clearing house.  The clearing house could not possibly arrange to give a refund on the spot to each person who would get a dividend with income tax deducted.  Even a clearing house will not be able to get over the difficulty of people with small incomes being kept out of their money for a certain length of time.  I congratulate the Minister on what he has done to get rid of what was an intolerable nuisance.  The filling of the forms in connection with these claims in the past was one of the most troublesome things I have ever come across.  In justice to the people on the other side, I may say that I made a claim within the last fortnight and this morning I received a return, so that I was not kept waiting for any length of time.</P>

      <P>When we have a Deputy telling us about the annoyance he experienced in making these claims we can imagine the difficulty the ordinary investor in the country experienced who had not the advantage of Deputy Sir James Craig's education.  There is another difficulty which has not been referred to.  When one sets about the recovery of these deductions from England, he is told about the English method of calculation.  Has the Minister heard anything about that? In some cases they have a different method altogether.  Could the refund not be made by means of an affidavit of an investor in an English company, which affidavit would be held by the company sending out their dividend warrants, and which would be sufficient <Col N="186" /> to exclude the investor from English tax?  I happen to do business with some of these small investors, and they have to go to an expert to deal with their claims.  For that they have to pay, which is another tax on the small investor.  It is the small investor who suffers most, because he generally knows less about the procedure than the large investor.  The annoyance has not been overstated by Deputy Sir James Craig.  It has been felt very keenly by the small investor in the country.  I have been up against it myself and I know what it is.</P>

      <P>It is an enormous simplification, and I think that the Minister's answer is quite satisfactory. If you had to wait until the following 5th April, as is the case at present, before you could put in your claim, then, I think, a hardship would arise; but the clearing house will possibly meet that difficulty.  If it could be arranged that the dividend warrant when sent here with the income tax deduction could be taken to the clearing house, and deducted income tax paid over to the investor, the matter would be quite satisfactory.</P>

      <P>(1)  That whenever in any year of assessment a person would be entitled to income from a particular source which in fact does not produce income in that year, and the tax thereon would if the source had produced income be computed by reference to income from the same source in any preceding year or years, such person shall, in the year following the year or years by reference to which the computation is directed to be made, be chargeable with tax in the same manner and to the like amount as if the source had produced income in such following year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> This resolution arises out of a recent decision given in a British court which might perhaps be followed here.  The case in the British courts was Whelan versus Henning.  The taxpayer was the owner of shares in a Ceylon Rubber Company, the dividends of which were assessable to British income tax in case 5 of schedule D as income from possession outside of the United Kingdom, and it was assessable accordingly on the average of the three preceding years.  On this basis his assessment was fixed at a figure of over £3,000.  In the year of assessment the company paid no dividend, and Henning, the taxpayer, contended there was no liability to income tax.  The House of Lords upheld the contention.  Now this resolution is designed to neutralise or to prevent a similar decision being given by the courts here.  It is also intended to put beyond doubt the legality of the practice that has been in existence for a great many years.  Of course, it is intended to be effective only where the person is still in possession of the source of income.  If he has parted with the source of income, of course, he is not liable.  It will be obvious to Deputies that if the decision of the British House of Lords were to be followed by the courts here the taxpayer would get the benefit of the bad year twice.  First he would pay no tax in the bad year, and then the year in which there was no income would come in, in calculating the average of the three succeeding years.  The need for this would be clearer if we were to adopt, in this country, the recommendation of the Royal Commission of 1918, which, I think, was that the average of the three preceding years basis should be done away with altogether, and that instead of the average of the three preceding years we should have the actual income of the year previous.  Suppose we were going to adopt that basis, and the House of Lords decision stood, the position would be that if a man had no income this year he would pay no tax under the House of Lords decision, and the next year again when he had a big income he would pay no income tax because it would be assessable on the previous year.  The position would be that a man could so arrange that each alternate year he would have a big income <Col N="189" /> and no income, so that he could not be charged income tax at all.  It is obvious that if this decision were to be followed by the courts here, it would be a grievous hardship upon other taxpayers who would not get the unfair and inequitable advantage which this decision would give.</P>

    <P>(2)  That whenever the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that any cinematograph film imported into <Col N="190" /> Saorstát Eireann is of an educational character, they shall, subject to compliance with such conditions as they think fit to impose, exempt such film from payment of the duty on cinematograph films included in the new import duties mentioned in this Resolution.</P>
    <P>(3)  That the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duties mentioned in this Resolution with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(4)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913.</P>
    <P>This is a Customs resolution continuing what are commonly called the McKenna duties.  The duties are those on motor cars, including motor cycles and tricycles; musical instruments, including gramophones, pianolas and other similar instruments, with the accessories and other component parts thereof; clocks and watches with their component parts; cinematograph films. The duty on blank films is one-third of a penny; on positive films containing pictures ready for exhibition, one penny per lineal foot; negative films (that is films containing photographs from which positives can be printed), 5d. per foot; other goods in the list, duties equal to 33? per cent. of the value of the article.</P>
    <P>The yield from the various items during the past year has been as follows:&mdash;Cinematograph films, £13,220; clocks and watches, £16,070; motor vehicles, £304,260; musical instruments, £23,020.  Two years ago we removed the provision imposing the duties on gramophone records.  Last year we gave exemption to films which were held by the Revenue Commissioners to be of an educational character.  This year it is proposed to give an exemption to blank films.  There are not many cinematograph pictures taken in the Saorstát, and certainly no blank films are made or will be made here; and it is thought that any additional production of pictures will probably be more advantageous than the very small <Col N="191" /> amount of tax which is at present received on blank films, which amounts to about £140 per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reserve my general remarks for the discussion to-morrow, but there are just one or two points I should like to touch on now.  Firstly, I should like to thank the Minister for assenting to the request I made on two previous years, in disentangling this resolution from the resolution dealing with the duty on dried fruits.  I am glad that at last he has extracted the motor cycles and ukuleles from amongst the figs and the dates and the currants.  I want to express the hope that the Minister will go a little further in his exemptions as soon as he has sufficient revenue and exempt musical instruments from this duty.  It is not a protective duty.  The making of musical instruments requires a long training, in many cases an hereditary aptitude, and is confined to certain areas, mostly situated, I think, in Germany.  Again, we have adopted the principle of exempting educational films.  Music in most of its forms is in itself educational.  It is a wholesome and healthful relaxation and it is not a subject that we ought to put a tax on, if we can possibly afford to sacrifice the revenue.  £23,000 sounds a great deal of money, but taken in the scale of a national balance sheet of £23,000,000, it is not a very large amount; so that I hope when the Minister is considering remissions, if not this year, at any rate next year, he will take this matter into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like if he would tell us a little more about the duty on blank films.  At present almost the only films that are taken in Ireland are what are called topical films.  Cinematograph operators of one or two of what are called &ldquo;Topical Gazettes&rdquo; come over for certain national functions, like the St. Patrick's Day parade and things of that kind, and take pictures which are exported, certainly to Great Britain, and probably elsewhere in the world. It is very desirable that they should do so, because, apart from anything else, it is good propaganda.  A picture of a parade of the National Army is good propaganda.  I do not know <Col N="192" /> whether a picture of Deputies arriving at Leinster House is good propaganda or not, but it may suggest that we are not quite such a hardened gathering as some people imagine.  Up to the present, I believe there has been the anomalous situation that the companies who took these films had to pay a double duty; they had to pay a duty on the film coming in, and then had again to pay duty on the film as it was exported.  Now we are relieving them on our side from that burden, and I think that is satisfactory, because it will help to make our activities&mdash;I hope our constructive activities&mdash;better known to the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, perhaps, to encouraging the taking of more topical pictures, it probably may encourage the taking of scenic pictures which do not give much profit, and which it would be very advantageous to have taken if they were well taken and exported.</P>

Probably I should not refer to this matter now, but I take advantage of the occasion to remind the Minister that I will take a further opportunity of pressing this matter.</P>

    <P>This is the only Customs duty of an agricultural character which we found it possible to accept and to recommend to the Dáil.  As I said, it deals with a commodity of which not a very large quantity is imported, but it is a commodity that will give a certain new market for agricultural produce, amounting as I said, to something like 20,000 tons of oats.  It will keep a certain number of grist mills going, or help to keep them going, which are of value to the country, and in that way, and in increasing the output of other mills, it will give a certain amount of direct employment.  We have not thought it necessary to elaborate in any way in the matter of defining oatmeal, as we think that no difficulties will arise.  It will include all the ordinary types of oatmeal: Pinhead meal, pot oats, medium curb oats, rolled cats, <Col N="194" /> flake meal, Quaker oats, redhead flaked meal, baby flake meal, groats.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately the Deputy dealt with only one side of the question.  He forgets that large numbers in the community will have to pay the £37,000.  This particular proposal is put down with the object of helping the farmer, but what one fears is that, while it will give some small help to the farmer, it will add considerably to <Col N="196" /> the cost of living.  I am not at all sure that the indirect result of this tax, by adding to the cost of living, will not hit the farmer to a greater extent than any benefit he could derive from a small increase in the price of a barrel of oats.</P>

At the present time we have Canadian oatmeal brought in, and it has a very small nutritive value.  What is made from it is sold cheaper, but it is a much worse article than what is made from Irish oatmeal.  I am only sorry that the Minister did not include Indian meal as well as oatmeal.  If he did it would be a very valuable thing. As far as the Minister has gone he has done well.  I do not think the cost to any families that live, to any extent, on oatmeal is going to be increased by the tax that the Minister proposes to put on.</P>

      <P>If the intention is to benefit agriculture by this import duty, is it not a fact that those who will benefit will be the millers?  I see no guarantee that millers who are going to manufacture an increased quantity of oatmeal will be bound to pay an extra 2/6 for each barrel of oats, particularly in view of the fact that a large quantity of oats will be used for other purposes besides oatmeal.

    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> (3)  That, for the purposes of this Resolution, wine rendered sparkling or effervescent and bottled in the warehouse shall be deemed to be sparkling wine imported in bottle, and upon delivery for home consumption shall be charged with the duty imposed on sparkling wine by this Resolution, and the time when the wine is entered for home consumption shall be deemed to be the time of importation.</P>
    <P>(4)  That in this Resolution the word &ldquo;wine&rdquo; includes the lees of wine.</P>
    <P>(5)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913.</P>
    <P>This is a resolution increasing the duty on wine.  As the Deputies will see, the duties, even the new duties proposed, are very low indeed.  Under the old scale the ordinary bottle of white wine that sold for 5/-, 6/-, or 7/- paid a duty of about 5d.  Under the new arrangement it would pay a duty of about 10d.  The prices at which wine is purchased outside this country bear absolutely no relation to the prices at which they are sold here, even allowing for importation and other duties.  It is one of the things on which somehow or other there are enormous rates of profit as between the producer, as you might say, and the ultimate consumer. The duty comes, perhaps, a little more sharply in the case of sparkling wine, champagne or such wines, which are either imported in bottles, or are here in warehouses converted into sparkling wine.  Even in that case the extra duty is only £1 5s.  Having regard to the price at which these commodities are sold there will be no need to pass the duty on to the consumer.  Probably to some extent it may be passed on, but if it is passed on it will not, we believe, very greatly decrease the consumption.</P>
    <P>It will still leave the charge on wine, having regard to the alcoholic content, lower by far than the spirit duty, and lower than the charge on beer.</P>

In the past it was 12/6, and now with the additional duty it is £1 5s.  We simply doubled all the duties.  On wine not exceeding 30 degrees of proof spirit, the duty was 2/6 a gallon, and now it will be 5/-.  Wine over 30 degrees and under 42 degrees proof spirit previously paid a duty of 6/- and now it will be 12/-.  For every additional degree of proof spirit there was an extra 6d. and now it will be 1/-, and the surtax added.</P>

    <P>Resolution No. 8 arises out of the proposal to increase the period during which spirits must be bonded from three years to five years.  When the Immature Spirits Act was passed requiring the warehousing of spirits for not less than three years certain classes of spirits were exempted from that. They included imported gin and perfumed spirit&mdash;that is really perfume&mdash; and foreign liqueurs, to which one of the Deputies referred.  Then it included certain mixtures, and other preparations containing spirits.  As there was no obligation to keep them in bond for the three years, there was, apart from the spirit duty, an additional duty. Where they were warehoused for two years and less than three years they were charged an extra 1/- a gallon. Where they were warehoused for less than two years they were charged 1/6 per gallon extra, and there was a slightly higher rate on sweetened and perfumed spirits.  We propose that the duty, if warehoused for less than five years, on perfumed spirits be 2/6, and for every gallon of liqueurs, cordials, mixtures and other preparations entered in such a manner as to indicate that the strength is not to be tested, 3/4, and for every gallon of perfumed spirits 4/-.  Then as to the Excise duty on home-made spirits, a flat rate additional duty was placed on spirits warehoused for five years of 2/6 per gallon. It is necessary that there should be this discrimination between spirits which are sent out to the public after being warehoused for less than five years, and spirits which have to be warehoused for five years.  The cost of warehousing falls on the persons who warehouse these spirits that have to be kept for five years.</P>

    <P>(4)  That in this Resolution the expression &ldquo;wireless telegraphy&rdquo; means and includes any system of communication by an apparatus for transmitting or receiving messages or other communications by means of signals produced electrically, and transmitted without the aid of a wire <Col N="204" /> connecting the points from and at which such messages or other communications are sent or received.</P>
    <P>This resolution imposes a tax on wireless apparatus.  As I explained, we are satisfied, as the State has taken hold of wireless as a means for the entertainment or education of the people, that there will be undoubtedly a feeling that there is an obligation on the State to give as many of the citizens as is reasonably practicable a means of listening-in to wireless performances on the cheaper classes of sets which the ordinary person can afford.  On the other hand I have indicated that we are rather against the idea of charging £1 all round as a licence fee for wireless sets.  It may be true that a licence fee of £1 means less than a penny per night, and that is a very small charge for any sort of programme, but there is the fact that £1 is a large sum to a great many people who desire to listen-in.  It is a very big sum compared with the prices of the cheap wireless sets, and there would be a feeling that it is too high a sum having regard to the licence fees in the adjoining countries.  Generally it is felt that we ought to have in the case of crystal sets a fee of 10/-.  As I say, we believe that ultimately, probably the collection would be facilitated and cheapened by a lower fee.  It is very difficult to come to any form of conclusion about the cost of wireless broadcasting, but it is certainly felt that for some time and until there has been a great growth in licence fees, the licence fees will not provide the cost of running a station.  On the other hand, we feel that this is a method by which an additional sum can be obtained and the existence of which can be taken into account when we are deciding what is to be done in the matter of wireless broadcasting.  It is estimated that it should bring in about £20,000 a year. There is just one point in regard to paragraph 2 of the Resolution.  That is meant to deal with those articles which come along containing cabinets and other contrivances that would make them liable to the furniture duty. We want to make it clear that they are not liable to the furniture duty and this new duty in addition.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister a few questions in regard to this duty.  The first is what will be the position of those people who have already paid £1 licence fee in respect of crystal sets?  Will they be entitled to a refund?  The second is how much is the differentiation in favour of crystal sets going to cost from the point of view of inspection and collection? When I brought up the question, about three months ago, of allowing a lower rate in respect of crystal sets the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs expressed the opinion that it was quite impossible owing to the amount of inspection which would be necessary.  I am glad the Government have reconsidered the matter, but I think that we should have some explanation of their new attitude.  I presume it was not adopted without consultation with the Post Office.</P>

      <P>The differentiation was adopted after careful consideration and on the recommendation of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I think the conclusion finally arrived at was that whatever cost in the way of inspection and costs of enforcing might arise from the differentiation, greater costs would arise because people would feel that £1 was too high for a crystal set and would probably take risks.  As to the user of the crystal set who paid £1, the only thing we can do for him is that he will have to pay only 10/- next time.</P>

      <P>I want to say a word on this resolution, though perhaps what I want to say might be said at another time, at least in part, if we were not asked now to pass this resolution imposing a duty of 33? per cent. of its value on wireless apparatus.  The apparent policy in regard to broadcasting now is that certain parts of the country are to be served by wireless stations and that certain other parts cannot be served by these stations.  If citizens in certain parts of the country want to have a service from these stations they have to procure much more costly wireless sets than a resident in Dublin or its vicinity or a resident in Cork and the immediate vicinity.  A resident in my constituency or in constituencies <Col N="206" /> in the West of Ireland, will have to pay £30 or £40 for a wireless set in order to get any service from these stations.  He would have to pay £25 at least, and up to £40, from my information.  I am not an authority on it.  Does the Minister consider that while he pursues that policy, that tends only to serve a certain number of the citizens, that other people in outlying districts in order to get any service whatever, will have to pay for a much more costly instrument to start with, and pay a tax on that instrument equivalent to what the individual will have to pay who can procure an instrument at one-twentieth of the cost? I do not think the policy of the Minister in this respect can be favourably commented on at all, and I shall have some more to say at a later stage.  I want to ask if the Minister considered this aspect of the case when it was decided to impose this tax?</P>

      <P>I think the resolution rather aims at solving the difficulties to which the Deputy draws attention.  It provides the Department with these necessary funds for extension and also provides against a very serious loss which would certainly accrue for some time to come. On a recent occasion here it was explained that every effort would be made to extend equal facilities&mdash;equal as far as equality can go&mdash;to the various parts of the country, and steps are being taken to realise that hope.  I feel with Deputy Baxter that we cannot place country districts, no matter how far removed, in a favourable position in regard to the cost of broadcasting sets, but beyond the fact that the provision of this £20,000 or £30,000, provided for in this resolution, is a step in that direction, I do not think the question arises here.</P>

      <P>I am very glad of the Minister's proposal to reduce the licence for crystal sets to 10/-, but I regret this resolution very much.  The way it strikes me in the first place, as far as the crystal set user is concerned, is that he is taking away 10/- with one hand and bringing it back with another. If the crystal set user wants to get the advantage of the 10/- licence <Col N="207" /> he will probably have to pay 30/- for his outfit, and he has got to pay a tax of 33? per cent. on that.  That is the 10/- taken back straight away.  As far as the crystal set user is concerned this 33? per cent. duty is not going to do him any good, even though there is a reduction of 10/- in the licence.  As far as the country user is concerned, what Deputy Baxter has stated is quite true.  It will be a further handicap on the likelihood of extending the advantages of broadcasting and establishing a desire for broadcasting amongst users in the country districts.  It will be a very long time, indeed, before any broadcasting service is able to put up enough stations to supply country people with the advantages of wireless.</P>
      <P>I am one of those who take the optimistic view that very quickly the advantages that will arise from wireless for country people will be so much appreciated that the revenue from licences alone will be sufficient to enable the State to meet all expenses. It is a great pity that we should now throw this handicap on the people in the country.  They should have every opportunity of taking advantage of the broadcasting service.  I think there are great advantages to be derived from broadcasting, particularly in country districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of the desire to make broadcasting a success I think this resolution is a mistake.  From the much more important point of view&mdash; the one with which I am more immediately concerned&mdash;of scientific instruments in general, I think the resolution is also a mistake.  We might conceive that it is going to lead to very great difficulties.  Any institution that wants to teach experiments in physics, for instance, in so far as it is concerned with the principles of broadcasting, will have difficulty in getting instruments that can be used for broadcasting either in the way of reception or transmission. No doubt there is a clause in the resolution which indicates that if it can be proved the instruments are used for some purpose other than reception or transmission there may not be much difficulty in regard to the duty.  It will be difficult to put that into practice, <Col N="208" /> and schools and colleges will have to pay more for certain apparatus that comes very largely into use in connection with wireless reception and transmission.</P>
    <P>I think this resolution is a mistake. For the sake of the revenue that will be got from it for the next year it is not worth while.  It would be much better to run the broadcasting service at a loss, not for a very long time but for a comparatively short time.  I believe it will tend to complicate and perhaps spoil the whole broadcasting service if we put on this additional duty, and it will complicate our work in connection with science and educational and scientific development generally. I have no doubt the Minister is determined to go on with it.  I regret the resolution very much indeed.  On the other hand, I welcome the reduction of the fee because I do feel that the benefits of broadcasting ought to be made available to as large a section of the population as possible.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is employing postmen to report the names of people who have aerials.  That is a wrong policy altogether; it is a policy fundamentally wrong, inasmuch as it alters the relationship which should exist between the postman delivering letters and the people to whom he is delivering. Postmen are at present being employed as policemen in connection with this work; they are engaged to spy on the people in whose service they are. I think the Minister, when he is introducing a Bill dealing with broadcasting and the payment of licences, should make arrangements to exempt postmen from having to play the part of policemen or act as spies on the people to whom they are delivering letters.</P>

      <P>If I understand Deputy Baxter's contention properly, it is that while a farmer would not be stopped from getting in a broadcasting receiver for the difference between forty shillings and thirty shillings&mdash;thirty shillings without the duty and ten shillings extra as duty&mdash;at the present moment he has no option but to pay £15 or £20 for a valve set.  The Minister's contention is that funds must be provided for development purposes.  Obviously the purchase of a valve set is out of the question for the majority of farmers; there are exceptions, of course, and you will have a limited number of farmers who are in a position to purchase valve sets.  The crystal set, which is the cheapest set, is capable of receiving up to a radius of twenty miles from the station, and in that case crystal sets would not be suitable for the remote districts of the Saorstát.</P>
      <P>If we are to tap the areas that Deputy Baxter and I want tapped, it is a question of having more transmission stations, and we will need a fund for such development.  Is this method that is suggested the most suitable for establishing a fund for development so that new stations can be erected and people in remote districts will be able to listen-in on cheap crystal sets?  That is the important question.  The present difficulty is that people living in remote districts must have a valve set if they desire to listen-in to Dublin.  The average farmer would not mind very much the difference between thirty shillings and forty shillings when buying a set; but he would object to paying £15 for a valve set.  If you are to get over that difficulty you must have new re-laying stations.  To erect them will cost money, and this method provides for the beginning of a fund which will enable further stations to be established.  Then crystals sets, which are not appreciably affected by this duty, will be available for the poorer districts.</P>

      <P>If I was not afraid that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would use it unfairly against me, I would say that I think the State, having taken over control of broad. <Col N="211" /> casting, will ultimately have to make broadcasting available for crystal set users everywhere.  I would not like the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to use that unfairly.  There is a good deal to be said on this question of a high-power station, although I understand that the Daventry station gave disappointing results as to the radius at which it reached crystal holders.  I heard certain reports about Daventry which led me to believe that we should go ahead with a high-power station like Daventry somewhere in the centre of the country; but later things that I heard indicate that the range of Daventry, as far as crystal sets were concerned, was not as great as at first reported.  If there is an advance made in wireless telegraphy which would make it possible, even by an expensive high-power station, to reach crystal set holders over the larger portion of the Saorstát, then I think that we ought certainly to provide such a station.  In any case, I think we ought to develop in this matter.  I am not so keen on making this particular thing a charge on the general taxpayer so far as development is concerned.  I feel that some of the revenue necessary for it should come out of broadcasting itself.  I believe that the difference between our attitude, as it were, and the attitude that perhaps Deputy Baxter indicated was that his does not lead to any change except the continuance of the present position.  We propose to make a charge and to have a development fund.</P>

The money that the State has to pay out benefits a few <Col N="212" /> favoured citizens in Dublin and Cork, who alone are to have the advantages because in the remote parts of the country very few can afford to pay £25 at least, and anything up to £40 for a receiving set.

Let those people assist in creating a fund. Later on is your policy to be extended so that other people around will be in a position to put in sets that will cost what the crystal sets cost to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is very unfair, and it will call for a good deal of criticism from the majority of people.  If the policy of the Ministry is that a station is to be erected in Cork I suppose that when Cork is satisfied the rest of the country can wait.  I suggest to the Ministry that if their attitude in this matter is as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs himself understands it, that only two stations are to be erected, if these two stations are to be availed of to any considerable extent by people in outlying districts, they must purchase costly sets.  I think if your policy is against these people in one matter it should not be against them in both things, and I suggest that some <Col N="213" /> consideration should be given them in the matter of this tax on broadcasting sets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest respect for Deputy Baxter, and I am rejoiced to find that he is against this resolution.  But I am afraid that he is in conflict not only with the laws of the Minister for Finance, but also in conflict with the natural laws when he talks about getting as good reception in Connemara as in Dublin.  I believe it is established that the people in mountainous districts cannot get as good reception as might be got, say, in Dublin. To get a good reception they would need a station for practically every house.  It may be possible to get over these difficulties with the advance in broadcasting, but I believe that at the present time there are complaints that they cannot get the Dublin station very well in Wicklow or Wexford, because of the Dublin mountains.</P>
      <P>That being so we want to proceed cautiously, and, above all things&mdash; there I have Deputy Baxter with me&mdash; we want to develop the wireless habit. But we shall not develop the wireless habit by making the possession of wireless sets more costly.  The broadcasting station being only in operation for four months I consider that the Minister might well wait for a certain period before imposing this duty.  It may be ultimately necessary, but I think it is a little early in the day now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to return to my previous point as to the people who paid £1 licence duty for crystal sets.  The Minister, in refusing to give the benefit of this reduction to the people who have already got their licences, is putting a premium on law breaking. The people who obeyed the law and paid their licence duty of £1 on 1st January will get no refund.  I do not know whether this becomes law under the Finance Bill or the Broadcasting Bill, but as soon as it becomes law those who have crystal sets will pay the 10/- licence.  That is to say, those people who have not taken out their licences but defied the authority of the State in so far as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs represents the State&mdash;and in this matter he does&mdash;will have a <Col N="214" /> financial advantage of ten shillings over the people who did their duty and backed up the Government.

I do not see any difficulty there, and I do not see any point in the alteration consequent on the reduction of the crystal licence. Deputy Baxter is insistent that the State ought to extend wireless facilities to the country generally.  Nobody quarrels with that.  As a matter of fact, I have repeatedly stated that every step is being taken to expedite that idea.  It will take some time to erect a series of wireless stations; even if we should not proceed with the chain of small stations which we had originally in mind, but on the contrary instal a high-power station like Daventry, that also will take time to consider. I want to say that there is no question of trying to differentiate as between the residents of Dublin and the residents of Connemara in this matter.  We regard it as vital to the progress of education and enlightenment in the country to build up this broadcasting chain as quickly as possible. We have lost no time and we are losing no time, but if you want to place a real impediment in the way of progress you will deprive the Post Office of the necessary funds, you will place a charge on the general fund, and you will raise a cry in the country from those who have not any great sympathy with broadcasting.

It may not be quite as effective as the installation of a station of the Daventry type, but it will be very much cheaper. Either one or other of these programmes will be persevered with, and I put it to the House that it is the duty of the people who are getting the benefit of broadcasting to pay the piper.</P>

      <P>I do not altogether hold with Deputy Baxter with regard to the cost of a valve apparatus. I think it can be got in almost any part of the country at a figure considerably less than that which he has mentioned. A valve set sufficient to enable you to hear Dublin or Belfast can be bought in almost any part of the country for under £10, I should say.  I rose for the reason that there seemed to be an underlying wrong opinion both in what the Minister for Lands and Agriculture and the Minister for Finance said.  I think that they are both approaching this matter from a wrong point of view.  They seem to be contemplating <Col N="216" /> the preparation of a fund in order to prepare stations.  I think that that is looking at it from a wrong angle.</P>
      <P>You want to arrange it so that when you put a station in a particular district, in order to feed that district, the revenue from that district shall pay the expense of running the station and provide a proper sinking fund in order to meet the cost of the station. If you approach the question with the idea of obtaining the money first and then putting up the station it will be a long time indeed before you meet the requirements of the country.  But when you consider whether you can put up a relay station, such as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has been talking about, with only the number of licence fees that you may draw from that district to provide you with funds to pay current expenses and to provide a proper reserve fund, quite a small relay station would be necessary, and I do not think there would be such a long delay at all.  I object to the resolution principally because of the delay in the development of wireless reception and the benefits that will come from it to the farmer, and because it does not tend to encourage them as we want to encourage them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a slight misunderstanding has arisen.  When we talked of a fund we were not really thinking of a capital fund but of a fund to meet current expenditure. I think anywhere we start a station there will be a loss at first.  For some time no station that is put up anywhere will result in sufficient licences being taken out to pay for the running of that station.  Our idea is to provide £20,000 or so that may be used for the running costs of new stations, so that, as a matter of fact, this proposal will really hasten development.  If we had not some fund like this we would not feel inclined to take the money out of the Exchequer in the ordinary way, but we would wait until we were sure that the loss on the stations we had would be some figure smaller, by £20,000 at any rate, than we could afford for the future.  In regard to the question of the use of sets for scientific purposes, I believe it possible to insert amendments at a later stage that would make <Col N="217" /> it comparatively easy for bodies like universities or other teaching institutions to get what they require.  With reference to what Deputy Baxter said, I do not want to talk too much about the £30 set; it is most probable that the £30 set had already paid 33? per cent. furniture duty.</P>

      <P>One thing seems to have emerged from this discussion, that is, that the system that has been in operation in the Post Office for some years with regard to other matters has been carried into effect in this, and that is that the rural community should bear the whole expense, without any charge at all to the favoured few who lived in the charmed circle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I am afraid I do not quite follow what the Minister means.  At any rate, the whole thing resolves itself into this: that the owner of every crystal set in the neighbourhood of a power station getting an equally good service to that given to the owner of a valve set out in the rural districts is to get off with a reduction of ten shillings in the licence.  Those in <Col N="218" /> the rural districts, because of the distance they live from the power station, will still be obliged to get valve sets and will have to pay the old tax.  The proposal, as I understand it, is that the difference between the old tax and the tax that the owner of the crystal set will have to pay, is to be set aside to create a fund to meet further developments, and to provide for additional power stations in order to enable people in the rural districts, when the power stations are extended, to be able to get a service on a crystal set.  Is not that what the proposal amounts to? You want the users of valve sets to create a fund to pay for the development of wireless stations all over the country in order that people living in the rural areas may be able eventually to get a service on a crystal set.  To me that seems that you want one section of the community to pay for all&mdash; the people who have had the pluck and the enterprise to buy valve sets.  These are the people that you are going to ask to provide all the facilities for the rest of the community.  Perhaps the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would call that equity.  I imagine that would be his idea on the matter.  From the peculiar bent of his mind I would expect nothing else from him.  It does not matter what the cost of the valve set is, whether it be £15, £20 or £30; the real point is the distinction made between the one set and the other.  If wireless telegraphy is going to be developed, it ought to be at the national expense, and not at the expense of a few individuals.</P>

Deputy Baxter denies that, and says that the poor farmer cannot afford it.  That is the dilemma that I find Deputy Gorey in.  What is the position actually?  A tax is proposed here.  Objection has been entered by Deputy Thrift on a very reasonable ground with regard to apparatus that may be used in educational institutions, and an allowance is to be made for that.  Outside that, there is a tax proposed.  Deputy Baxter, as far as I can gather, wants that tax remitted.</P>

      <P>Deputy Baxter's objection to this tax was apparently based on the possibility of preventing wireless being at the disposal of people in remote districts.  I fear he has not examined the position clearly.  I fail to see how the small farmers or tradesmen can afford to put in a valve set, especially if one considers the position of agriculture in the country for the last twelve months.  I believe this duty will help to create a fund by which there will be relay stations or else a central power station which will place wireless at the disposal of the people in the remote districts in the country.  We are also aware of the fact that it is quite possible that the advance made in wireless with the crystal set will make it available at a distance of four hundred and fifteen miles.  I believe there is going to be an advance in wireless, and naturally it will have advanced to such a degree that those near Cork or Dublin only will not have the sole advantage, but also people in remote districts, and if Deputy Baxter has the interest of those latter people at heart, he should ask that those who are in a position to put in an expensive set should pay the tax so that the smaller people in whom he is interested would be able to make use of the crystal set which they may purchase. By creating a fund you will be able to have a central or relay station so that the crystal set will be available to the farmers or smaller people in the remote districts in Ireland.  I say resolution No. 9, therefore, is going to effect what Deputy Baxter has at heart. that is the placing of wireless at the disposal of the smaller people who cannot afford to put in a valve set.</P>

      <P>Deputy D'Alton's argument is that this tax will eventually bring the possessor of a crystal set in distant parts of the country into contact with the broadcasting station.  He said: &ldquo;let the people in the country who own valve sets provide the funds to do that.&rdquo;  That would be very good if he also said that before you started to do that the people in Dublin and Cork who have crystal sets should provide the money.  The State has provided a station in Dublin and the owners of crystal sets there get services which are provided out of the common fund.  Now the country people are to provide the funds which will eventually give them the same facilities.</P>

      <P>Yes.  That is not a fair proposition.  If future developments brought the holder of a crystal set into communication with a station three or four hundred miles away there would not be very much to say against the resolution.  It is, however, a case of &ldquo;live horse and get grass.&rdquo;  We consider that the better way would be to make the people in the neighbourhood of cities provide the funds, that is, let them pay for what they have already and afterwards, when you provide <Col N="222" /> similar facilities for people in the country, they also can pay for them.  Do not, however, ask them to pay for something which they may get in the future when, at the same time, dwellers in the city are getting something for nothing.</P>

    <P>(a)  vehicles in respect of which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that seventy-five per cent. of the cost of producing the vehicle is attributable to manufacturing operations performed thereon or in relation thereto in Saorstát Eireann, £10.</P>

    <P>If any person proves to the satisfaction of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that he has paid in respect of any vehicle to which this paragraph applies, the duty chargeable under this paragraph and that the engine of the vehicle was constructed before the 1st day of January, 1913, he shall be entitled to repayment of twenty-five per cent. of the duty so paid.</P>
    <P>The most interesting part of this resolution is the Schedule.  In the Schedule to the resolution are set out the charges which it is proposed to levy in respect of motor vehicles.  In the case of 'buses and char-a-banes the increase is not very considerable.  Deputies will see that the duty on tramcars is not touched.  The duty on cars seating more than six but not more than fourteen persons, it is proposed to make £28, the existing tax being £24. In fact, right on down the list the increase is simply an increase of £4 in each stage.  We propose to make the charge £40 where it was £36, £52 where it was £48, and £64 where it was £60. With regard to the other vehicles, however, there is a considerable difference. In the first category are electrically-propelled vehicles, which do not exceed 25 cwt. in weight unladen.  The tax in that case was £6, and it remains as it was.  In the second category are vehicles other than these electrically-propelled vehicles.  In the case of vehicles not exceeding 12 cwt. in weight unladen, the tax was £10, and it remains the same; where these vehicles exceed 12 cwt. but do not exceed one ton, the tax which was £16, remains as it was.  We now come to the changes.  The tax on these vehicles exceeding one ton but not exceeding two tons was £21, and we propose to make it £30; exceeding two tons but not exceeding three tons&mdash;it was £25, and we propose to make it £45; exceeding three tons but not exceeding four tons&mdash;it was £28 and we propose to make it £60; exceeding four tons but not exceeding five tons&mdash;it was £30, and we propose to make it £75.  Thirty pounds was the maximum, no matter how the weight increased.  We have <Col N="227" /> added two higher sums: exceeding five tons but not exceeding six tons&mdash;the tax is to be £90.  Up to the £75 point our proposed scale is the same as the scale in Northern Ireland, except that instead of £75 they have an £80 tax, but their tax does not begin at one ton. It begins at one and a quarter tons, and ends with one and a quarter tons, so that the £80 tax would be for a vehicle exceeding four and a quarter tons, and not exceeding five and a quarter tons. As I have said, the tax on a vehicle exceeding five tons and not exceeding six tons is to be £90.  The former figure was, of course, £30, and the Northern Ireland scale is £100.  For vehicles exceeding six tons the tax is to be £105, the Northern tax being £100.</P>
    <P>In the next section of the schedule we do not interfere with bicycles, invalid cars or heavy tractors.  They are merely mentioned in paragraphs 1, 2, and 4.  Our new scale applies to motor vehicles other than those vehicles in respect of which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that 75 per cent. of the cost of producing the vehicle is attributable to manufacturing operations performed thereon or in relation thereto in Saorstát Eireann. There the tax is £10.  That at present applies to the Ford car only.  The old minimum was £6 for 6 h.-p. or under. We have raised the minimum charge on cars from £6 to £8 and then, from £8 onwards, it is £1 for each unit or part of a unit of horse-power.  We exempt taxis from a higher tax than £20.  IIeretofore, a taxi which did not seat more than six people paid £12. That was a flat £12 rate.  We propose to charge them as private cars for the future with this exemption&mdash;that the upper limit shall not exceed £20.  It was thought undesirable that a certain class of taxi, which might serve purposes of utility and be an attraction to tourists, should be put off the road by a high tax.  There are probably very few of these vehicles and the amount of tax involved is not very large.</P>
    <P>The rebate allowed in respect of engines constructed before 1st January, 1913, is continued, because it is intended, by Order, to go back to the <Col N="228" /> method of calculating horse-power which was in use prior to January, 1923.  When I was Minister for Local Government, the basis for calculation of horse-power was changed.  It was changed because the British basis of the bore was extremely unfavourable to the Ford car.  It meant that the Ford car was paying £23 when what you might call the corresponding car was paying only about £10 or £11.</P>
    <P>We adopted the new basis of cubic capacity of the cylinder instead of bore, and that new basis gave the reduction to £18 for the Ford car.  It operated to reduce the tax on most cars as well. There were a few increases, but, in general, the new basis we adopted reduced the taxation on cars.  It is proposed to go back to that new basis which will give something over 15 per cent., in general, in additional taxation, on cars other than Ford cars. Going back to that makes it necessary to continue the rebate made on engines before 1913, because they were engines of a very wide bore.  They were made before the manufacturers began to adopt the make of their engines to pay as little tax as possible, and they would pay an extremely high rate.  It is an exemption which is in existence.  It would not have been necessary to continue it if it was not intended to go back to the old basis of calculating horse-power.</P>
    <P>The changes we have made in regard to char-a-bancs and goods vehicles will give us, it is calculated&mdash;having statistics of the numbers and various weights in existence&mdash;an all-round fifty per cent. increase in the amount of taxation paid by these vehicles.  I think that is not unfair at all, because, as a matter of fact, it is that class of vehicle that does damage to the roads. As Deputies will see, we have not increased the tax on the lighter vehicles. Any vehicle not exceeding a ton weight will pay as heretofore; on the vehicle not exceeding two tons the tax has not gone up so tremendously&mdash;it is gone up £9.  On ordinary roads the ordinary private car does not do a lot of damage. The damage is mostly done by the heavier vehicles, and we feel it is fair that a fairly substantial tax should be extracted, and that perhaps the really <Col N="229" /> heavier ones should be discouraged somewhat.</P>
    <P>The net result of the changes proposed in this resolution, taken with the next resolution, will be that there will be about £133,000 extra for the Road Fund.  We believe that that substantial addition to the Road Fund will ultimately help to bring about a very considerable reduction in local taxation.</P>
    <P>It is, as I said, proposed to borrow on the strength of the Road Fund, and to carry out works of a somewhat substantial character over a considerable mileage of roads.  That, for all practical purposes, is only made possible by an increase of the Road Fund, because, as a matter of fact, there must be a year to year distribution.  That is a practical necessity.  In order to have a substantial borrowing this increase, or some increase, in the Road Fund was necessary.  With the borrowing now possible, and the prospect of a fairly considerable increase in the Road Fund, we believe it will be possible to put the roads into such a condition that the maintenance cost will be lower, and we can probably get to this position: that the cost to the rates of the roads will not be more than 50 or 60 per cent. over the pre-war cost to the rates.  If we can do that, we will be in a not unsatisfactory position at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think he is to be congratulated upon this particular resolution?  The amount of the increase that he proposes&mdash; £133,000&mdash;is to try to make good the damage that has been done and is likely to be done to the roads of the country.  In my opinion, this is only a drop in the ocean to meet the situation. An increase of a flat rate of £4 on charabancs is no good whatsoever, and does not at all meet the situation. It is a very doubtful matter whether charabancs are not more damaging to the roads than very heavy lorries.  They can go much faster, carry heavy loads. As a matter of fact, any road on which they travel is the first that breaks up. I think there is very little doubt in anybody's mind that this class of traffic is more damaging than the heavy lorries. Where they travel you have regular graves along the road, not merely <Col N="230" /> pot holes.  I say that this £4 flat rate increase is only tinkering with the question.  It is not an honest attempt to deal with the matter.  I should like to get from the Minister, in connection with heavy lorries, the comparative figures for the several classes of vehicles.</P>

There is no tax higher than £30 at present, so that there are no comparative figures for the remainder: Five tons to six tons, £90; exceeding six tons, £105.  I should mention that the existing duty on a trailer is £2, and it will be increased to £12.</P>

      <P>Here we have a more serious attempt to deal with the problem. The tax is not anything like what it should be and not at all as much as a fuel tax would give.  The most that a six-ton lorry would be able to do would be between five and six miles to the gallon. A fuel tax on that class of lorry would produce more than is proposed here.</P>

He said the reason for not adopting it was the difficulty in administration. That, however, should not stand in the way of equity.  If the matter were approached properly there would be very little difficulty.  The Road Advisory Board was advised that there would be little or no difficulty.</P>

      <P>The Minister speaks about £133,000 meeting the situation. Perhaps the Minister for Local Government will tell us the cost per mile for constructing an ordinary trunk road, say from Dublin to Naas, by any of the new methods.  He has made experiments out there, some of them good, some of them probably not so good.  Some of these methods, or even a better method, will have to be adopted in order that the roads will be able to bear the traffic in future.  These experiments are costing up to 16/- per square yard.  I do not know how many yards in width the roads are.  If the Minister will tell us what the construction of these roads cost per mile, we will be able to form an idea as to how far this £133,000 will go to meet the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only fair to examine the Deputy's concluding remarks.  The £133,000 is not intended to make good the cost of this service.  What we had in mind was the amount contributed by the rates towards the upkeep of the roads in 1914.  That sum amounted to about £670,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>£695,000, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Excluding what we will call the incidence of the motor traffic on the roads, the actual cost to the ratepayers, excluding boroughs and urban districts, was £670,000.  The question then arises as to what is the fair charge, by reason of the changed conditions, and 60 per cent. has been estimated as a fair increase.  That brings that particular amount to about £1,100,000.  In considering this matter, perhaps the best estimate to go on would be the estimated cost of the upkeep of the roads last year, including the contributions from the <Col N="232" /> rates and from the Road Fund.  That might be calculated by adding those two sums together, and that amounts to about one and three-quarter millions. The Road Fund contribution last year was about £540,000, and in order not to place a higher burden on the rates, you want a sum approximately of £650,000 or £680,000&mdash;I forget the exact figure.  The difference then between the income from the Road Fund last year and the figure in question, is approximately £133,000, and that sum is made up by the new scale of charges, including the increase in the drivers' licence.</P>
      <P>In his statement this evening the Minister for Finance stated that a capital sum of about two million pounds was to be provided for our road programme, leaving a sufficient sum to deal with counties in respect of which this capital sum might not be spent. The condition of the roads at present does not warrant all the criticism that we hear from platforms and from writers in the Press.  The roads are in a fairly satisfactory condition.  I have had, perhaps, as much experience as anybody else in motoring over the roads.  I think I have covered something like 25,000 miles a year for the last three years.  There has been a marked improvement in the condition of the roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking all these things into consideration, the number of counties in which the roads are in excellent condition considerably outnumbers those in which the roads are not in good condition.  This is a road programme which will possibly require some revision, but it is a constructive attempt to deal with the problem. When this programme is completed, we will have roads which can only be surpassed&mdash;if they are surpassed&mdash;by one country in Europe&mdash;England.  When speaking of roads here people usually compare them with English roads. There is a difference between Continental and English roads.  The Irish roads are better than the Continental roads.  They are not as good as the English roads.  A great many visitors from the Continent who travelled over our roads, and quite a number of Americans that I have met, have expressed some surprise that we did not consider our roads to be in very good condition.  They have been more than astonished on various occasions, when told that certain roads were bad, to find they were in good condition.</P>
      <P>The average price which may be estimated in respect of re-conditioning a road would be about £2,500 per mile. The cost of doing a road in the same way as it was done in Merrion Street or the Naas Road from Inchicore would be much higher than £2,500 per mile, but the average cost may be said to be that amount.  The Roads Engineer is satisfied that a very considerable improvement in the main and trunk roads will be effected by the expenditure of a sum of £2,000,000.  Deputy Gorey suggested a tax on fuel.  The Minister has dealt with the possibility of the introduction of some other forms of spirit than that which would be specified.  Apart from that there are other users of petrol, stationary engine owners, dyers, cleaners and other people of that sort.</P>

      <P>Very little, but I understand the experience of people who had to deal with applications for rebate when the fuel tax was on was <Col N="234" /> that the expense of the distribution of the money practically equalled, if it did not exceed, the amount handed back.  In addition to that we have a Border 250 miles in length, and it can be quite understood what difficulties would ensue in examining a quantity of petrol going out in a particular car and examining the quantity in it coming back.  There is also the inducement to smuggling, and very many other complications.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Poteen is a spirit that I never consumed and that I would not advise anyone else to consume. There are two very strong arguments against the fuel tax.  There is the fact that there is manufactured in this country one particular type of car, which, experts say, consumes a considerable amount of petrol.  The incidence of the tax in that case would not make that car an attractive proposition to prospective purchasers. That is a consideration we cannot afford to overlook.  The exports of that firm's manufactures represent about 80 or 90 per cent. of their entire output.  That is one of the most economic propositions in the State.  It can be seen that if a few more concerns of that kind were established in the country it would be a distinct economic advantage.  Something should be done to stimulate the purchase of such cars in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very satisfactory engine.  I have never seen it fail to take a hill and I have seen other very expensive cars unable to climb hills.  Motoring may be divided, I suppose, roughly into three or four classes.  The first class consists of persons who require a motor for business. The second class consists of those persons who combine business with pleasure.  The third class are <Col N="235" /> those who run goods vehicles, including charabancs.  The other class would be persons who use a car only during the week-ends.  A case has been made in respect of the latter class, that the annual tax bears unfairly on them. What do they ask?  They ask for excellent roads to be provided for seven days of the week but they use them only one or two days and for luxury purposes.  They are entitled to do so but their contribution towards the upkeep of the roads would be very small if the fuel tax only were imposed. The last point I have to deal with is that concerning charabancs.  Deputy Gorey thinks that the tax is not sufficiently high.</P>

      <P>At the present moment I have three cars and my contribution in respect of tax is considerable. I think if Deputy Gorey takes the average weight in respect of the charabancs and compares that with the goods vehicle he will find a very close parity between the two.  The charabanc is an attraction.  There are comparatively few of them in the State.  They are used only in the summer months.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not arrived yet.  It is a tourist traffic proposition, and as such it is undesirable to tax unduly that particular form of income to the country.  I suppose it is generally known that on the Continent the charabanc is, perhaps, the cheapest possible form of travelling.  It is possible to drive something like 20 or 30 miles there for 2/6.  Any steep increase in the incidence of the tax in respect of charabancs might injure the tourist traffic which it is desired to stimulate in this country.  But even taking it that you were satisfied that something should be done, it would be unfair to make a higher charge in respect of the charabanc than for goods vehicles.  If <Col N="236" /> you are calculating the damage that is done to the roads&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has outlined the road policy on this particular resolution, and perhaps it is just as well that we should know exactly how the finances of that fund are being dealt with.  I notice that the Minister has forgotten that there has been a 6d. tax levied on all ratepayers for the last three or four years so that this great advantage we are getting of £600,000 by way of additional agricultural grant, is merely returning to the ratepayers the 6d. tax that they have been paying during that period.  It balances exactly, and so far as we are concerned, it is of no use.  It is only giving us our own money back.  If it is the right policy to pass compensation for damage on to the future, why should the ratepayers for the past four years have had to contribute £300,000 yearly out of revenue for damage to roads, while in the case of other property it is to be all passed on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you include that £300,000 in the figures for the roads, you will find that the contributions from the ratepayers should not be anything like sixty per cent.  On £670,000 a sixty per cent. increase gives £1,073,000.  The new duties, plus the £300,000 and the sixpenny tax, would total £800,000.  That would give you close on two million pounds per annum, but last year it was only £1,700,000. In respect of the ratepayers, sixty per cent. is too large an addition to the 1914 rate, and is not doing justice to <Col N="237" /> them.  We are not quite so pleased with that part of the programme.  If you said that the increase in our selling price was 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. it would be nearer to the truth.</P>

      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on his efforts to encourage the manufacture of motor cars in Ireland.  He is evidently putting what appears to be a flat rate of £10 per car, no matter what its horse-power. That is how I understand his speech. We have a company manufacturing motor cars in Ireland, and they export 80 per cent. of their output, not in cars, but in parts.  These parts are made into the perfect car.  A great many of these cars return to Ireland, and the company complain they have to pay a duty to England on the parts imported there, and to Ireland on the complete car which is returned to Ireland. In paragraph (a), section 3, it is stated that any vehicle which to the satisfaction of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health consists of 75 per cent. of work done in Ireland shall be subject to the duty of £10. How is a buyer of one of those cars, which is made of parts which were manufactured in Ireland, assembled in England, and returned to Ireland as a perfect car, to prove to the Minister that that particular car, though of the same make as the whole car manufactured in Ireland, contains 75 per cent. of work that has been done in Ireland? There is a conundrum for the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with some remarks made by the President in his comparison of the expenditure on roads at present with the expenditure in 1914.  He has tried to compare the total expenditure, regardless altogether of how it was spent then and how it is spent now, and regardless altogether of the condition of the main body of the roads in the country then as compared with their present condition.  When Ministers speak of 1914 they ought to remember that the roads in every county, both main roads and by-roads, and no matter <Col N="239" /> how small the by-roads, were of uniform quality.  They were all reasonably good, and the main road of its class was no better than the by-road of its class.  Will the Minister or somebody tell us authoritatively how much of the money of the people is now spent on main roads, and how much on the by-roads, and how do these figures compare with 1914?  I would say, subject to correction, that practically all the money is now spent on main roads, and that the by-roads are neglected, or very nearly so.  The totals that have been given to us are absolutely misleading. I hope somebody in authority will be able to give us the exact figures showing the proportions spent on the different classes of roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the incidence of charge that would fall on the main and trunk roads on the one hand, and on the other roads on the other hand, there are 8,400 miles of main and trunk roads, and there are 38,000 miles odd of the other roads, making in all something like 46,000 or 47,000 miles.  The estimated cost of the upkeep of the 38,000 odd miles at the rate of one shilling per perch, is £612,000.  It is calculated the balance would be sufficient for the main roads in respect of the capital expenditure, and the other sum of £300,000 will be in the Road Fund, having met the liabilities in respect to capital expenditure. I wonder have I made it clear to Deputy Gorey?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go over it again.  The total cost at 1/- per perch, to deal with the 38,000 miles, is £612,000.  The maintenance in respect of the main roads is estimated at a cost of £60 per mile.  That for 8,400 miles would total £504,000.  That makes a total sum of £1,116,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is spent now.  That is the second calculation as to how the £1,116,000 would be spent.  The difference between the £1,116,000 and the £1,750,000 is £633,000 odd, of which £223,000 would be absorbed in dealing with principal <Col N="240" /> and interest on the £2,000,000 capital expenditure on the roads, leaving £300,000 for big construction work, apart and separate from capital charges in respect of the capital sum.</P>

      <P>I admit that the condition of a lot of the main roads where work has been done in recent times is better but considerable stretches of the main roads of the country are impassable, even of the trunk roads from here to Cork.  The condition of the main road between Callan and Clonmel inside the Tipperary border, is such that it would knock the teeth out of the Minister himself and out of his car. I also take exception to the flat rate.  I do not care what argument is used to justify it.  It cannot be justified&mdash;a flat rate on cars and on lorries.  For lorries used frequently, that are all day on the road, that make two or three journeys a day, it will be all right, but in the case of a lorry which is used only occasionally, sometimes used by farmers to bring their lambs here to market, how is it suggested that they should pay this tax?  They will make very little use of their lorries, perhaps not a dozen times in the year.  What equity is in that compared with the case of the lorry of the same description that is every day on the road?  What equity is there as between the private or other car that is used occasionally as compared with the President's 25,000 miles?  What is the value of a car to the man who does 2,000, or 3,000, miles compared with the President's 25,000, for that tax? There is no equity about it and it could not be justified.  This flat rate will never do justice either in the case of a <Col N="241" /> lorry or private car or any other fuel-propelled vehicle.  Many farmers throughout the country have got light lorries.</P>

It will be used very seldom and you can give up the idea of development in that direction.  They will not have it at this price.  If equity is any guide at all to Ministers, I think the sooner that they decide to face the motor fuel tax the better.  No matter what obstacles are in the way they can very easily get rid of them if they have a mind to do it.  They have got over greater difficulties than that, and if they make up their minds to get over this they can do it very easily.  I am not prepared at all to accept the comparisons that have been made between money expended on the roads at present and in 1914.

      <P>I do not want to deal with the question of the roads at this stage, but I want to make a suggestion regarding the proposed tax on other vehicles.  The third paragraph of this schedule intimates that it is proposed to make a charge of £10 in respect of vehicles of which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that seventy-five per cent. is attributable to manufacturing operations performed in the Saorstát.  I want to suggest that the same principles should be applied in respect of charabancs and 'buses, that is to say, that there should be a lower charge as an annual licence fee where it can be shown to the Minister responsible that the 'buses and charabancs have been manufactured, the main parts or any other part perhaps, even in respect of the bodybuilding, in Ireland.  I am sure Deputy Hewat, in view of the very big increase in the number of motor-buses, would support me in that proposition.  I think the business houses, the railway companies and the tramway companies, and the like, prepared to give assistance in respect of the building of bodies in this country, should have some encouragement in that action and inasmuch as the principle of preferential treatment is embodied in this very resolution, I urge that it should be made applicable in respect of these other classes, namely, 'buses, charabancs. I hope an opportunity will arise at later stages of this discussion to set forth that proposition in a more detailed form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The point has been brought to my notice more than once, that the method of collection in this matter of tax on cars at present is such that if a motor owner, a man making his living on a motor car, paid his tax at the beginning of the year, he gets off with perhaps £2 or £3 less than if he paid his tax quarterly.  It is very difficult to justify an extra £2 or £3 per year on a car if the owner decides to pay the first half-year's tax in two quarterly instalments and the last half-year's <Col N="243" /> tax at the beginning of the last half-year.  The work of administration is practically nothing, and why that extra charge is made in this case is very difficult to explain.  I think it is really no justification, and in as much as the the cost of collection is nothing more, and as the owner of the car is going to pay this tax before he goes out to use the road, because he must pay at the beginning of the quarter anyway, I think it is a matter that the Minister should reconsider and make some arrangements other than the arrangements that exist at present.</P>

It will be remembered that before the adjournment we pressed the Government for a definition and a clear statement of road policy in the immediate future. We got an assurance immediately before the adjournment that that road policy would be outlined in the Budget.

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  But I want the Committee to understand the policy of this resolution and what is embodied in it.  Page forty-two of the Minister's statement deals largely with the different figures that we have been discussing during the last hour on this resolution. I will just give you the opening words of the statement:&mdash;&ldquo;I now come to deal with what has been designated the road problem.&rdquo;  Then he proceeds to outline the Government's view on this road problem and the methods by which he hopes to deal with that problem, so that there is in this resolution, as I said, a great deal more than has been read into it by the preceding speakers.</P>
      <P>As I understand that road policy, as outlined in this resolution, it is very much on the lines of the road policy at the present moment.  The roads, as I understand it, are to be maintained by the local authorities.  These local authorities are to be assisted with a grant from the Government.  Now let us see where that leads us.  The roads have to be dealt with by the local authorities.  Take the road from Dublin to Dunlaoghaire.  It is some six miles. That road is known to most of us. That particular roadway comes within the jurisdiction of four local authorities&mdash;four local authorities in six miles.</P>

These four local authorities have four staffs, four sets of plant, for dealing with six miles of main roadway, plus by-roads, and I may say that in addition to having four local authorities you have four methods of dealing with the roadways, very different in character.  I only quote that to show the Deputies what this system of road maintenance, as outlined in this resolution, means.  I, for one, most strongly object to that method of dealing with our roads.  I have contended from the start that our roadways ought be under one authority.  To set up a series of plants, a series of staffs, a series of methods for dealing with our roadways all over the country is the most wasteful system that I can conceive.  I want that aspect of the question to be considered before we pass this resolution.  Let me just give you one example, one unfortunate example of that method of dealing with roads.  In the South of Ireland there is a great deal of limestone in many of the local areas.  In order to give employment in a particular local area every surveyor dealing with that local area has to use the local quarries. If he attempted to say that that limestone is unsuitable he possibly would hear other views from the labour representatives or the local authorities. That being so, he is compelled to use what is admittedly unsuitable material for modern roadmaking.  I think even the President, who stands as the largest user of roads in this particular gathering, will agree that limestone roads blow away in the summer time and turn into mud in the winter time.  Anybody who has any experience of roadmaking will agree that that is a most unsuitable material.  The present system compels those authorities to use that unsuitable material.  The approval of this resolution maintains that system.  These are points that I hope will be elucidated more fully when we get to the clauses in the Bill, but I only want to point out to the Deputies exactly what that means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President has been good enough to give us some figures in connection with the cost of roads.  He mentioned <Col N="246" /> what roads cost in 1926&mdash;£1,750,000. He said that in 1914 the roads cost £670,000 to maintain.  I hope I am quoting the figures correctly.  If you take the difference between the two figures you have an increase of £1,080,000 this year as against 1914.  That increase falls very largely on the local authorities. Take, in conjunction with that figure, the fact that within the last two years the rates levied by local authorities have increased by 30 per cent.  The figures given in the Dáil by the Minister for Finance showed that in 1922-23 local taxation per head amounted to £1 3s. 1d., and in the year 1924-25 it was £1 13s. 5d., or an increase of 30 per cent.</P>

      <P>I just want to couple the two.  We are laying burdens on local authorities for the maintenance of roads.  I hold the increase in the expenses of local authorities has very largely accrued from the increased cost of road maintenance.  That is not right in principle, and I want to get that burden off the shoulders of the local authorities, not alone from the financial point of view, but from the point of view of having the work done thoroughly and in the most economical manner.  I think it is advisable to get the burden off the shoulders of local authorities.</P>

      <P>When we are considering this resolution I hope those points will be given attention.  I do not want to press those points unduly at the moment. There is also involved in this question of roadways the problem of the size of vehicles.  Some motor lorry bodies and many charabanc bodies have attained such dimensions that practically no other road user can use by-roads in many districts.  That is a point that ought to be dealt with.  Not alone should we limit the weight of these vehicles, but we should also limit their size so that other road users will be able to use the by-roads in addition to users of charabanc and motor lorries.</P>

If it can be shown to the Minister that the engine of any vehicle was manufactured prior to January 1st, 1913, the owner of that vehicle shall be refunded 25 per cent. of the motor duty.  I have not been able to find out when the present system of taxation became operative; I should think it has been in force from four to five years.</P>

      <P>This principle was, no doubt, in operation when the Act came into force.  I take it that an engine seven years old in 1919 was entitled to a refund of 25 per cent. of the duty. That principle has been maintained in each Budget.  I hold that if an engine manufactured in 1913 was entitled to a remission of 25 per cent. of duty in 1919, the same principle should hold good to-day in respect of engines of a similar age.  The year of manufacture will, of course, have to be advanced, and in the circumstances an engine manufactured in 1916 or 1917 should be entitled to a remission of 25 per cent. duty.  The users of old engines and old chassis should be given some advantage. I think that is a point that was overlooked.</P>

      <P>There is a comparatively small but important matter in connection with the third paragraph of the resolution to which I would like to refer.  We are all pleased and satisfied that the Minister has reduced the tax on the Ford car to £10.  There will, however, be pretty general objection to what is tantamount to an increase in the tax on other cars.  That, I assume, will be the effect of the proposal to take the horse-power as a unit of taxation and charge £1 for each unit of horse-power as against the present system.  This will hit especially the cheap American car, the car that comes next in price to the Ford.  This particular type of car is made in the United States and in Canada.  It includes such makes as the Chevrolet, the Overland and the Maxwell.  These cars generally reach 20 or 21 horse-power; they are rated at that horse-power. Very much more powerful and more expensive cars are built in Britain and are rated at 14 and 16 horse-power. The tax on these cars will be much cheaper than the tax on cheap American and Canadian cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no justification for increasing the present rate on these cars. There is an average increase of £3, and when you have that in addition to the proposed increase which comes in under the next resolution, increasing driving licence from 5/- to £1, it will be a very considerable increase in taxation on this particular type of car <Col N="249" /> user, because the majority of these people will be in the class the President spoke of&mdash;using the cars mainly for their own business.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister might very well allow the present basis of taxation to continue in the case of cars other than the Ford.  He gave as a reason for adopting that system of 1922, or 1923, that it was in order to give a special advantage to the Ford car.  I think that the Ford car is getting a very substantial advantage in this resolution, that no good case is made for going back to the unit of horse-power, and that the tax as far as these cars are concerned should be left as it is.</P>

      <P>The concessions that the Minister has made with regard to the Ford car are very highly deserving and are very gratifying to me because the industry is so unique and so valuable.

      <P>It is proposed that the tax will come into operation in about a month.  It is not one of the things we can put into operation to-morrow, because certain administrative arrangements have to be made.  With regard to what Deputy O'Connell has said, the position is that it is, of course, the horse-power basis at present.  We are not altering the horse-power basis; what we propose to do is to go back to the old method of calculating the horse-power basis.  We calculate it, under an Order which I made as Minister for Local Government, on the cubic content of the cylinder.  Previously it was calculated on the bore of the cylinder, and we propose to go back to that. That will mean an increase in about 64 per cent. of cars; it will mean a decrease in about 24 per cent. of cars, and it will mean that about 16 per cent. of the cars will remain as they are.</P>

      <P>It possibly will.  I know that the Chevrolet is one of the cars that will be increased, but our reason for this was to get the £133,000 for the Road Fund.  We felt that more money was wanted for the Road Fund. At the same time we wanted to remove the handicap on the Ford car, and it was really a question of how we could best spread it out to get the money. This was the best conclusion we could arrive at.  Some suggestions might be made for improving it.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my pleasure at the fact that the Ford car has been dealt with.  Its case has been considered for a long time, and it laboured under a great disadvantage in having to pay a very heavy tax as compared with other cars.  It has now been put on the same level as a number of light English cars, and I welcome that.  I would be prepared to go even further because of the fact that the parts of the car are made in Ireland. I do not think Deputy O'Connell fully considered all that underlay his suggestion. If the Minister adopted this suggestion it would be a good thing for the Overland and other cars that he mentioned.  If a few hundred of these cars were brought into the country there would be a few hundred less Ford cars here, and in that case there would be, perhaps, a few score more Cork men walking the streets idle. That is a consideration that he should remember.  I remember Arthur Griffith stating that if we had power in Ireland to put on tariffs he was sure that the first thing an Irish Government would do would be to put a tax on foreign motor cars and enable an Irish industry to prosper as it should prosper. He said that in a few years under such a tax nine out of ten cars used in Ireland would be Irish made.  I would like to see a policy adopted that would lead to that result.  The policy as outlined in the Budget is a slight help to the Ford industry, but it will be a long time before we arrive at the result that Arthur Griffith hoped and wished for.  At all events it is on the right lines.  I welcome it, and I hope that the Minister will not take away any of the benefits which he is now conferring on the Ford car.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer the Minister back to the last paragraph, as well as Deputy Good.  This is the first time I ever heard this explanation that the Minister has given, and I was very keen on the matter when the Finance Act of 1920 came into vogue.  In common with Deputy Good, all the motorists that I have ever heard discussing it were of the opinion that it was to be a concession to poor men with old, second-hand cars on which they would not have to pay the full tax, and who would keep these cars on the road at a reduced tax.  I never heard the explanations given by the Minister or the President before.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter on the lines that I have suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can quarrel with the Minister's idea that articles manufactured in this country should get a preference, but I would ask the Minister to inform the Committee what is the reason, with all the advantages that the Ford car has already, in being free of duty in the country, that we pay £25 to £30 more in the Free State for it than is paid for the same car in Northern Ireland, where it has had to pay duty somewhere, and why it is possible to-day to buy a Ford car in Belfast and import it into Southern Ireland for practically the same price as the article manufactured in Cork? I hope that the Minister will go into that point.  Otherwise, with the reduction in tax, which I agree with in principle, he will only be assisting profiteering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to put the larger tax he is placing on the lorries on the 'buses, because there is no doubt about it&mdash;those of us who live in the northern end of the country have, perhaps, seen these 'buses more in operation than those in the southern part of the Free State&mdash;that for damage to <Col N="252" /> roads and for inconvenience to other road users they beat everything on the road.  I understand that in Northern Ireland there are 'buses to-day that can do, and have done, between sixty and sixty-five miles an hour.  The Minister will say that we have a remedy against that, that is, that the Gárdaí can take steps to stop it.  But the Gárdaí cannot be everywhere and it is on the open road that it happens, which is, perhaps, the best place where it could happen. But that is what is tearing up the roads.  You have a speed limit of 12 miles an hour for all heavy lorries, but is it ever enforced in the Free State? I never heard of it.  It is being enforced in the North, and Free State drivers find that when they go across the border.  I reckon that there is more damage done to the roads by the speed at which heavy lorries and 'buses travel than by the actual weight of them. The greatest inconvenience of all is the enormous width of these vehicles, particularly when you meet them on narrow roads.  In our end of the country we have not the fine wide roads that you have here about Dublin, and it would be very hard for the ordinary Deputy from this part of the country to visualise what he might meet with up in our part of the country.  It frequently happens that you have to pull right into the ditch and wait until one of these charabancs, lorries, or 'buses passes.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I wish to touch on, and it is the question of fines. I do not know whether, at this stage, it comes into the discussion, but I would ask the Minister to make some change in the method that obtains with regard to fines under the Motor Acts. The minimum fine, I think, for not taking out a licence is £20.  The usual procedure, when a case goes before the District Justice, is that he may think it a hard one in this respect that the person charged was only a fortnight or three weeks late in taking out the licence.  It means that the man has been caught a little bit earlier than usual.  The District Justice proposed to recommend the case to the mercy of the county council and the unfortunate members of the county council are written to and canvassed for weeks <Col N="253" /> asking them to reduce the fine.  The fine is reduced in nearly every case, so that in the end the fines for non-compliance with this regulation requiring people to take out the road tax, that we fix here, is practically a farce.</P>

      <P>I want to say that I do not think Deputy Sears need have the slightest fear that the change proposed by Deputy O'Connell would have the slightest influence in deciding whether a person would buy a Ford car or another car, because the amount is much too small.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell that the change proposed is rather a hardship on the owners of the cheap, small cars, and throws the incidence of taxation too much on them. If the Minister would examine the 64 per cent. that he told us about on which there would be an increase, due to the change, I am pretty certain he would find that it would go almost entirely on light small cars and the cheap class of car.  That means that, by this alteration, you are putting on that kind of car owner the burden of increased taxation that you propose to secure under this resolution.  You will find, too, I believe, that the dearer kind of cars are getting off rather lightly.  The cheap light car is going to suffer.  That is one objection I have to it.  There is another, proposing to change from the system to which people are getting more or less accustomed.  To make a change for a small advantage is not, I think advisable.  Unless there was some important reason for it, I do not think the change proposed is to be commended.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the appeal made by Deputy Johnson and not replied to by the Minister when he stood up to speak.  I refer to the question of motor body-building in the city of Dublin.  I would appeal to the Minister to allow the chassis, for ordinary touring cars, free into the Free State.  If the Minister were to do that, <Col N="254" /> it would be a great encouragement to body-builders in the city of Dublin as well as to the purchasers of cars to get Irish bodies built on their favourite chassis.  For instance, a man may want to have a Fiat chassis.  If that man thought that he could get the chassis in here free of duty he would, I am certain, have no hesitation whatever in getting an Irish body built on it.  It would be a great thing for the country if, instead of having English or French bodies on these cars, the work of body-building on them was done in Dublin.  What I suggest would be the means of providing work for many men in the city of Dublin who are now idle. The machinery is ready in the Dublin workshops to provide the best type of body in the United Kingdom on any chassis.</P>

      <P>I think the President knows more about that than I do. Our United Kingdom cars are coming in here every day of the week.  You have cars coming in every day of the week from the British Isles, and you have also French and American cars coming in.  If cars ready for the road, that come in here, were made pay a duty of 33 per cent., and if chassis were allowed to come in free of charge, our coach-building shops in Dublin would, I believe, be able to do very well.  I am pleased, of course, to see that the Ford car is getting an advantage, but that advantage will not mean anything to any part of Ireland with the exception of Cork.  The preference that has been given to the Ford car will be of no advantage to the Dublin coach-builders who are walking around our city streets idle.  I raised this point last year and the Minister said that he would look into it, but he never went further than that.  The suggestion I make of letting chassis in free would provide much-needed employment for our body-builders in the city of Dublin who are idle at the moment.  Motor bodies that I have seen built in Dublin are the best that could be seen in any part of the Kingdom I have been in, the United Kingdom or any part of the <Col N="255" /> British Isles.  I notice some Deputies are laughing, but some can laugh because they have got what they want for Cork.  The appeal I am making is on behalf of Dublin working men, and I urge on the Minister that he should not overlook the suggestion I have made.</P>

      <P>It is certainly a source of satisfaction to Deputies to find that the Minister has been able to do something to afford protection to the motor industry in Cork.  We are all Irish, and it really does not matter what part of the country benefits by the Budget.  I think we all ought to be deeply grateful for what the Minister has been able to do in that matter. With regard to the question of roads, it was also a source of satisfaction, I am sure, to every Deputy to hear the Minister for Finance admit that we have a road problem.  County Councils all over the Saorstát have it brought home to them week after week and month after month that there is a road problem, and a very serious one, too. To my mind, the efforts that the Ministry appear to be making in this Budget in order to deal with the road problem fall very short of the mark. To my mind increasing the taxation on large motor lorries is not at all making adequate provision for dealing with the road problem.  We must remember that we have also a very serious railway problem.  The railways at present are not paying their way, and eventually something will have to be done by the State to put the railways on a proper footing.  I think the greatest contribution the Government could make to the railway problem would be to remove, from the roads, motor lorries of over five tons all in.  At present the county councils in the Free State are not able to cope with the road problem, with any small degree of success, because the efforts they are making continually are spoiled by the heavy motor traffic which is ruinous to the roads.  It is apparent that the money spent on the roads for the last three or four years is only money thrown away because of this heavy traffic.  I think the Minister for Local Government will admit that he has received representations from a <Col N="256" /> great many county councils in the country asking him to prohibit heavy motor traffic on the roads altogether. If the Ministry are not preparel to prohibit heavy motor traffic on the main roads they ought at least to permit of the county councils prohibiting it.  The by-roads are a complete charge on the local ratepayer, and the Minister will not give them the authority to prevent heavy traffic on the by-roads.  It is a big problem which, I am sorry to say, the Ministry are not dealing with satisfactorily in this Budget.  The amount of money to be raised by this extra taxation bears a very inadequate proportion to the amount of damage done to the roads by those lorries.  Some people may think it is a retrograde step to suggest that these lorries should be removed from the roads, but the railways are the proper channels for the conveyance of merchandise such as motor lorries are carrying at the moment.  I suggest to the Ministry to reconsider the policy of lorry traffic, and it will not alone be a relief to the local ratepayers but also to the taxpayers.</P>

Ninety per cent. on an average is spent on the main and trunk roads.  Over and over again the view has been expressed from those benches that a tax should be placed upon petrol, and that that would be a fair way of dealing with those very heavy lorries doing such heavy damage to the roads.  I should like to ask the Minister for Finance has any estimate been made of the load which a four-ton lorry can carry so that we might estimate what would be <Col N="257" /> the total weight placed upon the roads by a lorry of that capacity.  Again, a great many farmers, especially in tillage districts, own lorries of their own which they use fairly often, especially after harvest, in delivering corn and that sort of thing, and I think it would only be fair that those lorries should be taxed on a different scale from the lorries which are constantly on the road.</P>

Although I do not entirely agree with Deputy Good in the grave view he takes of our passing this immediate resolution, at the same time I cannot close my eyes to the fact that the resolution is entwined with the road policy of the Government.  The fact that this resolution will go through to-night, as you stated, will in no way prevent the discussion taking place on it and, even if the Dáil thought fit, its rejection, at a future time, when it comes up to be dealt with on the Finance Bill and otherwise.  At the same time, we have had the road policy defined more or less by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech, and, like others, I am somewhat disappointed, not so much with the amount he proposed to get by way of taxation and to apportion towards the development of a transport policy in the Free State as with the whole outline he has given of the road policy. It is proposed, as far as I understand, that certain classes of taxation should be apportioned for the benefit of road transport, but it is also proposed that a sum of two million pounds should be placed at the disposal of the Local Government Department for the up-keep, the maintenance and the improvement of&mdash;I think the Minister said&mdash; some 1,500 miles of roadway in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am strongly of opinion that this is a great question of national transport; that, as one speaker has mentioned, railway transport and road transport are interlocked, and that it would be wise if we were to take a more national aspect of it instead of endeavouring by piecemeal taxation, or by small grants by way of borrowing, to obtain <Col N="258" /> a sufficiently large sum whereby we could ensure that, at least, the national arteries of the country could be taken out of the hands and away from the responsibility of the local councils and placed as a national burden upon the State.  We are, however, dealing now with the immediate resolution.  It proposes various classes of taxes in regard to various classes of motor vehicles. These are different to those taxes which have been in vogue up to the present. I am in complete accord with the suggestion as outlined in these taxes, that heavy motor vehicles, which at the moment do not seem to pay their proper share for the up-keep of the roads, should be taxed sufficiently to do so. I would go so far as to say that they should be taxed completely off the roads.  We have the railways and we have the roads.  The railways could, I think, be used for the transport of goods.</P>
    <P>I think that long distance motor vehicles should be heavily taxed, and I think there should be differentiation made in regard to the taxation of vehicles carrying goods, say, from Dublin to Limerick by road, and between vehicles only distributing articles in the neighbourhood of Dublin.  These vehicles which are using the roads contribute very little to their upkeep, and they are competing with the railways and destroying the roads.  Our roads are not perfect.  They were not built for heavy traffic.  We had not money for that purpose in the past, and it is questionable whether it would be wise to expend money to enable them to carry that traffic in the future.  The railways are largely idle.  I think every encouragement should be given for the utilisation of the railways for the carriage of goods, and that every discouragement should be given for the utilisation of the main roads for the same purpose.  In regard to the various classes of taxation and in regard to those in respect of ordinary motor vehicles I welcome the proposal to encourage the factory at Cork.  I remember that factory in the early stages of its inception.  Perhaps this flat rate of £10 may be of some assistance to it, and perhaps not.</P>
    <P>I would like, before this debate concludes, <Col N="259" /> if the Minister for Finance would answer the very ingenious question put by Deputy Leonard.  Subsequent to the Deputy's remarks, Deputy Myles said that he could not understand how a Ford car coming from Belfast could be bought as cheap in the Free State as a similar car produced within the Free State.  I think that that bears on Deputy Leonard's previous question.  He said that according to the proposal contained in paragraph 3 (a) it is suggested that, if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister for Local Government that 75 per cent. of the cost of producing the vehicle is attributable to the manufacturing operations performed in the Saorstát the rate is to be £10.  He went on to say, and I think his statement is correct, that what happens mostly in Cork is that the parts are manufactured there, then transferred to Manchester or elsewhere, and put together, and then they are sent back, perhaps, to Dublin, and when the finished article arrives in Dublin it is taxed as if the parts had never been made in Cork.  That is to say, it is taxed as if it came in whole and entire from outside the country.  I want to know if that is so.  I am not sure that it is, but if it is so, I say that, if it will continue, it will defeat the object outlined by the Minister in paragraph 3 (a), namely, to encourage the production of motor cars at Cork.  If that is so it is also a reason why you could get a motor car in Belfast as cheap as in Dublin, because if the cars are to be manufactured in Cork, put together in Manchester and charged the full duty in Dublin, you will pay the same price in Dublin as in Manchester. I think that that is a point which the Minister for Finance might clear up.</P>
    <P>We have had many interesting accounts of the condition of the roads in the country.  Those of us who have occasion to go about the country&mdash;and the President is not the only one&mdash; know what they are like.  We know that money has been spent on the roads &mdash;unfortunately, in my opinion, fruitlessly, and lavishly spent, though I do not say intentionally.  The material put on the roads was never meant, nor <Col N="260" /> could it be expected, to maintain the heavy motor and steam lorry traffic placed on them.  I think it has, unfortunately, been an extravagant economy upon our part&mdash;probably an unforeseen one but one which we could remedy now.  It might be possible for the Minister to consider, instead of driving the heavy motor traffic off the roads by heavy taxation, the advisability of further and increased borrowing in order to take over large portions of the main roads.  I suggest that that is the only satisfactory solution of the problem. With the general tenor of the whole resolution I am in complete agreement.  Regarding the statements that have been made about paragraph 3 (b) being a hardship on owners of light motor cars, I am in total disagreement with Deputy Thrift, because, after all, a Chevrolet car is not a light car or a car of small horse-power.  The light car is one which I understand to be in the nature of a Morris-Cowley, a Standard, or a Morris-Oxford.  These are much lighter than the Chevrolet car and they have much less horse-power.  They will consume much less petrol and can be driven at much less cost.  These are cars which are made in England and which the McKenna duties were brought in to protect.  They are the cars which the McKenna duties made possible to produce in England for the benefit of people with small purses.  I do not think the Chevrolet car, being strong and having large horse-power, will cost more owing to taxation under this paragraph, or that that is going to inflict a hardship on the owner of light cars.</P>

      <P>It may be cheaper in initial cost, but I doubt very much if it is cheaper to run.  I doubt if it would not cost much more per mile to run than it will cost to run a Morris-Cowley car.  What I do say is that for the person who has to get about his <Col N="261" /> business, for the local doctor, for the peregrinating parish priest and for the hungry lawyer who has to hunt the various districts in the wilds of the country for his existence, the light car is the type selected, and this will not particularly hit the owner of that vehicle.  I certainly think that in regard to taxation and in regard to helping the upkeep of the roads, this resolution is a step in the right direction. It is a step in the direction of taxing properly, but not too heavily, vehicles which have been largely the cause of the destruction of our roads.</P>

      <P>The discussion, therefore, cannot be very elaborate.  I want to ask the Minister for an explanation as to the increase in the licence duty of motor drivers.  As was stated by the Minister, the increased motor duties are to compensate for the increased upkeep of the roads.  It seems quite reasonable that the owners of motor cars and motor lorries and char-a-bancs which do a considerable amount of injury to the roads should have to pay a portion of the tax, but I do not see any reason why a driver of a motor vehicle should be expected to pay portion of a tax for the upkeep of the roads.  He cannot possibly have any ill-effect on the surface of the road. I do not know what the corresponding charges are in England, but I am inclined to think that the charge proposed in the Budget is an excessive charge for drivers' licences.  More justification is required for the imposition of this tax than the bald statement that money is required for the maintenance of the roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister two questions and I will do it very briefly.  I have read rather hurriedly sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Motor Car Act of 1903.  I gather that it applies not only to drivers of motor cars but to drivers of motor bicycles.  A charge of £1 in proportion to the running cost of a motor car is very little, but in the case of a motor bicycle, which is lighter and uses less fuel and which is driven sometimes by a young man, a charge of £1 would be a good deal more, in proportion.  I suggest to the Minister for Finance that if the drivers of motor bicycles are included in this resolution he might graduate the duty.  Ten shillings would be a reasonable duty to impose on the driver of a motor bicycle.</P>
      <P>I now come to my second point. There are many cases in which a motor car is used by members of one family. Members of the family take out a licence each in order that they may take out the family car.  Would it be beyond possibility to adopt some form of procedure like that in the Firearms Act whereby you took out one licence at the full price and members of the same family could take out additional licences at reduced rates?  I would ask the Minister to consider that before Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to go a bit further, and as we have the doctrine of &ldquo;one man one vote,&rdquo; to apply the doctrine of one car one driver's licence.  Deputy Cooper has stated exactly what was in my mind.  Three or four members of a family may have occasion to drive the same car, and it seems a gross injustice to ask for a £1 licence from each person. I do not see why that should be substituted for a 5/- licence.  The Minister may think that the more irresponsible people will be driven off the roads by this tax, but he has not said that. If we want to meet the increased cost of road maintenance, let the tax be put on the vehicle, but do not divide it between the driver and the vehicle except you have some other aim.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Cooper said with regard to family licences would be possible, but whether we should do it or not is another thing.  I do not think there would be any difficulty. It is suggested that if we reduced the number of members of a family holding licences it would be good for the cars apart from the mileage run.  It would be to the advantage of the owners that there should be an increase in the cost of licences and that fewer licences should be taken out by the members of a family.</P>

      <P>Motor bicycles; at present, get off fairly lightly.  There has been no increase suggested in their case.  It is felt that they are, perhaps, to some extent a danger on the road. If we could prevent that, and the irresponsible use of them, by increasing the licence duty, in their case, at any rate, <Col N="265" /> it would be to the good, but the real question is, as the President stated, that the sum of £45,000 is to be derived from this increase.  If you have regard to the value of money, this increase, as compared with the ten shillings that had to be paid as licence duty in 1903, when the charge was first imposed, only brings the licence duty up, for all practical purposes, to the level that it was then.</P>

He cannot afford to pay a year's tax at once, or even a half-year's tax, and because he is forced to take out his licence quarterly it will cost him £2 12s., or £3 more than if he took it out yearly.</P>
