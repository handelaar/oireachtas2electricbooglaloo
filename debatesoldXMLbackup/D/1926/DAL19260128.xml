      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether it is the practice of the Board of Works to specify Irish-made paints in contracts for decorating work in Government Buildings; whether he is aware it is stated that premises at 8 Hume Street, Dublin, are being painted with imported paint, and that the Dublin Broadcasting Station Studio was recently painted throughout with the same imported paint, and whether this was a breach of the instructions given to the contractors; and whether he will take steps to ensure that paints manufactured in the Saorstát are used on all such works in future.</P>

      <P>The specifications of the Commissioners of Public Works provide that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All materials, appliances and fittings required for the works are, wherever possible, to be obtained from manufacturers operating in the Saorstát.  Where any materials, appliances and fittings of Irish manufacture are not procurable, or, if procurable, are not of suitable quality and reasonable cost, the facts are to be reported to the Commissioners, who will issue instructions as to the course to be followed in each case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Portion of the painting work at No. 8 Hume Street was done with Gay's imported paint, the remaining portion was painted with paint of Saorstát manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> The Dublin Broadcasting Studio received only a finishing coat of imported paint upon previously painted work.</P>
    <P>It is regretted that the rule laid down in the specifications as quoted above was overlooked in these cases, and steps have been taken to secure that it shall be carefully observed in future.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if he will consider the desirability of having affixed on premises where work is being done the main lines of specification, so that the men concerned will know whether the specification is being carried out or not?  There is very good reason for believing that in many cases the specification is not carried out and that two coats of paint are sometimes given when three are required.</P>

      <P>The question of the refund to certain local authorities, including the Tipperary (North Riding) County Council, of the amounts paid by them on foot of decrees awarded in respect of criminal injury to the person, is at present being investigated by my Department and forms part of an adjustment which is being effected with the British Government.  It has not been found possible to dispose of the matter earlier because of the fact that the apportionment of liability between the Saorstát and British Governments has been difficult to ascertain. Further, the matter is complicated by the fact that there are certain local authorities from whom refunds are due on foot of decrees awarded in respect of injury or damage done prior to the 21st January, 1919.  In such cases the local authorities concerned are liable for the amounts of the decrees.  These decrees have been discharged by the British Government and have been taken into account in the adjustment referred to above, which clearly can only be dealt with as a whole.  Considerable progress has, however, been made with the adjustment and it is practically certain that the matter will be disposed of by the end of the current financial year.</P>

McSweeney, Queen St., Tramore, Waterford, for compensation for destruction of her house and portion of her furniture (by order of British Forces as a military necessity) during pre-Truce period; whether he is aware that she was awarded £180 by Judge O'Brien at the Quarter Sessions in January, 1922, as compensation for loss of furniture; if he will state why <Col N="200" /> same is still unpaid; whether the British Government are liable for payment of compensation for damage done under such circumstances, and if, in view of Miss McSweeney's failure to secure payment of compensation, he will make representations to the proper quarters to have this old outstanding claim disposed of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he intends to introduce a new Unemployment Insurance Bill, to enable workers whose title to benefit is exhausted under the existing legislation to draw benefit for a further period, and, if not, what other steps he proposes to take to alleviate the sufferings of the unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  Taking into account the contributions by employers, employees and the State, the cost of administration, and the advances to meet the deficit from the Central Fund, the net burden of the Unemployment Insurance on the productive energies of the country in 1925 amounted to £1,077,000.  In these circumstances I do not see my way to recommend an extension of benefit to those who have exhausted their contributions.</P>
      <P>In reply to the second part of the question I would refer to the explanation made by the Minister for Finance of the provision made by the Government for the relief of unemployment when moving a Supplementary Estimate on the 17th December last for £120,000 in respect of relief schemes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he can state the total number of persons who drew unemployment benefit during the fifth benefit year, the number who exhausted their benefit and continued to register for employment at the Employment Exchanges after the exhaustion of benefit during the same period, the number who claimed benefit since the commencement of the sixth benefit year, the number who have since exhausted all benefit to which they were entitled, and the percentage of such claimants who have continued to register for employment after the exhaustion of benefit: whether his Department has formed any estimate of the extent to which the total number of unemployed exceeds the number registered by the Employment Exchanges, and whether <Col N="204" /> any steps are being taken to devise means of ascertaining with reasonable accuracy the full number of unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of persons who were allowed unemployment benefit in the fifth benefit year was 61,923.  Of these, the number who exhausted their benefit rights in that benefit year was 33,017.  Some of those continued to register for employment after their benefit was exhausted, but the exact number cannot be stated, as persons registering for employment are classified on the basis of the work applied for and not their previous benefit position.  The total live register, however, exceeded the number of claims current by a weekly average of about 7,600 throughout the benefit year.  The number of persons who have claimed benefit from the commencement of the sixth benefit year up to the 4th January, the latest date for which figures are available, is 40,967. Of these, 9,524 had exhausted all the benefit to which they were entitled by the 5th January, the latest date for which figures are available.  As already explained, I cannot state the percentage of these who continued to register for employment, but the average weekly difference between the live register and the number of claims current in the sixth benefit year up to the 18th January was 10,206, equal to 33 per cent. of the total weekly average number of persons registered as unemployed.</P>
      <P>Ample means are provided through registration at the Exchanges, available to every unemployed person, for determining the full number of unemployed. I could not justify the labour and expense that would be involved in searching for unemployed persons who do not register.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister take some steps to bring before the unemployed the necessity of registering for employment?  Does the Minister not think that it is desirable that he at least should be in a position to state the total number of unemployed in the country, and not to have figures appearing in the Press which are totally misleading?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on what the Deputy means.  Ideally one might think it better to have some means of determining the actual number of unemployed on any particular date, but whether people should be driven to make use of the means now available to them is another question. I must abide by the answer I have given, that I cannot justify any further labour and expense in searching for unemployed.  If there is anything that can be done through the medium of the present Exchanges that will not involve&mdash;I will not say any labour&mdash; any great additional labour on those employed in the Exchanges or any further expense that could be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to view this from two aspects.  From the point of view of statistics there may be some better way of getting it as a result of the Statistics Bill now going through. From the point of view of my Department and the public, I look on it this way: There is a Vote annually for my Department of somewhere in the region of £360,000 for all the services administered by that Department. Nearly a quarter of a million of that is due to unemployment insurance, between contributions, administration, and everything else.  With such a heavy burden I must have very good reasons given to me before I add even a penny to it.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given on the 13th November last to Deputy Corish in which I stated that employment under the Office of Public Works or the Department of Lands and Agriculture on the work of improving agricultural lands by drainage is not insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  In the case of a number of men employed last year by the Land Commission in the reconstruction of an embankment on the River Fergus for the purpose of reclaiming agricultural <Col N="208" /> land, contributions under the Unemployment Insurance Acts were paid in error.  As the work was not insurable, my Department had no legal power to place those contributions to the credit of the men for whom they had been erroneously paid nor to pay benefit in respect of them, but application for the return of their value may be made by the persons concerned within the prescribed period of three years from the date on which the contributions were paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received only one claim under Section 5 (4) of <Col N="209" /> the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925.  But arrangements are being made for the settlement of compensation as quickly as possible, particularly in the case of small holders.  Under the Shannon Electricity Act compensation is to be settled by agreement, or failing agreement, by arbitration.  I expect in a few days that the officials acting for me will be in a position to negotiate as to compensation with those whose property is being acquired, attention being specially given to the more urgent cases.  It is, however, important that claimants should first furnish me with notice of their claims as provided in Section 5 (4) of the Act.  Without a formal notice of claim I may not be able to proceed to a settlement.</P>
      <P>The basis for compensation is that prescribed in the Acquisition of Lands (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, and any claims in respect of damage or disturbance will be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of that Act.  If compensation is fixed by agreement it can be paid promptly, subject to my having satisfactory particulars as to other charges on or interests in the property, and to proof of title.  If it goes to be decided by arbitration it cannot, of course, be paid until the arbitrator's decision has been received and title proved.</P>
      <P>Land purchase annuities on land acquired for the Shannon undertaking will be apportioned and become a liability of the undertaking.  The question of the liability for rates depends on the interpretation of a number of statutes on which I am at present awaiting advice.</P>

This rule applies to claimants generally, including those who have claims in the Castlecomer district, and there has been no stoppage of benefits properly payable to persons resident in the latter district.

      <P>That the Special Order made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Electricity Supply Acts, 1882 to 1919, and the Electricity Commissioners (Transfer of Functions) Order, 1924, in respect of the Urban District of Blackrock, in the County of Dublin, which was presented on Tuesday, 19th January, 1926, be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Dáil to give approval to the Order referred to in No. 1 of the Orders of the Day.  The Order was presented on Tuesday, 19th January, and has to deal with a very small matter.  It is a question of area and the necessity for the change now required arose in this way.  When the 1924 Special Order was made and approved by the Oireachtas with regard to the Urban District of Blackrock, Co. Dublin, a rather large area was <Col N="226" /> included in the Schedule, and it was laid down that mains must be compulsorily erected in that area within a period of two years.  Negotiations are at present proceeding between Dun Laoghaire district and Blackrock district, whereby Dun Laoghaire will supply Blackrock with electricity.  The negotiations are likely to be successful, if the area is modified or reduced to a certain extent, and the schedule, which is really the only operative part of the Order, does definitely limit the area from that approved in the 1924 Order. The Order will not deprive any resident of Blackrock of his right to obtain a supply in accordance with the ordinary Electricity Acts, but if this Order that is now presented be made it will avoid the financial risk of laying down mains in that particular area before a definite demand has been secured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;In sub-section (1), line 39, to delete the words `(without naming him)'.&rdquo;  As the section stands it gives the Minister power to serve a notice on any person by simply writing the name of the house and saying &ldquo;occupier.&rdquo; By doing that he renders that unnamed occupier liable to a penalty not exceeding £20, or imprisonment not exceeding three months, without even naming the person on whom he serves the demand. This is a comparatively revolutionary principle.  There is one precedent for it, and that is to be found in the Census Acts, but the Census Acts are very much more limited and less far reaching than this Bill.  The Census Acts seek information on a variety of subjects which is taken on one night every <Col N="230" /> ten years, but this Bill gives the Minister power to seek at any time information on a far larger number of subjects.  I do not quarrel with the right.  I think it is right that he should get the information, but I do think he ought to name the person from whom he demands it.  He should not simply shovel out notices addressed to the occupier.  When it is a case of approaching every house in the country I think there is necessity for doing it. We are going to take sample statistics. I think this Bill gives power to take sample statistics.  A committee on statistics recommended that we should take that power.  Then I think he ought to say definitely who the person is from whom he wants information. Is it intended, if the information is not furnished, that a summons should also be addressed to the &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;?  The occupier may have changed in the meantime.  Is the occupier who has just gone into possession to be liable for the deeds of his predecessor?  As a matter of fact, there is very often some doubt as to who, in the legal sense, is the occupier of a house.</P>
      <P>When passing the Firearms Act we made provision that an occupier might get a gun licence for five shillings for the purpose of protecting the crops in his garden.  A constituent of mine came to me and complained that he could not get a licence at a reduced fee.  He said the police told him he would have to take out a £2 licence. He wanted it to shoot the birds in the garden.  I inquired into the matter, and found that the householder, although a man of mature years, was not the occupier.  His mother was the occupier.  Unless the elderly lady took out a licence he could not get it at the reduced rate.  There are doubts of that kind in many cases.  There are doubts in cases where there have been changes of tenancy.  There are doubts where there has been a death. Without some more justification than we have had up to the present, I suggest that it would be unwise to render an anonymous and unnamed occupier liable to these penalties without a little more specific indication of who he is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see great weight in Deputy Cooper's objection, <Col N="231" /> based on the action taken against an occupier so named by the description. That is not going to be the fact.  I will try and explain that in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the objection that it is wrong to have a document left addressed, not to a person named, but merely to the occupier, the Deputy has mentioned the census. There are matters, not exactly a census, but of a census type, which would naturally fall to be taken under this type.  It would be absolutely and entirely putting the cart before the horse if the officers of statistics should have to go and inquire the names of persons before serving them with certain documents where, in fact, the serving of the documents is mainly for the purpose of getting the name of the occupier and various particulars about him.  The name of the person and the fact that he is in occupation might be one of the main things aimed at.  There is going to be no trouble whatever about prosecutions. It is quite impossible to believe &mdash;it has been suggested and the suggestion has been turned down most vehemently&mdash;that the Courts would entertain an action of the type, &ldquo;The Attorney-General v Occupier.&rdquo;  It could not possibly be done.  As to the other difficulties which the Deputy referred to&mdash;that you might have, for instance, a person in occupation at the moment that the document was served and when the time came for filling up the document somebody else&mdash;the circumstances would all come out if any action was taken.  And to have an action taken would require that a certain person should be named.  The most obvious defence would be that the person named was not the occupier at the date at which the particulars should have been given.  If the Deputy takes my assurance, that there will be no possibility of the Courts entertaining actions against persons described as &ldquo;occupiers,&rdquo; and if he takes the further assurance that only in very exceptional circumstances&mdash;I omit matters of a census nature, because there you are really looking for the name of the occupier&mdash;will documents <Col N="232" /> be left merely addressed to the occupier that there will be trouble gone to to get the name of the exact person who is in occupation and the name of the exact person who should furnish the information required.  I hope the Deputy will agree that the amendment is not of very serious importance from the public point of view, and if those words were struck out it might render the work of the statistics officers very onerous.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 3&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (1), line 41, after the words `specified time,' to insert the words `which shall not be less than one week from the date of delivery of the document'.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put this amendment down because I have from time to time observed that there is a certain tendency amongst minor officials in Government Departments to think that a man has nothing else to do but fill up forms.  You find notices served on you to be filled up and sent in after two or three days. Sometimes, you are away from home and these notices are forwarded to you. Sometimes a considerable amount of research is required in connection with these inquiries, and you may not have time to do that when engaged in your ordinary business.  You may have to wait until the week-end to ascertain all the particulars required by the form. I am not tied to a week in any special way.  My desire is to assert the principle, that there should be a reasonable interval between service of the notice and the date for filling it up and returning it.  A week seems to me a reasonable interval for that purpose.  If there is any substantial reason against a week, I am prepared to modify the amendment in that respect, but I do think that the ordinary citizen is entitled to have his convenience met in regard to all these notices&mdash;census of <Col N="233" /> production, ordinary census and so on, in connection with vital, social and educational matters, commerce, railways, etc.  It is reasonable that there should be a certain time given to supply the information, and I suggest to the Minister that if the amendment in its present form is not acceptable to him, he might introduce some words that would give the person who would, I suppose, then be defendant a certain defence in the law courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest to the Deputy that it might be better to rely on the commonsense of the person in charge of statistics, but after what he has said about minor officials acting on the assumption that a person's time is at the disposal of Government officials for the filling in of forms, I do not suppose he would be disposed to agree with me.  But I put it to him in this way.  It is always a difficulty in legislation that you have to guard against cases which may be very rare.  Where you are having a Bill of a general type, such as this Bill is, which is intended to last for some time, you have to envisage certain periods of emergency.  I can very easily see a type of emergency arising in which it would be essential to know the amount of coal, petrol and essential food-stuffs in the country at a particular period, and it might spoil the whole effect of such a demand if one had to wait a week for the information. I think in most cases a week would be a very reasonable time and that no very great advantage would be got by modifying the seven-day period.  But it is very hard to look forward in the vague and to find out what would be a reasonable time, no matter what emergency one considers. Let me again refer to inquiries of a census type.  I am referring to the analogy of the Census Bill, although it is not quite on all fours with this Bill. The whole aim and object of the census is to get a document left on a particular day before a certain time and have it filled in by midnight and then returned within a certain time. That, and matters akin to it, would very definitely be prejudiced by putting in a week.  If some vague phrase about a reasonable interval being <Col N="234" /> allowed would meet the Deputy's requirements, I would be disposed to agree.  I do not know on whom the definition of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; would devolve. If the Deputy can suggest any form of words, I would be very glad to meet him.  I do end with what I said I was not going to begin with&mdash; that the setting-up of a department of statistics with a director, that director being advised by a statistical council&mdash; the statistical council will certainly not be entirely a body of civil servants, and one may hope to get the ordinary human point of view as opposed to the Civil Service point of view&mdash;will lead to statistics being handled in the future, though he may not be disposed to agree with me, with more humanity and to more time being allowed for the filling in of forms.  If the Deputy would put his amendment in a form that would provide that the whole matter of time would be dealt with in a reasonable way and that there would be no undue pressure in the filling in of these forms, I would be prepared to accept it.</P>

      <P>I was going to suggest to the Minister that he should, on Report Stage, bring in an amendment providing for a reasonable time and leaving it to the courts to determine what is a reasonable time in the particular circumstances.  If the Minister is prepared to consider that&mdash;it is more or less his own suggestion&mdash;I would be prepared to withdraw my amendment.  As regards civil servants, the Director of Statistics and civil servants of the higher grades would not, I agree, be disposed to limit the time too much, but there is always the danger that these things will be filled in in the office.  Somebody will prepare a draft containing the important items and the various heads under which inquiry is to be sought, but the other portion may be filled in in the office without coming under the notice of the director.  If the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; were introduced, I would be quite satisfied.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>My point is that this section gives power to ask for information on certain points.  It does not include all the points which the Census Act of 1911 asked for information upon.  That was the first Act I discussed in Committee, and I have some knowledge of it.  It does not include those statistics which hitherto the Irish census always included, statistics relating to those whom I may call the minority denominations.  It is rather important to have those statistics in order that we may know where we are.  It would not be possible to get a complete census, on the lines on which it was customary to take a census in the past, under this Bill. However, if no decision has been arrived at, I do not want to press the matter.</P>

      <P>I am afraid it will seem apparent that I am arguing that a census should be taken in connection with this Bill.  I am not at all arguing that.  The Deputy thinks there is a gap in regard to matter on which we may require some information. <Col N="236" /> I would refer him to Section 2, where it is stated:</P>

I do not know whether that is so, although I would imagine that &ldquo;vital, social and educational matters&rdquo; might easily be understood to include religious matters. I think this matter of the census is important. I imagined this Bill was really taking the place of a Census Bill.  If it is intended to take the census in April, and if advertisements are appearing regarding contracts for the printing of census forms, I would imagine the Bill empowering the census to be taken should be in our hands now, before the advertisements appear in regard to it, and certainly before any orders are given.  Unless this is to be taken as empowering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe anything could be taken under this, including the census.  I was under the impression that a special Census Bill was in preparation.  I presume the forms are being got ready on the basis of the sort of census to which we have been accustomed in the country, and I presume the census will, more or less, follow the same form as on previous occasions.  I am not quite clear as to Deputy Johnson's point.  If words set out in detail, following general words, <Col N="237" /> are to be taken to exclude from the purport of the general words, matters not specially referred to in the details, then I would prefer to amend the Bill by wiping out the details and leave the wording in the general form.  This was founded on the South African and the Canadian Acts with regard to statistics.  The statistics officials take everything, including the census, in both countries.  I do not know whether they have the matter set out in detailed form.  I am not sure that the details would preclude taking anything such as has been referred to.  If that is not so, I will undertake to have the Bill amended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this Section I am not sure whether it does not go very much further than is desired and will make impossible the publication of returns which have <Col N="239" /> been found necessary hitherto.  I can, for instance, look up the census returns for 1911, and find that in the City of Dublin there was one maker of dolls' eyes; I could find something about his family and antecedents, religious associations and so on.  I am, therefore, able to identify the fact that John Smith is a maker of dolls' eyes.  Under this section that information could not be published.  Similarly the matter can be applied to railways.  There is one railway company in the country. Section 2 indicates that you are to obtain particulars regarding railways, tramways, shipping and other forms of transport.  Unless those controlling the railways or tramways specifically allow you to publish the information they give, you will not be able to publish it.</P>
      <P>I think, too, that the section is going to limit very much the value of the census returns.  Take, for instance, the census of industries.  There are industries in the country that will inevitably be recognised by any returns you publish. This section would preclude the publication of any information which would be taken to identify the industry or business in question.  In that way it seems to me the whole section is going to nullify the effect of much of the statistical inquiry that is to be made.  I suggest that the Minister should consider the kind of statistical information that it is desirable to keep private, but he ought not prevent the publication of information of a general character which would be of public interest, simply because it might identify the persons concerned.  As an obvious illustration, I will point to the railway company.  Under this section, unless the company gives specific permission to publish any information that they give, it could not be published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point in that, and I am glad the Deputy has drawn attention to it, with regard to the railway.  The Deputy, I am sure, understands the purpose of the section.  It is to prevent the returns of individual businesses being published in such a way that particulars of any business may be identified. In the endeavour to secure this, this <Col N="240" /> section may have gone too far.  In the example given it has probably gone too far; it was not so intended.  The section requires some re-drafting so as to secure the secrecy which is required in connection with individual returns. But a company of the type of the Great Southern Railways, operating in the Saorstát, should not have the right to refuse consent to the publication of particulars supplied by them.  There is always, I think, an obstacle to any form of wording that I have ever seen. The first example given by Deputy Johnson of one individual employer in a particular type of business is easily identified by reason of the subject-matter of the business.  I think it has been considered by the Statistical Office that a business so marked out is not of sufficient importance to warrant an abstract of it being made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which, technically, comes within the scope of my Department, although in reality there is no public expenditure; there is no national expenditure or national saving involved.  It is introduced for the purpose of preventing a certain class of pensioned local officers <Col N="242" /> being in a more advantageous position than others.  It is common knowledge that in the period before the Truce the majority of the local councils acknowledged the authority of the Local Government Department of Dáil Eireann, and most of the officials obeyed the rulings of their own authorities and the Department of Dáil Eireann.  But in certain cases there were officials who refused to carry out the instructions of their own authorities and refused to acknowledge the authority of the Dáil Eireann Department. A number of those officials were dismissed.  They appealed to the Local Government Board on the question of their pensions, and sealed orders were issued fixing those pensions at, I think, in all cases excessive amounts.  Following the Treaty and the setting up of the Provisional Govérnment, the position of these officials was the subject of discussion between the British Government and our Government here.  It was agreed between the two Governments that some person should be appointed to assess the proper amount of the pensions or gratuities payable to the dismissed officials who had not obtained sealed orders from the Local Government Board. Some of them had not.  This person was to report in all sealed-order cases as to the amount by which the sealed-order pensions exceeded the pensions properly payable.  Mr. Justice Wylie was appointed to carry out that.  As a matter of fact, the British Government admitted our contention that the sealed-order pensions were in most cases excessive.  When Mr. Justice Wylie went into the matter he found that they were in all cases excessive. During the course of this discussion between the two Governments, there was never any intention that the Free State Government should assume liability for the pensions.  But local authorities, even although the pensions had been reviewed, and revised in some cases, particularly in the case of the Wexford County Council, refused to have anything to do with the payment of the pensions; after Mr. Justice Wylie's examination and award, the pensions still remained unpaid.  It was to deal with that situation that <Col N="243" /> the Act of 1924 was passed&mdash;the Local Officers Compensation (War Period) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was prescribed in that Act that the payment should be made in the first place out of moneys placed at the disposal of the Minister for Finance by the British Government.  Those were moneys to cover that portion of the pension which Mr. Justice Wylie found to be in excess of what the officers were legally entitled to.  Then the remainder of the pensions was to paid out of the Local Taxation Account.  Consequently the amount available for distribution to the local authorities out of the Local Taxation Account is reduced by the amount paid on pensions. Actually the pensions of the officers dealt with in the Act of 1924 are paid by the local authorities in an indirect way.  Local authorities pay these particular pensions because the amounts of the pensions are deducted from the grants going to the local authorities out of the Local Taxation Account. Consequently, there is no reason why the pensions of those officers should not be subject to the same deductions as the pensions of officers who obeyed their own authorities, and did not take the particular part in the national struggle that these people took.  The officers who obeyed their own particular body and acknowledged the authority of Dáil Eireann, have their pensions paid direct by the local authority. As a matter of fact, this Bill itself proposes to leave the small number of officers to whom it will apply in an advantageous position, because it is not proposed to have any retrospective effect.  The reduction of pensions will take effect only from the passing of the Act, whereas other officials whose cases are really similar&mdash;officials who, in consequence of the amalgamation scheme or something like that, had their services dispensed with by the local authorities, who received pensions and who afterwards were re-employed &mdash;have already, since the passing of the Local Government Act, had their pensions reduced.  It is proposed that these few individuals to whom this Bill refers, should have their pensions reduced only after the passing of this <Col N="244" /> Act.  Out of the original 27 or 28 officers named in the Act of 1924 a number are dead.  I think, so far, only about four have received employment. I think that at the present moment there are actually only two in employment. The sum involved is very trifling.  It does not affect, as I say, the Exchequer in any way.  It affects only the local authorities, but it is felt that there is a certain matter of principle involved and that officials, simply because they took a strong part against the national side&mdash;they took a fairly strong line against the national side in the pre-Truce struggle&mdash;ought not to be in a better position than officials whose cases are otherwise similar in every respect, except that they obeyed their own authorities and accepted the authority of the Dáil Department of Local Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'CONNELL Mr. T. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be generally admitted that the legislative machinery of the country should not be set in operation except to deal with some very important matter affecting the lives of the people of the country as a whole.  Anyone who has read this Bill and studied its effects and listened now to the speech of the Minister moving its Second Reading must conclude that this is a case in which the legislative machinery of the country ought not to be used.  It will be necessary to refer to the original Act, of which this is supposed to be an amendment.  The original Act had its origin in the Treaty negotiations and in the troubles which preceded the Treaty.  In setting up our new Government we had to do many things that perhaps in ordinary times might not have to be done.  Certain difficulties arose, and some of those people who thought they had certain rights insisted on their rights as they deemed them to be.  They took such action as they were entitled to take within the law as it existed at the time.</P>
      <P>The President explained the object of this War Compensation Act on each of the stages of the Bill when it was introduced in 1924.  On the First Reading of the Bill he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This measure seeks to carry out an obligation that we entered into when negotiating with the British <Col N="245" /> Government about the payment of grants.  The local authorities on their part, while taking the money, did not fulfil their obligations, and this measure is to see that as far as these officers are concerned in respect of whom we gave an undertaking that they are not at a loss and that their rights are safeguarded.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again on the Second Reading the President said.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In so far as this particular method of dealing with all these cases is concerned, that is in substance made a national charge, but it is not a national charge that will fall upon the Exchequer because of the fact that the local authorities in question, by reason of this particular struggle, lost nothing in the struggle, and in consequence they have no liability to meet in respect of it except that for which they were very well compensated in other directions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the Third Stage the President said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Generally, on the whole thing, we have come to an arrangement with the British Government.  Mr. Justice Wylie has considered the whole of those cases, and our liability has been assessed at what would have been a fair compensation, given in each case, excluding the political circumstances of the times.  The British Government has accepted responsibility for the difference between what might be called an equitable pension in the circumstances and what was granted, and our responsibility is in respect of the rest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To me it seems clear from these statements that the local authorities lose nothing on account of these pensions. They have no liability on account of these pensions, and it is equally clear that it was a definite arrangement between the British and the Irish Governments arising out of circumstances which preceded the Treaty.  It is a very unusual thing in legislation to legislate for individuals and to set out in an Act of Parliament, as has been done in the case of the main Act, the actual names of the twenty-four or twenty-five individuals who are affected <Col N="246" /> by the measure.  It makes it clear in any case that it is something special&mdash; something which is not of general application.  The pensions set out in the main measure, which is now sought to be amended, were given absolutely unconditionally.  No condition whatsoever was attached to the pension.  It cannot be held that the leaving out of these conditions which are now sought to be made was overlooked or was merely an accident, because I find that at the very same time a Bill was going through the Dáil&mdash;the Military Service Pensions Bill, and both in fact were signed on the same day&mdash;in which a special section was introduced setting forth some such condition as is now put in in this case.  So that it could not be that it was forgotten in one case and put in in the other, or that this Bill is now to remedy an oversight on that occasion.  It was done of deliberate act.  These pensions were made unconditional deliberately by the Oireachtas at the time.</P>
    <P>There is another matter, and I wonder whether the Minister is cognisant of this fact.  It is a very important matter to my mind.  When the first draft of the Local Government Bill was circulated it contained a provision which, if passed, would have the effect which this Bill will now have if passed.  Section 33 of the original Bill as circulated stated &ldquo;Whenever a person who is in receipt of an allowance under this or any other Act on account of his having, whether before or after the passing of the Act, ceased to hold office,&rdquo; and so on.  I draw attention to the words &ldquo;Whenever a person who is in receipt of an allowance under this or any other Act.&rdquo;  That undoubtedly would have included the twenty-four or twenty-five people in this Local Government (Compensation) Act&mdash;the main Act&mdash;but that representations were made at the time by the people concerned or their organisation. Those who represented them made representations to the Local Government Department, and the Local Government Department admitted the justice of the representations.  In the new draft of the Bill that was brought forward&mdash;it will be remembered that there was a new draft of the Local Government <Col N="247" /> Bill brought forward&mdash;they were specially cut out of the Bill.  That draft became an Act.  The Act as it now stands shows that the words &ldquo;under this or any other Act&rdquo; were definitely omitted.  Instead it now reads &ldquo;or in receipt of an allowance from a local body.&rdquo;  These people are not in receipt of an allowance from a local body, and therefore in the second draft of the Local Government Bill which finally became an Act their rights were preserved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course if the draft had remained as it was originally, this point would have been raised at the time when all those people affected went to the Local Government Department, discussed the matter with those responsible for the Bill, and got themselves definitely excluded from the provisions of the Act.  Now, surely there must be some good reasons why that was done.  What happened was, it was definitely recognised that these people had special claims from the whole circumstances surrounding the passage of this Local Government Act.  The Minister has said that the Bill does not secure any national economy; there is no national expenditure involved, but the whole object of the Bill is to prevent a certain class of local officers being in a more advantageous position than certain other classes.  I wonder is the Government going to adopt that as a general principle for which it will legislate, in order to see that no one class of persons will be in a more advantageous position than any other set of persons.  If there is any such intention it is clearly revolutionary.  In all the circumstances, there is no case made for the introduction of a measure of this kind.  It clearly does not secure economy.  It will only have the effect of preventing any of those people getting employment under local authorities, because none of those who have the pension and who are at liberty to take employment under any body except a local authority will take employment under a local authority and thereby lose his pension.  It is simply shutting out men with a certain <Col N="248" /> amount of training and experience, from getting employment under local authorities and it is very hard to have any other impression than that it looks like having one back on them for something that they did or failed to do in 1920 or 1919.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite wrong for the Government to leave it in the power of anybody to say that six or seven years after this event they are using the machinery of the legislature, as it were, to have revenge on people who did not fall in with their particular views at that time.  That could be carried out in many other directions.  We had to pay a good deal to people who refused on that occasion to fall in with the views of the majority.  We had to compensate the R.I.C.  We had to give big pensions to civil servants who retired because they did not wish to carry on under an Irish Government. There were various classes of people who had to be compensated in one way or another, but on examination of this particular measure, it will be found that very few, as the Minister has said, will be affected or can be affected.  Only four at most have sought employment under a local authority, and if the statement made by the Minister for Local Government, in reply to a question of mine a few days ago, is correct, there is, at present, only one person who happens to be drawing a pension of £160 a year who would not be affected by the passing of the Bill.  I do not see on what ground the Minister can defend the introduction of a measure of this kind, even if there was something special to the advantage of this particular individual in the way things turned out after the settlement had been effected between the British and Irish Governments. It certainly seems to me exceedingly wrong treatment of this particular individual, who was in the employment of a local authority when this Act was passed, who Act was passed, under the Act, without conditions, without anything being set out in the Act to show that if he held employment he was not to get a pension.  He was in employment, and now the legislature comes along <Col N="249" /> again in a year's time and simply takes from that man the rights given him under the Act of 1924.  If this is going to be done, really the effect will be to destroy that sense of confidence and that sense of security in the public service that an individual and the public generally ought to have in the State.  A man should not simply feel I am all right to-day, but the Minister may bring in a Bill to-morrow and pass it through the Dáil and take what I have from me.  That will be the attitude of mind that will be created by the passage of this Bill.  For no matter what argument the Minister can put up to show that we do not want one class of individuals to be in a more advantageous position than another class of individuals, the man in the street will say it is those special cases arising out of circumstances that may not occur again&mdash;at least not in our lifetime it is to be hoped&mdash;that this measure is aimed really at, affecting one or two individuals.  I will put it straight to the Minister.  The individual I have in mind is one who, because of his representative position in the organisation that defended the rights of those individuals, was very active, and from that point of view this has a sinister appearance and will be looked upon as if it was aimed at this particular individual.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is worth while, for what is gained, because there is no general principle involved.  There is protection in the Local Government Act, which has general application, and was passed here as a matter of course because it had general application, but this only applies to a certain number of individuals limited by the Act itself &mdash;some are dead, the majority of them have other employment and never will seek employment under local authorities. Many of them are employed in local authorities outside the Saorstát; some of them have very good employment in England, others in the North of Ireland, and these cannot be touched in any way.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the case is that if instead of getting pensions they got compensation they would not be touched or affected by this Bill.  If the particular individual I have in mind <Col N="250" /> who had less than 10 years' service got something like £1,000 compensation, the Bill would not touch him at all, but because he had longer service than that he got a pension, and this Bill simply takes the pension from him now.  I cannot see how the Minister can, by any argument, justify taking from an individual rights he has at the present time, and which, no doubt, he had a vested interest in, and I do put it to him, from the point of view of that sense of confidence in the justice and fair dealing of the State, that everybody should have a feeling of security that the legislative machine should not be set in motion to deal with a matter of this kind.  I put it to the Minister that it is not worth while going on with this measure. There is nothing involved except what he thinks is a principle, but I maintain that no general principle is involved, inasmuch as it applies purely to individuals. The Minister would be doing good service to the State, in creating those feelings of security and confidence that we ought to have in the State, if he were to say that in all the circumstances, as they have been put before him, he would not proceed further with the measure.</P>

      <P>What is the case that the Minister has made for this Bill?  Put in a few words, it is that the Act of 1924 operates to the advantage of a certain class of local government pensioners as against a certain other class.  Were those facts not known in 1924?  The President had been Minister for Local Government. The Minister for Finance had been Minister for Local Government.  Three years had elapsed since the dismissal or retirement of the last of the pensioners named in the Schedule of this Bill, and yet the Executive Council thought it right to pass through the Oireachtas the Act of 1924.  Now we are told, and it is the only case made for the Bill, that the Act of 1924 was a mistaken Act.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the Act of 1924, No. 50.  That is the Act that we are amending now.  That is the case he has made.  What is the case the Minister has got to make?  To begin with, he has got to prove to us that when the Oireachtas granted pensions unconditionally we are justified in subsequently imposing certain definite conditions to the detriment of one or two individuals.  He has got to prove to us that we are justified in placing these pensioners in a worse position than those ladies and gentlemen who got gratuities under the old Act and whose gratuities cannot be taken away, and he has also got to prove to us that he is justified in discriminating against persons who are in the employment of local authorities.  Pensioners under the old Act can take any other form of employment they like without discrimination. They can sell tea on commission, they can canvass for insurance companies, they can, if they are of a suitable age, enter the National Army, they can stand for the Dáil, they can become Parliamentary Secretaries, they can become Ministers, and there will be no deduction whatever made from the pensions.  But if they enter the employment of a local authothority then, and then only, are they to be penalised.  What is the reason for that penalisation?  It may not be the same local authority and it may not be the same position.  A technical teacher who got a pension under this section might go to college, qualify in engineering, and years later be appointed a county surveyor, and yet he would find, just because he was in the employment of a local authority, that he was penalised.  A man might be on his last legs and take employment as a rate collector, or a dairy inspector, or something of that kind, some miserable little employment.  Still he would find himself penalised to a small extent, though not to the full extent, under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no reason for discriminating between persons simply because they entered into the employment of a local authority, and the Minister will have to make a case on these points. I am open to conviction on these points, but I do not think he will be able to convince me, however eloquently he <Col N="252" /> may plead, that it is right for the Dáil to pass a measure which deprives a couple of individuals of a sum of less than £200 a year.  It seems to me an abuse of legislation, and, as Deputy O'Connell says, it strikes at public confidence because of the feeling that general legislation may be used to affect the rights of two, three or more individuals. Where a large class is concerned people must suffer for the public good.  In this case the public stands to gain little, the individual stands to lose a great deal.  Therefore, I earnestly hope that the Government will not proceed with this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this is a measure which is unworthy of the Minister himself, of the Government that he represents, and of the State of which it is the Government. At the beginning of this session, when there are numerous extremely urgent and pressing measures which need to be passed through the Oireachtas for the benefit of the country&mdash;measures such as the Courts Officers Bill, the need for which is holding up the whole business of the circuit courts throughout the country&mdash;we are called upon to discuss and to pass a measure which the Minister himself says has no financial significance, and which he finds, I think the Dáil will agree, very hard to defend. It is not a measure which will involve a large section of the people.  It is not a measure which will involve the future of the country.  The Minister has stated that the measure is not retrospective.  What is it if it is not retrospective?  Does it not propose to take away certain rights&mdash;rights which were not only acquiesced in, but which were specifically given to certain individual citizens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it to be contended by the Government of to-day that the Government of 1924 and of 1925 were blindfolded, that when the very names of these people were actually inserted in the Bill of 1924 and when certain rights were given to them they did not know that these rights were being given absolutely and unconditionally? Is it to be the practice, as this Bill would seem to indicate, that not only what one Government does to-day in regard to pensions <Col N="253" /> of certain classes of public officials will be discarded by another Government of to-morrow&mdash;a practice that is never indulged in by any well-organised and civilised country&mdash;but that the same Government is to come forward with one Bill to-day, name certain people who are to be entitled to certain absolutely unconditional rights, and that that very same Government is to have the face&mdash;I say the audacity&mdash;within the space of two years to say that these very people are not to enjoy these rights now except under certain conditions which we did not impose in 1924 but which we seek to impose now?</P>
    <P>This Bill at the very outside could not involve more than the pensions of twenty-six one-time officers of local bodies.  Out of that twenty-six I understand that twenty-two are not employed by any local authority, that two have passed away and that at the very most there are only two to-day who could be in any way implicated or affected by this Bill.  Yet at this stage when there is a crying need for important legislation we are asked seriously to pass this two-man measure, taking away the rights which were conferred by a previous measure of this same Government.  What is the position of these two individuals?  At the period in or about the Treaty, Section 8 of the Local Government Act of 1919 was in existence.  It provided that certain officers dismissed from certain bodies should be entitled to certain rights.  These officers in question, and the remainder of the twenty-six, were placed in the position of having to choose, if I may say so without offence, between the devil and the deep sea.  On the one hand they were officers of local bodies.  On the other hand the local bodies were controlled by the Local Government Board.  They were told on the one hand by the local bodies that they had to do one thing; on the other hand they were told by the Local Government Board that they had to do the other.  Some of them choose one way; some the other.</P>
    <P>I do not think, as a matter of fact, that there was any choice.  I think that probably those who chose one way ran as great a risk, if not greater, than those who chose the other, but however <Col N="254" /> that may be, certain numbers of them were actually dismissed by the local bodies and, having been dismissed, they brought their claims before the courts.  By a judgment of the Court of Appeal in 1921, their claims were upheld. Subsequently an Arbitration Court was set up and Mr. Justice Wylie, his appointment having the approval of the Saorstát, made certain awards.  As a result of those awards; and because the local authorities refused to honour those awards, this Government passed a Bill, known now as the Local Officers' Compensation (War Period) Act, 1924.  In that Act they actually named the very people who were to receive the amount of the awards made by Mr. Justice Wylie. Then came the Local Government Act of 1925 and, as Deputy O'Connell has accurately stated, this matter was not only not overlooked in that Act, but the Act was specifically altered so as not to apply any disability to those people entitled to pensions under the Local Officers' Act of 1924.</P>
    <P>Let me take as an instance one of the two individuals concerning whose pension we are asked to pass this Bill.  In 1919 this gentleman was dismissed from the position he held by a local body.  He was dismissed ostensibly for political reasons.  There were no bones made about it at the time, and that being so he made his case before the Court of Appeal and also before Mr. Justice Wylie's Committee.  He was awarded the sum of £160 per annum, that sum to be retrospective from 1919 and to be unconditional.  Now, in 1926, seven years after he received that unconditional award, with the full approval of the then Government under whom Mr. Justice Wylie acted, with the full approval of the then Government, who subsequently passed the Act of 1924, with the further approval of the Government who ratified it by the Act of 1925, we are asked by the same Government to pass a measure depriving that man of the unconditional pension that he got seven years ago.  If that is not retrospective legislation I would like to know what is.</P>
    <P>It may seem that it is all a storm in a teacup.  I really think it is.  I think this measure should never be introduced <Col N="255" /> here.  I think it is belittling the Dáil and belittling the Government to come along with a measure such as this, which will not affect a large number of the citizens of the Saorstát, which will not effect, as the Minister has admitted, any great economy, and which I submit does not affect any general principle. As has been already stated, why should a man who chooses to remain in the Saorstát when he receives a pension and chooses to serve in some capacity some local body, be penalised, and why should he suffer in his rights when his comrade who is in the same position can go across the border, serve perhaps the Government of that country, go across to any other country he chooses, draw his full pension from the Saorstát, and enjoy it elsewhere to the benefit of no people in this country.</P>
    <P>In this particular instance, I would like to point out that the man happened not to be employed in a similar capacity to what he was previously, but, on the contrary, he actually went and studied and trained himself for an entirely different class of work.  He succeeded in getting that work from another local body, and because he has been so industrious, so energetic, because he has been sufficiently patriotic to remain in the Saorstát and not to go as others have gone and spend his pension elsewhere, because he is of sufficient use to the local administration of this country that a local body thinks fit to employ him, that man is to be penalised and others who did not take the course that he is taking are to be allowed to enjoy the full amount of the pension that has been granted.</P>
    <P>Then again it might have been possible for many of those people to have elected to take a lump sum by way of compensation instead of pension. Is it proposed now to attach any lump sum which may have been given if the recipient of that sum succeeds in getting employment from a local body? I cannot follow the line of argument that because certain rights were given &mdash;I am not saying that they ought to have been given, but they were given with the full approval of this Government&mdash;I do not see what moral right there is for this Government to deprive <Col N="256" /> the recipient of those awards or anything appertaining to those awards.</P>
    <P>What those awards were is unequivocally clear, from the various Acts I have cited, commencing with the Act of 1919 down to the Act of 1925, that is they were absolutely unconditional. Is it suggested that if the Dáil passes a measure to-morrow giving pensions to ex-service men in the National Army, that the same or even a subsequent Government should come along and attach different conditions to the pensions which have been given by this Government?  I do not think that any Minister would have the face to make such a proposal.  I say, from start to finish, this is a paltry measure, and is trifling with the time of this House. It is trifling with public honour and decency in this country to come along and discuss the passing of a measure depriving two people of rights which we ourselves in this Dáil and the Government bestowed on them seven or a less number of years ago.  I hope, after the appeal made by Deputy O'Connell and by Deputy Bryan Cooper, that I have not imported any heat into the matter.  I think it is in the interests of the Government that nothing of this nature should be allowed to be brought here, and to have it thrown in their faces that they are scrapping their undertakings with individuals in the Saorstát, because that is what it amounts to.  The President has said on more than one occasion, and has had the courage to say so, that Great Britain has kept her word to the Saorstát in regard to the Treaty, and that she has acted honourably up to the present.  I say this is a matter of honour with our Government, and that it is dishonourable, to say the least of it, that in connection with a matter which was explicably bound up with the negotiations and Treaty itself, that the Government should now come along and seek to deprive individuals of the Free State of what they themselves were prepared to give them only a few short years ago.</P>

      <P>I am not going to debate the merits or demerits of this Bill.  I think they have been sufficiently dealt with by the previous Deputy.  There was one statement made <Col N="257" /> by the Minister to which I should like to call his attention.  I held an erroneous opinion as to the finance of this measure.  I understood when this 1924 Bill was introduced that the money to be paid to those officers was to be supplied by the central fund, and not, as the Minister now in his statement makes clear, from the local rates.  It is news to me that it is paid by the local rates.  I do not believe there is a county council in Ireland that understands that such is happening. I am glad he made it so clear. I hold it is unfair to the local rates to have to pay these pensions at all.  Those officers were dismissed at the bidding of the then Local Government Department. I remember sitting on the county council and having instructions from the Local Government Department before us time and again.  We were finally ordered to dismiss those officers who did not fall in line with their instructions. In Wexford we did so, and when they sought pensions from the county council we declined to pay them from the rates on every occasion.  We sent back word to the Minister that we declined to pay them from the local rates.  To-day the Minister has informed us that these pensions are paid from the local rates or from grants sustaining the local rates, which is tantamount to the same.  Those grants are withheld from the rates.  I hold that county councils all through Ireland have been misled.  I should like a further statement from the Minister on the matter.</P>

      <P>The emphasis I want to lay on this question is somewhat different from that of the other Deputies.  Without dealing with the merits of the quarrel that took place, pre-Truce, between Dáil Eireann and the British authorities, without expressing any view as to whether those local officers were justified in obeying the statutory authority of the time or the public authority of the time, it appeared to be admitted by the Minister that a discrimination is now going to be made against certain people who, by disobedience of the public authority of the time and by obeying the statutory authority at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct <Col N="258" /> that.  It is to remove the discrimination in their favour, but there is no intention to discriminate against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that it is actually a discrimination against them.  There were many offenders in the pre-Truce period against the public authority of the time.  There were many landowners, owners of estates, and owners of big houses who flouted emphatically the authority of Dáil Eireann, deliberately flouted that authority, and they had their punishment, which was very often inflicted by the torch.  Their houses were destroyed and they appealed to the courts and got compensation. Is there any prohibition of these people against getting employment under a local authority?  No. On the contrary, what have you done within the last few weeks?  You entered into an agreement to increase their compensation by 10 per cent.  We had a good deal of talk a little while ago about the desirability of allowing the ill-feelings of that time to be cleared up.  There has been talk about forgetting bygones and wiping out all hatreds, but surely this is a Bill which is going to perpetuate and deliberately reinstil these hatreds.  The argument is, and, of course, undoubtedly it is a fact, that only two persons, possibly only one, will be affected by the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly at this stage, whatever may happen in the future, before anybody else can be brought under this Bill he must apply for appointment and be employed by a new local authority in the future.  At the outside, two persons are going to be affected.  As Deputy O'Connell stated, it is rather significant and not a pleasant thought that one of the persons to be particularly affected is a person in whose name action in the courts had to be taken.  That does not add to one's feeling of confidence that this Bill has been brought in entirely out of good-will.  Then one has to remember the effect of it.  I think that if a local authority finds it possible to get better value out of A than out of B, C, D and E, it will appoint him to a particular post, but, not at present being employed by a local authority, he <Col N="259" /> should not be deprived of offering his services to that local authority.  This is not a similar case to a transfer from one local authority to another.  It is not a similar case to a voluntary resignation and then re-employment by another authority.  This is a case of forced resignation, and the person in question, having gone through another course of training entirely, qualified himself for another post, is deliberately deprived of what, rightly or wrongly, was enacted in his favour. The case is being made by the enactment of this Bill, if it is enacted, that future Governments, if they wish to follow the precedent, will penalise all those people who received any compensation or assistance from the State by virtue of an act done in the pre-Truce period.  You are going to lay the headline for future Governments to say that the person who received any compensation or pension&mdash;policemen, soldiers or others&mdash;will be entitled to get any emoluments of any kind from any public service without being penalised.</P>
    <P>That, I say, is going to perpetuate those feelings which Ministers at other times have been eloquent in pleading should be obliterated and wiped out. This, I think is an unfortunate Bill.  I cannot understand where the desirable principle, which the Minister says is involved, comes in.  There is a principle involved but it is a very bad principle, and that, I think, would justify the Dáil in not giving the Bill a second reading.  Without having to ask the Dáil to divide on a matter of this kind I would urge the Minister to reconsider his own position.  It is not being pressed forward by his own Department but by the Local Government Department.  As the Minister said, it was not a Bill for which he was primarily responsible.  That very Department had the matter under consideration during the interval between the introduction of the first and the second draft of the Local Government Bill. The whole matter was gone into by the Department concerned and the men primarily concerned were brought face to face.  One of the officers of the Ministry at the time is now in the Ministry <Col N="260" /> of Local Government, and, presumably acting on the advice of experts in the Department, the Minister re-drafted his Bill so that there would be no question that the men who are receiving pensions from the Central Fund under a specific Act should be brought within the purview of the measure then being dealt with.  I think that no case has been made for the Bill, and I think that the case against it is that you are dealing with these men and women in a way which is entirely different from the spirit in which you asked us to agree in respect to other sections of the community who also disobeyed the orders of Dáil Eireann in 1919 and 1920.  I think that there is a discrimination against these persons and that you are treating them differently from the way in which you treated other classes of the community in respect to their conduct during that period.  I think that the Bill ought not to be pressed at this stage and that the whole matter should be re-considered with a view to safeguarding the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I approached the consideration of this measure with no reference whatever to a particular individual who may have made representations to anybody in the House concerning it, but rather I approached it from the point of view of principle.  I notice that the principle of the Bill has been rigorously avoided in the speeches to which I have listened in connection with it.  There is a history attached to this whole question.  The historical side of it has been absolutely neglected, but perhaps it is not known to some of the Deputies who have spoken.  The real history in connection with the matter started in 1919. An Act was introduced and passed in the British Parliament called the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Act, 1919.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the face of it, it looked to be an Act dealing specifically with criminal and malicious injuries.  During its passage a certain organisation, or a certain number of individuals representing the officials of local authorities, proceeded to point out to the gentleman who was occupying the position of Chief Secretary for Ireland&mdash;I think he was Mr. <Col N="261" /> MacPherson&mdash;that in the forthcoming elections a great change in representation would take place; that the position of officers of local authorities would be rendered difficult; that they would find their positions altered and perhaps would be dismissed, and they desired to have some security in respect of the change that would take place. They managed to get included in this Act, called the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Act, a particular section, Section 8, which altered&mdash;I might say, revolutionised&mdash;the terms of superannuation which, up to that time, an official of a local authority was entitled to claim.  The Act was bad, it was an unjust, immoral, and a wicked Act in every respect, not alone with regard to Section 8 but from the beginning to the end.  It was, perhaps, one of the most corrupt measures ever introduced into and passed in any Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the President say if he is referring to the Criminal Injuries Act or the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1919?  There seems to be some confusion.  I understand the section under which the pensions were given was Section 8 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1919.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can have it that way if he likes.  I think he will find that practically every section of that Act deals with criminal and malicious injuries, with the exception of Section 8.  Section 8 deals with these officials and the case they then put up to the Chief Secretary. Although it is some years since I had the Act in my hand, I challenge denial of the statement that Section 8 was a very much more expensive and extravagant superannuation scheme than had appeared up to that time for employees of local authorities.  It introduced a new element into the question of compensation. Compensation, or superannuation, as it was known up to that time, was based, I think, upon the number of years service divided by sixty. I think it required ten years to qualify. In some cases it was necessary to have twenty years' service before a pension was payable.  This particular section enabled a person having less than ten years' service to get compensation in <Col N="262" /> a bulk sum in the rate of one whole year's salary for the first year and a half-year's salary for every completed year of service, with a maximum of five years.  It came to this, that if an official had £200 yearly and had 9½ years' service it was possible for him, with the sanction of the Local Government Board, to get £1,000 in hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the particular phase which gave rise to the whole trouble and which has been avoided.  As I said before, I am not dealing with individuals.  I am dealing with the principle only.  If a man with ten years' service was entitled to ten-sixtieths of £200, that would amount to £33 6s. 8d.  That was only for the life of the individual.  One can judge the merits of this &ldquo;just&rdquo; Act by comparing a life interest of £33 6s. 8d. per annum and a lump sum of £1,000. Local authorities took exception to that, and to other Acts passed, and a conflict arose.  It developed when another Act was passed, in 1920, practically surrendering into the hands of any person who had a decree for criminal and malicious injuries every penny of money that belonged to a local authority.  Out of that arose a conflict, and within six or eight months &mdash;I think in August, 1920&mdash;the Local Government Board declined to send the local authority moneys out of the local taxation account.  I would like to remind Deputy Doyle that a sum of something like £1,300,000 or £1,500,000 was due to local authorities in respect of the withheld grants in January, 1922, when members of the Provisional Government secured that sum and paid it to the local authorities.  On getting that very considerable sum they were asked would they on their part undertake to see that the officers who had been dismissed and whose pensions had been arranged by the Local Government Board would have their cases favourably considered.  The answer to that was &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  The local authorities should remember that they got the withheld grants, that the sum in dispute and one of the main purposes of the conflict was settled by that payment. <Col N="263" /> A settlement is not arrived at by giving one side all.  A very considerable sum of money was also available in the local taxation account in respect of interest which would not have accrued but for that conflict, and which sum relieves local authorities of a very considerable amount in connection with this payment.  It has been said that we are discriminating here.  In my experience in connection with public matters a very considerable number of people object to pensioners being employed. I think it was a test in some elections, and I think the party that Deputy Johnson belongs to was one of those parties who objected to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I say unhesitatingly that one of the points made by the Labour Party in connection with elections to my knowledge during the last twenty-five years was the objection to the employment of pensioners.  Under the Military Service Pensions Act the employment of a person entitled to a pension is open to a deduction from the pension.  That was specially put in.  In the case of local officers who were not in this conflict they are open to this disadvantage, that the persons affected by reason of this Act are in a sense privileged persons, because their cases were considered under what I have described as an extravagant and an expensive superannuation system.  Discrimination against them there is not.  Should we put them on a level with other persons superannuated by local authorities? Yes.  Why should they be <Col N="264" /> singled out for special treatment, and why should there be a case made for them so that other officers of local authorities superannuated should be in a less favourable position than they are in?</P>

They are not entitled to greater consideration than other officials of local authorities.  That is the principle of the Bill, and I am supporting the principle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the persons who will be affected by this Bill are not to be entitled to take up positions for which they are specially fitted in this country, but that they may go to the North of Ireland or to England, or any other country, and get positions under local authorities there.  Those local authorities will have the benefit of the special training and experience of those officers.  In this country, they may take up any position which is not under a local authority. I do not see the necessity for this Bill. The feeling of people who have taken any interest in this matter is, that the Bill is brought in in a spirit of revenge <Col N="265" /> for certain things that happened in Limerick.  It is as well to state the matter clearly.  That is the feeling. People are more or less convinced of that by the fact that the Bill will only affect one person, if it becomes an Act. If the President, or the Minister for Finance, can show to the Dáil that there is a good case for the introduction of this measure, that there is something existing now which did not exist when the Local Government Act was going through the House, I am sure that the Dáil will be prepared to consider it.  But it seems to me that the Minister for Finance and the Government as a whole would be better employed dealing with the industrial position of the country and trying to provide means of employment for the workers than in bringing in little pin-pricking Bills of this sort.  I think there is far too much time&mdash;and it is the opinion of most people in the country&mdash;being wasted on legislation of this sort while there are so many greater problems awaiting attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to make clear my attitude on the question and to say that I am entirely opposed to the Minister for Finance on the question of the introduction of this Bill.  We have had explanations from the Minister and we have heard the President deal with the subject.  Nothing, however, can alter the fact that the Bill is directed against one or two individuals. It is quite useless to say that the question of individuals does not enter into the Bill or was not taken into consideration by the promoters. If you leave out those few individuals, the Bill disappears.  With the end of their life, the Bill comes to an end likewise.  It may be quite right for the President to say that one person or two persons are placed in a favoured position by the legislation that has been already passed.  But if legislation, passed as recently as a couple of years ago, has the effect of providing <Col N="266" /> favourable terms for one person or two persons, is this House to be called upon to pass a special Act to deprive these people of what you have given them?</P>
      <P>Commercially, the proposition is perfectly unsound.  As far as the amount involved is concerned, the Bill is not justified, and I do not think it is a credit to our legislature that a Bill of this sort should be brought forward.  I think it has been sufficiently emphasised that the person or persons concerned in this matter were dismissed. In putting forward their claim and pressing it, they got what they and the people responsible at the time would have called justice.  Arising out of the disturbed conditions, you have a mass of disemployed people getting pensions who are free to take up other occupations. In many cases, the people who are enjoying those pensions to-day are better off than they would have been in their own employment.  Why, therefore, single out one or two individuals in order to deprive them of the position you deliberately gave them?  I hope, with Deputy Johnson, that the Minister will see his way to withdraw the Bill, because, if it is put to a division, I would have to record my vote against it.  I will do that not with any knowledge of the case, not with any knowledge of the individual, and not with any knowledge of what the Bill is about except what I gained from the discussion in the House.  Having heard Deputy O'Connell and other Deputies on the question, there is no doubt left in my mind that the President and the Minister for Finance would be well advised not to proceed with the Bill.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the appeal of those who have asked the Government not to press this Bill.  I agree with them that it is not worth while proceeding with it.  I am prepared to accept the principle laid down by the President.  For the sake of argument, I would be prepared even to agree with the Minister for Finance, that this Bill does not discriminate against, but removes discrimination in favour of, certain people.  For the sake of argument, I would be prepared to admit that.  But the essence of the President's case seemed to me to be that they made a mistake in making a <Col N="267" /> certain agreement and did not recognise a principle which he claims is valid and should be recognised.  There, I say, is the weakness of the Government in bringing forward this Bill.  It becomes a retrospective Bill to remove what they think was a wrong thing in so far as it affects a few people.  In order to substantiate the force of that principle they are prepared to make this retrospective legislation which, we are told, will have the effect of operating in one or two cases.  I do not know those cases at all, but it seems to me that is a wrong principle in legislation. Even admitting the statement of the Minister for Finance, I urge them not, for the sake of establishing that principle which they have asserted and acted on before, to press this Bill.</P>

    <P>I may say, in moving this Estimate, that in view of the fact that a Dáil Committee recommended the establishment of a broadcasting station, and that the report of that Committee was accepted by the Dáil, we thought it not improper to incur the fairly considerable expenditure that has already been incurred out of the Contingency Fund.  In the ordinary way, in connection with a new service like this, expenditure ought not to be incurred until the Dáil actually votes an esimate; but as decisions were not arrived until the Dáil had risen for the Summer Recess, it was decided, in view of the particular circumstances existing, to proceed with the erection of a station.  When the Dáil did meet in November the boundary crisis and other matters were upon us and the supplementary estimates were delayed until the present time.</P>

      <P>The estimate which has been moved by the Minister for Finance comes under four headings. The first deals with salaries, wages and allowances&mdash;£4,800.  This item may be sub-divided into two parts.  The first, £1,545, covers the running cost of the station, and the remainder pays artists, not only locally, but elsewhere, wherever we should find it necessary to employ them.  The staff employed in the station is set forth here; it numbers twenty.  Two of these have not yet been selected.  I refer to the assistant director and woman organiser.  These posts are advertised at the moment and will be filled, I hope, within a week or so.  When these posts are filled we will have eighteen full-time employees and two part-timers.  The part-time officials are the musical director and the announcer.  They have been employed as part-time officials, but in reality they work something like twelve or fourteen hours a day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the new term for part-timers.  Now, under head B we have a sum of £250 which was expended on the visit of our engineer and other officials to stations on the other side in order to enable them to acquaint themselves with the manner in which broadcasting stations are conducted over there.  This will not be a recurring item.  Under head C we have rent, light and heat as ordinary items.  Head B is not a recurring item, except in so far as it deals with maintenance.</P>
      <P>The cost of the station itself is shown here.  The station is in the McKee Barracks, and the broadcasting headquarters, or studio, as it is usually termed, is in Great Denmark Street. The items set out here include furniture and equipment for both places. Under the heading relating to miscellaneous expenses, which amount to £850, we have such items as postage, stationery, and copyright royalties. Copyright royalties in broadcasting are not only difficult of arrangement, but are also expensive.  We have also under this particular heading provision for weather reports and news services, and also such items as we may from time to time be called upon to provide in the way of extra musical equipment, gramophone records, and matters of that kind.</P>
      <P>Now, it is intended that this sum of £14,385 shall cover the period up to the end of the financial year.  Thereafter the broadcasting estimates will take their place in the annual estimates, and be discussed as separate items.  It is not intended that these estimates should be included within the sphere of the Post Office proper.  This, I believe, gives a sufficient explanation of the Vote which the Minister for Finance has just moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, seeing that the service is a new one, and that it has brought in its trail a very large amount of public interest, I take it that the Dáil will expect that a short review of the present position and of our future programme should be forthcoming.  To begin with, I want to say that the staff at our broadcasting station here, as at present envisaged, is inadequate.  Were <Col N="270" /> it not for the substantial assistance rendered by the Secretary's Office of my Department, it would not have been possible to maintain the programme at all.  Deputies will agree with me that the arrangement of a single night's programme of amusement is not in itself an easy task.  Those who have had experience in that way will agree that the number of details is very large, indeed. But when we apply a programme of that kind to seven nights in the week, and 365 nights in the year, we will learn more fully the extent and magnitude of the task.  I must say that I had no conception at the outset that broadcasting involved such a great variety of details and such intricate details as we have experienced since we opened the station.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that it might have been possible to work this programme with a musical director working part time, and an announcer in a similar position, and with the other members of the staff as you see them here.  But the two officers to whom I have referred particularly have been called upon to work something like twelve to fourteen hours a day up to the present, and both they and the station director have consented to continue their services only on the clear understanding given by me on more than one occasion, that immediate steps would be taken to provide an adequate staff for the station.</P>
    <P>I think it right at this stage, in view of the possibility of ill-informed criticism being made later on in regard to the staffing of this station, to make it clear here that the staff that we have at present is not adequate for the purpose and that it must be increased, regardless of cost, if the station is to be continued.  I had no doubt about that fact myself for some time past, since I became acquainted with the conditions in other broadcasting stations.  I have taken pains to produce a list of those employed in a typical station at the other side&mdash;Manchester. It is not entirely a typical station, not typical to the extent of doing quite as much work as we do here, for the reason that Manchester provides a considerable part of its programme from London, and also carries through the main part of its clerical <Col N="271" /> work from the central office of the British Broadcasting Station.  Therefore, in this respect, Manchester is more favourably situated from the point of view of the work than we are here.</P>
    <P>Here is a list of the staff at Manchester:&mdash;One station director, one secretary to the station director, two assistant directors, two publicity men, one commissionaire, one musical director, one orchestral conductor, twenty-five members of the orchestra, one lady organiser, one lady attendant for the lady artistes, four typists, one filing clerk, one property man, one doorman, one junior boy, one messenger, one senior maintenance engineer, three assistance maintenance engineers, one linesman, two men for outside broadcasting, one night clerk, and one night telephonist, making a total staff of 53, as against 20 in the Dublin office.  I dare say that the staff in Manchester is not employed for the mere purpose of kicking their heels against the walls in the Manchester Radio Station, and there is some justification for the employment of these 53 people.  Therefore, contemplating doing very much more work here, working as an independent unit, as we are in Dublin, the staff of 20 is entirely inadequate.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not intend to tell the Dáil at this moment what extra staff we may require.  We will work with the lowest possible margin, but I just want to give notice that we must necessarily increase the staff.  We have one increase in anticipation, and that is the augmentation of our orchestra.  At the present time we are confined to an orchestra of four.  This orchestra comes into the programme in a week's time.  It is engaged and practising at the moment, but it must be increased to eight in the very near future.  That is the only immediate increase in the staff that I can outline to-night.</P>
    <P>The programme that we have envisaged and that we intend to pursue for the future is not a great extension of the present programme, for the very simple reason that we cannot make any extension until we are more firmly placed with regard to staff.  Therefore, we intend to extend slowly and to pick our steps carefully; in other <Col N="272" /> words, we will not take on anything that we may have to recede from.  At present we run through a programme of three hours per night&mdash;from 7.30 to 10.30&mdash;and two hours on Sunday nights&mdash;8.30 to 10.30.  In the immediate future we mean to extend these hours by introducing an item which will involve some extra staff, both intern and extern, during the earlier part of the day, in the form of broadcasting market reports at, say, about 1.30.  In certain continental countries this practice is followed, and I believe it to be the right one.</P>
    <P>We believe that the middle of the day is the correct time to broadcast stock exchange reports.  When I say stock exchange reports I mean that these reports will be confined to Irish stocks.  We are satisfied that the middle of the day is the correct time to issue stock exchange and market reports to listeners-in.  This will be the only immediate extension in regard to hours.  Later on, we may do something with a school programme.  We are discussing this matter with the Ministry of Education, and no doubt it will take time to materialise.  But we are prepared to consider sympathetically a school programme in or about the same time as I have mentioned in regard to other reports.  We may also do something later on in the way of a children's programme, perhaps at about 6 o'clock, as well as with a programme on domestic economy and similar matters relating to the ladies' sphere at a slightly later hour.  Finally, in the next three or four months possibly the programme will be one hour in the middle of the day and from 6 to 10.30 at night.  These latter items that I have mentioned are not yet decided on, and there is no need to go more fully into them, but within the next week or fortnight our programme will consist of a weather report at 7.30, to be supplemented, I hope, by news items with which I will deal later.</P>
    <P>From 7.35 to 7.45 we intend to introduce lectures on various subjects&mdash;subjects that we deem suitable.  From 7.45 to 8 will be devoted to language teaching.  I am referring now to the week nights.  We are arranging for Irish classes on three nights a week, <Col N="273" /> and on the other three nights we propose to have the teaching of French, German and Spanish.  From 8 to 10.30 will be confined solely to entertainment of the musical type.  We intend to shut down at 10.30 punctually.  We do not mean to keep our station open after that hour except under the most exceptional conditions.  I do not know how that particular viewpoint meets with the wishes of the Dáil, but it is my own.  I consider that it is a bad practice to take people off the normal track of living: to keep them up late at night and to disturb the usual routine of life unduly.  I believe that 10.30 is late enough.  On Sunday nights we will give those programmes which we have been giving during the last few Sunday nights&mdash;musical in the main, but occasionally we may very the programme with religious items.</P>
    <P>That is the programme that we intend to pursue for some little time to come&mdash;until the bigger one which I outlined at an earlier stage will have matured.  Preparations have been made for a re-lay from the other side. The British Broadcasting Company, which, I may say here, assisted the Dublin station to the utmost in getting under way, has come to an agreement with us whereby we are enabled to relay at any time that we choose.  We have therefore decided for a bi-weekly relay of those items which we, in our judgment, consider desirable, and that will proceed on and from next week.  The cost of this variation is not infinitesimal. It is cheap from the point of view of the British Broadcasting Company. I must say that they have treated us very decently, but, nevertheless, with our resources it is expensive enough.  It will cost us something in the nature of £14 or £15 an hour.  I just mention this figure to warn people who speak lightly of extending jazz music and entertainment of that kind to this side: that every hour which we transmit from the other side involves a sum such as I have mentioned, namely, anything in the region of £15 an hour.  Not only will we re-lay from Daventry, but also from Belfast, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, or any place where we shall find a suitable programme.  We hope, also, that those stations may from <Col N="274" /> time to time take suitable programmes from us which we intend to put up.  I believe they will.  An interchange of programme between countries has become quite a common thing.</P>
    <P>The return in licence fees to date has not been satisfactory.  Up to the 31st of December last we had received in the twenty-six counties 2,900 licence fees, and in the interval up to yesterday we received an additional 1,300 from the Dublin area.  We have not had a return from other parts of the country yet.  I propose to get this return monthly.  I understand we cannot get it more frequently, because of the difficulty of collection, seeing that every small Post Office issues licences.  The total response in the Dublin area during the present month amounts to 1,300 licences.  What part of the total this is I leave to the imagination of Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is clear there are a great many citizens of this country who are too busy to find time to pay broadcasting licences.  In order to remind them of their duty in that respect a Bill is being introduced next <Col N="275" /> month that I think will not only cover licences but a variety of other questions dealing with broadcasting.  The Bill is in course of preparation now.</P>
      <P>More than one correspondent has complained that the wave length of 390, secured by Dublin broadcasting station could be improved on or is not the best.  Well it is clear that it was our duty to get the best position we could in the overcrowded wave band. There are in Europe, roughly, 165 broadcasting stations with a wave band of 200 to 500, allotted by the various governments.  They can only accommodate, without interference, 150 stations. We have gone beyond the limit now and the position is becoming more serious every day&mdash;more serious with new stations, and it is impossible for any station coming along at this stage to get a free space.  We had to choose that position which we thought most free, and we satisfied ourselves that we have got as good a position as was available.  I see no hope of any deviation from that until such time as the possibility of broadcasting comes under review by the governments of the world, and this is foreshadowed in a convention which is likely to take place at Washington in the fall, and when this convention comes off it is thought that steps will be taken to eliminate many of the smaller stations and make way for free play for the existing ones or the remaining ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will expect to hear something of the future developments of what we have in mind with regard to that.  There are two courses which we could follow here.  One is the erection of a big central station of the Daventry type costing anything up to £60,000 or £70,000 for erection, and involving the State in an annual engineering maintenance expenditure of something like £25,000.  A station of this kind has an effective range for crystal sets of 75 miles; therefore, such a station should be in the centre of the country obviously. We stand in a peculiar position here.  The bulk of our population is along the coast, and therefore the bulk of the population would be excluded from this range, or rather a big percentage of the urban population would <Col N="276" /> be excluded from the range of a station of this kind.  Apart altogether from the cost, which is prohibitive, it would mean the erection of a power station and a very heavy outlay in other directions, yet we would still find a considerable portion of our people outside the crystal range.</P>
    <P>There is another alternative which may, or may not, be within our reach in the near future, that of a medium power station, a station costing perhaps three or four times that which the Dublin station costs, but nevertheless taking with it an annual engineering outlay of £20,000, and that would only have an effective crystal range of about 50 miles.  A station of this kind, if science advances as some people believe it will, will be of the type known as a low-power-short-wave station.  You will note that a crystal range is very much more effective than a range provided by a station like ours, but not quite as effective as that provided by Daventry.  The argument against a station of that kind, and we would require two or three to bring the whole country into the crystal distance, is initial expense and annual maintenance. The other alternative and the one we are inclined to follow, and, I think, must follow, is the development of the Dublin station.  This station, as you may observe, cost in erection between £5,000 and £6,000, and with the studio it costs something over £7,000.</P>
    <P>The initial outlay in this case is not very much, and the annual engineering cost will not be very heavy.  These two factors rather incline us to the belief that we will be well-advised to take that course.  We are reluctant naturally to ask the State to plunge its money into a venture which may change radically within a short time.  Broadcasting is changing from day to day. If the Minister for Finance takes this view and is prepared to spend more money on broadcasting, I intend asking him to sanction a sum similar to that sanctioned for the Dublin station and expend that on the erection of a station in Cork.</P>

      <P>Of course we are a very considerable people down there and a very important people.  The population of Cork City and County, covered by a crystal range in this case, is something like 200,000.  Of course we are concerned with the question of the return in licence fees.  If this line of development were pursued it would ultimately happen that we would have a third station somewhere in the West, possibly in Galway, and a fourth in the North-West.  The four stations would fairly adequately cover the country and cover it sufficiently for the depth of our purse.  At any rate for the moment we have only in contemplation the erection of a second station, and as I said in this matter of broadcasting we are going to move cautiously and see what the public return in the way of willingness to pay up for value received is going to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned that we had in view the production of a news item, of five minutes duration or thereabouts.  A news item is a very interesting one in broadcasting and is keenly looked forward to even by people who take little or no interest in music or even lectures. Most people like to get the news of the day.  In this connection we have been in negotiation with representatives of the Dublin newspapers during the past few months.  Certain proposals have been put up to that body to provide us with not only Irish but an international review somewhat similar to that which is provided by the British Broadcasting Company.  We find, however, that our proposals have not been acceptable to either the British news agencies or to the Dublin Press.  As a matter of fact, I fear that the restrictions which the latter body wishes to impose on us as a preliminary to the formulation of any such news scheme are out of the question. We cannot accept them.  There is no need to mention these terms, but they so restrict our field of activity that I fear they stand very little prospect of endorsement by the House judging from the views set forth on this particular question not only by the Committee that considered broadcasting but by the recent Committee <Col N="278" /> in England.  It therefore follows that we have got to face elsewhere for a news programme.  I am satisfied that the material is available, and it should not surprise me if that material were likely to be an improvement on that secured from the British Broadcasting Agency at the present time.  More than that, with regard to the Press, I do not intend to say except that I regret that we have not been able to secure a news service from the Dublin newspapers or from the British news agencies.  I see no prospect whatever of doing so in the future within the terms set forth by these bodies.</P>
    <P>There is only one other item.  I am satisfied that the programmes we have produced up to now are reasonably good.  It is difficult to satisfy everybody with regard to a programme. That ideal has yet to be attained in any country.  I do not believe that it will ever be attained in any country. Most people that I meet seem to hold different views.  It is very hard to meet two people who hold the same views in regard to musical affairs.  One person wants all music; another wants half lectures and half music; another wants no lectures at all; a fourth wants no music at all; a fifth thinks that the scales should be weighed in favour of one item against another; a sixth thinks the opposite.  If anybody believes that it is possible to satisfy the general public in regard to a broadcasting programme I think he will find himself deceived from the mere fact that an old established institution like the British Broadcasting Company has not been able to satisfy general public requirements.</P>
    <P>The British Broadcasting Company is a very well managed and a very efficient institution.  Some of you will remember that within the last month certain English journals opened their columns to a criticism of its programmes, and one paper in particular got no less than 400 protests in one day against the British broadcasting programme. Personally, I believe the British broadcasting programme is good.  I have been listening to it for the past six months, and my own untutored judgment convinces me that it is a very good programme.  Yet that <Col N="279" /> very able institution has failed to satisfy its listeners.  Now, I do not hold here that we have satisfied everybody, that we are going to satisfy everybody, or that we intend to try to satisfy everybody, but I am satisfied that we have given a reasonably good programme, and I am gratified to know that great numbers of people in other countries have taken the trouble to show their appreciation of that programme. Whether in time, when we can be more firmly established and the machine is running more smoothly, we will be able to improve, I cannot say. That is a matter for the future, but I am satisfied that we have done reasonably well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the very full, frank and interesting statement that the Minister has made has almost disarmed criticism.  I think the whole Dáil is grateful to him for setting forth so clearly and at such length the position in regard to broadcasting. Nevertheless, some criticism must come, because it is a natural consequence of the State undertaking a service of this character that criticism is expected to be made here.  Letters which in England drop into the letter-box of the B.B.C., or go into the offices of the newspapers, have in many cases come to Deputies here and they have to put their views forward.  I hope in everything I say that the Minister will see that it is intended to be a friendly, constructive criticism, making due allowance for all the trouble that must be encountered in establishing a service of this kind for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to emphasise the fact that I am speaking from the point of view of the user of a crystal set, costing 8s. 6d., installed by a schoolboy at a distance of ten miles from the broadcasting station.  I know that the Minister will suspect that I have a hankering for getting Daventry or 2LO.  That is not the case.  I am quite satisfied with Dublin, and in one respect I can whole-heartedly praise Dublin, and that is in the transmission.  My little weak set does not pick up those great invisible European stations that appear to interfere with other people.  My <Col N="280" /> only interference is the Morse on the mail-boats or the wind over the house, but when these are not operating I think the transmission is admirable.  I get results ten miles from 2RN every night, and I can hear every musical piece if the artist is competent.  I think the Minister is to be whole-heartedly applauded for that.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the entertainment itself. The Minister said it was reasonably good.  I accept that.  It is as good as we can reasonably expect. Some of the criticisms that have been made are unreasonable, such as that we ought to have a first-class symphony orchestra.  Unfortunately Dublin does not posses one, and except on the very rare occasions that a first-class symphony orchestra visits the city there is none.  It is a very great loss to us that we have not one.  I hope that the Minister will be able to supplement that lack, so far as it is possible.  But while admitting that the programme maintained up to the present is reasonably good, I do not think it is so good that it could not be improved, and I want to put forward, in what I hope the Minister will understand is an entirely friendly spirit, one or two criticisms of the programmes that have been provided. The main criticism is that the type of the entertainment every night is practically the same.  It is what you might call the ballad concert.  Sometimes it is a very good balled concert, but every evening you look at the programme, with very few exceptions, you will see that a gentleman is to sing a couple of songs; Clery's Trio, which is doing most excellent work, will play orchestral selections; a lady will sing a few songs, and an instrumental soloist will perform, sometimes on the banjo and sometimes on the piano. Then a humourist will contribute, and I am afraid that some humourists have come to the conclusion, as was said, that as any old story will do for a political meeting, so any story, however old, will do for the broadcasting.  I do not want it to be thought that 2RN is going to be renowned for its crop of chestnuts.</P>
    <P>That is one half of the programme; the other half is a repetition, the same lady and gentleman and the same instrumental <Col N="281" /> trio.  That is the type night after night.  People are developing a tendency to look at the programme, say &ldquo;the same thing over and over again,&rdquo; and give up using their wireless.  One danger in that stereotyped form of programme is that the number of songs that may be used is very limited.  The average artist has only a comparatively small repertoire, and it ranges over most popular songs.  I think I have frightened &ldquo;Danny Boy&rdquo; off the wireless; it has not even appeared under the title of the &ldquo;Londonderry Air,&rdquo; but we had a song called &ldquo;The Ballynure Ballad&rdquo; last Friday and we had it last Saturday as well.  It is a mistake to have the one song two nights running, even if sung by two different artistes and even if sung well. But that mistake is inherent in having one particular type of artist and one particular type of song, the ballad type of artist and the balled type of song.</P>
    <P>Another point upon which I would criticise very gently is that broadcasting is in a sense an art in itself.  A very good singer may be comparatively inefficient at broadcasting, just as a very good speaker may be hopeless at broadcasting.  I do not think enough of recourse has been had to persons resident in Dublin, or the neighbourhood, who have had broadcasting experience. I know that one of my constituents was engaged by the B.B.C. to give a humorous talk some time ago, and I gather he was a success, because they re-engaged him, but I have not seen his name in the 2 RN programmes. Last week another constituent of mine, another humorous artist and an author of some note, talked for the B.B.C. in Belfast.  He lives and carries on his business a great deal nearer to Dublin than to Belfast&mdash;at Skerries&mdash;but I do not think he has been approached by 2 RN. to supply humour here.  A further suggestion I put forward to the Minister is that he should have special nights.  The B.B.C. has done a great deal by concentrating on one subject on a particular night&mdash;an operatic night, and so on.  Last week, or the week before, I saw that they had a fox-hunting night in Belfast.  There is no pack of hounds nearer Belfast than fifty miles.  The nearest is in the constituency <Col N="282" /> of the Minister for Defence. Surely if they could have that in Belfast we might have something of the kind in Dublin.  Then I think we should have local nights, nights devoted to certain parts of the country.  Why should we not have a Tirconnail night, starting with &ldquo;O'Donnell Abu&rdquo; and winding up with a few words from Deputy White.  I know that that does not fit in with the Minister's view.  The Minister wants to have the talk first and the music last, but I think in this case it might be better to have the music first and the talk last.  I know it would be a difficult thing to do, but I think a little specialisation of that kind would be very valuable.</P>
    <P>At present I think we are drawing artists from too small a field, and that, I think, is inevitable when you have to rely on a couple of men&mdash;the Musical Director and a few others.  I am not criticising them, but they cannot have as wide a knowledge of all the people who are likely to give satisfactory performances as a larger body would have. I asked the Minister yesterday about setting up a Consultative Committee to select programmes, and he said that it was intended to make provision for that in a Bill he was bringing in.  That Bill will probably not become law for a couple of months, but I see no reason why he should wait for it.  Such a consultative body would not be paid, and there would be no need for it to go on the Estimates at all.  If it were composed of people resident in Dublin, I do not think that there would even be a charge for travelling expenses.  I would suggest that the Minister should try at once to get such a voluntary body, a body such as the Minister for Fisheries has set up in connection with his Department, to consult in regard to these programmes.  In addition to these he mentioned yesterday, representatives of the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture and the Ministry of Education, I suggest, with them, representatives of the Universities, a representative of the Gaelic League, a representative of the Royal Dublin Society, as that body has great experience in connection with lectures and concerts, and also one or two individuals who are well-known for their interest in musical matters.  On a <Col N="283" /> previous occasion I suggested the names of Colonel Brase and Dr. Larchet, both of whom would give us a wider view of music, and possibly a greater knowledge about people who could be approached to broadcast.  A large number of people are unwilling to send in appli-applications for appointment, but are willing to help the station.  I know one friend of mine, a Fellow of Trinity College, one of the greatest authorities in the British Islands on Spain, and an accomplished musician, told me he would be glad to give a talk of a quarter of an hour on Spanish music, illustrating it on the violin.  I think that would be of a high educational value.  You will not get hold of those people by putting an advertisement in the paper.  You want a central body who would beat up recruits. I should be quite willing to help the Minister myself if my voice recovered, but at present it would be only a fiasco.  The Minister does not need to wait for a Bill giving him statutory authority for an advisory body of this kind.  He should not wait until the Bill is law, but should set up a committee at once.  It could not be done in a day, but I believe if you had this committee working by the end of next month it would do a great deal to provide better entertainment, stimulate interest in the station, and induce people to take out their licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping the Minister would give us a little more information than that which he has given.  Roughly estimated, the figures I extracted are that the running costs of the broadcasting station would be £25,000 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>About £30,000 a year.  Up to now the number of licences issued is 1,300 for this year, and assuming that all that had licences before renewed them, you will have 4,200 licences.  As has been made evident for quite a long time, revenue will be almost wholly from crystal sets, and the obvious question that arises is whether the £1 charged for the poor music is, to any degree, prohibitive, Would there be greater income from a smaller charge than there is from the <Col N="284" /> present £1 a year or alternatively if the £1 a year has to be maintained could not easy methods of payment be adopted?  I think, as a matter of practice, the boy or girl who finds himself or herself interested in wireless even from the experimental side is debarred from exercising their ingenuity. It costs 10/- for their set, wiring and so on.  In addition they have to pay £1 for a licence.  If they could pay that £1 in small instalments it would help them, or if it were a smaller sum it would mean an additional annual revenue from the crystal set user.</P>
      <P>That directs attention at once to the project in regard to Cork.  If there is nearly half the population in the Cork area that is in the Dublin area, capable of receiving on a crystal set, then we might look for three-fourths of the Dublin income in regard to Cork inasmuch as Cork is going to excel in the spending of money for useful purposes educational and entertaining.  I should like to know what would be the running cost of Cork Station, for presumably there the programme would be really from Dublin in the main, and the cost of the programme would not enter into the Cork Station.  If you are going to increase the income by 50 per cent.  I anticipate that the increased running cost would not be anything like 50 per cent.  Consequently there is a distinct advantage in hurrying on with the Cork proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not an authority on this business. I have spent a few evenings since the new year listening, and I must say I have been very pleased indeed. I said to a friend the other day that I wished the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would make his telephones as clearly heard as his wireless. That perhaps is an ideal unattainable, but certainly the reception is very good within a few miles of the station.  I, too, think with Deputy Cooper that there is too much sameness in the programme, and one wonders whether the Minister and his assistants are assuming that the hearers are only occasional hearers, say, one night a week or that they listen in two or three nights a week.  If the latter, they are listening to the same concert, and people do not attend similar concerts two or three <Col N="285" /> nights a week.  The suggestion Deputy Cooper made with regard to specialisation and giving greater variety is good. I hope it will be considered and, so far as practicable, be carried out.</P>
    <P>I notice that there was a half-hour of jazz at the end of the programme but that for a night or two it has been dropped.  I do not know the meaning of it, or why it was included at all, unless to enable people to dance in their own homes, but they hardly get time enough for that.  I find by referring to the programmes for Great Britain that for the benefit of those who like that sort of thing two hours are generally given.  Half an hour of that particular kind of rhythm would not give dancers an opportunity of starting.  I am glad to see it has been abolished or, at least, it has been dropped recently.  I am not satisfied with the Minister's emphatic statement that everybody has to be in bed at ten-thirty. After all, there is no compulsion on anybody to listen in, and I think ten-thirty is unnecessarily early if there is anything to be heard.  I imagine that a later hour would satisfy a larger number of people, especially those who are late in arriving home.  I am sure a number of Deputies would like to listen in for half an hour when they arrive home, but when the Dáil sits until 10.30 p.m. that of course is not possible.  I think the experiment, so far as it has gone, has been very successful from the station side.  I believe that the education in taste has, on the whole, been, and will be, good.  I believe that there are more listeners-in to good music and to good concerts than one would get at ordinary entertainments throughout the city.  I think that those who have been introduced to listening-in have had a greater variety of pleasant, delightful and educative music than they would ordinarily have if this method had not been in operation.  From that point of view alone I think it is worthy of commendation.  I hope that the idea of lectures will be extended, but not confined to the ten minutes outlined by the Minister.  I do not know how far a language lesson could be given in ten minutes.</P>

      <P>The proposals in the early stages were based on the assumption that about £10,000 would be required in the first year.  I find I am correct.  I am not blaming anybody for not having made a more accurate estimate, but I think the necessity for obtaining a very much larger number of licence fees justifies the Minister in considering how far the present fee is detrimental to the income.  I know that he is considering the question as to whether the amount of the licence fee prevents a larger number paying for licences.  It would be better to have a generous response in regard to that than to have a considerable number of prosecutions, and, if prosecutions cannot be entered into until the new Bill is enacted, that may be a considerable time.  I think we ought to encourage young people to interest themselves in wireless reception and broadcasting, and I think that could be done if there were some modification in regard to crystal sets.</P>

I understand, however, that there is going to be a good deal of money spent on broadcasting, and I would suggest to the Minister that some of that money be spent on extending the telephone in my town, where we can get on without broadcasting. That would be a much more sensible speculation than broadcasting.  Even though I may be a little out of order in mentioning this, I hope the Minister will take a note of it.  I hope he will consider my suggestion with all earnestness as we have long been advocating an extension of the telephone to Carndonagh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Though the last Deputy did not add very much to the interesting debate we have had on the subject of broadcasting, he touched on an aspect of the question, possibly in his innocence, that would appeal to a great number.  That aspect is this: Broadcasting is going to cost the taxpayers <Col N="287" /> in the State so far as one can judge, from particulars given, something in the region of £30,000 per annum.  That money will have to be provided by all taxpayers in the State in order to give privileges to a comparatively few of those known as &ldquo;listeners-in.&rdquo; That is an aspect of the question which I think the Minister would be wise to anticipate.  Naturally if taxpayers are taxed, like all the rest of the community, they will want to get some value for it.  If they are going to pay this considerable sum for the benefit of the few, I think it is wise to anticipate a considerable volume of protest.  I agree with the Minister that in setting up a station it ought to be comparable from every point of view with the other station.  In other words, if we are going to set up broadcasting let us not spoil it from any point of view for want of funds.  That appears to me to be the difficulty&mdash;to do that and still meet the protest that will accrue.  The only way that I see of surmounting that difficulty is by trying to encourage a very much larger number of licensees than we have at present.  I do not know what campaign the Minister has in view in that particular direction, but it appears to me that very considerable effort will have to be made by his Department in order to try and bridge the large gulf that exists between a maximum income of £4,200 and a liability of £30,000 per annum.  In that connection it appears to me that a very important question of policy will arise.  The Minister has informed us that he has under consideration the setting up of four broadcasting stations in the Free State.  The point that immediately occurs to one, who is to a large extent a novice in these matters, is whether four stations or one station would be advisable.  If every area is going to have a multiplicity of stations, as outlined by the Minister, the problem of wave-lengths is going to become very serious.  Not alone will it be a problem for running stations but it will be very serious for licensees getting attached to various stations&mdash;a problem which is not a very small one at the moment.  Therefore, before we incur any expense in setting up stations or deciding as to what is to be the <Col N="288" /> capability of the stations, I think that particular aspect of the question ought to have very serious consideration&mdash; that is, whether the Free State is to have a number of small stations or one very efficient station which will serve the whole area.</P>
      <P>In the solution of that problem I think the Minister would be well advised to consult with all the different authorities on this question, and then try and give us the benefit of their united advice, in order to guide us as to the future of broadcasting in the Free State.  I agree with Deputies who have already spoken that the Minister has given us a very full report on this resolution.  I would like to ask the Minister if, instead of running the station as it is now run, it was run in connection with stations of the British Broadcasting Company, such as Belfast, would any advantage accrue?  Or would it be better to run the station as a separate entity?  In coming to a conclusion on that point, could the Minister give any information as to the cost, supposing the station was run the same as the Belfast station, in connection with the British Broadcasting Company?  There could be an arrangement whereby the programme would be one specified by the Committee or by the direction staff.  In order to judge the outlay of £30,000 yearly it would be well if the Minister could give information which enables Deputies to see the wisdom or otherwise of expending such a large sum immediately.  As the Minister pointed out, broadcasting might be up-to-date to-day&mdash;much of which is expensive&mdash;may have to be scrapped within the next two or three years owing to developments.  That has occurred in connection with other industries.  In running this station ourselves we have to bear the brunt of all the expenditure.  Before undertaking that liability it would be well if we had some idea of what the cost of it would be if we were to co-operate the same as other stations with the British Broadcasting Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that strikes me about the statement made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is similar to that to which Deputy <Col N="289" /> Good hes referred.  According to the figures given by the Minister, this enterprise will cost the taxpayer approximately £26,000 yearly.  I know that the Oireachtas has committed us to the acceptance of a broadcasting station under the control of the Post Office authorities.  At the same time I believe there will be a good deal of dissatisfaction amongst the people of the country generally if, within a reasonable time, it is found that broadcasting is not at least paying its way.  Matters of this kind, which are run by a Government Department, are hampered and have difficulties which an enterprise of a similar kind in the hands of private individuals would not have.  A Government Department cannot advertise the service it is prepared to give in the same way as private concerns can.  I urge the Minister to make every effort to make broadcasting a paying proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who knows very little about the technical aspect of broadcasting, but who takes a considerable interest in its possible development, particularly when applied to rural communities, it seems to me that the people who are getting the advantage of broadcasting are those who want it least, the people of the cities and towns.  The people in the cities and towns have already a multiplicity of entertainments provided for them.  On the other hand, people in the rural areas are those who really want broadcasting.  If I understand what is happening now, people with crystal sets can get very little advantage from the present arrangement.  I think when the Minister comes to decide on what particular power station he is going to use, that is a question that should be seriously considered, and whether it would not be worth while to take a big jump by providing a high-power broadcasting station which would give the people in the country districts an opportunity of availing of broadcasting by means of crystal sets. I believe there are great possibilities in this enterprise if they can be realised. Every effort should be made to bring its advantages to the notice of people in rural districts.  One of the greatest problems that has to be faced in those districts, is the provision of entertainment during the long winter <Col N="290" /> nights.  In recent years the people have broken out of bounds and insisted on getting entertainment.  As a result, dancing goes on night after night.  If you take up a local newspaper now you find announcement of dances prominently advertised.  I think that is the result of modern development, but I think the desire for entertainment and pleasure might be availed of to lead the people along more cultured lines, and that the use of wireless might contribute in a way that would be desirable to the education of people living in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest to the Minister that he should attempt to provide programmes that would be of a definitely heavy or cultural description, but he might, as he is doing now, intersperse entertaining items of jazz and songs with lectures which would be of advantage and be instructive to those people. If the Minister accepts the suggestion made by Deputy Cooper, and sets up an Advisory Committee, he should see that it is not predominately representative of the towns and cities, but that people who know the kind of instruction that would be suitable for the country districts, should also be on it. I emphasise the necessity of bringing the advantages of broadcasting before rural communities.  To a large extent the making of this proposition a paying one will depend on how it is taken up by people in the country.  If I remember aright, the licence fee to be charged for halls is £5.</P>

      <P>I think the charge might be an elastic one.  That amount is too much.  Any development which will take place in this matter in rural districts will take place largely in the villages and small towns.  I think that village halls should be encouraged to get wireless sets so as to bring the people together where they could spend a few pleasant hours &ldquo;listening-in.&rdquo;  I think a licence fee of £5 is too high at the commencement for village halls.  I cannot suggest a way out, or how the Minister could differentiate between a town where £5 might be charged and a village where a good deal less should be charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to get some more information <Col N="291" /> from the Minister about the circulation of market reports.  It appears to me that the hours suggested are not suitable.  I may be wrong. Probably it is the experience in other countries that the hours are suitable.</P>

      <P>From the point of view of the farmer, I am inclined to think that very few farmers will be able to listen in at 1.30 to receive market reports and I would suggest that these reports might be circulated during the night programme.  I would like to know, in connection with these reports, whether the Minister refers to agricultural market reports&mdash;reports of fairs and markets and the prices of agricultural produce across the Channel. Incidentally, I think it might be a mistake to confine stock market reports to the Dublin stock markets. There is no reason why transactions in the outside markets, which really control the Dublin markets, should not be reported when the other reports are being broadcasted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder what proportion of those who are using reception sets within the crystal radius of the city are included in the 1,300 who, the Minister told us, had paid their licence fees.  I believe the number would be only a very small fraction.  I do not at all share the fears expressed by some of the Deputies, that we have embarked upon a scheme which is going to cost us a large sum of money. I do not go so far as to say that immediately, or even in two or three years, the scheme is going to pay for itself.  Undoubtedly it will cost money at the start, but I am rather optimistic as to the extent to which it will ultimately be a real feature in the life of the country.  I agree with Deputy Heffernan to a considerable extent in thinking that it is in the country districts the value of this broadcasting, as a feature affecting the social life of the country, is going to be of importance. I think it would be worth his while to make inquiries for himself as to the comparatively small expense at which a resident within 25 or 50 miles radius <Col N="292" /> of Dublin could equip himself with a single valve or two valve set.  With comparatively small expense, he could equip himself with a set which would enable him to get the benefit of the programmes broadcasted from here. He would be surprised at the small expenditure which would effect this.</P>
      <P>I do not at all accept Deputy Heffernan's figures regarding this scheme being an immediate burden on the country of something like £36,000 a year.  It is remarkable how close the estimates furnished to the Committee on Broadcasting have come to the actual expenditure, so far.  My recollection is that the initial cost was estimated at £8,000 and the cost of running at £10,000 per year.  The figure of £8,000 has not been quite reached.  The figure of £10,000 a year is apparently going to be exceeded.  But £6,000 added to £8,000 does not represent the annual cost; neither does it give you the annual cost if you multiply by four. Perhaps the Minister would tell us, in replying, what, at the present rate, the annual cost would be.  It would seem to be something like £12,000 a year.  As against that £12,000 a year considerable sum will be realised in licence fees as soon as citizens realise their duty to pay for the entertainment they are getting, and as soon as the Bill the Minister has foreshadowed is put through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear the Minister correctly.  I thought the £30,000 he mentioned covered the cost of running the Cork and Dublin Stations. <Col N="293" /> What I said must, therefore, be partially altered.  I was taking the figure at £12,000.  I will take the figure at £25,000 for Dublin.  I think a considerable part of that will be met by licence fees coming from the holders of crystal sets within the immediate neighbourhood of Dublin.  Of course, the extent to which that expense will be met will depend upon the extent to which the Station makes itself a success.  Further, it will depend upon the extent to which people living within a radius of 50 miles of Dublin get to know the value offered by the Station&mdash;apart from amusement, the general educational value and, apart from that, the profit they can make from the information that will be forthcoming from the Station.  Even though the cost is going to be something like £20,000 or £30,000 a year, I do not think we will have to wait very long in order that a considerable part of that should be forthcoming from licence fees from persons in the area served even by a single station. At the same time, we should realise that even if the station does cost something, we are getting a great deal for it and we are getting something that will be of real value to the country.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to enter into any criticism of this station at present.  I think it is too early.  I think Deputy Cooper's remarks and Deputy Johnson's remarks were very valuable and that they have offered useful suggestions to the Minister.  I made it a point to inform myself as to remarks which are made about the station in other places&mdash;across the water and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find that the general verdict seems to be that the station has done exceedingly well for a commencement and a very considerable success is looked for from the Dublin station.  I anticipate that will be the result.  Although the Minister said that you cannot expect to get anything like perfection or to satisfy everybody, at the start particularly, I do think that we may congratulate him on the way the station has behaved for the first month of its life.  I think Dublin people in the main are pleased with it.  I know that in other places they think it compares <Col N="294" /> very favourably indeed with many other stations at the corresponding period of their careers.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would do well to adopt Deputy Cooper's suggestion and get a committee to assist him with as much speed as possible.  I think he will find there will be many ready to give a helping hand in that way and that many societies will be able to give him valuable help.  I agree very largely indeed with most of what the Minister said when he outlined the way in which he hopes to develop the station.  I think he is to be congratulated on the very clear way in which he made his statement in reference to this estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate very much the commendations of Deputy Thrift with regard to the working of the station.  It may be opportune to mention here that commendations of a similar character have already reached us from those who have years of successful experience of working stations in other countries.  I wish to refer particularly to a communication which I received from the managing director of the British Broadcasting Station in which he said he was agreeably surprised at the very successful strides made by the Dublin station, and mentioned that they far exceeded the anticipations of himself and his colleagues.</P>
      <P>I am just as anxious as Deputy Cooper to extend operations.  I am equally aware of the necessity of stretching out in a variety of directions. As I said at the start, our difficulty is shortage of staff.  I am glad the Minister for Finance is here now when I mention that.  We try to run the station with skeleton material, and we cannot do it.  We are merely working from day to day.  To talk of great variety, to think out necessary schemes, to get the imagination in full play, is out of the question.  Until such time as we have established a staff that will enable us to strike out in new directions, we will not be able to do anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some imagination. <Col N="295" /> I do not say I am going to apply it to broadcasting.  Perhaps after a time I may switch it on; I hope to do so later.  Without doubt, relaying a programme from the B.B.C. stations will assist us.  It will give us time to look around and develop those ideas which we hold in common with Deputy Cooper.</P>
      <P>Deputy Good thinks we ought to review our policy and see if it would not be advisable, in the interests of economy, to undo what we have done. I have no regrets for what we have done.  I believe that when a Bill, which I hope the Dáil will pass within the next six weeks, is in operation, quite a considerable number of people who have not yet awakened to the necessity of paying for the goods which are nightly delivered, will change their viewpoint, and I believe the gentle pressure which we may be able to bring to bear on them through that Bill will induce them to do so.  The immediate financial results may not be on all fours with what we have been discussing.  I will not be surprised if we lose for the first year or two.  I do not think any of us anticipated that in a sparsely populated country, when we strike out on a large broadcasting programme, we would be able to make it pay at once.  I do not think anybody ever held that view.  I am satisfied that within two years the enterprise will pay its way.  I have no sympathy with the proposal put forward by Deputy Good.  It is quite as important for a nation to have within its border its own broadcasting service as its own Press.  It may in time be more important; nobody knows.  It is vital, in my opinion, for the State to keep complete control of anything pertaining to this important medium of communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel with Deputy Heffernan that it will be a bright day for the rural population when we are able to reach them with a cheap service.  I am not sanguine that we will be able to cover the whole country.  The programme which I outlined to-night makes a decent effort in that direction.  Even in England, with all their stations&mdash; they have got twenty&mdash;I should say that at least one-fourth of the people <Col N="296" /> are outside the radius of the crystal sets.  Scotland has only three stations, and it must be even harder hit in this respect.  I do not see either that we have any prospect of ultimately covering the whole ground, desirable as it might be.  I should mention here, for the information of any Deputies who may not have made a study of this subject, that the crystal set has a range of 25 miles with a station of the strength of 2R.N.  A one-valve set extends to 50 miles.  A one-valve set is comparatively cheap, possibly £10.  A two-valve set may be purchased for anything in the neighbourhood of £20, and it extends to 75 or 80 miles.  Now you will find if you begin to examine these figures, that most people will be able to get the Irish station with a one-valve set, and that is not expensive.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to alter my opinion in regard to the time of issuing market reports.  If the farmer wishes to avail of the market on the following morning, if he is sending his corn, cattle or pigs to the market, it is very little use telling him at 8 o'clock at night that the price was so-and-so. There is no chance of his preparing for the market at that hour.  He requires to be told and to get reasonable notice during the day.  The same applies, also, with regard to the Stock Exchange reports.  Most people interested in these can get very full details from the evening papers.  Those who desire to buy or sell stocks in the latter part of the market do so about 3 o'clock.  In European countries, and amongst European people who have given consideration to this subject, the hour has been fixed at 1.30, and I think that is good enough for us.  We would be well advised to follow the example of people who have thought the matter out and have discussed it with their nationals and with their listeners-in.</P>
    <P>I see no objection to the early setting up of an advisory committee, none whatever, but I am not quite so enthusiastic about the idea as Deputy Cooper.  It might happen that a committee of this kind would very seriously impede the work of the station.  It might consist of a dozen, and the station may have to face a dozen extra obstacles every day.</P>

It may happen that in extending this experiment to our system here, we may be taking a step in the wrong direction, and one that may have to be discontinued. It has not been tried anywhere else so far as I am aware.  I am, however, <Col N="298" /> prepared to try it, because there are so many apparently well informed backers for the idea and I am not prepared to insist on my own ideas prevailing. But I do say again that I do not look upon it enthusiastically, nor do those in charge of the station display any enthusiasm for it; they fear the idea.</P>
      <P>Vote put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether ex-Constable Edward T. Wilson, R.I.C., in reply to a letter from his Department, dated the 20th July, 1925, gave the names of two gentlemen from County Westmeath who would be able to corroborate his statement as to his national sympathies in 1917, and whether those gentlemen were written to for corroboration; whether he is aware that Mr. Wilson holds he is properly entitled to a pension under Section 5 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923.</P>

      <P>Mr. Wilson failed to satisfy the Committee of Inquiry into Resignations and Dismissals from the Royal Irish Constabulary, which investigated his case very fully, that his <Col N="222" /> resignation from that Force in May, 1917, was caused by his national sympathies. After careful review of all the facts and circumstances of the case as presented to the Committee of Inquiry and of the evidence since submitted by Mr. Wilson, I can see no reason for disagreeing with the unfavourable view formed by the Committee, and I am accordingly unable to authorise the grant to him of a pension under Section 5 of the Superannuations and Pensions Act, 1923.</P>

Cork, for compensation for the destruction of her house and household effects at Monedresnane, Kilworth, Co.

      <P>The claim referred to by the Deputy would appear to be that lodged by Mrs. Margaret Noonan in respect of the destruction of household goods at Monadrisnane, Kilworth, Co. Cork, on the 31st May, 1919.  This claim was duly considered by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission in the first quarter of 1924, and was ruled by them to be outside the scope of their terms of reference.  Due notice of their ruling is presumed to have been issued by the Commission to the claimant or her solicitor.</P>

      <P>Mr. Ryan's application has been referred to the Board of Assessors, who exclusively will determine his service for pension purposes.  The <Col N="223" /> Board has not yet reported to me on his case.  No decision has, therefore been taken as to grant of a pension to him.  I understand, however, that the Board have requested him to furnish any fresh evidence he may be able to offer in support of his application.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether the claim of Mrs. E. Reidy, Annabella Cottage, Mallow, to compensation for the death of her son through sickness, which she alleges he contracted while serving as a member of the National Army, has been investigated, and with what result; whether Mrs. Reidy's statements regarding the refusal of the Army authorities to assist her in locating her son, and their placing him in Cork Asylum against her wishes, have been investigated, and with what result; whether the Army authorities have considered her claim to pay and other allowances which she alleges are due her for the two months prior to the date of his discharge by the military authorities from the Mental Home, Cork, and whether this claim will be paid at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Mrs. Reidy's claim has been investigated.  Her son Michael did not contract his illness whilst serving with the Forces.  It was ascertained that he had suffered from the disability before his enlistment.  He showed signs of a recurrence of the malady within four months of joining the Forces, and his services actually terminated five months after the date of attestation.  His case did not come within the terms of the Army Pensions Act, 1923, and I regret that I am therefore unable to entertain the claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mrs. Reidy's statements regarding the refusal of the Army Authorities to assist her in locating her son have been investigated, but I regret that it is not now possible to verify her statements. Her inquiries may have been badly directed, resulting in any inconvenience to which she may have been put.  Her son's removal to the Cork Mental Hospital was carried out by arrangements <Col N="224" /> previously made between herself and the Medical Authorities of the Curragh Military Hospital.</P>
    <P>Michael Reidy's discharge from the Cork Mental Hospital was not effected at the instance of the Army Authorities, as his services with the Forces had terminated some time previously.  All money due in respect of his service has already been paid, and I regret again that I am also unable to entertain the claim in this connection.</P>

      <P>As regards his claim in respect of the occupation of and damage to his premises in 1922 and 1923 the payments mentioned include rent up to the 1st October, 1922.  In respect of the remainder of this claim, I am informed that the Commissioners of Public Works forwarded to Mr. Coleman's solicitors on the 5th July, 1924, a cheque for £110 as a final settlement.</P>
      <P>No further payments appear to be due to Mr. Coleman.</P>
