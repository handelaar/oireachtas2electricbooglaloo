      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is in a position to state when the report of the Committee of Inquiry set up to deal with the reorganisation of the Ordnance Survey Department will be completed, and when it is expected that the reorganisation of that Department will be carried out.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to state when the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Ordnance Survey will be completed.  The Committee are at present investigating allegations as to numerous errors in levelling.  This investigation is necessarily laborious. When it has been completed the Committee will be in a position to furnish their report.  As regards the reorganisation of the Department, necessary preliminary inquiries, which can be made without waiting for the report, are in progress, but until the report has been received and considered it will not be possible to say by what date the reorganisation will take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS BOLGER</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the <Col N="468" /> Minister for Finance whether he is aware that in support of his claim for a pension under Section 5 of the Superannuation Act, 1923, Mr. John Purcell, Coolcullen, Co. Kilkenny, an ex-member of the R.I.C., submitted the names of several persons as references in regard to his sympathies with the national cause, and, further, whether in this connection he received a testimonial from the clergy and people of the claimant's district and the Castlecomer district; whether this case was, as is stated, favourably considered by the Committee of Inquiry into resignations from the R.I.C.; whether the Minister had before him on the occasion of his recent decision a copy of Mr. Purcell's letter, dated 26th October, 1925, to the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána, in which was given a full statement of the claim and reasons for resignation, and the names of people who could corroborate the statement, and whether the Minister proposes to review his decision in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  Mr. Purcell's claim was favourably reported upon by the Committee of Inquiry into Resignations and Dismissals from the R.I.C., but on full consideration of all the facts of the case, including information which was not before the Committee, I am not satisfied that this man's resignation from the Constabulary was caused by his national sympathies.  I have accordingly felt unable to authorise the grant to him of a pension, and I am not aware of any reason which would warrant a departure from that decision. I have not received a copy of the applicant's letter, dated 26th October, 1925, addressed to the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána.</P>

    <P>I might say that the salary and bonus figures given are only approximate. They are calculated on the mean of the scale of each appropriate grade.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cost of Living Report for Mid-January, 1926, was published in the monthly Irish Trade Journal for February, 1926, issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  After the publication of the Cost of Living Report for Mid-October, 1925, it was decided to cease publishing these quarterly reports as separate publications. In future they will appear regularly as special articles in the issues of the Irish Trade Journal for the months of February, May, August and November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, perhaps, I should ask you, sir, and not the Minister, could it be arranged to have these Journals filed?  Hitherto we have been able to go to the file in the Library and compare the cost-of-living statistics.  If there is to be a Journal which will be taken off the file, we shall not be in the same position to make comparisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to that I have nothing to say, but I understand that copies of the Irish Trade Journal are supplied to Deputies and Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>No; a sample copy was supplied, but only a sample.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make inquiries as to that, because it was the intention to have these supplied both to Deputies and Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it to be taken that this Irish Trade Journal is an authoritative official Journal and that everything in it has the official sanction of the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to go so far as that.  It is an authoritative Journal issued by the Department from information collected from the other Departments, but the articles at times will reveal that they are not <Col N="471" /> to be taken as definitely and entirely authoritative.  There always has to be a certain amount of discretion given. That will generally be revealed by the type of the article itself or something arising out of the article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The important point is that if the cost-of-living index figure is to be taken as an index affecting wages, it ought to be in some way quite definitely circulated as an official document. If the Irish Trade Journal is not to be considered as an official authoritative document, there is no assurance that this is a strict official return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite see the Deputy's point.  It may be necessary to have some note prefixed to the issues which contain the cost-of-living figures. Actually what is happening is that the inquiry goes on as before, and the result, instead of being published as a separate sheet, is included in the Trade Journal.  We might have that more specifically marked in succeeding issues of the Journal with regard to that item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we take it that this official Trade Journal should be accepted by everybody as an official document which could be always referred to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might confine myself to the cost of living: as far as the cost-of-living figure is concerned it is authoritative in the fullest sense of that word.  It is the same as used to be provided only that now it is included in the Journal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister the advisability of keeping to the old forms, because they are convenient for filing.  The Trade Journal is very inconvenient for filing as it means filing a great deal more than is requisite to file for the cost-of-living figure, inasmuch as that periodical matter is filed in many offices as something to refer to, and the cost, surely, would not be very great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be very big, but it was thought desirable to include it in this Trade Journal. <Col N="472" /> Certainly it had been thought that this Journal was being supplied to Deputies and Senators and, as the difference in price is only a penny, that it would be bought by anybody who had previously bought the cost-of-living sheet.  However, I will consider the Deputy's suggestion to return to the old separate publication.</P>

I am not sure whether the inquiry has yet been completed.  I could pursue that inquiry further, but it is most difficult to get this suspicion closely examined home in every case.</P>

Is the Minister also aware that the lands are now in possession of a man who has already disposed of three farms in the district?

I dare say this case was discussed for probably two or three hours before the Land Commission, during which the pros and cons were gone into.  That is the only possible way an examination like that could be made.  The decision is made by the Commissioner who is the final judge and from whom there is no appeal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>An appeal would not go to the Judicial Commissioner unless an appeal from a decision of the Land Commission.  The Land Commission are acting on behalf of the tenants and landless men of the particular district for whom they intend to acquire land, and they put up every consideration from their point of view.  They can trust the owner to put up every consideration from his point of view.  Consequently the Judicial Commissioner has the benefit of both sides of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MURPHY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the Deputy.  An appeal never comes before the Judicial Commissioner on the part of the owner unless the Commissioners make a ruling with which the owner disagrees.  What happens is that the Commissioners make a ruling to acquire land against which the owner may appeal.  If the Commissioners make a ruling not to acquire the land the owner is not going to appeal because he is quite satisfied.  In that state of affairs I do not see how the Deputy could suggest that the Commissioners were not particularly anxious to acquire the land.  They could have disposed of the matter there and then in the beginning, and there would be no further trouble.  They could have refused to acquire it and there would be no question of appeal.</P>

The time taken in collection <Col N="485" /> will naturally be longer, as the Civic Guard will have to scrutinise forms and in many cases help heads of households to fill in or correct them.

Everything in connection with the Census is proceeding exactly, having regard to the work to be done and the staff available for it, as anticipated.

      <P>Yes.  Amendments 22, 23 and 24, in fact, hang together, but amendments 22 and 24 deal with practically an identical matter.  The suggestion is to restrict the post of Officer for Accounts and Inquiries, and the post of Registrar to the Chief Justice to either practising solicitors or existing officers.  The point of view underlying the amendment differs from that of Deputy Johnson and Deputy Cooper, who seem to wish to open more posts to the rank and file of the staff.  Deputy Hewat seeks by these amendments to close certain posts to the ordinary competition of the staff. My road is the middle one, and it is rather less generous to the staff than Deputy Johnson and Deputy Cooper would wish, but rather more generous than the point of view of Deputy Hewat.  At present you have two chief clerks who would be Examiners of the future, who are promoted officers, and admittedly there is no suggestion of any lack of competence on the part of these two officers.  I am not prepared to assume that there may not be more such men in the future.  Therefore, I am not prepared to debar, in the ordinary course of promotions, these officers from these positions&mdash;that is, the position of Officer for Accounts and Inquiries, or the other position with which Deputy Hewat's amendment deals, that of Registrar to the Chief Justice.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that <Col N="489" /> there is some confusion.  As a matter of fact, Deputy Hewat spoke to me about this amendment and as to what was in his mind.  He did not desire to exclude the possibility of promoting an existing officer to the position of Examiner. What he had in mind was that if an outsider were being appointed, a solicitor had better qualifications for a position of that kind than a member of the Bar who had no experience of the class of work an Examiner has to do.</P>

      <P>I take it that Deputy Duggan, while moving the amendment that stands in the name of Deputy Hewat, does not approve of the proposition that a solicitor is not as capable of filling the post as a barrister. On this question I think it is not inopportune to remind the House that we are discussing an issue between two rival trade unions.  It is a demarcation question.  We are asked to give statutory authority to one union to the exclusion of the other.  I am not going to say whether it is a desirable thing or not, but I am asking the House to bear in mind that they are ratifying a principle which might be brought to their attention on some future occasion.</P>

      <P>(a)  is a barrister of not less than ten years' standing who is then actually practising, or</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to Deputy Johnson that there is absolutely no inconsistency in my moving this amendment and supporting the other because the position is a totally different one and a barrister is best qualified for this position.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really a matter regarding which application of the Civil Service Commission machinery would be very cumbrous if applied to the re-staffing or the staffing of the new court system, inasmuch as we will have on hands all the officers who decide to come into the new system, on this Bill coming into operation.  If the processes of the Civil Service Commission were to be adopted that machinery would be overstrained.  It is evidently a matter for administrative discretion to fit the existing officers&mdash;I say existing officers, meaning the officers who are serving under the present court system&mdash;into their proper places in the new system, and it is felt that a period of from a year to eighteen months will be required before that process could be said to be complete.  Therefore, the effect of Section 27 is to avert the necessity for troubling the Civil Service Commission in regard to every single appointment that may arise under the new system and to leave my hands and the hands of my Department free to deal administratively with the staffing problem that will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the statement of the Minister does not make it <Col N="497" /> easier to justify the section.  While administrative convenience may well be served by leaving this whole question of promotion and staffing in his hands for eighteen months, I doubt whether it is good policy for the sake of administrative convenience to depart from what has been emphasised in this House as a very necessary provision&mdash;that appointments in the Civil Service, appointments under the Government, should be referred to the Civil Service Commission.  I think that it is unwise for the sake of administrative convenience to make this very great departure from what has been emphasised here as necessary and desirable.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider very carefully the question whether this is necessary, having regard to all the circumstances and the public view that the Civil Service Commission is, and should be, a check upon political prejudices.  Unless the administrative inconvenience is overwhelmingly great there should not be a departure from the rules that the Civil Service regulations should be applied to appointments in the courts as long as appointments are being retained by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point of view I suppose the Deputy felt bound to put just as I feel bound to reject it. It is rather straining the word to refer to these appointments as appointments in the ordinary sense.  It is a question of the statutory termination of one system and the statutory commencement of another system, no doubt, but there will be there carrying on the work of the courts some hundreds of officers and the staffing problem consist merely in fitting these various officers into their respective positions in the new system and defining their duties.  To suggest that this is in any way usurping the functions of the Civil Service Commission may read very well in the newspapers, but it is very wide of the mark, and I think the Deputy appreciates it is very wide of the mark. There is no question of making new appointments; there is the question only of dealing with the existing personnel of the courts, allocating them <Col N="498" /> to their positions under the new system and defining their duties.</P>

      <P>I beg to move, on behalf of Deputy Hewat:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 56, page 10, to delete the words &ldquo;hold office at the pleasure of the Executive Council&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;only removable by the Executive Council on the recommendation of the Judge of the Circuit Court to which he is attached.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This section deals with the appointment of county registrars to the Circuit Courts, and the proposal in the Bill is that these county registrars shall be appointed by the Executive Council. The Bill goes further and sets out that the registrars shall also be removable at the will and pleasure of the Executive Council.  It has been thought desirable that, as these officials have to discharge duties of a semi-judicial character, not alone should they be placed in a position of some independence but that the judge of the court to which they are attached should have something to say before the services of the official are dispensed with.  The amendment lays down that the services of an official can only be dispensed with by the Executive Council on the recommendation of the judge of the court. That maintains a principle that many of us thought was very desirable, and, in fact, very necessary in a Bill of this kind.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the principle underlying the amendment or to what the amendment seeks to achieve.  The idea is to give to this semi-judicial officer a semi-judicial tenure, a tenure that would be nominally, and I think only nominally, stronger than the ordinary Civil Service tenure.  As I say, I have entire sympathy with the principle underlying the amendment and the object which the amendment aims at.  But let us consider the thing in practice.  I think Deputy Hewat put down the amendment with an eye rather to the county court system of the past, and the mental picture he had of that, than to the circuit court system <Col N="502" /> as it at present obtains, or rather will obtain in its fullness under the operation of this Bill.  In the area of jurisdiction of a given circuit court judge, there may be as many as five or six county registrars.  The judge will be absent from a given county, perhaps, as long as three or four months.  In that state of affairs is it reasonable to ask the concurrence of the circuit judge in the removal of a particular county registrar?  He may say in respect of the matters that are advanced as sufficient cause for such removal that he knows nothing of them.  How could he?  Let us suppose that it is proposed to remove County Registrar A.B. for not having attended to his office for two months, and that matter is submitted to the circuit judge.  He might reasonably reply: &ldquo;I note that you charge this officer that he did not attend to his office for two months together or perhaps for three months altogether.  But at that time I was working hard on compensation cases in another county.  I know nothing whatever of it, and if your Act makes my assent necessary to the removal of this officer, I will not give that assent in the absence of positive personal knowledge of the matters with which the officer is charged.&rdquo;  That would be a quite fair and reasonable attitude for the judge to take up, but its result administratively would be that as long as a particular officer was able to avoid coming under the unfavourable notice of a circuit judge who might be in his county once in three or four months, he was rooted in his position.  Considerations like that make me hesitate to agree to a principle that I would otherwise have complete agreement with&mdash;that the concurrence of the circuit judge should be made a necessity and condition precedent to the removal of the county registrar.  The judge will be moving around.  He will be absent for long periods from a given county. The matters complained of may be matters lying entirely outside his knowledge and experience and he might insist that without positive personal knowledge he would not give his concurrence in the removal.  It is because I think the thing would be unworkable in practice that I am not <Col N="503" /> disposed to accept the amendment, while I sympathise with the object the Deputy aims at.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Minister does not see his way to accept this amendment, because it does appear to one as an exceedingly reasonable amendment.  I happen to know something of the genesis of this amendment. It was put forward at a large conference which was held in Dublin to consider the provisions of this particular Bill, and it was felt by practically all those attending that conference that the powers of the Executive Council in connection with this proposed Bill were rather on the strong side, to put it mildly, and that it was desirable that certain limitations should attach to those powers so that they should not be exercised unfairly.  As I pointed out when moving this amendment, the idea was that the appointment of these particular officers was left in the hands of the Executive Council as proposed in the original Bill.  The removal of these officers in the original Bill was entirely in the hands of the Executive Council.  I think every Deputy in the House will agree that that is a section that might be used unfairly, and this amendment seeks to limit the power of the Executive Council under that section only in so far as they must get a recommendation from the judge attached to that particular court before they can remove his assistant.  That is desirable.  I think one does not like to stress the question.  Behind it are a great many principles that we would all approve of.  I think it is a highly desirable limitation to put on this particular proposal.  With all respect to the Minister, he gives as his reason against this amendment that it is unfair to cast that duty or that obligation on the judge of the court to which this officer is attached.  What is the reason that the Minister states why it is unfair to put the obligation on the judge of the court?  It is that he is the Circuit Court judge, that he may be called upon to discharge duties away from his own particular court and thereby be absent for long periods&mdash;</P>

      <P>I pointed out that in the area of the jurisdiction of a given Circuit Court judge there might be four or five counties.  The judge cannot be in all these counties at the same time.  He must take them in rotation. That means that he will have to be absent from any one of them for three or four months at a stretch. Within that time the county registrar in that county might be guilty of grave misconduct that would warrant his removal, but the judge would not have personal knowledge of that, and might have difficulty in giving his concurrence because of the absence of personal knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take even that case that the Minister has put forward. The Circuit Judge has, say, to attend&mdash; and it is an extreme case&mdash;four or five courts, and for that reason he would not be able to say whether the senior officer in these courts had a reasonable cause for being absent for a period of two months, which was the case the Minister took.  I am only speaking as a layman, but any of us who knows anything of judges who have to discharge somewhat similar duties know that in very few cases is there anything, even of the most minor importance, taking place in any of the four or five courts where they have to exercise jurisdiction that they are not aware of.  Such a case is, with all respect to the Minister, scarcely one that any of us could look upon as a reasonable one on which to ground opposition to an amendment of this character.  I am quite satisfied that if a case or two of the character mentioned did occur they would be looked upon, certainly by the judiciary, as exceedingly exceptional cases, and not at all as incidents that are likely to occur frequently.  It was expressed, and strongly expressed, at that conference that limitations should be attached to the powers of the Executive Council in connection with these officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Not that I want in any way to take from some of the advantages that would accrue from having the Minister present, but if we wanted to get an impartial view of the Bill I think we would scarcely go to the Minister; much as we all admire his views and his abilities, we would scarcely look upon him as an impartial authority on a Bill for which he is responsible. It is desirable that these officials, who have to discharge duties of a semi-judicial character, should be protected if, in the discharge of their duties, they are brought into conflict with the Executive Council.  I think it is up to this House, in the interests of the laws of our country and the good conduct of officials in the duties they are called upon to discharge, to protect these officials. Therefore, I say that it is desirable that limitations should be placed on these powers, and as far as I am concerned, knowing the views of that conference and knowing the force, and, I think, the justice, with which these views were put forward, as expressed in the amendment, I certainly shall have no alternative but to press it to a division if the amendment is not accepted by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the case made by Deputy Good is a sound one, and I cannot understand how the Minister, while perceiving the principle and desiring to apply it, raises the objection that the judge who is referred to here may not have personal knowledge of the incidents which the Minister would deem to be sufficient to warrant the dismissal of the registrar. The Minister will not have personal knowledge either.  The Minister's staff, the people who will report to the Minister, will report matters, presumably, within their knowledge, and he will judge upon those reports.  The <Col N="506" /> judge also would do the same.  I can see that the Registrar of the High Court, who is not to be removed without the concurrence of the Chief Justice and the President of the High Courts, might commit acts which would warrant calling for his dismissal, such acts not being within the knowledge of the Chief Justice or the President of the High Court.  These matters would have to be brought to the notice of the Chief Justice or the President of the High Court, and I do not see any difference in the practical working out of the proposition, which the Minister approves of in principle, with respect to the registrar of the Circuit Court as compared with the registrar of the High Court.  The judge would, presumably, be consulted and have presented to him the evidence that had been presented to the Minister, and if the concurrence of that judge were sought he would be forming his judgment on the same evidence as that on which the Minister himself was forming his judgment.  I cannot understand, therefore, that while the principle is accepted, there can be any objection to the practice, inasmuch as that practice has already been conceded with respect to the High Courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there is a very considerable difference between the position in the higher courts and the position in the circuit courts.  In the higher courts the judges have almost daily contact with the officials during the round of the law year.  In the circuit court the position, as I have already emphasised to Deputy Good, is very different.  Some circuit judges will have as many as six county registrars in their area of jurisdiction. That means that they will have about six weeks contact in the year with an individual county registrar, and we are asked to put upon the circuit judge, in the face of that situation, the burden of assenting to, or refusing to assent to, the discharge of an officer of whom he really knew very little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I will know more. I will have administrative contact with these officers from January to December, <Col N="507" /> and, as I say, the judge might very well answer: &ldquo;You propose to remove this officer for unsatisfactory attendance at his office over a given period, for dissatisfaction to the public, and so on.  I was in Mayo between these dates and I know nothing.&rdquo; Suppose the position were that the accounts of a particular county registrar were invariably late and, when they did arrive, were utterly unsatisfactory, you might be met with the comment from the circuit judge that he knew nothing of that, that he was not a judge of accounts, and so on.  If you had the High Court and the Supreme Court position of almost daily contact between the official and the judge, I would see no objection, but where you have only six weeks in the year contact, then I submit it is unwise to press that the concurrence of the judge should be required in respect of matters of which, in the nature of the case, he could not have direct or personal information.  Some judges might be very scrupulous as to the degree of positive personal knowledge they would require before assenting to the removal of an officer.  A judge who is out of the county, in which the officer functions, for 46 out of the 52 weeks can have very little in the nature of direct personal knowledge as to the degree of satisfaction a particular officer is giving, either to the public of his county or to the Department of which he is an officer.  That is not the High Court position and that is not the Supreme Court position.  There is little, if any, analogy.  If there was a circuit court for every county, I would fully accept the principle that this semi-judicial officer, or this officer who performs some acts at any rate of a semi-judicial nature, might be given a tenure stronger than that of the civil servant, and that the concurrence of the judge under whom he works should be a condition precedent to his removal; but in the actual case, with the judge absent for ten months of the year from the county in which that officer works, I do object to making the concurrence of the judge a condition precedent to the removal of the county registrar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the example of Dublin.  There would be close contact between the officer in Dublin and the presiding judge, and the same would also be true of Cork.  Are we to deal only with exceptional cases such as the Minister referred to in order to put these officials in Dublin and in Cork entirely into the hands of the Executive Council?  Is it wise, I ask, to do that?  If the Minister would consider adding some words to this amendment that would meet a particular case in the unusual event of a judge being unable to express any opinion for or against a particular reason why the official was absent and that then the Executive Council should act in order to meet such an unusual emergency, I would be agreeable to that, but to place these officers who, as the Minister admits, have to discharge duties of a semi-judicial character, entirely in the hands of the Executive Council is, I think, exceedingly undesirable. If the Minister would go as far as to agree to accept the amendment and then add to it such words as would cover the case that he refers to, I would be quite willing to accept that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will resist this amendment as strongly as possible.  In what were called the good old days, the clerk of the Crown and Peace, in certain counties, certainly had a very good time of it.  The office, I think, was regarded as a very good one&mdash;in fact, a plum.  I think, in a great many cases, the attendance of these officers at their offices left a great deal to be desired.  I often wondered whether their non-attendance was ever reported to the higher authorities by the judge.  Of course I can understand that in many cases it would have been very difficult in the old days for the judge to have to make a report against this official, for the reason that he came into such intimate contact with him, and very often was a great personal friend of his.  For that reason I think that the arrangement the Minister is now proposing is a far better one&mdash;that the responsibility for removing or remonstrating <Col N="509" /> with an official of the kind should come from headquarters.  I am, therefore, in agreement with this arrangement which the Minister proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle and the practice have been admitted and adhered to in the High Court. Therefore, I cannot see how Deputy Johnson's argument, as to why they should not also be applied to the circuit courts, can be met.  The Minister has said truly that the circuit court judge will not be in constant contact with officials such as these are going to be. He will certainly not be in daily contact with them, and I admit all that the Minister has said in regard to the number of the courts and intervals that elapse between the holding of them.  At the same time, the circuit court judge is not, if I may say so, entirely out of touch with these officials.  While he is acting elsewhere he is often in communication with them dealing with matters which refer not to the court that the judge is actually attending at the moment, but rather to the court of the official.  Though the judge may not have what the Minister described as positive personal knowledge of anything in the nature of misconduct on the part of one of these officials, he certainly could not very well be completely in the dark as to what was going on in the conduct of one of the courts over which it is his duty to preside.  I think the case that the Minister has put is a very extreme on and one that would not be likely to arise.  Certainly, if a court registrar was not attending to his duties for two months, and even though the circuit judge might not be in his bailiewick during that period, I do not think that could happen without it coming to the knowledge of the judge.  He would be the first probably that complaints would be made to about the conduct of this official, and as Deputy Johnson, I think, said, he would be a better judge of the conduct of one of these officials than the Minister himself.  If the official's conduct were to be brought into question and were brought before the Minister for Justice, the latter.  I venture to suggest, would turn first <Col N="510" /> to the circuit judge to ask for information concerning the conduct of this official.  On the grounds of the extreme case put forward by the Minister&mdash;the Minister himself admits the soundness of the principle that applies in the High Court&mdash;I do not think it would be inadvisable to apply the same principle to the circuit courts.</P>
      <P>It is true that the cases are somewhat different and a Circuit Court Judge has to attend to various courts.  He cannot be everywhere at once, but at the same time, though he may have to preside over five courts, while he is presiding over one court he inevitably must be in communication with officials in his other courts.  I think it is well that should be recognised, as showing the extent and the character of the work that has to be done by the Circuit Judge, because at the time of the passing of the Courts of Justice Act people seemed to regard their task in the future as a light one.  I say this is one of the difficulties of the position of a circuit judge, that while he is away from one court he is really never away from it, but is in constant communication with the officials of the court because he has to direct various operations and he has to know generally what is being done.  Therefore I do not think the case the Minister has made is altogether an answer to the amendment that has been proposed, especially in view of the fact that the Minister himself says that he accepts the principle, and also in view of the fact that he has not only admitted it but applied it to the High and Supreme Courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister look favourably upon the suggestion that the concurrence of the Chief Justice should be sought.  The point I should like to make in the matter is that we want to remove the possibility of suspicion that other influences than administration and legal efficiency may operate in the dismissal of a registrar.</P>

      <P>Such as political friendship&mdash;any other factor of the kind that operated in the Minister's mind when he consented to a similar regulation in regard to the High Court <Col N="511" /> and the Supreme Court.  Whatever influenced the Minister to accept amendments inserted in the Bill with regard to the officials of the Supreme Court applies&mdash;perhaps to some less extent, I do not know&mdash;but it applies in respect of the Circuit Courts; the end sought for and the principle embodied in the amendment which the Minister accepts would be met, I think, if the concurrence of the Chief Justice was sought before the registrar was dismissed.  All the evidence that would be available for the Minister would be available to be laid before the Chief Justice, and while there is no personal contact in the case and personal knowledge of the faults which might warrant dismissal, the other point of view, that Deputy <Col N="512" /> Wolfe expressed, that the personal friendship of the Circuit Judge to the registrar might influence the Circuit Judge, would be absent.  The assurance would be at least that no political influences were at work in leading to the dismissal of any registrar and undoubtedly that is a thing to be desired.  I think the Minister might consider reasonably if he cannot accept the judge of the Circuit Court before authorising the dismissal, or announcing the dismissal, of a registrar of a Circuit Court, that the concurrence of the Chief Justice should be obtained.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (3) (a), page 11, line 3, after the word &lsquo;years&rsquo; to insert the words &lsquo;and whose age does not exceed fifty years at the time of his appointment.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for moving the amendment is that the retiring age, according to Section 31, is 65, and I think the <Col N="513" /> State should get service from a man for fifteen years before it should be burdened with a pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not inclined to accept the amendment.  In general, we look for a man below the age mentioned in the amendment, but there may be exceptional cases.  There may, for instance, be cases where competent men below that age are not available, and I would not like to tie my hands, or the hands of the Executive Council, by saying in a hard and fast way that we would not appoint a man over fifty years of age.  Deputy O'Connor referred to the retiring age mentioned in Section 31 of the Bill.  If Deputies refer to sub-section (5) of that section they will see that every county registrar shall retire at the age of sixty-five. That is the statutory age limit.  The sub-section goes on to say&mdash;&ldquo;but such age of retirement may, in the case of any particular county registrar, be extended by the Minister to any age not exceeding sixty-eight years.&rdquo;  There may be a question about this on Report, and I will consider in the meantime whether the age of sixty-eight might not be extended by another two years, that is, to the age of seventy.  Even, however, leaving it at the age of sixty-eight, a man coming in at the age of fifty, fifty-one or fifty-two, will give sixteen or eighteen years' service, and, as you get on in the fifties, the fact that the pension depends on the number of actual years of service given will tend to deter the older men.  We have, for instance, the experience that a man who can only look forward to a short term of office and who, consequently, will not be eligible for a considerable pension on retiring, hesitates to take the position.  I do not believe that we will have many applicants for a position of this sort above the age of fifty-five or, at any rate, fifty-six.  In general, we will look for men below the age mentioned in the amendment.  We should hope to get men very much below the age of 50 years.  I do not want to accept in a hard and fast way that, in an exceptional case, we would not appoint a man who would be more than that.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply to this amendment opens up rather an undesirable vista of irresponsibility. The amendment before us seeks to provide that a person shall not be appointed to a particular post if he be over 50 years of age.  The Minister says he is not prepared to put in any age limit.  If we were dealing with probability or with likelihood, the Minister would probably be right in saying that it would be unlikely that a man over 55 years would be appointed. But the Minister does not want to have an age limit at all.  Up to the age of 68 a man could be appointed.  The amendment, I think, is a reasonable one.  If you are going to put a man in a permanent position, you must have some regard to his age, since the office is pensionable, and you must have regard to the number of years' service that is going to run.  We all recognise that the span of human life has lengthened in recent years.  A man of 50 years or 60 years is not now a particularly old man.  If I dealt with the matter in detail, I might become personal. At the same time, we must have regard to the age when taking a man into the service of the State to fill a pensionable office.  That should not be done at a time when he has expended the greater part of his youthful energy in other directions.  I should have imagined that 50 would have been accepted as a reasonable age.  Even if that limit were extended, it would be better than to have no limit at all.  It is clearly undesirable not to have a limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy's idea of reasonableness is.  Supposing there seemed a prospect of getting ten years' good service from a man, in the absence of competent younger men applying for the post, would the Deputy consider it reasonable to employ such a man even on a basis of 10 years' service? He would get ten-sixtieths of his salary&mdash;that is one-sixth&mdash;as pension, and if he served 15 years he would get fifteen-sixtieths or one-fourth of his <Col N="515" /> salary.  It comes down to this in the end: What is it worth to the State to put in a good man&mdash;a man who is considered competent&mdash;on the basis of a probable ten years' service as against putting in a younger man who is not competent?  It would be very difficult to size it up in terms of cash.  But that is the problem.  That is my objection to tying my hands by saying definitely that a person shall not be appointed above the age of X years.</P>
      <P>I do say to the Deputy that in general we would look for a younger man than a man of fifty years, although 50 &mdash;if I did agree on Report Stage to fix the age at 70 as the outside age limit for the position&mdash;would mean 20 years' service.  In general we would look for men considerably under that age.  Supposing they were not forthcoming, or supposing that only men under that age were forthcoming that were not really competent to fill the position and perform the duties attaching to the position, where does true economy lie?  Does it lie in taking a competent man at 50 years of age or upwards with his prospect of giving ten or fifteen years' good service or taking the incompetent man of 35, 38 or 40 who, no doubt, would give longer service of a kind before he draws his pension?  That is the problem.  I present it to the Deputy and, if he wishes, both he and I can give mature consideration to it between this and the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In this we are dealing with assumptions.  Is the Minister right in assuming that the attraction of the public service, as represented by this post of registrar, will not produce, in the solicitors' profession, not merely a single individual but a number of competitors for the post?  If the Minister's assumption is rightly founded, his argument is greatly strengthened, but I am not prepared to accept that as a hypothesis.  Knowing <Col N="516" /> the solicitors' profession, as we do, and its competency, this position is one which will have not merely a single suitable applicant, but competitive applicants under 50 years of age.  If the position is to be so unattractive as not to appeal to the solicitors, the Minister's argument is well founded. You may not get applications, although the suitable men are there, but I would not like to base any argument upon that assumption.</P>

      <P>I could not accept that amendment.  The County Registrar is a professional man, and we will endeavour, as far as possible, to see that he is a man of considerable standing in his profession.  Of all the court officers he will probably approximate most closely to the position of a junior judge. This proposal is that a member of his office staff shall be eligible for appointment to the position, provided he has served for a sufficient number of years in the office&mdash;ten years.  I could not accept that.  The staffs in the offices of the Clerks of the Crown and Peace are not even of the general education of second-grade civil servants.  It is true that in the course of time they acquire a pretty good routine knowledge of the work of the office, just as it might be said that a district court clerk acquires a certain amount of routine knowledge of the duties of the District Justice.  We do not propose to appoint a district court clerk to the position of District Justice, or to make him eligible for such an appointment.  To do that would be really on a level with saying that an official in the office of the Clerk of the Crown and Peace, or of the County Registrar, shall be eligible in time to be appointed as County Registrar.</P>

These clerks in the Crown and Peace offices are not eligible for pensions.  If they serve for thirty or forty years, and then resign through ill-health or for other reasons, they receive no gratuity or pension.  Having regard to their service, they should be eligible for these appointments and should be treated like the registrars of the courts as regards pensions.</P>

      <P>I think it has been established, or is being established in this Bill, that the Clerk of the Crown and Peace shall be a solicitor of some years' standing.  It has not been expected hitherto, I think, that the clerks would have any such qualifications, although a considerable number of them had such qualifications.  They have a very great knowledge of legal matters, perhaps even more than their official heads.  Still we must consider the legal qualifications of men for such an important position as the registrar of the county.  In the past many of the clerks were most efficient men.  I have in my mind a particular instance&mdash;a more efficient clerk could not be found &mdash;still I do not think that he would ever think of aspiring under present circumstances to one of these posts. Although these men have acted for the Clerks of the Crown and Peace in the absence of their principals, I do not think we could take it as a good principle that they should be promoted to these positions when a particular qualification is required.  Under the circumstances I do not think the amendment should be pressed.  I do not think it is consistent with the Bill, however worthy of compensation these clerks may be in regard to pension or gratuity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us a little more information as to his intentions regarding the retiring age?  I gather that he is still in doubt, or is leaving it open to representations in the Dáil, as to whether 68 is satisfactory. I should like to record my view that 68 is not enough, when 70 is required in the case of officers of the High Court.  If the Master of the High Court and the Taxing-Master may continue in office until the age of 70, I cannot see any good reason why the Registrar of the Circuit Court should be obliged to retire at 65, with the possibility of extension to 68.  I think the contention which, if I remember aright, was advanced about the excessive wear and tear upon a judge of the Circuit Court, as compared with a judge of the High Court, does not apply to the case of the Registrar, inasmuch as he is attached to his court and has not to travel, which was alleged to be the reason in the case of judges for an early retiring age.  I think that the age of 65 or 68 years might well be extended to 70 in this case, as in the cases of the Master of the High Court and the Taxing-Master. I do not know whether the Minister's doubt applies only to the power of the Minister to extend the age of retirement to 68 years, or whether it also applies to the question of the normal retiring age.  I hope that the Minister will favourably consider the proposal that the retiring age should be 70 and not 65.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Deputy as to the advisability of adding two years to the outside age limit, making it 70 instead of 68.  If that were so, then the position you would have really in practice is that, in the absence of some rather marked decline in physical and mental powers, a man would serve until 70, but that as from 65 up to 70, if it were evident that a man were unfit to perform adequately and satisfactorily the duties of his office, it would be in the power of the Minister to intimate <Col N="522" /> to him that that was considered to be the case and that he should retire.  So that during the last five years there would be that kind of discretionary elasticity which would be broadly applied and a man would only be asked to retire sooner than 70 if we considered that the public were not really getting value for his salary.  It is in that spirit that I believe, either by me or anybody else, the sub-section would be administered and applied: that simply we fix the age of 65 and the outside age limit of 70, and within that period if a man were failing he could be notified that we did not consider he should remain on and try to perform the duties of his office.</P>

I think from our knowledge of those court officials we are all agreed that there are a great many of the existing officials who, even at the age of 70, are still capable of discharging satisfactorily their many duties.  I think that none of us would be in favour of going beyond the age of 70, but I hope that up to that age the Minister will see his way to encourage as many of the existing officers as he possibly can to continue in the service of the Department up to that age.</P>

One would like to know before the Bill passes the exact nature of these fees which are transferred from the local to the central authority, and the amount, so that we may be in a position to judge whether it is wise to take from the local authorities and throw a charge on the local authorities of an equivalent amount.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6)  This section shall not operate to authorise the senior officer in a circuit court office to exercise the powers or authorities or perform the duties or functions of the county registrar as registration officer under <Col N="527" /> the Electoral Act, 1923 (No. 12 of 1923) or any Act amending or extending that Act, and Section 10 of that Act shall apply to the exercise and performance of those powers, authorities, duties and functions during any temporary absence or temporary incapacity through illness of the county registrar or any vacancy in the office of county registrar until a deputy is appointed under this section but not thereafter.</P>
    <P>(7)  After the powers, authorities, duties, and functions of any under-sheriff have become transferred under this Act to a county registrar, the powers, authorities, duties and functions of such under-sheriff as returning officer under the Electoral Act, 1923, shall not be exercisable by the senior officer under this section, and in lieu thereof whenever such county registrar is temporarily absent or incapacitated through illness or his office is vacant the Minister for Local Government and Public Health may if he so thinks fit appoint a fit and proper person to exercise and perform those powers, authorities, duties and functions during such absence, incapacity, or vacancy until a deputy is appointed by the Minister for Justice under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of that amendment is to make it possible for the Minister for Local Government to appoint such a person to carry on the work of a registration officer, and to carry out Parliamentary elections if the county registrar is unable to do the work.  The same power exists in regard to the Clerk of the Crown and Peace and the under-sheriff.  The intention is to make it clear that the passing of this Act does not put an end to that power.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Whenever any fine, amercement, penalty, or forfeited recognisance is remitted in whole or in part after the same has been paid into or disposed for the benefit of the Exchequer under this section, such fine, amercement, penalty or forfeited recognisance or the portion thereof so remitted (as the case may be) shall be repaid out of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister for Finance shall direct.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is that in cases where a fine is remitted or reduced there may not be any difficulty in providing the necessary funds to repay the entire fine if it is remitted or the reduced portion in case of reduction.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another question involved which I think may have to be discussed more fully on the Report Stage.  That is the principle that is being perpetuated under this Bill of paying over fines to an informer. It is one that has come down to us from the past, from a very long time ago, and I question very much whether it is desirable to perpetuate it &mdash;that certain sums that are levied on the prisoner or defendant shall be paid to the informer.  I do not think it is at all a desirable practice to encourage that by promise of payment from penalties.</P>
      <P>I would like to know whether the Minister has considered the desirability of continuing this practice, or will he consider the limitation of this on the Report Stage of the Bill?</P>

      <P>Is not the term &ldquo;informer&rdquo; in this particular case rather an objectionable way of expressing what happens?  Certain bodies have a right of prosecuting and they become informers.  They are not really informers; they are prosecuting for certain acts, and when the court fines they get the money.  I take it that is the way the thing operates.  I do not think &ldquo;informer&rdquo; means actually informing on the part of an individual.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Johnson is not correct in his interpretation of the effect of the section generally.  It is not accurate to say it has the effect of continuing and stereotyping indefinitely this disposal of moneys.  It leaves it open to administrative change in future, and one is not <Col N="538" /> bound to continue anything that is considered objectionable.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Hewat's point could be met.  The word is a technical term.  It has been used in many statutes, and I think it would create a difficulty to get away from it. The fact that it is used colloquially with a certain amount of odium attaching to it should not make us baulk at it as a technical legal term, and it would require some looking into if we were to amend it.</P>

      <P>In sub-section 3 the Minister is taking power to direct that the whole or any specified portion of every fine belonging to certain classes &ldquo;shall not be paid into the Exchequer under this section and that, in lieu of being so paid, the whole or such specified portion (as the case may be) of every such fine shall be paid to such prosecutor, informer or other person and upon such terms and conditions as shall be specified....&rdquo;  I am raising the matter because it would seem under this new power the Minister is obtaining that fines can be handed over to the informer.  It is a fact, I think, that certain classes of prosecutions take place at the instance of the common informer, and any informer might be tempted to take a prosecution with the prospect that he will get the fine or portion of the fine.  I think it is quite an undesirable practice to perpetuate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>There were certain prosecutions brought by Boards of Conservators in connection with the fishery regulations, and portions of the fines imposed were in the past, by statute, paid over to the prosecutor.  In the course of the Second Reading of this Bill, dealing with Section 43, I explained to the Dáil, in connection with the proposal to abolish the Fines and Fees Fund, that it had been decided to abolish this special fund altogether and to pay the fines and fees into the general Exchequer, and I asked the Dáil to vote annually the necessary money for the pensions, salaries and expenses of district court clerks in the same way as the Dáil votes the money for the pensions, salaries and expenses of the other court officers.  I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We propose to enact that in <Col N="539" /> future all court fees and all fines shall go into the Exchequer direct instead of into a fund, and it will be observed that there is a provision for the making of orders under which certain classes of fines may be paid, not into the Exchequer, but in other directions to be specified in the order. The reason for that is that at present under various statutes there are certain persons and bodies having a right to certain fines or portions of certain fines.  Local authorities, Gárda Síochána Reward Fund, and Fishery Conservators are just a few examples of that, and I have been informed that there is a regular entanglement or network of provisions of that kind which it would be impossible for any person to expound clearly.  The law on this subject ought to be so simple and so clear that every district court clerk in the country might be expected to tell off the list of all the classes of fines in which vested interests of that kind exist.  It is not at all clear at this stage that all these various vested interests in fines, whatever their origin and however justified they may have been in their origin, are now justified at all.  You have rights of that kind created by statute 50 or 60 years ago, but the circumstances have altered so much in the meantime that there seems no longer any justification for the private right.  Therefore, our object is, firstly, to clear up the existing confusion as to who is entitled to these rights irrespective of the merits; and, secondly, to eliminate claims which have ceased to be justifiable in the existing circumstances or claims which are so insignificant in amount as not to deserve a separate existence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I added that, lest the second portion of our object&mdash;the elimination of claims which had ceased to be justifiable or insignificant&mdash;might appear menacing or confiscatory in character, in some cases the claims are those of Government Departments, and the present arrangement is merely a bookkeeping one, and merely the taking of money from one pocket and putting it into another.  I explained that generally, if any person or body that at present has such a vested interest as has <Col N="540" /> been referred to can put up a case that the abolition of that interest is unjust to individuals, or undesirable to individuals, it would be our duty to consider whether it would be advisable to make any change.  The position we are taking up with regard to this is that we are asking the Dáil to say that, having examined into them at leisure, we can by order make such administrative arrangements as shall appear just and proper.  That does not commit us to a continuation of the practice to which Deputy Johnson has referred, and which he considers objectionable.  We are simply taking a rather wide power, in view of the number of such exceptions there are, to examine them in detail and to make our administrative dispositions by order and get away from the innumerable statutory provisions there are appearing on the subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not that rather open up a very large question of giving general powers of administration? This House may not realise how far-reaching those powers may be.  From the Minister's explanation it would appear that the law is very entangled and the situation wants to be cleared up. At this stage the clearing-up process should be as complete as possible; the clearing-up process is not going to be done by this House but by the authority under this Bill which will give the Minister power to clear up the cases individually.  How far is that sacrificing the rights of the people who are concerned in this matter?  In other words, supposing an authority has had that right established by law, is it the proposal that the Minister under this Bill can come in and, without the consent of the authority, abolish the perquisites, if I may put it that way, that they have been in receipt of in the past, by statutory authority?  It does seem to me that that is treating in a Bill in a very general way a whole heap of details and is taking them out of the decision of anybody but the Minister.  We would assume, of course, that the exercise of that authority would be done in order and properly.  At the same time, it is in essence taking away the right of the people to something that <Col N="541" /> they had in the law altogether, and leaving them that right at the discretion of a Minister at some future time. I do not know whether that is what the Minister intends by what he said by way of explanation in this matter. But if the Dáil is satisfied to do that they should do it with the recognition that there may be cases involved in this on which the House might wish to express an opinion and be consulted on, but under this proposal they will not be consulted, nor will people have a right to appeal.</P>

      <P>I might be able to meet the Deputy to some extent on the Report Stage by providing for the concurrence of the Dáil in any such order. The position really created by the section is that the rights go.  But where a case can be established we are prepared by administrative order to meet that case.  Where there is any substance or reality in the vested interests we are prepared to meet that case by an order which sub-section (3) of the section enables me to make with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister make some safeguard for the people on the Report Stage?  I think every Deputy here has a difficulty in this matter, because of the fact that it is a technical matter and of our want of knowledge of it.  The only knowledge I have of this matter is in connection with the Port and Docks Board.  They have something in this direction which is of no value.  But it might be of some very considerable value, and I would object to the Minister making an order affecting, say, a body like the Port and Docks Board, leaving no appeal either to the Dáil or to the Court.  If that were modified so as to make it possible to have an arrangement mutually come to as between the Ministry and the body concerned, so that that body would have some right of appeal, it would be more satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, quite a difficult matter, and the Deputy is quite right in describing it as being very technical.  But the position I am seeking is this, that we should hack at this tangled position, withdraw these <Col N="542" /> rights by statute, then find which amongst them are worthy of being resurrected by administrative order, or for which of them a really equitable case can be made on any ground, either on the ground of public expediency or on the ground of private merit, and so on.  Such an order can be made under sub-section (3).  If there is a feeling that the Dáil would like to know just what right we consider worthy of resurrecting in that manner, it can easily be provided on Report that these administrative orders shall be laid before the Dáil for its approval and that in the absence of a rescinding motion they shall have effect.  I do not want to mislead the Deputy.  The section, as I see it, removes the right, and a case must be put up for the revival or resurrection of any right which it is considered ought to endure in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>It might take the form of compensation.  A person might be entitled to compensation for something taken away from him.  I quite agree with the Minister that the whole system is rather out-of-date and ought to be dealt with in the way he suggests and as propounded in the Bill.  But all I ask is that the Minister shall not be put in the arbitrary position of being able to make an order without appeal to anybody in the case of a person who may have a grievance or who may be damnified without having the right of bringing his case before some other tribunal from any arbitrary decision of the Minister.</P>

Sub-section (1) removes these rights, and sub-section (3) enables us to resurrect by administrative order any of them that are considered worthy of resurrection. Therefore, it is not I who destroy the rights.  I am asking the Dáil to <Col N="543" /> destroy them, and then I am asking the Dáil to give administrative discretion to myself and the Minister for Finance to revive such of them as are considered worthy of reviving.  If Deputies would like to see which amongst them are considered worthy of revival, then we can make provision that these orders should be laid before the Dáil for its approval.  The effect of section 1 is to remove the rights and the concession is granted in sub-section (3).</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are important question raised in this section. One is if the fines are to be paid into the Central Fund, as I think they must be, the authority to pay them should not be on the head of an administrative order.  I think such will have to be sanctioned by statute.  I would like to ask the Minister if he has, in considering this whole question of the disposal of the fines, considered having the matter dealt with in the light of the views of the Department of Finance on this matter?  The proposal to authorise the payment out of the Central Fund of money by order would be, I think, stretching beyond the authority of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise rather a different point.  It is that this section raises the rights of individuals under certain private Acts.  For instance, I happen to have a fishery and that fishery is constituted under a private Act of the year 1837.  Under that Act all fines levied in prosecutions <Col N="544" /> come to the proprietor of the fishery; in other words, to me.  I admit that generally I took proceedings under the Fisheries Act rather than under the private Act, because owing to the unfamiliarity of the justices adjudicating with this private Act I did not get convictions.  But there are rights of individuals concerned.  I am probably not the only person with a private Act of this kind, and I suggest that the section is one that requires a little consideration before the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>On Deputy Johnson's point, I think the answer is that the payments under orders made by the powers asked for in sub-section (3) would be made out of the actual proceeds of the fines and before any payments into the Central Fund had been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the constitutional question was raised before and I thought this was intended to meet it.  It lies in the proposition that all revenues, from whatever source arising, shall, subject to such exceptions as may be provided by law, form one fund.  Whether this is the kind of exception is doubtful, and that is why I press upon the Minister the importance of having the very highest opinion on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure.  I could not say positively that the Attorney-General was consulted on the section. But this section forms one of the outstanding matters in connection with this Bill that we had to discuss with the Department of Finance, and they have been satisfied with the provision in the sub-section.  What Deputy Cooper says serves, of course, to emphasise what I have said, that this is a very difficult and tangled matter. These rights have grown up under a variety of statutes, and there are innumerable vested interests in small portions of fines imposed for one <Col N="545" /> offence or another.  What the Dáil is really being asked to do is, so to speak, to clear the ground and let us see how many of these are sound, reasonable and worthy of being revived and carried on into the new courts system.  People who would consider themselves aggrieved by sub-section (1) are invited, as it were, under sub-section (3) to make their case, the Dáil giving discretion to two Ministers to meet the equitable cases by an administrative order.  That is what is being asked.  It would be a task of very great difficulty to ask a Department to set to work and examine into all these exceptions and all these petty vested interests that have grown up about fines and to bring them specifically one by one before the Dáil.  We are asking power to take the other line of approach, that we withdraw them, see where the outcry comes from and then deal with the claims, taking power under sub-section (3) to deal with the claims and protests that will arise as a result of sub-section (1).  I think that the Dáil has very frequently given wider powers than that to Ministers, and I think that it is little short of necessary to give the powers asked for in this section, and to take the step you are asked to take in sub-section (1)&mdash;to withdraw these rights, with power to revive such of them as are considered worthy of revival.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not attach&mdash; and I hope I made it clear&mdash;any great importance to my particular rights.  So far as I am concerned, sub-section (3) will rest; I shall not assert any claims, because the poacher is not, as a rule, a good mark to levy a fine on, and especially a fine levied by a private individual. But might I suggest to the Minister that the formula there is a somewhat unhappy one&mdash;&ldquo;prosecutor, informer or other person.&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;informer&rdquo; was so offensive under past conditions, that people would be very slow to associate themselves with that description.  I would suggest that &ldquo;prosecutor or other such person&rdquo; would be sufficient, and the Minister might consider something on those lines.</P>

      <P>Let me be clear as to the Deputy's expectations for Report Stage.  I could not undertake to bring before the Dáil by Report Stage an itemised list of these vested interests. I do not believe that I could manage in the time.  I could no doubt, bring sample ones, but it would be a very considerable task to investigate all these cases of little portions of fines going to this person and to that body. It is simply practically as a result of the despair of being able to place such an itemised list before the Dáil that this section has taken its present shape, that we are asking the Dáil to withdraw these vested interests in fines, leaving power to us to re-create such of them as are considered worthy of revival.  I only want to be clear that the Deputy will not be disappointed on the Report Stage.  If the Deputy thinks that I could bring full information as to all the things that are affected by sub-section (1) of Section 43 before the Dáil by the Report Stage, I do not think I could undertake it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not asking the House to do an extraordinary thing?  It now appears that in Section 43 the Minister wants to establish a principle whereby the House is to wipe away something that they do not know the nature of at all.  Is that fair to the House, and is it fair legislation? The more we proceed with this section the more it seems to me to be based on very arbitrary lines.  I recognise that the object the Minister has in view is a good one, and I think most of the House will agree that the simplification of the existing laws as far as these fines are concerned would be good.  But to say: &ldquo;I am going to sweep away a number of rights; I do not know what they are myself,&rdquo; is something that I <Col N="547" /> think the House should not accept.  In other words, we do not know what we are being asked to do.  Is that fair?</P>

I know that there is simply a variety of petty, trifling and little provisions of one kind or another almost negligible in their amounts, and when we proceed to ask for specific power to meet such claims as will arise&mdash;many will not arise&mdash;it will simply be regarded as a perfectly natural provision, on the establishment of a new court system, that these rights should disappear.  Only the substantial ones will show their heads, and we are taking power to deal with those, so that the thing is not just so overwhelmingly revolutionary as Deputy Hewat is inclined to think, or inclined to say.</P>

For instance, we know that Deputy Good has an interest in the sums which go to the local authorities directly from fines in respect to matters which local authorities administer. We have had knowledge that quite a number of local authorities have expressed some concern in regard to this deprivation of certain of their revenues.  If the Minister could give the House a copy of the draft of the order that he proposes to make in regard to these fines which are at present available for local authorities, I think that would give some of us some reassurance, and perhaps Deputy Good amongst us.</P>

      <P>I have considered this amendment, and I am of opinion that it is not really necessary.  If the employment of these men is found desirable in the public interest, there would be no difficulty whatever in arranging that without the specific power which the amendment gives.  There is no obstacle to the county registrar employing them, and an express provision enabling him to do that is unnecessary. There are other considerations. For instance, the men at present employed by an under-sheriff are the personal selection of the under-sheriff. <Col N="551" /> If they are suitable men, as the vast majority I believe are, there would be no difficulty about a county registrar when he takes on the duties of an under-sheriff simply taking on also the staff of the under-sheriff, and in Dublin, both in the county and in the county borough, the question will not arise for probably fifteen, twenty or twenty-five years.  It is not necessary to make special statutory provision to cover the case of a situation that need not be expected to arise for twenty or twenty-five years, and to insert any express provision that the county registrar may employ those men, when there is, in fact, nothing whatever to prevent him, is unnecessary.  The Deputy may take it that there is nothing to prevent the staffs of the under-sheriff being simply carried over to the new officer on whom the duties of the under-sheriff will devolve in due course, and it is not necessary to insert an express provision to the effect of his amendment.</P>

      <P>I may say in explanation of that that the view I took originally of the matter was that court fees were not a judicial matter, that they were something that should be fixed by responsible Ministers, by myself in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  We could be criticised then if they were too high or too low. There was a certain amount of representation from the legal profession, and this amendment is inserted to make the consent of the rule-making committee a condition precedent to the fixing of these fees.  It will probably work all right.  If there is a deadlock and failure to get the consent and concurrence of the Committee to fees which are considered reasonable by the Government, that would be a question of approaching the Dáil again for further powers.  I am satisfied with <Col N="555" /> the existing provision, and I believe that in consultation and after contact, it would be possible to arrive at a reasonable scale of fees.  If I form the opinion that the scale of fees is not, in fact, reasonable, it would be a matter of coming again to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I would like to express a view which I know is very general, and that is, that in exercising such powers as are contained in this section the Minister will endeavour to make the fees as low as possible, and much lower than they are at present. I hope it will not be difficult to get the concurrence of the rule-making authority in that.  I am sure that if anyone has been influenced by what is called the economy campaign he will be glad to apply it in the case of the courts, as it will fall very heavily on litigants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bear in mind what the Deputy says.  It is an expression of opinion.  My own view is that the court fees, as such, are not high and do not form any considerable proportion of the cost of litigation.  It is the professional fees rather than the court fees that make litigation expensive. I think that probably I might develop that a little further on Report Stage.  It is a very fixed view of mine and of my Department that the court fees, even as they are at present, are not unreasonably high, and constitute a very small proportion of the total cost of litigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am prepared to accept that view, I think an expression of opinion from the Dáil, that the desire should be to keep down what I may call litigation fees, wherever they may fall, may have some effect on the rule-making authority and the Minister.  It is to be hoped that, when we find the rules of the various courts before us for consideration, we shall see that the procedure is intended to be so simplified as to reduce very greatly the cost of litigation. An expression of the view by the Dáil that that is desirable, even in respect to court fees, may have its reflection on the lawyers of one type or another.</P>

      <P>Before Section 49 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The several powers, authorities, duties and functions conferred or imposed by Part I. of this Act on the respective officers therein referred to as principal officers and by Part II. of this Act on the county registrars shall be exercised and performed by those officers and registrars with the assistance of the officers and servants employed in the offices under their management respectively, and every such principal officer and county registrar shall arrange for the exercise and performance by officers or servants employed in the office under his management of such of his powers, authorities, duties and functions (other than those which he is for the time being expressly required by statute or rule of court to exercise or perform in person) as he cannot conveniently exercise or perform himself.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>The original section was drafted so as not to apply to the appointment of any person except those retained to assist the court.  Neither was it meant to interfere with the powers of the Chief Justice in lunacy matters, and the amendment is to make certain that it has not that effect.</P>

      <P>The Civil Service Regulation Act made the Civil Service Commissioners in effect the judges of the extent to which a knowledge of Irish should be demanded as a qualification for any public post.  In general, therefore, court officers can be appointed only if they satisfy the Commissioners that they have such a knowledge of Irish as the Commissioners deem necessary for their work.  There are three Commissioners.  The Department of Justice has constantly endeavoured to secure trained Irish speakers in Irish districts, and it has succeeded in an appreciable degree.  In such places as Falcaragh, Galway City, Dingle, Dungarvan and elsewhere, we have succeeded to a large extent in making the court administration Irish-speaking. It is only in a few cases where the appointments are made direct by the Executive Council that the Civil Service Commissioners have not power.  Such cases are legal appointments of high standing.  The Deputy should know what the supply of Irish-speaking lawyers is.  Moreover, if the amendment is good for court officers it should be good for the entire service and good for such persons as police, judges, and even Deputies. To demand here and now that the whole public service must, as from date, be reserved exclusively for Irish speakers, is to demand the impossible. <Col N="559" /> There are not sufficient Irish speakers with sufficient qualifications to perform the work.  I venture to say that they are not there to the extent of one-twentieth of the need, and I think the Deputy knows that just as well as I do.  I am not, therefore, accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>He must have been concealing his knowledge.  He told us he had not any knowledge of Irish. I could not accept the Deputy's amendment. It simply would not be honest, in face of the position as we know it to be.  The supply of competent men with the necessary qualifications is not there and we could not bind ourselves in the terms of this amendment.  I think on an examination&mdash;such an examination as took place by the Gaeltacht Commission&mdash;it <Col N="561" /> could be shown that we have made every reasonable effort to find for the Irish-speaking areas Irish-speaking officials and Irish-speaking police.  But there is a point at which you cannot sacrifice that reasonable efficiency in the public service which the tax-paying public are entitled to demand.  I could not tie myself down to the terms of this amendment.  It would be simply an absurdity, a dishonesty, and a hypocrisy.  It would be like the resolutions they used to pass long ago at political conventions&mdash;&ldquo;That this time three years the business of this convention shall be transacted in the Irish language and in no other.&rdquo;  Everybody there knew&mdash;the proposer, the seconder, and the supporters of those resolutions&mdash;in their hearts and souls that the thing was an impossibility.  It could not take place and it did not take place.  There was not even a reasonable effort made to ensure that it would take place.  It was a farce.  It would be quite as big a farce if I were to accept this amendment and pretend that it would be administratively possible to give effect to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are awaiting the report of the Gaeltacht Commission.  I have no doubt it will be a very interesting and a very important report, and I would ask the Deputy simply to take the view that matters such as the principle underlying this amendment may be left over until we have the benefit, the advice, and the assistance that that report will give us.  I do not want to deal with this amendment in any hostile spirit at all.  I think I could show that in the administration of my Department for the last three years we have made every reasonable effort possible to meet the spirit in which the amendment is put forward.  But I could not accept the amendment in the form in which it is and say that no county registrar would be appointed in the country who had not a competent knowledge of Irish.  It would be an absurdity.  We could not get the competent men, the men with the necessary experience and qualifications, who, in addition, would have that competent knowledge of the Irish language which the Deputy demands.  We could <Col N="562" /> not get the stenographers, we could not get the county registrars, we could not get the officials to man the courts of the country, with a knowledge of Irish. The Deputy knows that we could not get the judges and that we could not get the District Justices&mdash;though by luck we were able to find a sufficient number of District Justices with a knowledge of Irish to conduct the courts which function in Irish-speaking areas.  Even that was a task of some difficulty.  Drawing on the two legal professions&mdash;barristers and solicitors&mdash; we were just barely able to man the Gaeltacht courts with District Justices who knew Irish.  In face of that, is it reasonable to go the length that this amendment does and say that under this Bill&mdash;which provides, of course, for the appointment of hundreds of officials&mdash;no person shall be appointed to any position unless he has a thorough and competent knowledge of the Irish language?  If I were to accept that amendment and bind myself by statute in the terms of the amendment, the logical sequence would be the breakdown of the Judiciary system in the country.</P>

At the present time&mdash;I admit it with a great feeling of regret&mdash;I listen to the Minister for Justice giving a speech in Irish without appreciating the merits of the speech.  I think the Deputy will serve his purpose a great deal better by allowing things to take their course for a reasonable time, by allowing the people themselves to decide these matters <Col N="563" /> and by having some definite opinion from them on the question.</P>

      <P>I think the course taken by the Minister is the only course he could have taken.  I am as keen about the language as anybody can be. I have a smattering of many languages, including two dialects of Hindustani. The Irish is a very difficult language to learn, particularly when one is not a juvenile.  I have succeeded myself in learning a certain amount of Irish, but I realise that a man beyond a certain age cannot and never will be proficient or what one would call a perfect speaker of Irish, having the language on the tip of his tongue, so that in a court of justice or other place of that sort he would be fit to interpret and to understand clearly everything that was going on.  It is quite different with young people.  I think for all appointments for which young people are eligible, it should be absolutely necessary that they should know Irish, but in the case of appointments to the higher grade of people over a certain age, that is impossible, and the Minister's attitude is the only reasonable attitude he could adopt as things are.</P>

There is a certain line of conduct laid out for this State, and that line of conduct is that officials of the State should be Irish-speaking.  It does not matter what Deputy Hewat or any other Deputy thinks.  He thinks that no man should learn Irish because he does not consider it convenient to do so.</P>

A condition in which appointments are made to the Indian Civil Service is that candidates are to acquire the dialect of the districts in which they are to function.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>What I anticipate is that before the question of making appointments under this Act arises we will have had the report of the Gaeltacht Commission.  If a condition of that kind is to be made there is nothing to prevent it.  It is not necessary to write it into an Act.  I feel that this Bill will probably take a month or six months before it becomes law, and I think it likely that by that time we will have the report of the Gaeltacht Commission. As I say, acceptance of the amendment the Deputy has put down is out of the question.  My own view is that to do even what Deputy McCurtain suggests throughout the entire area of the State is scarcely practicable. It will be a matter that will have to be considered very closely, whether you could in counties in which Irish is spoken appoint a person who either is not himself at present a speaker of Irish or who will not undertake within a given time to satisfy some body of persons as to his competency to do business with an Irish speaker and to transact the business attaching to his office with a person who has only one language and that the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not be prepared to put forward a substituted amendment to the Deputy's, along the lines of Deputy McCurtain's suggestion.  I would not be prepared to say that all over the State no person shall be appointed to any office, under this Bill, who will not undertake, within a period of two or three years, to satisfy some tribunal of his competence in the Irish language. I certainly am fully alive to the necessity <Col N="565" /> of keeping the administrative machine, in a given county, in a position in which it can do business with all the residents of that county, but the administration cannot be expected to rush ahead of the actual position in the country amongst the people.  After all, our first business is to provide an efficient administrative machine, and other considerations have to come second to that.  They would not come second if I were to accept, as applicable all over, the idea that no person was to be appointed to a position under this Bill who did not either&mdash;(a) know Irish; or (b) undertake to know it within three years, because the fact is that I would not get the best men for the offices on those terms, and thereby I would be sacrificing efficiency in the public administration to language enthusiasm. I would want very definite intimation from the Dáil that that was imperative before I would be prepared to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak, with great respect, on Deputy McCurtain's suggestion.  I think I speak on behalf of Deputy Hewat and Deputy Thrift as well as myself when I say that I am in agreement with the doctrine that in districts where there are people who know nothing but Irish, the officials and the judges of the courts should be acquainted with Irish, and not be dependent on interpreters.  I think that is an absolute necessity, and I hope it will be carried out.  There is no doubt whatever that Irish is a very difficult language.  I got half way through one book of O'Growney when I was told by Deputy Dr. MacNeill that I was studying the wrong method entirely. I have made an effort to master certain technical terms, but I was up against difficulties.  Deputy McCurtain. whom I hope we will hear again, spoke of the Indian Civil Service.  The difficulty in that comparison is this: that Indian civil servants or officers of the English Army going to India, find awaiting them a well-equipped teacher, a native speaker accustomed to teaching and to getting people through examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can discover, the number of native speakers who are teaching <Col N="566" /> and who know how to teach&mdash;which is rather a different matter&mdash; are comparatively few. Therefore I think that, as the Minister stated, you must proceed gradually in this matter.  With the limited number of native-speaking teachers who are competent to teach&mdash; the Indian Civil Servant gets individual attention and I have never been able to discover that you can get individual teaching here: you have to go to a class, often at times inconvenient for your occupation&mdash;you must proceed slowly.  When you have developed the number of teachers then, as Deputy Hewat says, in another generation what Deputy McBride suggests might be practicable.  I do not think it is practicable to-day.  I must say I would have supported the amendment more fervently if any arguments had been urged in its behalf in Irish.</P>

    <P>(1)  The Civil Service Commissioners may grant to any person who at the passing of this Act is employed during the whole of his time in an office attached to a court of justice and is paid wholly or partly out of clerical allowances given out of public moneys to the head of that office a certificate of qualification in respect of the situation in which he is so employed in such office.</P>
    <P>(2)  A certificate of qualification granted under the foregoing sub-section may be expressed to take effect from a date prior to the date on which it is granted but not in any case prior to the 1st day of January, 1924, and when a certificate of qualification is so expressed to take effect from a date prior to the date on which it is granted the person to whom the certificate is granted shall be deemed to have been paid from moneys provided by the Oireachtas within the meaning of section 17 of the Superannuation Act, 1859, as from the said date from which the certificate is expressed to take effect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> (3)  Whenever a person who at the passing of this Act is employed during the whole of his time in an office attached to a court of justice and is paid wholly or partly out of clerical allowances given out of public moneys to the head of that office and attained the age of fifty-five years before the 1st day of January, 1924, is discharged from such employment or from any employment under this Act, the Minister for Finance may pay to such person on his discharge such gratuity as such Minister thinks proper, but not exceeding twice the amount of the salary and emoluments received by such person from whatsoever source during the last year of his employment.</P>

    <P>The Courts of Justice Act will greatly increase the responsibilities of the assistants.  They will be required in the future to perform duties hitherto carried out by highly-paid High Court officials.  A committee appointed by the British Government recommended that they should be made permanent civil servants and given credit for all their past years of service and the then (British) Under-Secretary stated that owing to impending changes in the Government of Ireland the matter would be left to be dealt with by the Provisional Government of Ireland.  It is, therefore, almost a certainty that the British Government would have granted their claim many years ago.  It is calculated that as credit for past services now claimed for the assistants would apply to approximately 30 men in the whole country, the burden on the Treasury would not be a heavy one and it would not be a charge for many years to come.</P>

      <P>The foregoing amendment 73, moved by Deputy Duggan, leaves the date on which the establishment certificate may be granted an open question, and leaves each case to be considered on its merits. Taking the two amendments on their face value, amendment 73, which has just been passed, is better, in fact, than this amendment, which would limit the Minister for Finance to giving half the past services to the particular officials, whereas amendment 73 leaves it open to him to give the whole service, if he thinks fit.  I do not think he will think fit, and I do not want to delude the Deputy into the view that he is likely <Col N="569" /> to think fit to give even half; but taking the two amendments simply on paper as they stand, the present amendment has a limiting effect which is absent from amendment 73, which has been accepted by the Dáil.  I ask the Deputy to rest satisfied with the fact that the case is not prejudiced by anything in the Bill.  It is left an open matter, and each case will have to be considered on its merits.  If I were pressed to prophesy, I would say that in my opinion the most that these officers would be likely to get in the way of retrospective consideration would be a matter of three or four years on establishment.  But that is not in the Bill, and Deputy Duggan's amendment leaves the matter open in a way in which Deputy Doyle's does not.</P>

      <P>Sub-section 3 of Section 51 represents the best bargain I have been able to make with the <Col N="570" /> Minister for Finance to meet the case of those officials.  After all, the Deputy ought to consider that even sub-section (3) as it stands, represents what is somewhat rare in State Acts&mdash;money for nothing.  These men, after all, made their bargains with their employers&mdash; the Clerks of the Crown and Peace. They were not officials, and they were never left under any illusion about that.  It was not a question of entering the State service in any formal way, or by any process of examination, or other form of competition.  They were simply the private employees of the Clerks of the Crown and Peace, and they made their bargain.  Even sub-section (3) as it stands, though the Deputy may be dissatisfied with it, is a not ungenerous provision on the part of the State.  It represents a voluntary and fairly handsome gratuity on retirement to men who really could not claim that they had any very good grounds for expecting a gratuity of that kind at all.  If there had been no change in the system, and the old judicial system simply went on, they would remain at work as the employees of the Clerks of the Crown and Peace, and I doubt if, on retirement, they would get any such gratuity as sub-section (3) of this section provides for them.  I could not hold out any hope of it being altered or increased.  It represents the best terms we have been able to extract from the Finance Department, and I can hold out no hope of reviewing them.</P>

      <P>The Minister says these officials made their bargain.  Of course they did, but that was at the time they were appointed, with the Clerks of the Crown and Peace.  The bargain was then from their point of view probably a life bargain.  They were chosen, probably, because they were extremely efficient.  In fact, many of them were, so far as the work was concerned, the real Clerks of the Crown and Peace.  I know one or two of these officials who gave their whole life to the work.  While, of course, a pension could not be claimed, they certainly had employment for life under the old régime.  These men are still there, and they are naturally nervous as to what is going to happen to them.  I do not <Col N="571" /> know if they would be entitled to get any compensation.  Some of them are also extremely nervous that they will be turned out of office at the age of fifty-five.  The Minister, I think, said that was a mistake.</P>

They were appointed without any promise of a pension, but on the understanding that if they did not misbehave themselves their employment was for life. It depends now whether they will be re-appointed or not.  The Minister, I think, stated that if there was nothing against them they would be reappointed. That will probably reassure them until they receive further information. It will also reassure them as regards the age, to know that they will not be turned out at fifty-five.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Sub-section (1) of this section shall not apply to any person who immediately before the commencement of Part III. of this Act holds the office of district court clerk under the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923 (No. 6 of 1923) or, in the Dublin Metropolitan Area and in the County Borough of Cork, the office of chief or other <Col N="574" /> clerk of the District Court in that area and borough respectively, and no such person shall be an existing officer or servant for the purposes of this section.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2) to insert after the word &ldquo;employment,&rdquo; line 29, the words: &ldquo;with tenure not inferior to his present tenure.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tenure of the present officers of the High Court is not the ordinary tenure of the civil servant.  The 65 rule is never applied to them.  Their appointments have been for life, so long as they were fit to do their work. Though the Bill does not definitely say so, it may be inferred that it is intended to apply the 65 age limit.  If so, it would be an infringement of the tenure of existing officers, many of whom entered the service after competitive <Col N="575" /> examinations for which the age limit was 30 years.  As it requires 40 years to qualify for a full pension it would seem to follow that candidates 30 years old at the date of the examination might expect to remain at least to the age of 70, if they are to get a chance of attaining their full pension.  The full pension is about two-thirds.  I hope the Minister will give the amendment favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole underlying principle of this Bill, and its whole object, has, practically, been to define the tenure of court officers as being the same tenure as every other civil servant&mdash;that is, the pleasure of the Executive Council.  It sounds no doubt a flimsy thing, but the Deputy knows in fact that it is a real and a solid thing.  But the people for whom the Deputy is speaking are not satisfied with that.  They asked instead for a tenure not inferior to the present tenure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question arises, what is their present tenure?  I venture to say that in the case of a great many of them the Deputy could not tell me, and the officers themselves could not tell me, but I am to give them by this Bill a tenure not inferior to their present tenure.  They do not know what their present tenure is, and I would not be in a position to find out in order to give them the equation of it.  I am not simply playing with the idea.  It is a fact that in the case of a great many officers serving in the courts no man, whether on or off the Bench, could say what their present tenure is.  Under this Bill they will have the same tenure as the entire civil servants of the State, but I cannot undertake to give them some indefinite thing that would be different, and that might be said to fall under the description of not being inferior to their present tenure, which is unascertainable.  Under the Judicature Act of 1877, for instance, the tenure of certain officers is described as being such that they may be removed by the person having the right of appointment to the office with the approval of the Lord Chancellor for reasons to be assigned in the order of removal.  The person having the right <Col N="576" /> of appointment to the office would be hard to find, and the Lord Chancellor would be still harder.  It is not possible to say in any precise terms what is the tenure of those persons who were appointed under the Act of 1877, with that proviso attached to their appointment. I could not undertake to make any discrimination between the tenure of court officers under this Bill, and the tenure of the civil servants who serve in the various departments of State, and it is a very substantial tenure, as everyone knows.</P>
    <P>Certain well-defined exceptions to that were arrived at in response to certain protests from the Judiciary.  The principal officers are given nominally and theoretically a stronger tenure than Civil Service tenure; that is, the concurrence of the Chief Justice or the President of the High Court, as the case may be, would be necessary as a condition precedent to their removal. There were considerations urged in favour of that, but it was not regarded by me as adding anything in fact or practice to their tenure, because a civil servant would never be removed for reasons that would not command at once the concurrence of two judges. It was thought fit to make that necessary in the case of ten or a dozen principal officers down in the Courts, and I had no hesitation in assenting to the idea that they would not be removed without the concurrence of the President of the High Court or the Chief Justice, but there is no reason for extending that to the court staffs generally, and there is no reason for discriminating as between the tenure they shall have as from the date of the operation of this Bill and the tenure, say, of the Secretary to the Executive Council, or any of the other civil servants who are serving in State departments. That is simply my attitude to the amendment.  I cannot accept it, and if I were unwise enough to do so, then I would find it very hard to arrive at a tenure not inferior to some of those officials in the courts, for I do not know what that tenure is.</P>

      <P>This is a very little brother of Deputy Dr. Hennessy's amendment.  It seeks to provide for the position of the existing servant who is, say, serving on a scale of salary rising from £400 to £600 a year, and who has reached the £500 mark.  Under the Bill as it stands he might be offered a post of which the maximum salary was £500, and he would thereby suffer some loss in his expectations.  I do not think the Minister intends that, but I do think that the acceptance of this amendment would help to prevent some of the existing staff taking their pensions and going.  I think it is fair and equitable that they should have not only the same salary they have at present when transferred, but also the same prospects of promotion.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>There is a certain family likeness between this amendment and its big brother, as Deputy Cooper said.  It is an unnecessary amendment.  The words &ldquo;salary carried by the position&rdquo; would only mean in the context the scale of salary in any case where there is a scale.  Take, for example, the case of an officer in the scale of from £700 to £900 a year, by increments of £25, and let us suppose that he happens to be at the point of £775 at the time when this Bill becomes law, then the salary carried by the position might be £700 by £25 to £900, and not £775 as the figure that would remain.  The latter is merely the officer's salary at the particular moment of change from one system to another.  The Parliamentary draftsman, I may say, fully agrees with this view, and, in fact, is inclined to oppose the amendment on the grounds of unnecessary verbiage.  He has no doubt as to the effect of the words in the Bill, but if the Deputy would like me to make assurance doubly sure, I would like to be able to tell him also on Report that that is the view of the Attorney-General.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) provides that any existing officer shall be offered employment under &ldquo;this Act analogous to and carrying not less salary than the situation held by him as such existing officer or servant at the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  The question may arise as to whether the new situation which is being offered is, in fact, analogous to the situation which is being superseded. That question has to be decided.  The proposition in the amendment is that the question as to whether the new duties are analogous to the old shall be decided in the case of the Supreme Court by the Chief Justice, and in the case of the High Court by the President of that Court.  I do not know whether there is any real objection to that.</P>

      <P>I think that any officer who is lying awake at night wondering just what kind of fight he can put up on the question of analogous <Col N="579" /> duty, had better cut the thing short and decide to go before the new system comes into operation.  I would not accept this amendment at all.  We will abide by the terms of the Bill as it stands, and offer to each man who comes over into the new judiciary system, analogous duties, so far as conveniently may be, but we simply will not have the position in which it will be open to any man to argue, except in an informal administrative discussion, as to what are and what are not analogous duties.  If every such question had to be referred to the President of the High Court or the Chief Justice, as the case might be, the position would be simply intolerable&mdash;people remaining on with their Article 10 terms in suspense, and with a view to seeing what kind of duties they might get, and then running to one or other judge to haggle over the question as to whether those duties could be considered analogous or not; in other words, coming into the new system to see how they would fare and with the very full intention of bolting out in case things did not go just so, and not otherwise. That frame of mind is not any use, and people who have that frame of mind should not stand upon the order of their going, but go at once.  The judges, to put it on no other grounds, would find it a very considerable infringement of their official hours if, for six months following on this Act coming into operation, they had to listen to high constitutional arguments on the question of whether the duties which this man was asked to perform in the new system could be said to be analogous to those which he performed in the past.  It is not really a sound or feasible proposition simply to say that there should be an appeal to the two higher judges of the courts from the administrative decision to put A. B. at such-and-such a work.  If any man is gravely troubled about this question of analogous duties, my advice to him is to cut it short, and to go at once, because we are not going to listen to very much talk about analogous duties under the new system to those under the old.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether there is any likelihood of any considerable <Col N="580" /> number taking the hint of the Minister to retire under Article X, in view of his statement.  The emphasis on duties suggests to the Minister that it is the duties that may come from day to day that are in question; but what is intended by the amendment is that the situation under the new regime may be analogous to the situation under the old regime and that the situation carries a certain general assigned body of duties.  I think it is not an unfair proposition that there should be an authority named which will state that such a position under the new conditions is analogous to the old position, and is carrying certain duties in one case as in the other case. I feel as a matter of fact that there is an inherent weakness in the case I am putting forward if it is represented that this is purely an administrative function, that the assignment of duties is administrative and that consequently it is not the business of the judge.  That is not the case put forward by the Minister and he has rather argued as though the proposition was that the duties that may come forward day by day or month by month would be referable at somebody's instance to the judge.  Certainly that is not the intention, but I think, on the other hand, there is a question as to who is to decide whether one position is analogous to the other, and that, I think, should be considered.</P>

      <P>This sub-section deals with the rights of those existing servants who accept fresh employment under this Bill, who, in other words, instead of taking any pension to which they may be entitled, are prepared to carry on in office.  The section as it stands preserves any rights under the Treaty, but some of those officers in the courts have rights also under the Judicature Act, and my amendment is intended to preserve not only rights under the Treaty but rights under the Judicature Act.  It may be that the Minister will say that it is too wide.  If so, I am willing and anxious to have it restricted, but I do think on the whole, even at the cost of being told that it is unnecessary verbiage, that the principle of it is a sound one and that we should try to reassure existing officials as far as we can and get them to renew their services instead of going on pension.  Unnecessary verbiage costs something, a certain amount of printing and a certain amount of paper, but it does not cost us as much as the pension of one official who might be retained, if his alarms were allayed.  I hope the Minister will take the amendment into sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>I have some doubt as to the idea underlying the Deputy's amendment.  I do not know whether it is sought to cover possible rights under the Constitution as well as the Treaty, or rights under the Act of 1877.  My advice is that the provisions in the Judicature Act of 1877 applied only to persons who were prejudiced by that Act or by changes immediately pursuant to that Act.  The only rights that we acknowledge as existing amongst these officers are their rights, whatever they are or whatever they may be found to be, under the Treaty.  That being our view, on two grounds, therefore, I am not inclined to accept the Deputy's amendment.  The first ground is that I am of opinion, and am very definitely advised, that these officers have no rights arising from the Judicature Act. <Col N="582" /> My second ground is that we acknowledge such rights as they may be found to have under the Treaty.  We acknowledge no rights attaching to them by virtue of legislation in the distant past, prior to the Treaty.  On either count I would have to take the position of being against the Deputy's amendment.  I think that if these officers look for competent advice they will find that it will coincide with mine and that they have no such rights as they seem to think they have arising from the Judicature Act.</P>

I suggest to the Minister that the narrow line of legality is not the wisest line to pursue in a matter of this kind where there are people who are frightened&mdash;rightly or wrongly frightened&mdash;at the effects of this Bill when it becomes an Act.  The Minister wants, as he said on Second Reading, to avoid swelling the pensions fund.  I suggest it might be desirable to do a few things that may appear to him unnecessary.  If his belief that the Judicature Act does not apply to these officials at all is correct, it is unnecessary but it does no harm. It would be better to go a little distance to allay fears and suspicions rather than turn down every safeguard and every proviso that seems to safeguard, even if it does not effectively safeguard, existing officers.  I would suggest that.  I accept the Minister's view, reinforced as it is by legal authority and expert knowledge, as the official view; but I suggest even if that is so it is far better from the point of view of safeguarding an overburdened pensions list to go a certain distance to meet fears and remove them.  I do not believe the insertion of the words &ldquo;under the Judicature Act of 1877,&rdquo; if the Minister is prepared to insert them, would do any harm.</P>

The Treaty is something that both parties understand and there is no question but that any of these officials who decide to take the abolition of their office literally and refuse to come under the new system will get their rights under the Treaty.  But to complicate the thing by a reference to the Judicature Act of 1877 in face of the advice which I have that that Act confers no right whatever on them, does not seem good business or good legislation.  I would be simply making myself a party to a farce if I were to consent to write into this Bill a reference to possible rights of these officers under the Judicature Act of 1877, in face of the authoritative advice I have that they have no such rights.

      <P>I beg to move Amendment 82 (a) which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>82a. In sub-section (3) (d) after the word &ldquo;paragraphs&rdquo;, line 51, to insert the words &ldquo;in the case of any officers whose age at the passing of this Act, shall not exceed 45 years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Clause (d) as it stands in the Bill seems to be inconsistent with the foregoing three paragraphs unless it is intended to apply to officers who may look forward to many years' service. Probably that is the intention but if it is so it should be stated definitely. Otherwise, when the Bill becomes law, officers with only a few years' service before them might lose the benefits of clauses (a), (b), and (c), and have clause (d) enforced against them.</P>

      <P>The position I would have to take with regard to the Deputy's amendment is simply that I object to writing it into the Bill.  We are unwilling to bind ourselves by an Act of the Oireachtas in a matter of this kind.  It is possible that certain officers, the Taxing Masters, for instance, and the very senior officials will be allowed to have their Treaty rights cease and kept in suspense during their re-employment.  But in that matter we consider that every case must stand on its own merits.  Many men of more than 15 years' service in the courts have got no promotion so far, and will be only too glad to waive their Treaty rights in view of the abolition of the patronage system which has kept them as junior clerks for possibly 20 to 25 years.  I am not simply standing flatly against the principle of the Deputy's amendment, but I am objecting simply to binding ourselves by statute in the matter.  Certain very senior officers and people in the position, say, of the present Taxing Masters, might be considered to be entitled to have that concession applied in their cases. But the reactions of any wide application of that would be bad, administratively. I think it ought to be left simply as a discretionary matter as to the extent to which it would be applied.</P>

      <P>Here again I am treading in Deputy Dr. Hennessy's footsteps, and I am afraid these footsteps will lead me to the lion's den, because the principle in my amendment is very much the same as the principle in his amendment.

I am not enamoured of 15 years or 45 years of age, but I do not want a large number of senior officers going on pension. I do want, if possible, to persuade them to accept service under the new system for the sake of saving a pension, and also for the sake of retaining a certain number of experienced officials, and not starting absolutely fresh with new men or with men whose services have been only in very junior ranks.  I would therefore put it to the Minister, if he could give any shadow of an undertaking to meet the apprehensions felt by senior officials, he would be making his Bill a more workable Bill.</P>

      <P>Reading through some of these amendments I almost expected to come on one providing that under the new judicial system no one should speak unkindly of a court officer because he might, unless he got that guarantee, be inclined to rush out under his Article X rights.  Now, we must have a little give and take.  No one wants to see an exodus of court officials under Article X.  Equally, starting the new system, we must be careful to start right and not allow unsound provisions or unsound principles to creep in, and my problem is, on the one hand, to see that officers get every reasonable assurance, in the event of their deciding to come along into the new system, and, on the other hand, that they do not exploit their Article X position to extract unreasonable terms. If the Deputy wishes, I can have another look at his amendment and at Deputy Dr. Hennessy's amendment, with a view to seeing whether it is possible or proper to insert anything to meet the idea underlying these two amendments.</P>

      <P>This Bill's predecessor has had a rather chequered career.  I do not know exactly what the relationship of this Bill to the other would be, if we were to attempt to describe it.  The Bill of nine months ago, which became an Act, made provision for legalising what was a pretty general understanding, and a definite agreement, regarding shop hours in Dublin.  It was felt that a way of preventing the development of a dispute between employers and employees would be to make legal what was, in fact, an agreement between the principals affected by the threat to open for longer hours on a Saturday than had been the custom.  There was, by that Act, the prevention of a very considerable dispute, and the assistants in the trade felt that they were protected, at least for a time.  A few months afterwards there comes forward from the employers, or a section of them, in the trade a demand for an amendment of that Act.  Almost before the Act has had time to prove its value the Dáil is asked to make an amendment, and the Dáil agrees to do so; the Dáil goes out of its way to tell the affected persons that legislation tending to help shop workers is not going to be considered of much account by the Dáil, and that it is prepared to play ducks and drakes with its legislation in so far as it affects the working hours in shops and the hours of the assistants in those shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have attempted to prevent the passing of this amending Bill, believing that it was necessary to stabilise for a time at any rate the existing situation, but the determination of the Dáil in their treatment of the immediate predecessor of this Bill seems to have convinced the Dublin assistants in the drapery trade that it is no use for them to rely on legislation: that legislation <Col N="591" /> in regard to shop work and hours and shop assistants is something that is not to be relied upon.  They appear to think, and have come to the conclusion, that it is better for them to rely upon what is known in trade union circles as the industrial arm; that is to say, they are prepared rather to use their power as trade unionists, to rely not upon legislation but, if necessary, upon a strike.  That seems to be the position that the Dublin drapery assistants have come to mentally, and they are saying by inference that they are not asking the Dáil any more questions on this matter, but if the Dáil prefers to precipitate disputes, well, the Dáil will be held responsible.  With that knowledge I am not moving these amendments, and it will be for the Dáil to decide at a later stage of the Bill whether, in face of that prospect, they are still desirous of amending the Act of last year in the direction indicated in the schedule to this present Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is largely self-explanatory. Under the provisions of Section 72, sub-section (5) of the Local Government Act of 1925, when a local authority is dissolved it becomes necessary to hold an election within three years of the date of dissolution.  The Dublin Board of Guardians was dissolved on November 21st, 1923; the Dublin Corporation on May 20th, 1924; and the Cork Corporation on October <Col N="593" /> 30th, 1924.  Accordingly, if there was no amendment to the existing legislation, it would be necessary to hold elections for these different bodies on 21st November in the present year in the case of the Dublin Guardians, in the case of the Dublin Corporation on 20th May, 1927, and in the case of the Cork Corporation on 30th October, 1927.</P>
      <P>The position is that there is a Poor Law Commission investigating the whole position with regard to the administration of poor law relief.  That Commission will not conclude its labours for some considerable time. There is also a Commission dealing with the question of city government with particular reference to the City of Dublin. I expect that Commission will shortly be in a position to report, but as regards the Greater Dublin Commission it would, if anything, complicate the present position, which is itself sufficiently complicated, to have a new election of the Dublin Guardians, and so far as I can gather from the Poor Law Commission, there is not any great likelihood that they will recommend a revival of the old guardian system for the administration of poor relief.  A new election for the Dublin Guardians would cost on the 1922 basis about £4,000, and for the Dublin Corporation it would cost £5,000.  That would mean an expenditure of about £9,000 to have an election of bodies which, in their present state, are not likely to be kept in office for any considerable time, and the position in regard to Cork is somewhat similar.  There is no Commission inquiring into the position of Cork, but I expect the views of the Greater Dublin Commission will have some bearing on that subject, and it is very likely that the Cork Corporation will not again be revived, at all events, in its former state.  For these reasons, it would be impolitic and unwise to have elections for those bodies at this particular time, and, accordingly, I am asking the leave of the Dáil to pass the present Bill to relieve it from the obligation of these financial commitments and going to this unnecessary trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister had given us some indication of what is in his own mind regarding the future form of local government.  We are <Col N="594" /> only in April, 1926.  While it may be true, as the Minister points out, that the election to the Guardians of the Dublin Union is due, in November of this year, the other two elections are not due until May and October of next year.  I would imagine there was plenty of time to enact legislation in respect to future local government between now and then and that this Bill is premature in respect to Dublin and Cork, whatever may be the case regarding the Dublin Union.  The Minister has let fall, whether with deliberation or not remains to be seen, that the Commission dealing with the administration of Dublin and the surrounding areas is engaged in the problem of discussing city government as though it were its function to inquire into the general system of city government, and that its recommendations regarding Dublin will have effect as respects Cork, Limerick, Waterford and other cities.  I did not understand that it was the intention of this Commission to deal with the general problem of local government in respect to towns and cities and I say that we might have had, on the Second Reading Stage of the Bill, some views from the Minister as to the position taken by his Department on this general question of the future government of towns and cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good deal being said in favour of the Commissioner system. It seems to be forgotten, by those praising the Commissioner system, that so far as the public or the Dáil even is concerned, possibly so far as the Minister is concerned, but I am not sure, the Commissioners are entirely irresponsible. They may be responsible to the Minister but that kind of responsibility to the Minister is not helpful to the public. It may be said, and is said, that the work of the Commissioners has been eminently successful.  Much of the work that has been done by the Commissioners in Dublin has been simply to carry out schemes that had been adopted and were ready for carrying out under the régime of the Corporation.  While I have not the slightest intention to cast any doubt on the integrity of any of the Commissioners, I say that the system <Col N="595" /> that is being praised so highly whereby a Commissioner is set up to administer public affairs with no responsibility to the citizens and nothing educative in citizenship, is one that ought not to be pressed beyond what is purely an emergency, and ought not to be continued for one week longer than the emergency requires.  I agree that the question of civic administration requires a great deal of consideration and reform and that there is something to be said for the Commissioner or the city manager, but the Commissioner or the city manager ought not to be set up as a law unto himself, responsible only to a Minister for Local Government who has no responsibility for the direct administration of the city over which the Commissioner rules.  The situation that we have and that we are asked to continue for the year 1927, possibly until 1929, is one that may be justified in immediate results.  It may or may not be, but there have been instances, of a not very distant date, when men of very great capacity who have had the highest confidence have proved not reliable, and no matter how honourable and honest a man may be, when you place him in a position of absolute power and irresponsibility as the Commissioners are, the risk is run and no one in the city can say that they could have stopped any wrong if they had tried.</P>
    <P>The whole power and responsibility lie with the Commissioner, and I maintain that it is a position which we ought not extend one week longer than the necessities of the case require.  I, therefore, think that it would be better for the Minister to bring forward his proposals regarding the future methods of local government, so that there would be no necessity to extend the period during which the Commissioners are in authority beyond the time set down in the Act, in so far as it refers to the boroughs of Dublin and Cork.  I recognise the necessities of the case regarding the Dublin Union inasmuch as the expiry period is November of this year, but I think it is undesirable that we should extend it beyond May, 1927, in the case of Dublin, and October, 1927, in the case of Cork.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that <Col N="596" /> there are, at least, possibilities that the future local government system as affecting towns and cities will be in operation before the end of next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister comes with a Bill to continue in operation the transition arrangements that have been brought about in Dublin and Cork.  I do not think that anybody will appreciate more than business men what the Commissioners have done towards relieving the burden of rates which press so heavily on their shoulders.  I think they have administered the affairs of Dublin in a very creditable way, and have given general satisfaction.  I think, also, that there will be a very large consensus of opinion among responsible citizens that, pending reorganisation, the present arrangements should be continued, but I do not think that the bulk of the citizens will contemplate the continuance indefinitely of the present position.  If I may say so, the uprooting process, generally speaking, that has gone on in the country has created a state of apathy, and I think the greatest possible service that could be done to the country would be to get a revival of civic and national spirit among individuals throughout the country.  That applies, I think, particularly to the city of Dublin to-day.  It is, in my opinion, necessary for the Minister, or the Ministry, to give a lead to public opinion on this question as soon as possible, so that people can consider the whole question from their own standpoint before legislation is introduced here.  I think that this House is very often legislating in advance of public opinion, and that makes it rather difficult for the ordinary citizen to take as much interest in the proceedings here as he would take if he felt he was more interested in the initiation or trend of legislation than he is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the bulk of the people are at the moment disinclined to form definite opinions on this subject of the reorganisation of civic services.  I do not think that members of this House ought to blame them, because it is a case of the old order changing. Nothing, however, has been put forward before them in a concrete form to take the place of that which has been <Col N="597" /> knocked down.  The longer that continues the more difficult it will be to get people to take an interest in reconstruction, which must, of necessity, take effect at an early date.  If we are going to have civic administration of the areas involved in this Bill, the people will have to get back to a sense of personal responsibility in connection with it.  Take the case of the Commissioners. They hold a meeting.  They bring forward something that has been decided. When that is put into operation the people say that it is working well, but they do not take any personal interest in the initiation, or in the discussion of the pros and cons of the subject that is going to be dealt with.  I do not know whether the Minister has come to any particular decision.  I think he said that he is waiting for the report of the Greater Dublin Commission. What that Commission is going to contribute towards the problem is, of course, a matter that is not publicly known, but I think that whatever is in the mind of the Minister, or of the Ministry, on this matter, ought to be made public as soon as possible, and considerably in advance of any legislation that may take place in connection with it.  I may say that the reason that the Commissioners have been so successful in Dublin has been that they found a state of affairs which was not very creditable to the old Corporation. That Corporation was elected on a franchise and had a constitution which would not, I think, be acceptable to the people with any reawakened sense of their civic responsibilities.  What is going to evolve out of the position that has been created by the election of Commissioners?  I think that if any guidance could be given on that matter it would be generally welcome.  The Minister asks for a continuation of the Commissioner system for a further period which will run for a very considerable time.  If the Minister gets that extension of time I will be very much concerned in what would probably happen, and that is that the extension of the period would delay the urgency of the problem with which I think the city of Dublin is at present faced.</P>
    <P>It may be quite reasonable to continue the Commissioners as they are <Col N="598" /> by a mere flourish of the pen, for another couple of years, but there ought to be, coupled with that, a statement that within a reasonable time we are going to know what is going to arise out of the change that has taken place.  We must begin a new civic life in the city of Dublin, and we ought to know what general principles are going to underlie the legislation that is to alter the state of affairs that existed in the past.  That is important, not so much as a matter of information to the Dáil, as a matter of information to the citizens.  It is of importance that the uncertainty that confronts them should be dispelled.  They should be able to look forward clearly.  At present there is no looking forward. The sooner we know how the rebuilding of our civic organisation is to be set about the better for ourselves.  I take no exception to the renewal of the powers of the Commissioners within any reasonable limits, but if it is to be simply a case of postponing a definite and urgent problem, I think this procedure will not serve its purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the point raised by Deputy Johnson, I do not know if, in my opening statement, I gave reason for arriving at the conclusion that the Greater Dublin Commission was set up for some purpose other than finding a solution of the problem of Greater Dublin itself.  What I meant to convey by what I said was that the eventual decision, or finding, of the Greater Dublin Commission will be based on evidence which will help us in finding a solution, also, for the problem of the City of Cork and for other cities in the Free State.  In regard to the Dublin Commissioners, I think I made it clear, originally, that this was merely an emergency solution.  At the time, we had not any sufficient data to devise a permanent form of government for the City of Dublin.  Instead of carrying through hasty legislation&mdash; a thing we are often accused of here&mdash; we decided that it would be much better set up a Commission and have the whole matter investigated.  That investigation is at present being carried out, and while the matter is sub judice it would hardly be the proper thing <Col N="599" /> for the responsible Minister to state what his views are.  At the same time, I think the Commissioners in Dublin and the Commissioner in Cork are rather anxious that the whole responsibility for carrying out decisions should not be left on their shoulders. I think all of them would welcome some kind of buffer, in the shape of a popularly elected body, between themselves and public opinion.  A person placed in such a responsible position is naturally very sensitive to public opinion.  I am not in a position to anticipate what the views of the Greater Dublin Commission will be and I do not know how far we can base legislation on any decision arrived at by that body.  But there is no danger of this system of government being left for an undue length of time in operation. I think, when we have all agreed that it is necessary to seek those powers for the continuation of the present system of administration of the Dublin Union, there is no reason why we should postpone taking similar powers for continuation in office of the Commissioners of Cork and Dublin until we have time to bring in some form of permanent legislation.  Deputy Hewat recommended that, after we have arrived at some deliberate and considered policy, we should give time for that policy to sink into the minds of the public before bringing forward legislation. If we have to wait for the Commission to bring its report in, if we have to fashion legislation, guided by that report, and give the necessary time for any publicity that we consider desirable in order that the policy may sink into the public mind, it will be seen that we are not asking for an undue length of time in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the case of the shooting of John J. Murphy of Killenaule, by Free State troops on the 9th August, 1924.  The facts in connection with the case are as follows: A crowd of young men were collected in a playing field in the village of Killenaule, <Col N="601" /> in the County of Tipperary, on 9th August, 1924.  These young men had been practising for a hurling match, that was to take place the following day at Cashel, for the Junior Championship of the County.  Having finished their practice, they collected together for the purpose of discussing the formation of the team.  It was getting towards dusk at the time.  Suddenly they found themselves fired upon, and this young man, John Joseph Murphy, fell dangerously wounded.  Apparently, two shots were fired.  Murphy was hit and his thigh-bone broken.  I believe the same bullet that hit Murphy hit also a young man named Keane.</P>
      <P>As soon as the shot was fired the Free State troops rushed to the field shouting &ldquo;Hands up.&rdquo;  These troops were divided into two bodies.  One the main body, was on the road, which adjoins the field, and the other body apparently, was on the other side concealed behind a hillock.  The body behind the hillock consisted of an officer and two men, and all indications went to show that the bullets were fired from behind the hillock.  Murphy was taken to the Cashel Infirmary and remained there for three months. Keane was sent to Steevens' Hospital. Murphy at first was unfit to be removed for treatment to Dublin, but, after three months in the Cashel Infirmary, he was sent to Dublin and had to be operated upon there again.  His leg had to be rebroken and reset and he suffered considerable pain and was in hospital for a long time.  Eventually, he was sent home to Killenaule. I have seen him myself and I would say he is almost permanently disabled One of his legs is shorter by several inches than the other.  The boy is in delicate health and I think the bones of his leg have not yet become strong enough to let him walk about with case.  He is walking about now with the aid of two sticks.  I took the question of compensation up with the Department of Defence, and, after a great many questions and letters dating from August, 1924, to about a month ago, the Minister wrote stating that an ex gratia grant of £150 had been made to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may mention that a Court of Inquiry <Col N="602" /> was held in Thurles shortly after this event happened and witnesses from Killenaule were called there, it is believed, but the result of the Court of Inquiry was never published.  No information was given to me with regard to the Court of Inquiry and later on, in December of the same year, a Courtmartial was held upon the officer, Lieutenant Poole.  Apparently, the Lieutenant was not found guilty of negligence, and was not punished in any way.  At least, we have had no intimation that he was found guilty by the Courtmartial and, so far as I know, the findings of the Courtmartial were never published.</P>
    <P>All the evidence tends to show that this was simply a wanton action. There was not the smallest possible occasion or justification whatever for it.  I call attention to the fact that this occurred in August, 1924; it did not happen in 1922 or even in 1923; it happened in 1924, when the condition of the country was perfectly peaceful and when there was no indication that there was any kind of irregular action on the part of these men or that these men were connected with the Irregular movement.  These young men were steadily practising the game of hurley: the Gárda Síochána knew of the position, and had seen them at play.  It was well known that the gathering was for the purpose of playing hurling.</P>
    <P>There were stories in connection with the action of the military, at that time, to the effect that they were not sober, and that they were not in a fit condition to understand what they were doing.  I assume that evidence was given at the Court of Inquiry and the Courtmartial.  I have only got the story from the point of view of the people of Killenaule.  But the actual shooting indicates that the men were not in full possession of their faculties at the time.  Personally, I can see no justification for the shooting.  I made inquiries from prominent people, and all the stories confirmed the accuracy of the statement made to me by Murphy.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that Murphy is completely disabled and likely to be invalided for life, and that he was a smart, capable young man with good <Col N="603" /> prospects, I think he deserves greater consideration.  At the time he was shot, his passage had been paid to America by an uncle, and he was waiting only to get his place on a ship to take him there.  He had got his passport, and all the formalities were completed. So far as going to America is concerned, his whole future is spoiled owing to this shooting.  I consider there was no justification whatever for this act, and I think that the Ministry ought to have dealt more generously with this young man than it has done. I think it should deal as generously with him as with any young man in the Army who suffered permanent disablement, because of accident or disability occurring during service in the Army.</P>
    <P>I believe Murphy has ground for taking a legal action against the Minister for Defence just as any citizen would have grounds for taking an action against another citizen who inflicted injury upon him, but this is a poor boy with no money to expend on fees to solicitors and counsel.  He has been put to expense in connection with the injury he suffered to a greater extent than the whole of the ex gratia grant.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this case, and to make a much more generous grant of compensation to this young man.  I believe, if it is to be at all adequate, it must be greatly in excess of the amount already granted.  I believe Murphy has refused to accept this money, and I believe he was advised by prominent people in Killenaule not to accept it.  I hope the Minister will give this matter his most careful and sympathetic consideration, with a view to a very considerable increase in the amount of the ex gratia grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also appeal to the Minister to reconsider this case, as I know something about it. No later than a week ago I was speaking to this man Murphy, and in my opinion he will be a cripple for the remainder of his life.  At the time that this outrage occurred I understand he was a fine young man and, as Deputy Heffernan has said, he had good prospects.  Now his whole life has been ruined by this outrage, <Col N="604" /> because it was no less than an outrage and a blot upon the name of the National Army, that any officer with any sense of responsibility should order his men to fire upon a crowd who were hurling in a field without any warning, particularly, as Deputy Heffernan points out, as this occurred in 1924. There might be some excuse for it if it had occurred in 1922 or early in 1923, but in August, 1924, there could be no excuse for it.  It was a very serious matter, because the second man who was wounded is still in hospital.  The two men are poor and have been put to considerable expense.  As a matter of fact, Murphy has spent a good deal more than he has been offered on medical and legal expenses.  His whole life is ruined and he cannot take up any employment. Up to the present he has been maintained by his people but unfortunately his father died within the last month or so, so that he really has no prospect before him.  I think there is an obligation on the Department of Defence to do all in their power to repair the injury that has been done. There is no question that this man, or any of those who were in the field at the time, had any connection with the Irregular movement, or were in any way hostile to the State.  On the contrary, I am informed that they were supporters of the present Government. I appeal strongly to the Minister and the Government to treat this man not generously, but fairly and justly, because he certainly has suffered a great deal and will suffer for the remainder of his life.</P>

I understand that the Lieutenant and a private soldier who was with him were arrested immediately after the occurrence by the <Col N="605" /> Gárda Síochána and on the rifle being examined it was found that there were two empty cartridge cases in it.

      <P>The cartridge case would, naturally, be thrown out by the bullet.  Probably one of the cartridge cases was found in his possession. It is not claimed that these two men were shot by separate bullets.  I believe it is the fact that they were shot by the one bullet.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I am admitting all that.  As to the question of the injury to this man's leg, unfortunately it is short.  Deputy Heffernan says it is several inches short.  As a matter of fact, the report of the doctor states that his leg is one inch short.  I do not want to make much or little out of this case.  From the information in my Department, and from information supplied to us from other sources, the reason for this shooting was that information was conveyed that drilling was going on in this area almost every night within that period.  Representations were made to the military that they should proceed to the area and find out if that was the case.  They were accompanied on the occasion by members of the Gárda Síochána.  When they arrived at this field they found these men there&mdash;innocently or otherwise, probably innocently.  Their actions, however, did not tend to show that they were there with an innocent intent.  When called upon to halt, instead of standing their ground as innocent men should, they proceeded to run away.  They were called upon to halt; they did not halt, and one shot was fired, with the unfortunate result that these two men were wounded.  As a matter of fact, there were two courts of inquiry held into this affair.  One was the ordinary local court of inquiry, and a month or two afterwards a second court of inquiry was held by headquarters officers who had no interest in the matter at all.  The officer in charge was tried by court-martial <Col N="606" /> and found not guilty of the charges made against him.</P>
      <P>I have taken the precaution to look into this case personally, and, taking into account the manner in which similar cases have been treated and what this man would get, for instance under the Workmen's Compensation Act, or any of the other Acts passed for awarding compensation in case of injury by accident or otherwise, I came to the conclusion, after due deliberation, that £150 was reasonable compensation.  I do not say that the man was over-compensated. What I had to consider was what was reasonable compensation, and that is as far as I can go.  The recommendation was sent to the Department of Finance, and after some little hesitation it was sanctioned, the result being that a cheque was sent about a month ago for the £150.  Deputy Heffernan says that that sum will not be accepted.  It is an <i>ex-gratia</i> grant. We do not admit that any action lies against the military in this matter.  The case was submitted to the Attorney-General and his opinion was that an <i>ex-gratia</i> grant should be made.  That <i>ex-gratia</i> grant was made on the terms which I have set forth.  I deplore this accident, but I think that reasonable compensation has been given, and I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by re-opening the case. There are other aspects of it which I do not want to enter into, as regards the state of his health and his family history, and all that.  I believe that, taking everything into account, he was reasonably dealt with.  I do not say that he was lavishly dealt with, but reasonably dealt with, and I cannot see my way to re-open the case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey has stated that the other man, Keane, is in hospital at present.  That case is not before me. Certain payments were made in his case and we have not heard any more about it.  He was out of hospital at that time, and I am not in a position to say whether he is now back in hospital. If Deputy Morrissey says he is I accept his word.  He was out of hospital when certain payments were made to him and we have not heard anything from him since.</P>

Could the Minister say if the members of the Gárda Síochána who were present agreed that these men were called upon to halt?  My information is that the first intimation which the men, who were in the field engaged in selecting a team for a hurling match on the following day, got was when the shot was fired; that they were never called upon to halt and that they did not know that the military were within a hundred miles of them until the shot was fired.</P>

      <P>To my mind it conveys no such thing.  There was nothing to hide.  Courts of inquiry held by the military are not usually open to the public.  Sometimes, when there is something of public interest going on, if the Press representatives request admission to a courtmartial, they are admitted.  In the ordinary way the Press representatives are not invited.</P>

      <P>I could understand this thing happening in 1922 or 1923, and I would not grumble, but, when it comes to August, 1924 I think the time is ripe for a public inquiry, so that the public can judge for themselves.  I cannot understand how this could occur, except it was due to the allegations Deputy Heffernan made, that these people were drunk.  I have no doubt in my own mind as to the condition they were in.</P>

I wonder what expense this man was put to, and how far £150, which was offered, will go to recoup him for the expenditure?  I heard about this matter when it occurred.  I do not know what expense the family of this man was put to.  One thing is certain, and that is that a bullet wound passing through the body is different to any other wound.  Nervous and other complications will arise from a bullet wound that would not arise as the result of an ordinary accident.  The after-effects of a bullet wound are different to the effects of another accident, Limbs after other accidents can be reset and nervous trouble is never heard of.  After a bullet wound it is usual to have muscle or nervous complications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister about the position of the Army authorities on this courtmartial: is it the case, following shooting on a <Col N="610" /> crowd by a group of soldiers in time of peace, where a man is killed or wounded, that the only operation to take in regard to the legitimacy of the act is to have a courtmartial?  If that is all, is that courtmartial open to the public, and are all the witnesses and interested persons notified of the fact that there is to be a courtmartial?  To me it seems curious that there was not a civil charge preferred and a public trial.  The question of representation of the injured man by counsel in this case, or of his friends, or others, seems to arise at once and I think a good deal more consideration ought to be given to a case of this kind.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister whether a man named Thomas Nolan, who appeared at the first inquiry, or at least offered evidence, was asked to give evidence?  He maintains that he saw the soldiers before the firing, but he was not called to give evidence at the courtmartial.  I also want to know if a publican's wife who was able to give valuable evidence, but who was unable to do so owing to the condition of her health at the time, was called?  I also want to ask the Minister if he can give any information as to what medical evidence he has with regard to the physical condition of Murphy?  From my own knowledge of the man, I should say that he is in a very poor physical condition.  As the Minister has mentioned family disease, is it not possible that a disease of this kind would be aggravated by the wound?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>And by the suffering and the consequent state of health of this man?  I also say attention ought to be called to the point regarding the legal aspect of the case raised by Deputy Johnson.  I think that is important.  There is no justification for military in time of peace firing on citizens, even though they were suspected of being an illegal organisation. In this case it is acknowledged they were not engaged in illegal movements at the time of the occurrence.  I think the manner in which the case has been dealt with is unsatisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the discrepancies between the statements by Deputy Heffernan and Deputy Morrissey and the Minister's information I suggest that a further inquiry should be held so as to ascertain from the Gárdaí and eye-witnesses of the outrage what did happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Gárdaí who brought the military there in the first instance, and before they went to the field the military went to the barracks for the purpose of verifying reports that were made to them about drilling going on in the district.  If it were not for the information they got from the Gárdaí they would not be there at all.  I am not disposed to hold a further inquiry.  Two inquiries and a courtmartial have been held.  As I said, the Department tried to make amends for the incident.  I have looked carefully into all the evidence, and taking into account the compensation that has been given in similar cases during the past three or four years I came to the conclusion that the compensation in this case was reasonable.  I admit it was nothing extraordinary, but it was reasonable, and I do not think the Department should be asked to give anything more than reasonable compensation, or such as might be given under the Workmen's Compensation Act. This man was partially dependent on his father at the time.  He was an ex-R.I.C. man and, I think, a school attendance officer, and his income was about £100 a year.  It was stated this man was a grocer's assistant.  I have not seen him, and I do not know whether he is able to follow his previous occupation or not.  My information is that the injured leg is an inch shorter than the other.  I admit he is not in good health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that it was a deliberate act.  If these men had stood their ground as innocent citizens no accident would have happened.  If they had halted when called upon, no <Col N="612" /> shot would have been fired.  If it could be proved that a body of innocent men were there, and that the military just went into the field and opened fire on them, then I say they should be dealt with severely, but here is a case where drilling was going on in the area.  The military were requisitioned to go and they went there.  They found a number of men in the field, and they called on them to halt, and these men, when called upon, ran away.  One shot was fired, and that shot, unfortunately, struck two people.</P>

Will he recognise that in the absence of such an inquiry, a doubt exists in the mind of everybody that the details as given by the military are not the facts?  It would be a good thing for the Department and the Army if the facts were made public.  I am sure the Minister, as a sensible man, will recognise that a cloud of suspicion envelops the matter inasmuch as the public has not had an opportunity of seeing the evidence on both sides.</P>

I suppose it is not the responsibility of the Minister for Defence to initiate a trial of his own servants but it is the responsibility of some authority which is represented on the front Bench opposite.  I cannot quite understand how it comes that an inquiry of this kind should be merely a courtmartial, and, as has been pointed out, which was not public and with very little knowledge of who were to be called as witnesses.  The public will require some protection in such a matter.</P>

      <P>I might say that if the allegations made here are true and that the Gárda Síochána did arrest these people, they could have brought them to justice in a public court but the military held their own inquiry under their own law.  If the Gárdaí found that these men were engaged in an illegal act and that they acted in the manner which has been described here, it was their duty to bring them before the civil court.  Admittedly they had no case to bring and there was no prosecution brought.  The result was that the military dealt with their own people as they always do. If the civil authority stepped in, they have just the same right to prosecute <Col N="614" /> a soldier publicly as any other member of the community.</P>

The question of increasing the Dungarvan Harbour dues was first raised in a letter from the Solicitor to the Urban District Council, dated 4th November, 1925. That letter was replied to on the 9th idem detailing the necessary procedure. Since then the Solicitor states that the Clerk of the Council and the Harbour Master have been engaged collecting the requisite particulars. The formal application for a Temporary Order under the Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1920, was forwarded by letter from the Solicitor, dated 20th instant, and the particulars supplied with that letter are being examined preparatory to the application being forwarded to the Rates Advisory Committee for a report in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>

    <P>4 <i>(i)  Officers Already Established</i>&mdash;207.</P>
    <P>These were promotions of officials who already held Civil Service certificates, but in whose cases fresh certificates were necessary because the appointment of the individual was not in the customary course of promotion, <i>e.g.</i>, the case of a member of a departmental class such as a Post Office Sorting Clerk and Telegraphist promoted to a general service class such as that of Lower Executive Officer.</P>
    <P Just="Center">4 <i>(ii)  Oireachtas Staff</i>&mdash;30.</P>

    <P Just="Center">4 <i>(iii)  Congested Districts Board Staff</i>&mdash;92.</P>
    <P>These certificates were issued in respect <Col N="484" /> of clerks who had been serving in the late Congested Districts Board and who when that Board was abolished became established Civil Servants.</P>

    <P>These certificates were issued in respect of persons who, following the change of Government, were transferred from the British and Northern Governments to fill posts requiring knowledge and experience which could not be acquired outside the Civil Service.</P>

    <P>Certificates issued in the public interest under Section 6 (b) of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924.</P>
    <P Just="Center">4 <i>(vi)  Miscellaneous</i>&mdash;19.</P>
    <P>This includes certificates issued in respect of persons in whose cases promises of establishment made before the change of administration had to be honoured, and persons, <i>e.g.</i>, widows employed before marriage as certificated Civil Servants, who have been reinstated in established vacant posts in the grades in which they were formerly employed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notices of every appointment or promotion to which the above figures relate are duly published in &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil,&rdquo; and these notices state whether the certificate has been issued as the result of competitive examination or otherwise.</i>
