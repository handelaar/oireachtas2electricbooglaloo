      <P>asked the President what steps, if any, the Executive Council has taken to assert the right of the citizens of Dublin to have restored to them the thirty-nine French paintings left to the City of Dublin by Sir Hugh Lane in the holograph codicil which it is now admitted expressed the testator's intentions in their regard; and what steps it is proposed to take to counter the intentions of the British Government in carrying out the recommendation of the Committee which reported on the matter.</P>

      <P>The matter of the Lane Pictures was raised with the British Government by General Collins on the 22nd January, 1922, a little more than a week after the formation of the Provisional Government.  From that date onward representations were repeatedly made to British Ministers that these pictures should be disposed of in accordance with Sir Hugh Lane's last wishes.  Ultimately, as a result of these representations, the Rt. Hon. J. H. Thomas, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, informed the President in July, 1924, that the British Cabinet had decided to appoint a Committee of three to consider the arguments advanced by the Irish Free State and the Trustees of the National Gallery in London and to report whether in their opinion:</P>
      <P>1.  Sir Hugh Lane, when he signed the codicil of the 3rd Feb., 1915, thought that he was making a legal disposition.</P>
      <P>2.  If so, whether it is proper that, in view of the international character of the matter at issue, the legal defect in the codicil should be remedied by legislation?</P>
      <P>The report of that Committee was published on 30th June last, and the findings were as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  That Sir Hugh Lane, in signing the codicil of the 3rd February, 1915, thought he was making a legal disposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2178" /> 2.  That nevertheless it would not be proper to modify Sir Hugh Lane's will by public Act of Parliament. To do so would, in addition to constituting a legal precedent of the utmost gravity not justified by the facts, have the effect of bringing about a result contrary to the real spirit of Sir Hugh Lane's intentions. Our reply to the second question is, therefore, in the negative.</P>
    <P>It is only right to say that the Executive Council, through the courtesy of the British Government, were afforded an opportunity of perusing the report of the Committee before it was published.</P>
    <P>The Council felt that the Committee's reply to the first query addressed to them was satisfactory and, in fact, inevitable, but they were quite unable to follow the Committee's method of arriving at the conclusion set out in their reply to the second question.</P>
    <P>Accordingly the President communicated to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs the reasoned view of the Council, that the Committee had, in dealing with this aspect of the matter, failed to realise its international importance and had allowed their judgement to be based upon considerations which were not only outside their terms of reference, but were in themselves unsound and inapplicable.  He urged, too, that it was only by doing violence to Sir Hugh Lane's last wishes as to the destination of the pictures that legislation to validate the codicil could be refused.</P>
    <P>I regret that, notwithstanding these representations, which, I may say, were urged in the strongest possible manner, the British Government did not see their way to depart from the recommendations made by the Committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2179" /> In reply to a question recently addressed to him, the British Prime Minister stated that an assurance had been received from the Trustees of the National Gallery in London that it was their present intention to lend to Dublin a substantial number of the pictures from time to time and for a substantial period, as soon as they were empowered under existing legislation to do so.  For our part, the Executive Council could not accept the view that this proposal meets in any adequate manner the equities of the case, which demand that the collection should be disposed of in accordance with the donor's last-expressed desire.</P>
    <P>I do not quite understand the second part of the Deputy's question.  It must be borne in mind that so far as the strict letter of the law is concerned the codicil is invalid and consequently the return of the pictures depend upon the recognition in a generous spirit of the honourable obligation to respect, notwithstanding legal technicalities, the last wishes of the illustrious dead.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a precedent for the setting aside of a will having regard to the fact that the will of the late Mr. Cecil Rhodes was set aside and modified by law in a manner not in accordance with the testator's wishes, and will he bring that precedent to the notice of the British Government?</P>

The Executive Council has no responsibility for the administration of the Trust, and as regards the particulars desired by the Deputy inquiry might be made at the offices of the Trust.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have received a petition under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, from the Sligo County Council in respect of a small drainage scheme for the Ballaghnatrillick River on the County Leitrim boundary.  The Commissioners have informed one of the petitioners that it will be necessary to present a petition to the Leitrim County Council also, as part of the lands proposed to be improved extend into that county. When this formality has been complied with, the scheme will be given due consideration. This is the only proposal which has been received from the Cliffoney and Ballintrillick districts.</P>
      <P>The existing Drumcliff Drainage District was recently inspected by one of the Commissioners' engineers, and they are at present considering his report, with a view to deciding whether it is a case in which approval should be sought to the carrying out of works of restoration under the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1924.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he has received an application from Miss M.J. O'Neill, Post Office Assistant, Cahirciveen, for the payment of full wages to her during the period of her suspension from duty for eight weeks during the civil disturbances, whether he is aware that this officer only received half-pay for that period, although there was no charge preferred against her, and the military officer who suspended her has admitted there was no justification for doing so, and whether, in these circumstances, he will authorise the payment of full wages to this officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  In deciding to confirm Miss O'Neill's reinstatement in the Postal Service, the Executive Council gave due weight to all the evidence adduced. As regards the question of pay for the period in question, her case had to be considered side by side with many similar ones where suspension under suspicion of complicity had occurred, and it was only after the most careful consideration of all the circumstances of all the cases that I decided to give her half-pay for the period of her absence.  I regret that I am unable to depart now from that decision, and I would remind the Deputy that in effect it ensured the preservation of her full incremental and pension rights.</P>

They are aware that Mr. Coghlan tendered his resignation as secretary to the Drainage Board, but they have no knowledge either that a successor was not appointed or that the board is now dissolved. There is, however, a statutory obligation on the members to continue in office until their places have been filled and to discharge the duties appertaining to that office, and they cannot by resignation relieve themselves from that obligation.  The procedure for the assessment and collection of drainage maintenance rate is set out in Section 57 of the Drainage and Improvement of Lands (Ireland) Act, 1863.</P>

      <P>It is the duty of importers to make proper Customs entry of their goods and to pay down the proper duty at the time of entry.

      <P>Two auctions of a farm at Kilbarry, Co. Cork, were rendered abortive by the action of the South of Ireland Evicted Tenants and Sympathisers <Col N="2186" /> Association.  On the sworn information of the aggrieved party, John O'Brien, chairman; Daniel Hogan, secretary, and Charles Hayes, a prominent member of the Association, were arrested.  Hayes was formerly tenant of the lands but was evicted in 1890, and in 1892 transferred all his goodwill, if any, in the lands to the new tenant on payment of £250.  The State Solicitor conducted the prosecution on the instructions of the Attorney-General. The case was heard in the District Court on the 18th May last, when Hogan and Hayes were returned for trial to the Circuit Court.  Informations were refused against O'Brien on the grounds that although he was chairman of the association which was clearly responsible for the interference with the auction no evidence could be produced to prove that he personally interfered with the auction.  I cannot agree that any injustice was done to O'Brien in arresting him.</P>

      <P>There may have been a lack of detail in the answer setting out the industries which have applied for protective tariffs.  Obviously if I were to sub-divide any of the industries set forth in the list I read into their respective sub-divisions&mdash;the subdivisions into which any of them might <Col N="2188" /> fall&mdash;I could enlarge the list many times over.

As regards those in which evidence can be brought forward, will they be asked to appear before the Tariff Commission and repeat the evidence given on a previous occasion?  I think the Minister mentioned that the Tariff Commission would consider the cases of industries even in which tariffs had been imposed.  Will the evidence formerly <Col N="2189" /> given in these cases be taken into consideration, or must the whole thing be repeated?  Will the industries have to bring fresh evidence before the Commission in order to prove the necessity of a tariff?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy D'Alton, one of the difficulties in connection with an application for a tariff under the old procedure was that an industry made an application and submitted evidence bearing out the need for a tariff; the claim was set out and the case was made.  If the claim were refused it came forward again with the evidence somewhat changed for the better.  That process could, apparently, proceed <i>ad infinitum.</i>  The additional evidence had to be regarded as somewhat suspicious, particularly when it was not brought forward in the first instance.  The position in future will be that industries not tariffed will be regarded as having put forward a case which had not been considered satisfactory.  If they elect to bring forward further evidence, they can do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is that no change has taken place in the policy of the Executive Council regarding the Irish language.</P>
      <P>To part (a), that the provisions of Section 68 of the Railways Act, 1924, are being given effect to by the Great Southern Railways Company.</P>
      <P>To part (b), that I am having inquiries made as to the position at Dunlavin and Lucan North Stations and will send the Deputy the result as soon as received.</P>
      <P>To part (c), that the Gaelic League forwarded me on the 25th May an allegation to the effect stated in the question, and that on 29th June I replied to the League that the allegation was contradicted by the list of 27 stations furnished to me by the Company at which bilingual notices had already been provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To part (d), that the question of printing passenger card tickets for journeys in the Saorstát in both Irish and English has been pressed forward as rapidly as is consistent with a reasonable conclusion.  Section 68 of the Railways Act, 1924, provides that this shall be done unless it would jeopardise the standard revenue and result in increased rates and fares.  A satisfactory form of ticket has been produced, but I am informed by the Company that its cost represents an increase of approximately £1,600 per annum, or <Col N="2192" /> 121 per cent. on the past expenditure.  I am at present having this figure investigated to see if the cost cannot be reduced.</P>
    <P>To part (e), that the letter from the Gaelic League dated 25th May, 1926, was replied to on 29th June, 1926.</P>
    <P>To part (f), that the Company informs me that notices are provided in some of the passenger carriages used on the line of a type to which the provisions of the Act may be considered to apply, but the renewal of these notices does not necessarily arise when the vehicles are passed through the shops.  The space available in such cases may not admit of the exhibition of bilingual notices in a suitable form, and the question of removing all or some of them, therefore, is under consideration. Meantime, notices in both Irish and English do not appear generally in the carriages.</P>

      <P>Under Standing Order No. 25, I understand no question can be altered by An Ceann Comhairle without previous consultation with the Deputy concerned.  I sent in this question in order to get a definite assurance from the Head of the Executive as to what the National Anthem is. I find that it is put down to the Minister for Defence as if it were an Army matter, whereas it is a matter that affects everybody outside the Army.  I think I should have been consulted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I can solve the problem.  The President of the Executive Council is not responsible as a matter of fact or policy for an answer as to what is the National Anthem.  The Minister for Defence can be asked a question regarding the <Col N="2197" /> tunes played by military bands.  The question on the Paper is therefore to the Minister for Defence in regard to tunes played by military bands.  If the Deputy desires to investigate any problem in regard to the National Anthem, he cannot ask a question of the President.  The President cannot be asked to define what is the National Anthem.  It is not part of his functions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that it is stated that a number of highly skilled workmen, female employees, and junior mechanics are to be dismissed from the Post Office factory, owing to the cessation of all manufacturing work in the factory; that this factory is at the present time making large quantities of switchboard apparatus, of a better material and of as good a workmanship and at as reasonable a cost as that purchased from abroad; whether he will state why the only factory in the Saorstát for such work is to be closed down, and if the whole of this work, which would give employment to quite a number of our people, is to be purchased from abroad.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make an announcement to the Dáil with reference to the National Land Bank.  The Executive Council have decided to dispose of the interest of the Minister for Finance in the National Land Bank.  I had occasion previously in the Dáil to refer to the anomalous position of the National <Col N="2215" /> Land Bank and to the difficulty that exists in carrying on such a bank.  As I have already told the Dáil, I had asked the Banking Commission to consider what should be the future of the National Land Bank: whether it should be given new functions, whether it should be continued as it has been carried on heretofore or whether its work should be terminated.  The Banking Commission, in an interim report which I have received from them, recommends that the National Land Bank should be discontinued either by disposal to another institution or by winding up.  Before the matter had been considered by the Banking Commission I received an inquiry from the Bank of Ireland as to whether the Government would consider an offer for the purchase of the National Land Bank.  A reply was given to the Bank of Ireland to the effect that an offer, if made, would be considered on its merits as an offer.  Following that, certain investigations and negotiations took place with the Bank of Ireland, and a conclusion has been reached. The Bank of Ireland have made an offer which seems to the Executive Council to be a good offer, and it has been determined to accept it.  The Bank of Ireland have offered for the interest of the Minister for Finance in the National Land Bank a sum of £203,000&mdash;that is the amount of the paid-up capital of the National Land Bank.  A certain sum of the purchase money, however, to the amount of £13,000, will remain outstanding for a period of three years.  The reasons for that arrangement are that it was felt necessary by the Executive Council to take particular steps to see for certain that the interests of the staff of the National Land Bank were properly safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will have some recollection of the circumstances in which the National Land Bank was started.  It was founded in 1919 principally with the object of preventing the national struggle from being turned into a land war.  It was started for the purpose of making some beginning in the distribution of land which would prevent men who were engaged in the national <Col N="2216" /> struggle from diverting their energies to land activities.  At a later date it was decided to widen the scope of the bank in various ways and to do ordinary banking business: to attempt to get money from the public by deposits, and finally it was decided to start a number of branches.  Now there was no very great success in getting money from the public.  Perhaps that was not strange in the circumstances of the time.  I remember very well that in the case of certain branches prominent people urged us to open a branch. When the branch was opened, the people who had been most urgent in asking that it should be opened gave a very small amount of business indeed to the bank.  The bank came under the suspicion of the British authorities. There were many raids on the Head Office of the Bank, and on the branches of it.  In one case all the members of the staff of one branch were taken out in a lorry as hostages and carried around the country.  The people who entered the service of the Bank, leaving other banking institutions or other posts of substantial value to do so, did take a very considerable step and undertook very substantial risks.  They took steps which make it incumbent on the Government, in disposing of its interest in the bank, to be sure that they are not victimised or let down in any way.</P>
    <P>The Bank of Ireland has agreed that the permanent staff of the National Land Bank shall be dealt with in accordance with the practice of banks in dealing with their permanent staffs; that is, they will have permanent employment without reduction in salary unless dismissed on grounds of negligence, insubordination or misconduct, and they will have rights to pension in accordance with the terms of the Irish Banks Arbitration Award.  That is to say, they will carry over the pension rights which they had in the National Land Bank.  I might say that when the staff entered the employment of the National Land Bank they were given by the National Land Bank credit for the years of service they previously had in other institutions.  Now with regard to any of the staff for whom the Bank of Ireland may be unable to find employment without reduction of <Col N="2217" /> salary, they will receive compensation by way of superannuation allowance equivalent to two-thirds of their salary at the date of the purchase of the shares.  There may be some members of the staff for whom the Bank of Ireland will be unable to find employment. They may be people who came over, in the way I have described, at considerable sacrifice, to the National Land Bank.  It was felt fair that an arrangement should be made entitling them to a pension to the extent of two-thirds of their salaries.  That is more than they would have been entitled to under the Irish Banks Arbitration Award.  Because we felt it necessary that that arrangement should be made, we had to agree that half the cost of giving that particular compensation to those people should be borne by the Government to the extent of an amount not exceeding £13,000, and in order that we may bear half of the expense of giving two-thirds of the pension to those people who may not be employed, this sum of £13,000 will remain outstanding for three years.  At the end of three years this sum of £13,000, or whatever remains of it after having discharged the liability that we are undertaking in respect of these people, will be paid over to the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not have the option.  An employee will have to go over if he is given equivalent employment without reduction of salary. If he is taken over by the Bank of Ireland, of course he will have to go over.  Otherwise, the bill would be very high indeed.  I do not know what sum it would amount to, but, at any rate, it would be very high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether the two-thirds of salary is the standard rate of compensation, or is it based on the number of years' service given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in the case of those who are not taken over by the Bank of Ireland the compensation will be based on two-thirds of their standing <Col N="2218" /> rate of salary.  For the convenience of customers the Bank of Ireland will continue for some time to run the Land Bank as it has been run heretofore. They will undoubtedly at an early stage close the branches in the country, but, as far as the central branch is concerned, they will continue to run it for some time, but a definite period has not been specified.  It will be run, perhaps, for a year, so that there will be no inconvenience.  People who have had accommodation or arrangements with the National Land Bank will have these arrangements continued for a substantial period until they can, if they desire or think it necessary, make other arrangements.  The offer, as I have already indicated, has been carefully examined by officials of mine and by the auditor of the National Land Bank.  Before the auditor knew that an offer was being made he was asked, in view of a statement I made in the Dáil regarding the position, to estimate what would be the selling value of our assets in the National Land Bank, and his report was such that we are satisfied the present offer is a good one, which would give a much greater sum to the Exchequer than could have been realised by liquidating the bank. Liquidation would have been an extremely difficult matter, because the mere disposal of the staff would have meant that great sums would have to be paid out in compensation to the staff.  In addition, it would have been impossible in the case of many customers of the bank to close their accounts without allowing a very long period to elapse.  I do not see how, without causing hardship to customers, the bank could be closed without an interval of four or five years.  Of course, a bank that was being closed would gain no new customers, and it would be more and more a losing concern. I do not see that it would have been possible to get anything like the value of the bank by liquidating it, and I consider that in the circumstances we are fortunate in having got a good offer for the interest of the State in this particular institution.</P>

      <P>May I ask the <Col N="2219" /> Minister if he proposes to give the House an opportunity of discussing this matter before it is finally disposed of, because, apart from all questions of details, surely this is entering on a big departure from national policy, and as such it ought to be discussed?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That advance was made subject to twelve months' notice, so that in order to recover it we would have to give twelve months' notice. Now I am not sure whether we should give that notice.  The £300,000 advance was given in the face of the estimate for the general purposes of the National Land Bank, but it was given primarily in order that the National Land Bank might be able to undertake certain work in connection with the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  The Bank of Ireland were willing under the new arrangement that that work should continue to be done&mdash;the making of advances under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act. There might be some object served in leaving the £300,000 there, otherwise I think the course would be to give notice to withdraw at the end of the twelve months.</P>

Has the Minister put himself in the position of preventing, say, the Bank of England gobbling up the Bank of Ireland as the Bank of Ireland has gobbled up the National Land Bank, and in the way other banking combinations have been undertaken in the last three years?

      <P>I do not quite see the drift of Deputy Johnson's question, but it certainly would be quite easy to prevent further banks from being gobbled up.  When the final report of the Banking Commission is received, a question that will have to be considered is that of banks which are not Irish banks and carrying on business here, and their position, and as to whether, further, banks not registered here should be allowed to carry on.  The whole question of the domicile of banks is one that will have to be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion made by Deputy Johnson is one that I think ought to be carried out.  It is not right that a matter of this importance, involving a change as regards the connection of the State with banking, should come before the House in this manner.  No notice is given of it, and I do not know that the Dáil is even asked for a decision.  We are merely given a statement by the Minister.  My opinion is that a matter so important as this <Col N="2221" /> ought not to be decided by the Minister until he has before him the final report of the Banking Commission and until that report has been discussed by the Dáil.  We expect developments as a result of that report, and some Deputies think that the National Land Bank should be retained, and not absorbed into any other financial institution pending that report, when it may be given other functions to perform.  I suggest to the Minister that, in view of the importance of this matter, action should be postponed until the final report of the Banking Commission will have been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not received the final report of the Banking Commission, but I have received several interim reports within the last two or three weeks.  I know a good deal about the National Land Bank, apart from what may be contained in any report. I am quite satisfied that whatever other functions may have to be carried out, you could not economically transform the Land Bank into a different sort of institution.  It has been organised as an ordinary, small bank, and you could not economically transform it into a specialised institution.  One of the problems that arises is the problem of disposing of branches and branch staffs and that sort of thing. The question of urgency simply amounts to this&mdash;once the question of the continuance of the bank has been raised in any definite way, customers who are desirable and whom the National Land Bank has found it most difficult to get&mdash;the customers who deposit money&mdash;will not come to the institution.  They will not come to an institution which is in danger of being closed down.  The immediate result of the continuance of the bank being in question is that these customers who, to some small extent in the past, have given it funds, will begin to draw off to other banks.  They do not want any arrangement come to, without their consent, as it were, that may disturb them.  They do not want to enter into an arrangement with one institution and find that that institution is being dropped.  We have a certain goodwill: we have an asset of a certain value to <Col N="2222" /> sell.  That depreciates with delay, especially when the question of continuing the bank has been raised.  Delay will most seriously depreciate it, and, whatever price we would get to-day, if we wait six months we will certainly get a lower price.  Then you do cause anxiety and disturbance to customers by leaving the whole matter in doubt.  We have got an arrangement whereby the position of customers is very reasonably safeguarded, and I think delay could only result in making the position generally less satisfactory than it is at present.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister in this matter is treating the Dáil unfairly. While the whole position of banking is under review, and while we are awaiting the final report of the Banking Commission, the Minister proposes taking a step which it may later be necessary to retrace.  The Minister dissents.  He is in possession of the interim reports of the Banking Commission and the Dáil is not.  The Minister is satisfied that his policy is the right policy.  In support of his contention, he says that once this matter of transfer has been dragged into the light of day, business prospects for the National Land Bank will not be satisfactory. What was the necessity for dragging the matter into the light? What was the necessity for the Minister coming forward at the tail of the <Col N="2223" /> session and making this statement on banking policy without giving Deputies an opportunity of considering the matter and without giving the facts which enabled the Commission to make this recommendation?  Is it not likely that it will be found necessary to set up here some institution along the lines of the National Land Bank, as a result of the final report of the Banking Commission? Yet we are to cast away this institution with its staffs.  The Minister has not dealt fairly with the House in this matter.  Whether he is wise as regards the attitude of the State to banking, remains to be proved.  It would be better, I think, if the Minister would defer action pending the final report of the Banking Commission.</P>

Will the directors of the Land Bank be taken over by the directorate of the Bank of Ireland?  Also, I would like to know on what service are the officers of the Land Bank to get two-thirds of their present salary?  It seems that an officer with one or two years' service can now retire on a pension of two-thirds of his present salary.  That is an extraordinary arrangement.  No account is taken of the number of years service.  Information on this and many other matters should be placed in our hands.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask leave to introduce a Bill entitled the Patents Trade Marks and Designs (Validation) Bill, 1926, of which the long title is &ldquo;An Act to declare and establish the validity in Saorstát Eireann of certain British patents and the British registration of certain trade marks and designs.&rdquo;  The important section is Section 2, which, as it is short, I propose to read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every patent granted by the Patent Office in London, whether before or after the passing of this Act, and bearing date as of any day prior to the 7th day of December, 1921, shall have and be deemed always to have had the same force and effect in Saorstát Eireann as it has for the time being in Great Britain whether such force and effect are derived from or dependent on the original grant of the patent or any renewal thereof or any payment of fees, and whether such renewal or payment was made before or after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other sections which do exactly the same thing in regard to trade marks and designs as that section sets out to do in regard to patents. Deputies must have noticed in a case that came before the court recently, a judge of the High Court decided that patents granted before 7th December, 1921, ceased by the setting up of the Free State to have any further force or effect in the Free State.  An appeal has been entered against that decision. The matter is, therefore, <i>sub judice,</i><Col N="2228" /> but if the decision be established as the rule of law which is to operate in regard to patents then it is the view of the Executive Council that there should be legislation to declare the validity of such patents as from the 7th December, 1921, and to declare that with retrospective effect.  This is the proposed legislation.</P>

I do not know what the Minister's intentions are, but to introduce a motion of this kind, giving the Minister's views as to what the law in the future ought to be just at a time when a proposal is before the court and an appeal is being lodged, seems to be deliberately designed to prejudice the court, if possible.</P>

Here the Minister has now told us that this Bill is only of any effect if a decision of the Supreme Court happens to confirm the decision of a judge of the High Court.  If it happens to do so-and-so, then the Minister is going to carry on certain legislative proposals.  That surely is a unique method of procedure in legislation.

      <P>The Deputy must not take us as accepting his view, despite the emphasis with which he states it.  This Bill is based on the existing law as it is found.  If it is found to be otherwise, the Minister states that the Bill will not then be necessary.  Permission is asked to have printed and circulated a Bill which is framed in recognition of the law as it has been found to be.  This talk of waving a flag or attempting to influence the courts or to dictate to them is entirely illusory.  The courts have nothing to do with Bills.  They have quite a lot to do with Acts.  In the event of the law being found otherwise than what it has been found to be and which we must take it as being, unless and until a contrary decision is given, then it is a perfectly proper thing to introduce legislation to deal with that situation.  If it does happen that a contrary decision is given by a higher court the Bill will be then withdrawn, but there is no attempt to influence or dictate to the court.  In fact the very introduction of this Bill shows that we accept the law to be what a court of the State has found, and in the event of its being found to be otherwise, the Bill would be withdrawn.  For the moment we must take it that the law is what it has been found to be in the court.</P>

It is necessary to <Col N="2230" /> have an eye to the business the Dáil will have to deal with when it reassembles in November.  To that end certain First Readings are taken here so that when the Dáil reassembles there will be Second Readings to deal with, and the work of the Session will commence.

      <P>I admit that the Ministers were not aware of the fact: they are in the minority, I think.  It has been generally public property that the law was as it is now stated by Judge Meredith.  Now the Ministers have awakened suddenly to the fact, because of that decision and because of the outcry across the water.  There has been no outcry in Ireland in defence of Irish interests which have necessitated the introduction of a Bill of this kind. There has been an outcry across the water because certain British and other interests seemed to be involved and <Col N="2231" /> consequently on the last day, just by accident on the last day&mdash;we might have finished our work a week ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;we have this Bill proposed to us.  No advantage except to allay the suspicions and fears on the other side of the water will accrue from the First Reading.  No advantage in time will accrue&mdash;nothing but that allaying of feeling by a declaration on the part of the Ministers that this is their view of what the law ought to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended to make the Bill retrospective. I want to find out whether they have any reciprocal proposals from the British side with regard to patents.  For instance, under the present Patent Law, if I am not misinformed, no patent need be valid in the Free State unless steps are being taken by the patentees to manufacture those patented articles in the Free State.  Is that being put into operation? It has not been, and I say that is the <i>quid pro quo</i>, the fact that it has not been enforced.  Those British patentees have not suffered anything. We have heard of this one case.  They may have suffered something, I do not know, but in general British patentees have not lost anything.  Their patents have not been infringed and there has been practically no loss.  Suppose we had enforced our right that no patent would be valid in the Free State unless those articles patented were manufactured in the Free State, which is the present existing law, those patentees would be very much worse off than they are, even though this present state of invalidity prevails.  I say we ought not to make those patents valid unless we are prepared to enforce, in as many cases as possible, the requirements of the existing law that those patented articles should be manufactured in the Free State.  I say the reasons given for the introduction of this measure, even in the First Stage, are not sufficient to warrant the permission, and it is too much like a response to the cries in the British Press. <Col N="2232" /> I think we ought gently to waive them aside and say, &ldquo;You must await our pleasure and the decision of the court to see whether there is any need, even from their point of view, or not.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson has very rightly dealt with this question from the point of view of Irish interests.  I have only a few words to say on this matter.  To my mind honesty is an Irish interest, a reputation for fair dealing is an Irish interest, and these are assets that we cannot afford to throw away to gratify Deputy Johnson's sense of national pride.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to discuss that at considerable length, but not on this Bill.  I am waiting for Deputy Wilson's motion, when I shall be very glad to discuss it.  I think I am the only member in the Dáil who has seen the Lane pictures hanging as they are now, and who has compared them with the miserable way in which we hung them in Harcourt Street.  To return to this Bill, a patent is the outcome of a man's brain and a man's enterprise, possibly not the enterprise of the inventor, but the enterprise of the man who saw it was a good thing and was prepared to invest his money in it.  It is property, if anything is property, and that we should take advantage of our new status to confiscate the property of individuals who have invested their money, and used their brains in order to develop industries, and in order to increase the amenities of life, would, to my mind, be a wrong and a criminal thing to do.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not an authority on theft, but he is quite willing to be instructed.  I am not aware of it.  If there is any case of that kind let it be made before the court, as to whether a patent was stolen or not, but to say that our new status gave us the right to abrogate all patents and rights whatsoever, <Col N="2233" /> taken out before June, 1921&mdash;I do not know if the Dáil is prepared to stand over that.  If they do, Deputies will find themselves in an exceptional State indeed, a State outside all the common bonds of international obligations. I venture to think that the Ministry did wisely in at once giving notice that they were prepared to deal with this matter, not on a narrow or sectional basis, but on an international basis, and that as we, too, use the patents of other countries we will treat them fairly, and we expect that they in return will treat us fairly.  I should be sorry to think that Deputy Johnson should carry a division against this Bill, because it would mean that we would go into the autumn, when we intend to sell the bulk of our produce, with a reputation that would not be an enviable one.</P>

If that is the case, obviously the legislation now proposed is simply carrying into effect international obligations which we already had.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Esmonde has said is quite true.  There is no one in this House who stands up more frequently to uphold the dignity of the courts than Deputy Johnson. There is no one in this House who endeavours to hold up the judges to more public scorn and contempt than the same Deputy.  Imagine the idea of a <Col N="2234" /> judge being asked to decide on the facts whether a certain state of law exists, and going to be swayed by other influences.  If that is the idea of the Deputy I would rather leave him alone in his view of the judiciary.  The Deputy has gone farther and talked about a common point of view, about patents in this country, and that Departments have awakened to things that Deputy Johnson, as advised by the public, knew long ago.  Luckily he has given us an example of how he has been advised. Under the existing patent laws the Deputy says articles must be manufactured here.</P>

Yet, the Deputy holds with the recent decision of Judge Meredith that there is no patent law in this country at all. I wonder is this an example of what the public knows about patent law, and has advised the Deputy, so that he in his wisdom must give it out here? The Deputy talked about waving flags. Again no man can bristle with more righteous indignation at what he calls malpractices than the same Deputy. He has hoisted to-day what must be considered the flag of the pirate, and that is what he wants the Dáil to uphold by his request to refuse a First Reading to this Bill.</P>

The object of the recommendation is to make it clear and certain that a collector of tax can only make an affidavit in regard to (c) or (d).

    <P>Amendments inserted:</P>
    <P>1.  In Section 2 (1), after the word &ldquo;modification,&rdquo; line 33, the word &ldquo;abolition&rdquo; inserted.</P>
    <P>2.  In the Schedule, after paragraph 8, a new paragraph inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To what extent, if any, the imported goods, in respect of which an application is made, are the outcome of unfair competition resulting from currency depreciation, subsidies or bounties.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Dáil agree with the first amendment inserted by the Seanad.  I explained in the Seanad that originally the Bill contained a corresponding word, the word &ldquo;revocation,&rdquo; and that that word had been struck out of the draft because we did not wish misapprehensions and misunderstandings to arise. I do not think that the Bill will suffer at all by the insertion of the word &ldquo;abolition.&rdquo;  The Bill provides that the application either for the imposition, modification, or renewal, or, as it now stands, &ldquo;abolition or renewal&rdquo; shall be made by persons who are substantially <Col N="2239" /> representative of those engaged in, or who propose to engage in, the industry.  So that an application for abolition can only come really from people who are engaged in the industry in respect of which the tariff exists. I think it is somewhat unlikely that applications for abolition will come forward.  There may be applications for modification which may be in the nature of abolition of part of the duty or the duty on some particular class of goods, but for complete abolition of the tariff, I think it is not likely that any application will come forward.  If people engaged in the industry do think an application for abolition ought to be made, there is no reason why they should not be able to make it.  The amendment would have to be resisted if it enabled persons other than those engaged in the industry to make application for abolition, because the effect of the application and the hearing would be to discourage the development of industry and the investment of money in it.  As the Bill stands I contend that this amendment will do no harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister has overlooked one possible outcome of this proposal, and, in view of the argument he has put forward in favour of accepting the change, I think if he realises the risks being run, he will hardly press his motion to accept this change.  I have in mind, for instance, firms, say, engaged in the chocolate or in the boot trade who have hitherto been, and are now, supplying the greater portion of these classes of commodities consumed in this country. Let us take the chocolate trade.  The bulk of that trade in Great Britain is in the hands of three firms.  They may suffer in some little degree from the tariffs.  So they have to overcome it by some method.  They are persons engaged in the industry in Great Britain, and they may propose to engage in production in the Saorstát.  They put forward as a counter proposition that this duty should be abolished in so far as it affects chocolates.  They could argue before that Commission that the cost to the community of the tariffs might be <Col N="2240" /> excessive as compared with the advantage they would be able to give if the duty were abolished.  From the point of view of the consumer and from the point of view of the British trader or manufacturer who wants to supply Irish consumers I have no doubt they could make quite a good case.  At least they could produce a claim under this section for the abolition, and I do not see how it could be repelled, if they justified their statement that they were proposing to engage in production, provided the plea for abolition did succeed. The same thing might well happen in regard to, say, the boot trade. That has been given as an illustration of one of the good effects of the tariffs in so far as the development of the boot industry is concerned.  But I think it has been stated here that perhaps ten per cent., or it may be five per cent., perhaps, of the total consumption of boots is yet and will, for some considerable time, be the proportion of Irish manufacture.  One, two, three or half-a-dozen firms may propose to engage in the production of such boots in the Saorstát under certain conditions. But being persons who may propose to engage in production in the Saorstát they put forward proposals and they would say that it is far better for the public that you should abolish this tariff because they would say: &ldquo;We can supply you more advantageously from our own British factories.&rdquo; They would put forward that case. They would claim to be able to put forward a case of that kind and under the proposed amendment it would be very difficult to refute it.  If that is possible under the amendment then what becomes of the contention that the Minister has put forward with great force that it is not fair to legitimate enterprise that they should under the promise of a tariff, enter upon production when within two or three years it may be said: &ldquo;Well, here you have a section in your Bill which allows the proposal for the abolition to be seriously argued before your Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told frequently that that is undesirable, that there should be some security, at least for a few years for those manufacturers who have entered on production.  Under <Col N="2241" /> this proposal it will be possible for people who are not yet manufacturing, but who would propose in certain circumstances to manufacture, to argue that it is more advantageous to have the tariff abolished than to start manufacturing in the Free State.  The insertion of this word will destroy much of the case that has been made in favour of the sub-section, and, particularly, the statement made by the Minister that, inasmuch as the proposal is confined to those who are engaged in manufacturing, they, therefore, will not be desirous of seeking the abolition. I point, as against that, to the section which says that persons proposing to engage in manufacture may make such application.  If they may make application for abolition you cut the ground under the feet of those already engaged in industry, and who have risked their capital investments on the promise of the Minister that a proposal for abolition will not be considered for eight or ten years.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider the point that it materially weakens that section, as it will allow big competitors under the cover of promises&mdash;perhaps legitimate intentions&mdash;to undertake manufacture here, and under that promise to put forward a counter-proposition to the Commission to abolish the tariff altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would not regard such an application as <i>bona fide,</i> and I would think that that would be one of the cases in which the Minister ought to exercise his discretion by not submitting the matter to the Commission at all.  I think that you must assume that you will deal only with <i>bona fide</i> applications of people who intend to conduct the manufacture of their goods here, and who desire the tariff only because they would sustain losses, in the first instance, which would be too great to enable them to carry on if they did not get the tariff.  The particular ill results that Deputy Johnson fears could arise without the word &ldquo;abolition.&rdquo;  If an application, such as he describes, were to be entertained it would be possible to ask for a modification of the tariff.  If a firm, on those conditions, could make an application <Col N="2242" /> at all&mdash;for instance, a modification of the boot tariff to a farthing a pair&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If not a modification to that extent, say, to the extent of twopence a pair, and in that case you get the same ill results.  I think the only way that the hypothetical case which Deputy Johnson has put forward could be met would be by recognising that it was not a <i>bona fide</i> application, and by turning it down on those grounds.</P>

      <P>The new words which I propose are to the same effect as those inserted by the Seanad, but they fit in with the Bill.  The words of the Seanad are: &ldquo;To what extent, if any, the imported goods in respect of which an application is made...&rdquo;  Applications are not to be made in respect of imported goods but in respect of industries.

That would be undesirable inasmuch as the ordinary bookmakers who carry on their business in a legal way would be subject to the tax, whereas the other bookmakers, owing to the Bill not coming <Col N="2244" /> into operation, would escape the tax.  This amendment provides that an application to the Superintendent of the Civic Guard for a certificate of personal fitness shall be approved and countersigned by two Peace Commissioners, and that an advertisement in, at least, two newspapers circulating in the district shall be inserted.  I do not think that the publicity and the extra formality required by this amendment will achieve any useful purpose.  On the other hand, I think that any inconvenience that may result from the amendment will be greatly less than the inconvenience that would result from having the Bill held up for a period during which the betting tax would fall on bookmakers who carry on their business in a way that is legal at present.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Seanad in Amendment No. 2.&rdquo;  This is an amendment which further eases the situation for bookmakers who may have been convicted of any crime.  As the Bill originally stood, the ground of objection to the registration of a bookmaker was that he had committed an offence under this or any Act.  It was felt that the words &ldquo;under any Act&rdquo; were much too wide.  As Deputy Johnson pointed out, it might mean that a man, convicted of playing football on the streets, might be disqualified, and we inserted the words &ldquo;under any Act relating to gaming or gaming-houses.&rdquo; In the Seanad it was pointed out that many people who might have been convicted in the past under an Act relating to gaming or gaming-houses might be trusted under the new conditions of the law to observe it in future.  The amendment was passed providing that a bookmaker should be disqualified under the Betting Act, or under any Act relating to gaming or gaming-houses, provided the offence was committed after the passing of the Betting Act.  I think this is a reasonable amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in view of the continuance of widespread unemployment amongst all sections, the Dáil is of opinion that the condition that preference must be given to ex-National Army men which is attached to State grants for road and relief schemes should be discontinued forthwith, so as to allow local authorities to give a preference to unemployed men with dependents whether or not they have served in the National Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this motion I think it well to state at the outset that it has not been drafted in any spirit of antipathy to unemployed ex-National Army men, because I have as much sympathy for unemployed ex-National Army men as I have for any other class of unemployed worker.  I put this down in the interests of fair play to all classes of unemployed workers.  The Dáil will, <Col N="2246" /> I think, realise that at the present time we are in the midst of an unemployment crisis which is perhaps the greatest within living memory.  We have all round us thousands of unemployed with no means of sustenance or with inadequate sustenance.  In any case the unemployed workers are suffering from that poverty and destitution which inevitably follow in the wake of idleness.  It seems to me that our business as the national legislative authority ought to be to do the best we can for all our unemployed workers but that if there is to be any suffering, if one class more than another is going to suffer, that suffering ought to be apportioned to the capacity of the unemployed to bear it.  Our aim ought to be to endeavour to save the weakest, to endeavour to confine as much of that suffering as possible to those who are, comparatively speaking, better able to bear it than others.</P>
    <P>In this respect I want to say that the condition imposed by the Government on State grants for road and relief schemes is not calculated to help the weakest or to save the weakest.  Rather is it calculated to give a preference to people who are better able to bear poverty and the suffering which is inevitable in the case of unemployment, while visiting all the punishment, all the suffering and all the evil effects of unemployment on others who are least able to bear it.  The Government condition of preference for ex-National Army men is capable of applying in this fashion.  A grant, we will say, is made to a certain local authority with this condition imposed.  The local authority receives the money and immediately it is known that this money is available for any scheme there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of applicants for work.  The local authority is anxious to do the best it can for all those who are unemployed, and in particular for those of the unemployed who have dependents.  Under the conditions imposed by the Government it has to give a preference to ex-National Army men, with the result that an unmarried ex-National Army man, who has perhaps his father, or brothers or sisters working, is entitled to a preference over a man with a wife and four <Col N="2247" /> or five children, who has no source of income or no means of sustenance whatever.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Dáil that, much as it may sympathise with the case of the unemployed ex-National Army man, that sympathy should not be carried to the extent of giving a single ex-National Army man a preference of employment over a married man with a wife and a few children, without any source of sustenance whatever.  The Minister for Finance has intimated on a number of occasions that he recognises that this preference could not go on for ever.  He said that last year. He indicated it recently again, and I think it is time that the Government should take a definite decision on this matter and decide to withdraw that preference so as to enable local authorities to give preference to unemployed men with dependents whether or not they have served in the National Army. This motion is framed so as to avoid any suggestion of bias against ex-National Army men.  It is possible if the motion is carried, and if the preference mentioned in it instead of the present condition is applied, that in State grants for road or relief schemes the unemployed ex-National Army man who has dependents would be entitled to as much consideration as any other unemployed man with dependents.  In other words, local authorities would be able to look at the matter in this way: &ldquo;Here are a number of unemployed men with dependents; here are a number of single men or men with no dependents, and we consider that in this crisis we would be doing justice to the weakest and the most needy if we gave a preference to the man with dependents over the man who has no dependents.&rdquo; That is the position stated simply.  I think when this preference has gone on for two or two-and-a-half years, perhaps three years in some cases, that the Government ought to decide that it has gone on for long enough and that some consideration ought to be given now to the claims of unemployed workers with dependents, whether or not they have served in the National Army.  I put it to the Government that this discrimination against <Col N="2248" /> people who have not served in the National Army is not fair.</P>
    <P>The money from which these grants are made is raised by general taxation. It is not raised by taxation on ex-National Army men, and, therefore, I do not think it is fair for the Government to utilise money which they receive in general taxation for the purpose of subsidising, or giving preference to, ex-National Army men: in other words, to subsidise one section of the community on the taxes collected from the community as a whole.  At this stage, I think there is everything to be said for the abolition of the condition which attached to the grants I have indicated, and for the substitution of a fresh condition enabling local authorities to give preference to men who have dependents, if necessary ex-National Army men, but above all, to men who have dependents above the men who have no dependents.</P>

      <P>I beg to second Deputy Norton's motion.  There is not very much to be added to what he has said.  I have expressed the view pretty frequently that there must be a termination of the regulation which insists that preference be given to ex-members of the National Army.  I have urged frequently that the true method of selection and the true line of preference should be of those who have dependents: those who are in the greatest need of employment.  I have said, if you like, to take the case of ex-National Army men with dependents and put them first.  If that is done, I have not the slightest objection.  To act fairly and equitably you should, before you give preference to unmarried men, take men with dependents, whether they have served in the Army or not.  Deputies can quite readily understand that this sort of thing has happened: that men who have been in the National Army have claimed preference on successive jobs, while men with families who were not in the National Army and who might even have been more fitted physically for the work to be done, and certainly having a greater claim upon public funds of this nature for employment, have been successively superseded, the <Col N="2249" /> preference being given to the ex-National Army men.  That is to say, that the man with the family has been continuously unemployed, while in front of him there was the unmarried man without a family more or less continuously employed.  That is quite possible and it has happened.  I urge upon the Government that there must be a limit to that preference, and that the occasion has now arrived when that limit should be fixed.  Following up Deputy Norton's statement, I have no objection whatever, as I have said, to first preference being given to ex-National Army men with dependents, but if there is to be a second and a third preference, then the second preference should be given to the man with dependents, whether he has been in the National Army or not.  I think that the case made is one that cannot be controverted, and the only question that arises is as to the period in which this present regulation should be modified and a new system of preference adopted.  I urge that that period has now arrived, and that it ought to take place forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Norton and Deputy Johnson will agree with me in stating as a general principle that at the outset when these men were demobilised from the National Army&mdash;a great number of men were demobilised with very little warning and without any prospect of getting employment, men who had made great sacrifices and placed themselves in a relatively worse position for getting employment than people similarly situated in order to perform very useful and necessary services to the country at a critical time&mdash; they were entitled to preferential treatment of a very considerable character. That was our policy at the time.  We have given them that preferential treatment, and in doing so we have only done what every other Government has done in a similar position.  We feel that our attitude in that respect was justified, not merely because these men had a special claim to consideration from us, but also by reason of the fact that in many cases there was a strong prejudice <Col N="2250" /> against giving them employment. In very many places it was almost impossible for them to get employed in work on the roads or on relief work generally.  All through there was considerable latitude allowed to the local authorities in this matter.  Where there was an accommodating spirit shown by the different parties, there was no difficulty about adjusting a proportion of the men out of the National Army and men who were not ex-service men in the matter of employment.  It was only in cases where we were up against irregular authority or where you had gangers who were prejudiced against giving employment to ex-National Army men that we had any real trouble.  As time has gone on, and as ex-service men have become assimilated with the ordinary working population, we have relaxed in enforcing this measure, but we still feel that the ex-service men are entitled to preference, and in order to secure them that preference and to save them from being victimised by people who may have prejudices against them, we think it is necessary to continue this provision in force.  As I say, we are not enforcing the restriction as rigorously as in the beginning.  I should say that there is not very much difference between the attitude of the Government in this matter and the attitude that has been pointed out by Deputy Johnson.  We feel as regards ex-Army men with dependents that they are entitled to very special consideration, and that they should certainly be placed in a position by themselves.  We would be inclined to put ex-Army men who may not have dependents on a level with working people who have dependents.  That would be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that some people have an exaggerated idea of the number of ex-servicemen who are getting employment under these grants.  There is another point I would like to make and it is this: that there are very few ex-servicemen in permanent employment on the roads.  I have some statistics here from the various counties from which I propose to make some quotations. I find that in the month of May the total number of men employed in the northern division of the County <Col N="2251" /> Cork on road maintenance was 120. In that number there was not a single ex-service man.  As regards work under the grants, there were 40 ex-service men employed out of a total of 118.  In the month of June the number of ex-service men employed on permanent road work was 2, while the total number was 53.  The number employed under grants was 60 out of a total of 190.  In March of this year, in the same county, the number of ex-service men employed in road maintenance was nil, while the total number of men employed was 213.  The number of ex-service men employed under the grants was 38, out of a total of 324.  The number of men employed under the Corporation in Dublin in June was 517 on road work.  The number of demobilised members of the National Army employed out of that number was 57.  On the whole, the average works out very low&mdash;I think something like seven per cent. of ex-Army men employed on road work altogether.  It is in order to preserve these men from victimisation more than anything else that this particular proviso is here.  On a few occasions it was necessary to adopt very stringent measures to get ex-Army men employed on the roads at all.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister make a statement embodying in a new circular what he has stated is more or less the practice?  I take it that one or two councils may interpret the original circular very much more rigorously, and the effect would be to exclude from employment men who are entitled to it.  The Minister has given certain figures which go to show that the original circular is not being adhered to.  I do not know whether he intends it to lapse.  I have no objection whatever to applying rigorously a preferential employment scheme for ex-National Army men with dependents. If that is not happening at present, then I think it is the fault of the local authorities.  Will the Minister embody his suggestion&mdash;men with dependents, first, ex-National Army men, and secondly non-Army men, shall get preference&mdash;in a circular to <Col N="2252" /> the local authorities who are getting relief grants?</P>

      <P>I would like to say, in connection with the Minister's reply, that while the new type of condition which he has outlined is some advance on the present condition, still I do not think it quite meets the position. I do not think it is any answer to the case I made, that it was a hardship to employ unmarried men without dependents while there were applicants who happened to be married men with families.  If the Minister insists on the condition that ex-National Army men with dependents should get first preference, then I am quite prepared to agree to that if he will indicate that he is prepared to agree that men who are not ex-National Army men and who have dependents will get second preference, and relegate all people who have no dependents to the third place.  The Minister has conceded something, but if he limits the concession to what he has already indicated it is of very little use in getting down to the bedrock of my case, that it is a hardship that a man with dependents should be deprived of work while the man with no dependents should be given it.  I put it to the Minister that he should reconsider the matter with a view to giving a man with dependents who has not served in the National Army a chance of employment after the ex-National Army men with dependents have been given a first chance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, in connection with State grants; it depends altogether on what the objects of the State grants are.  If the State is giving <Col N="2253" /> money in connection with the roads it is not, I take it, State money, but money out of the Road Fund, and with the particular object, I presume, that the local authorities shall expend that money to the best possible advantage. If you are going to tell the local authorities whom they should employ and what they should do in connection with the administration of money, even Government money, I say this House is taking up a position of undue interference, and taking away from the local authorities responsibility for getting work done properly and efficiently. I protest against this laying down of regulations which mean making inquiries as to whether a man is married and has dependents, and things like that, in connection with the carrying out of administrative work which ought to be carried out on the best and most economical lines.  If you are going to say to local authorities in connection with grants, or the spending of their own money, who is to be employed on a particular job, you are not going to get efficient results.</P>

He is speaking on the motion which asks for the discontinuance of the condition that preference must be given to ex-National Army men in connection with State grants for road and relief schemes.

The Deputy is making the point that this is taking away a certain autonomy from local authorities.  It is with regard <Col N="2254" /> to money the local authorities get from the State or the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat made a point, and I tried to explain the position.  With regard to Deputy Norton, I do not think he realises how far he is going to do harm to the people by insisting on any rigid order being laid down for the employment of men at all.  So far as there has been a condition attached to certain grants, what the Minister for Local Government has said reveals clearly how far that condition has been rigidly insisted on in this connection.  The Minister has outlined a certain future grading; that ex-National Army men with dependents should rank first, that where previously ex-National Army men without dependents ranked, or were supposed to rank, prior to non-Army men without dependents, those two classes should in the future stand on the same footing, and that non-Army men without dependents should rank last.  That is a very fair approach to what Deputy Norton has in mind.  If the Deputy takes into consideration the figures the Minister has quoted showing how far the old condition has been adhered to, I think he will find that he has been met in the greater part of his desires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask Deputy Norton and Deputy Johnson not to ask that there should be any circular sent out giving, say, three definite orders in which people should be recruited for work, because, up to this, I do not know a single case of a grant in regard to which the number of ex-National Army men with dependents was exhausted before approach was made to non-Army men, whether they had dependents or not.  It has never been our attitude that you must absorb every National Army man, even with dependents, before you proceed to recruit from other groups.  It would be imposing a condition that would be far too rigid and that would, in fact, not be carried out, if we were to insist on a certain specific grade of precedence. I think Deputy Norton should not insist <Col N="2255" /> on that, in the interests of the people for whom he is speaking.  What the Minister for Local Government stated is, I think, a fair approach to what the Deputy has in mind.  In general, the Minister said that the line of approach would be ex-National Army men with dependents; then non-National Army men with dependents and National Army men without dependents&mdash;those latter ranking about equally&mdash;and non-National Army men without dependents ranking last.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2256" />&ldquo;That the Dáil hereby approves of the Rules of Court made by the Minister for Justice on the 13th day of July, 1926, under Section 31 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 (No. 10 of 1924).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These rules are submitted for the approval of the Dáil under Section 101 of the Courts of Justice Act, emphasising the fusion of the former system of separate courts for equity and for common law provided for in the Act. The former separation and division of jurisdiction was productive of delay, of a certain amount of expense and of uncertainty to suitors, and, accordingly, new rules have been drafted containing detailed proposals for uniformity of practice in all matters in the High Court and for expediting proceedings and avoiding unnecessary delays. In addition to provisions contained in the Court Officers Act, 1926, referring to the amalgamation of establishments, other means of simplification and economy in staffing are introduced and more specifically dealt with, in particular as to the institution of the Central Office.  One common form of originating summons for instituting proceedings or an action in any branch of the courts is provided, with the condition that the party issuing such summons in any case in which he is not entitled, as a matter of right, to a jury, shall mark on the face of the summons &ldquo;non-jury.&rdquo;  Generally speaking, that will apply to all proceedings except actions of tort, such as negligence or libel actions.  The times prescribed for taking the various steps in bringing an action to trial have been lessened, and if any party is anxious for an expeditious hearing in a defended action there is no reason now why the action should not be ripe for hearing within one month from the initiation of the proceedings.  The former practice of allowing one year to any party to appeal from a judgment caused needless delays and often the loss of the fruits of the judgment to which the party was declared entitled. The period of one year has, by Order 25 been shortened to 21 days.  Within 21 days, the unsuccessful litigant has to decide whether or not he will appeal against the decision of the court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2257" /> The procedure in appeals from the Circuit Court is dealt with in Order 24. Some inconvenience has been caused by the considerable number of such appeals awaiting hearing, amounting to one thousand or thereabouts.  It is hoped that the delegation to the Master of the High Courts of minor judicial cases will somewhat relieve the High Court Judges and allow more ample time to deal with these appeals.  The rules, following the recommendation of the Judiciary Committee, fix the long or Summer Vacation to commence on 1st August and to terminate on 30th September.  This change will give some 16 extra working days.  In Order 35, a provision has been inserted for enabling law funds to be invested in certain new securities.  Consequently such investments are made trustee securities. The following are the new securities&mdash;4½ per cent.  Land Bonds; 5 per cent.  Compensation Stock, 5 per cent. Dublin Port and Docks Board Stock, redeemable 1962/1985.  In reference to the Schedule of Costs in Appendix 2 attached to the Rules, these matters refer to costs in litigious cases and do not include costs to solicitors under the Solicitors' Remuneration Act, 1881. The costs and fees payable to solicitors in respect of business transacted by them in the High Courts were increased by an Order dated 28th June, 1918, by the addition to the then existing scale of an amount equal to 25 per cent., and by a further Order dated 1st July, 1920, the costs and fees payable to solicitors in respect of business were increased by an addition equal to 50 per cent. in respect of the original prescribed costs.  The scale now suggested is, with some few alterations, the scale of charges fixed in 1905, with the addition of 50 per cent. to each item. It represents as nearly as possible the same scale of fees as was chargeable by solicitors prior to these rules coming into operation.  I may say that the scale of costs in connection with the High Court and Supreme Court is considered reasonable.  That is all I wish to say by way of introduction.</P>

      <P>Do chur mé leas-ruin sios do na Riaghlacha so. Since the first copy of the rules appeared very necessary changes have <Col N="2258" /> been made in Orders 29 and 30.  We have now to use the rules as they stand.  I see that in Rule 2 of Order 29, in the case of all summonses the notice shall be served personally in the Gaeltacht, etc. But the Gaeltacht has not yet been defined, and it will require an Act of the Oireachtas to define it.  That is the only rule in which the word &ldquo;personally&rdquo; appears.  It does not appear at all in Rule 3 in regard to summonses, and these summonses and notices may be served in any part of the Saorstát upon any person and if in Irish may be accompanied by a translation in English. So that from the beginning the the Irish language is going to be placed at a disadvantage until such time as an Act is passed by the Oireachtas defining the Gaeltacht.  It also seems a bit strange why the word &ldquo;personally&rdquo; is used in Rule 2, but not in Rule 3.  The Minister may be able to give an explanation as to why it does not appear in that rule.  I hope the Minister will make a statement as to whether it may be possible to have legislation introduced defining the Gaeltacht.  It is very important that the Irish language gets its proper place in the courts from the very beginning.</P>

      <P>With regard to the statement made by Deputy O Maille, I wish to say that my attention has been called to the necessity in this Order 29 for ensuring that there shall be no delay in the translation.  One could imagine that delay in the preparation of the translation would nullify a good deal of the effect of the Order.  I leave that question of the use of Irish to other Deputies.  I want to deal more generally with the Rules of the High Court and of the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the House was led to anticipate that the new system, which was being inaugurated in respect to the High Court as well as the other courts, would lean towards reducing the cost of litigation.  Unfortunately, from the very beginning of these rules, we learn that there is no intention whatever of reducing the cost of litigation.  All the procedure and practice hitherto in force, except in so far as they are altered by these rules, are to be retained, and <Col N="2259" /> except from the point of view of time and possible delay which is sought to be avoided, there is no change in the procedure.  It is the procedure which has necessitated so great a charge in the way of costs upon the litigants that is being perpetuated.  I am not, now, referring to the scale of fees which, as the Minister stated, are retained for the future, as they have been for some years past.  The ordinary method whereby an action is pursued, from beginning to end, is undoubtedly cumbrous and seems to have been devised for the purpose of adding to the cost against the litigant for the benefit of the lawyer.</P>
    <P>I was hopeful that the new rules would have made it possible for the procedure of the courts to be carried on very much more economically than at present, or than in the past.  I am advised that the method to which we are now asked to conform of making applications to the court by way of motion on the various stages of a law action has been, in fact, disused, if not abolished, in Great Britain for quite a number of years.  There is some method known as a summons for direction whereby the court, at the request of either party, or of each party, decides what shall be the course to be pursued in regard to the method of carrying on an action&mdash;that is to say, discovery of documents, questions to be answered on oath before trial proper by way of interrogatories, inspection of documents, and examination of witnesses out of court who are ill.  Many matters of that kind seem to have been provided for by a much more expeditious method which does not require the calling in of counsel at every point in the case.  It is these matters that involved litigants in very heavy expenses.  I thought we had reason to hope that that kind of procedure might have been simplified, and that those who are unfortunate enough to have to go to law would have been saved this peculiar method of taking money out of the pockets of the citizen seeking his rights under the law and putting it into the pockets of solicitors and barristers.</P>

      <P>I am speaking on behalf of the business community, and am appealing that the Rules of Court that are to be adopted should be of such a character that would allow actions at law to be pursued at the minimum of cost and with the least expense. My attention also is drawn to a defect which again concerns the business community materially.  I understand that, if any citizen of the Free State wishes to sue in England since the Treaty, it is essential he should give security for defendant's costs, but a citizen of Great Britain seeking to sue a citizen of the Free State in the Irish Courts is not required to give any security for costs. That is a matter which I understand could have been altered by the Rules of Court, and might well have been dealt with at this time.  The method at present in operation seems to be unfair and places the Irish citizen in an unfair position in comparison with the English. That ought to be remedied in the preparation of those rules.  My attention, too, has been drawn to Order XXIV, Rule 8:&mdash;</P>

    <P>I think that is a provision which ought to be turned round completely, that is to say, the execution should be stayed if an appeal is made, unless the court decides to the contrary.  Appeals are made from the Circuit Court and the appeal is upheld, but the evil arising from the original decision may well have been caused and cannot be recovered from.  Take the case of decisions under the Rent Acts where ejecments took place.  There have been quite a number of cases where judgment <Col N="2261" /> has been overturned on appeal, but where the ejectment has taken place.  The damage is done to the defendant and all the appeals, successful as they may be, will not remedy the evil caused by the ejectment.  You cannot very well unscramble an egg, and it is only with great difficulty that you can put a family back into the house they have been ejected from under the new circumstances.  If the appeals were certain to be dealt with expeditiously, we could understand the possibility of meeting a case quickly, but as we know, many of those appeals have been delayed for very many months, and there is really no likelihood that they will be overtaken within very few months; I think the evil of that may be very great.  It is not reasonable to say that execution must be entered and effected unless a special decision is made by the court; the ordinary process should be that execution would be delayed pending the appeal unless the authority had reported to the contrary.</P>
    <P>I think, though, apart from any detail, there is one outstanding defect with regard to those rules, and that is, that we are perpetuating a system of delay which involves, and seems to be designed to involve, heavy charges for lawyers, that at every stage of an action application should be made to the court, and that a solicitor, and perhaps two or three counsel shall be engaged in each application.  I think that is the great defect in those new rules. The anticipation we all had was that the rules would tend towards simplification and the lowering of expense to litigants.  I am not now dealing with what I think is another defect in those present rules, that is the desirability and the necessity for making provision for the poor person, in dealing with High Court cases.  That is a matter which would require a good deal more consideration than I have been able to give it, but I fear there is a justification for asking the committee and the rule-making authority to take those rules back with a view to providing for a much greater economy of money as well as of time in the working out of a case in the court.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned I am not very much further advanced than I was on the previous occasion when this matter was under discussion here.  Generally speaking, I think as far as the Rules of the High Court are concerned, in so far as they adapt themselves to the proceedings of the court, they are not open to very great criticism.  There is one thing we must recognise, and that is, when we are speaking of the costs we have got, in the Rules of Court, the cost as far as fees are concerned for barristers and all that sort of thing, but in examining those rules one would like to have had also the court fees before him.  These fees to the court did not seem to have been issued at all and in so far as they may be, of course it is an incomplete record of what the expenses of carrying out the law will be.  I think there is a feeling outside that the Minister will be inclined to sanction the courts being made self-supporting in the way of fees.  I do not know whether that is so or not.</P>
      <P>In Order IV. it would seem as if there were a certain amount of clash; at least, explanation is wanted in respect to No. XXVIII., Clause 2.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject as aforesaid, except by order of the court, no costs shall be allowed to a plaintiff in any action or matter commenced in the High Court which could have commenced in the Circuit Court or the District Court, save such costs as would have been recoverable by the plaintiff in the Circuit Court or the District Court, as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That seems to be rather a hardship except in so far as it may be nullified by Order IV (3):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever a claim indorsed on a Summary Summons is for a liquidated sum only, the indorsement, besides stating the amount claimed in respect of the demand, shall state the amount claimed for costs, and further state that on payment of such amounts for demand and costs within six days (or other time limited for appearance by any Order of the Court) after service of the Summons further proceedings will be stayed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2263" /> Perhaps it might be possible for the Minister to clear that matter up. There seems to be uncertainty as to the position.  The question Deputy Johnson raised as to the cheapening of litigation is of very considerable interest to those concerned.  I do not think any exception could be taken to the scale of charges for the High Courts.  I think we must be satisfied to let things work out their own salvation. The trouble is that if these rules are passed and become operative, they will not be again subject to criticism in the Dáil.  Deputies have not had adequate time or opportunity to go into such technical matters.  After being some months in operation these rules should come before the Dáil again so that members might have an opportunity of criticising them.  I do not know if that is feasible, but in passing the rules now, Deputies, more or less, disclaim responsibility for them, as there has not been sufficient time to criticise them.  At some later stage Deputies should be afforded an opportunity of criticising their working.</P>

      <P>That question was mentioned before when we were discussing how these rules were to be considered.  I could not say off-hand what the exact procedure would be, but it does seem quite possible, as the Minister for Justice is the rule-making authority, and makes the rules eventually, that a motion could be introduced in the House by a Deputy, dealing with some particular aspect of the rules, after they have been in operation, and advocating the making of an amendment.  That could be dealt with by the Minister and, as he said on the last day, he could then begin the process of amending the rules if it seemed good to him and if it were the view of the House.  I think that is possible.</P>

      <P>Following on what Deputy O Maille has said regarding the position of Irish in the courts, it seems to me that it would have been more satisfactory if the Rules for the High Court proceeded on the lines of the Circuit Court, where it is stated that the proceedings in civil matters shall be carried on in the national language of Saorstát Eireann, or the English language.  Either language may be used at any stage of the proceedings. I think that would have been a more satisfactory position.  I would like the Minister to enlighten the Dáil as to why a distinction was made in the regulations in the High Court concerning the language.  It has been stated that the rules, as far as the High Court are concerned, discriminate against the use of the national language.  It would seem that such consideration as is given for Irish speakers, and those anxious to use the language, in legal proceedings is given only to those who happen to reside in that indefinite territory known as the Gaeltacht.  Irish speakers outside that district&mdash;if and when it will be defined &mdash;will have no rights.  I think that is a matter that the Minister would do well to explain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O Maille raised the question of Rule 29, and the use of the national language in the courts.  Rule 1 of Order 29 is intended to ensure that the court will be in a position to understand the evidence, for instance, of an Irish-speaking witness who is either unwilling or unable to speak English.  Take the case, for instance, where in a jury trial, a juror expresses a preference to take the juror's oath in Irish.  The judge, clearly must be in a position to assure himself that the juror has been duly sworn, and for that purpose the judge who does not himself know Irish might require an interpreter to inform him of the nature of the oath administered <Col N="2266" /> in Irish.  It may be taken that there will always be a sufficient number of officials with a knowledge of Irish attached to the Court, a knowledge sufficient to do interpreter's work.  The number of such officials in the court may be expected to be an increasing one.  New recruits coming into the court staff will, owing to our educational programme, presumably have a good knowledge of Irish, and Irish will certainly be a compulsory subject for the examination for these appointments.  What I would like to emphasise is that even at present when we speak of interpreters being attached to the court, it does not follow, by any means, that special men will have to be brought in here and now from outside the ranks of the present staff.  I think we have, at present, sufficient men with a competent knowledge of Irish for the purpose of fulfilling Rule 1 of Order 29.</P>
      <P>Underlying Rule 2 you have the idea that in the Gaeltacht, or the Irish-speaking portion of the country, the people who are brought to law should be summoned in the language which they habitually use and understand. On the other hand, it is recognised that the plaintiff, either in the Gaeltacht itself or outside it, may have no knowledge of Irish, and his solicitor may have no knowledge of Irish.  To deal with that situation it is provided that if the plaintiff does not voluntarily provide an Irish version for his original or a translation for service in the Gaeltacht, then, in the interests of the prospective Irish-speaking defendant, the document must be translated in the Central Office so as to ensure that the defendant will at least have the document in the language which he habitually uses.  That is the Gaeltacht position as covered by Rule 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rule 3 is not of a local but of a general application.  It deals with the whole Saorstát, and the underlying idea is precisely the same as that underlying Rule 2.  It is recognised that the defendant may have no knowledge whatsoever of Irish, but if the plaintiff chooses to start his proceedings in Irish he must not be prevented from doing so.  In the interests of the prospective defendant, whom we are <Col N="2267" /> assuming to be an English speaker, without any knowledge of Irish, the plaintiff may provide an English translation. If he does not provide an English translation, a translation will be done in the Central Office.  It has been suggested that Rule 3, in dealing with the whole Saorstát, is not the exact opposite of Rule 2, which deals with the Gaeltacht only.  It is suggested that Rule 3 should be limited to the operation of the area of jurisdiction of the State other than the Gaeltacht.  That would mean that if a document were served in Irish in the Gaeltacht, no English translation would be necessary.</P>
    <P>Underlying the difference between Rule 2 and Rule 3, there is simple realism, an appreciation of the facts of the position as they now exist and as we know them to exist.  We have to face the fact that English is widely known and generally spoken in the country, and even in the Gaeltacht there will be found people who know no Irish whatsoever.  Now take the other position.  It is rather difficult to imagine a person outside the Gaeltacht who knows no English whatsoever. The point is that no practising lawyer in the whole Saorstát is in the position that he knows Irish perfectly and knows no English at all.  No matter how much we may pretend to be independent of the trained lawyer, the fact is that when we come to serious law none of us is independent of him. In taking the basis for court practice, therefore, in the matter of the use of language, whether the Irish or the English language, we have to take the practising lawyer as a very important, and almost a fundamental factor in our review of the position.  When we remember that even in the Gaeltacht itself very many solicitors have practised heretofore quite successfully without any knowledge of Irish, it will be apparent that it is simply illusory to pretend that we can carry on the work of the courts, even in the Gaeltacht, in Irish.  I would put the dilemma, therefore, something like this &mdash;it is possible to carry on business everywhere in English in the courts, because the justice will know English, <Col N="2268" /> the clerk will know English, the practising lawyers will know English, and if the litigants or their witnesses do not know English, at least some of those whom I have mentioned, the justice, the clerk, or the lawyers, will know sufficient Irish to act as interpreter for those litigants or their witnesses.</P>
    <P>Now take the other position.  It is very hard to conceive a case where nothing but Irish is used.  Remember that we are now dealing with the High Court, and that is the explanation of the distinction that Deputy O'Connell drew attention to.  We are dealing here with the High Court and it is admitted straight away that there is not absolute equality of treatment between the Irish and English in the Gaeltacht, and in the rest of the area of the State. These rules are the rules recommended to me by the Committee, and I certainly maintain that they are put forward in a spirit of helpfulness and in a spirit of friendliness towards the national language.  I have no patience whatever with people who pretend to think that the rules were framed in a spirit either of indifference, contempt or hostility towards the national language.</P>
    <P>The absence of equality simply arises from a recognition of the facts, and the Rules of Court are not intended as propaganda of any kind, linguistic or political. They are simply rules intended for the administrative convenience of litigants and their professional representatives. These provisions in the court, so far as the High Court and Supreme Court are concerned, bearing on the question of the two languages, are deemed by me and by my officials to be adequate in the face of the position which now exists in the country with regard to the language.  If that position were to alter radically or substantially there might be a case for an alteration of the rules.  In the position, as we now know it, I consider there is no question of any slight on the national language in the provision which is laid down here in Rule 29.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson confined himself rather carefully to generalities.  He said that the old costly procedure is being continued; that there is no cheapening.  He complains that a hope was held out of cheaper law, and he sees no sign of its <Col N="2270" /> fulfilment.  Generally, he talked as if a cumbrous, unnecessary procedure, drawn up by trade unionists for the betterment of their own bank balances, was being continued to the detriment of prospective litigants.  He did not come down to touch on any particular rule and to suggest how it might be altered, or what procedure was, in his opinion or in the opinion of his technical adviser, superfluous.  In fact, a great deal of his talk on and around this subject of cost seemed to be without any advertence to Order 13 and its contents.</P>
      <P>Order 13 deals with the minor judicial functions of the Master of the Central Office: &ldquo;1.  The Master may make any order which was a Side Bar Order under the practice heretofore in force. 2.  In addition to the orders in the preceding rule mentioned, the Master may make any of the following orders.&rdquo; Then there follow thirteen additional Orders that the Master may make:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i.)  Any order which under the practice heretofore in force might have been made as of course.</P>
      <P>(ii.)  An order for appointment of a guardian ad litem of an infant or person of unsound mind not so found.</P>
      <P>(iii.)  An order for a statement of the names of persons who may be copartners in any firm suing or being sued in an action or matter.</P>
      <P>(iv.)  An order for the extension of time for doing any act or taking any step in an action or matter.</P>
      <P>(v.)  An order for discovery, limited or general, or delivery of interrogatories in uncontested applications.</P>
      <P>(vi.)  An order for the appointment or discharge of receivers in uncontested applications.</P>
      <P>(vii.)  An order to dismiss an action with costs for want of prosecution or for failure to make an affidavit of discovery or to answer interrogatories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rule 7 states that counsel may be heard in any case before the Master, but the costs of such counsel shall not be allowed unless certified for by the Master; so that if counsel is unreasonably employed to carry through these <Col N="2271" /> minor and formal applications before the Master, it is open to the Master to refuse his certificate that such employment of counsel was reasonable or necessary, and costs will not be allowed in the absence of such certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The very granting of jurisdiction to the Master in these matters, instead of having them dealt with, as formerly, by a judge, will tend to make law cheaper.  It may be presumed that under Rule 7 counsel will not be allowed in the costs unnecessarily. It is not likely that counsel will be disallowed in proceedings before the Master.  If the Deputies turn to page 12, Rule 4, they will see that it is stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Proceedings commenced by Summary Summons shall be heard on Affidavit.  In all uncontested cases the Master may deal with the matter summarily.  In contested cases in which the Master shall have jurisdiction, he shall in his discretion, decide the case himself or transfer it to the Judge's list.  The Summonses shall be listed before the Master on the day upon which the same shall have been set down, and, if then in order for hearing, shall, if the Master is of opinion that the case is one for a judge, be put in the Court list for hearing by the Judge on the first opportunity.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this rule, as in others, a genuine attempt is made to eliminate both delay and the consequent costs, owing to delay, on the litigant.  Because the scales of costs are fixed at those obtaining in 1905, with the 50 per cent. addition in recognition of the altered money value, it should not be assumed that in a great many matters pertaining to practice and procedure there is not substantial reduction.  The whole scheme of the Courts of Justice Act was to effect a certain shifting of jurisdiction from the high to the lower court.  That, of course, involves straightaway a considerable diminution in expenses, quite apart from any reduction of cost in the lower court, <Col N="2272" /> but the mere fact of a local venue, or one, at any rate, that is more local than the High or Supreme Court, in itself effects a considerable casing of the financial burden on litigants.  It is not possible simply to create the millennium and provide free law for the multitude.</P>

      <P>Solicitors and counsel have to get their fees and the State must get, at any rate, some contribution from litigants towards the administrative cost of the courts.  Deputy Johnson raised a point in regard to security for costs when the plaintiff is not resident in the Saorstát.  If the defendant has a good <i>prima facie</i> defence and makes the necessary affidavit, he will have no difficulty whatever in getting an Order from the court ordering a non-resident plaintiff to give security for costs.  That has always been the position, and will continue to be the position under these rules.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I mean is that I am not prepared to give a definite undertaking.  I will consider whether it would be advisable to bring in a new rule.  The Deputy raised a question on Order 24, Rule 8, which states: &ldquo;The appeal shall not operate as a stay of proceedings under the decision appealed from unless the Circuit Judge or the High Court shall so order, or unless within ten days after the decision a deposit shall be made of a sum to be fixed by the Circuit Judge, not exceeding the amount recoverable under, or the value of the property affected by the said judgment or order, together with costs.&rdquo;  The object of this rule is to prevent the abuse of people appealing merely to gain time.  There is a great deal of that at present.  The idea is, when final judgment is given, that the party proposing to appeal should satisfy the Circuit Judge of his <i>bona fides</i> in regard to the appeal.  It may be assumed that the Circuit Judge will not refuse to stay execution if the prospective appellant has any reasonable grounds for appeal.  An automatic stay of execution would lead to the abuse that people would appeal who had no real hope of having the decision reversed, but solely for the purpose of gaining time.  That rule is put in by people who have a very full knowledge of that abuse, and with a view to meeting a situation which notoriously exists.  I think that completes all I have to say on the points that have been raised.</P>

      <P>It would scarcely be feasible to go through these Circuit Court Rules in detail or to attempt to <Col N="2275" /> treat of them rule by rule.  I would ask Deputies in considering these rules to remember that Section 48 of the Courts of Justice Act confers a very wide jurisdiction on the Circuit Court, and that it is necessary, in considering this court and its jurisdiction, to clear one's mind completely of any fancied analogy that may be there with the old County Court and its very limited jurisdiction.  Under Section 48 of the Courts of Justice Act cases involving a considerable amount of money, up to £300, can be determined by the Circuit Court.  The Committee, therefore, in considering the question of the procedure to be adopted took as their guide, in many respects, the former procedure of the High Court as laid down in the Supreme Court Rules of 1905 which, prior to the passing of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, applied throughout the country to all common law cases where the amount involved exceeded £50.  The Committee, I take it, were also influenced by the fact that for all practical purposes this Circuit Court, in the vast majority of cases, must be deemed to be the final court.  An appeal on the stenographer's notes from the Circuit Court to the High Court is coming more and more to be recognised by practitioners, both solicitors and barristers, as an appeal on a matter of law.  I think it is true to say that the judges of the High Court have made it clear that, where the basis of the appeal is simply a suggestion, that as between Witness A, who swore one thing, and Witness B, who swore another, they are not prepared to review, and still less, to reverse, the decision of the Circuit Judge.  The Circuit Judge had the opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses, and in a direct conflict of evidence, as between one witness and another, he took a particular view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the experience of barristers and solicitors who have brought appeals from the Circuit Court is that the High Court is not prepared to reconsider the decision of the lower court on matters of fact or on matters of conflict, as between the evidence of one witness and the evidence of another.  My idea is that the tendency will increasingly be to have appeals <Col N="2276" /> from the Circuit Court to the High Court only where there is a genuine point of law involved in which the professional advisers of the unsuccessful litigant consider that the Circuit Judge was at fault or in error, and in the hope of securing a different judgment in the higher court they would bring their appeal.  I ask Deputies to remember, firstly, that in considering this Circuit Court we are considering a court with jurisdiction up to £300, and that very many large and important actions, libel actions, possibly which take a day or two days in the hearing, are pitched for damages falling at or under that level of £300.  I ask them, also, to remember that we are dealing with a court which may substantially, for all practical purposes, be regarded as a final court, so that there is no real analogy with the County Court of the past.  The Committee, I take it, were very conscious of factors of that kind and adverted also to the practice which obtains in other countries, particularly in South Africa, with regard to a court which corresponds very closely to the Circuit Court of our system.</P>
    <P>Now, as the amount involved in many cases would be considerable, and as the right of appeal to the High Court under Sections 61 and 62 of the Courts of Justice Act must be taken on the stenographer's notes of the evidence before the Circuit Court, it was necessary to provide machinery by which the nett issue between the parties would be before the court, and by which neither party would be taken by surprise at the hearing.  To ensure that, many matters such as pleadings, discovery of documents, and applications for particulars were necessary in the practice and procedure of these courts.  The High Court, so far as an appeal is concerned, deals for practical purposes only with whether the Judge of the Circuit Court trying the case mis-directed in law.  The High Court have decided that on the true construction of Section 61 of the Courts of Justice Act, if facts are proved at the hearing before the Circuit Court which support its finding, that finding shall not be reversed, notwithstanding that the High Court <Col N="2277" /> Judges hearing the appeal might feel that, had they been in the position of trying the case in the first instance, a different result might have ensued.  It is, therefore, of very real and vital interest to litigants to have all the facts in their favour proved before the Circuit Judge.  When pleading for discovery of documents and particulars of that kind, it would be very difficult for the solicitor for the litigant to know what case had to be met and what evidence he should offer.  As I have pointed out, owing to the view taken by the High Court as to appeals, it is essential that all the material facts should be brought to the knowledge of the Circuit Judge.  The former procedure of the issue of a civil bill and of no further pleadings in cases under £50 was satisfactory enough, because if a party to a case were taken by surprise before the County Court Judge, he was entitled to appeal to the Judge of Assize, and have a complete re-hearing with oral evidence.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what some people may regard as complicated methods of procedure, are necessary for the protection of litigants themselves.  They are introduced solely in their interests.  An exception has, therefore, been made in cases which might have been brought in the old County Court, that is in cases where the amount involved does not exceed £50.  Under Rule 165 no pleadings will be necessary in such cases except the court so orders.  Further special jurisdiction in interlocutory matters, such as attachments, injunctions, and garnishees, and all powers ancillary, all jurisdiction vested in or transferred to the court is given by Section 57 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  The procedure for the obtaining of such interlocutory relief is to be prescribed by the rules.  The procedure prescribed is, we consider, as simple as can be made.  Practically the only other procedure which did not exist in the County Court, and which is provided in the Circuit Court, is the obtaining of summary judgments.  By Section 66 of the Courts of Justice Act, the Committee are required to make rules for the granting of summary judgments in appropriate cases.  It is in the interest of litigants generally <Col N="2278" /> that there should be a speedy method of obtaining judgment, and that a plaintiff to whom money is due should not have to wait the sitting of the Circuit Judge in a particular town before he could obtain his judgment.</P>
    <P>That, briefly, is the scale of costs for the court.  Accordingly, under Rule 450, it is proposed that the High Court costs, less one-third, will be applicable in cases which were outside the jurisdiction of the old County Court, pending the drawing-up and publication of a detailed schedule of costs.  In cases within the old County Court jurisdiction the former County Court costs will be applicable.  That rule is purely temporary and provisional pending an agreement between myself and the Rule-Making Committee of the Circuit Court as to a detailed schedule of costs.  I may say that this Rule 450 would not meet with my approval as a permanent proposal with regard to costs in the Circuit Court, but as a temporary expedient bridging over the time when detailed proposals as to costs can be put forward, I consider it sufficiently good.  A reduction of one-third on what the costs of what the same action in the High Court would be under the old scheme of jurisdiction does not represent entirely the relief to litigants.  Deputies will remember that quite a considerable relief is involved in regard to witnesses' expenses, which in particular cases will, of course, be very much less by reason of the local venue, so that in attempting to arrive at an estimate of the reduction you have to take into account a reduction of one-third of what the cost would be in the same action taken in the High Court under the old system and the reduction in the expenses of witnesses arising from the fact that the venue is now local.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to have a detailed scale of costs prepared by the Committee at as early a date as possible, and when prepared and made by me they will be brought before the Dáil and the Seanad.  This proposed scale of High Court costs, less one-third, is considered reasonable as a temporary expedient, and is simply put forward in that way.  I think I should mention that we&mdash;not so much the Committee <Col N="2279" /> as myself and my Department&mdash;had considerable difficulty in forming a just estimate of the value of pleadings in the Circuit Court.  I met the most widely different points of view with regard to them from people who, from the nature of their position, were detached and impartial, and must be taken as competent to form a weighty opinion in the matter.  On the one hand you have the suggestion that things could go on pretty much as they were, and that there was nothing really intrinsically valuable in pleadings. On the other hand, you had quite definitely the view that it was a thing arrived at as a permanent, or practically permanent, administrative code for the procedure of the court; that it was essential to ensure that the time of the courts would not be wasted, that issues should be clearly knit in the more serious cases where larger amounts were involved before the cases came into court, that the parties and their professional advisers would at least be agreed on the point of what it was they disagreed about, what had to be determined by the court, and that the field would have been cleared and a straight issue brought before the judge and thrashed out.</P>
    <P>One can understand that a solicitor or barrister, going into court with no knowledge of what kind of defence might be put up to his action, might conceivably be taken very much at a loss and very much by surprise, with unfortunate results for his client.  Take the simplest form of action&mdash;an action for money due or for goods sold and delivered.  A solicitor might consider he had a perfectly straight case and yet be met by a surprise defence involving an allegation of fraud on the part of agents of his clients.  He might be wholly unprepared for a defence of that nature, and one can only suppose that he would be driven to the resort of applying for an adjournment.  It might not always be possible to get an adjournment simply because an unexpected point was raised by the defence. One can conceive that if that position were stereotyped in our rules, if there were no clearing up of ground or joining of issue before the actual case came <Col N="2280" /> on for hearing in court, frequent miscarriages of justice might result.  I ask Deputies to consider that and to consider it with special reference to the fact that I have already somewhat stressed&mdash;that this Circuit Court, quite unlike the county courts in the past, is practically the final court, that there is no real appeal on matters of fact, that the appeal lies on stenographer's notes, and is tending more and more to be an appeal on points of law and not an appeal as to the facts of the case or in the hope that the High Court may take a different view from the Circuit Judge on a conflict of evidence between Witness A and Witness B in the lower court.  The proposal is that pleadings be dispensed with in those cases which fell within the jurisdiction of the County Court of the past&mdash;cases ranging from £50 downwards&mdash;and that from £50 upwards to the limit of jurisdiction, £300, pleadings be necessary.  I think there is a wholly exaggerated idea as to the part played by pleadings in contributing to the costs of an action.  Pleadings are, in fact, almost the smallest part of the professional fees involved in a suit and, perhaps, the hardest-earned money.  Up to eight or ten years ago, the drafting of pleadings by counsel in a case was a matter of one guinea.  It is now a matter of two guineas.  Considering that the whole basis of the lawsuit is settled in that process of pleadings, that the issue is knit as between plaintiff and defendant, that charge cannot be said to be extravagant.</P>
    <P>I may say that I went outside the Rule-Making Committee for enlightenment and advice on this question of pleadings.  I consulted men who had been in the ring, who had been active practitioners&mdash;both barristers and solicitors&mdash;and who are no longer in active practice; who are detached and aloof and could not be said to have any direct or personal interest in the kind of advice they gave.  I received conflicting opinion from very competent persons&mdash;ex-barristers and ex-solicitors &mdash;who, I believe, were genuinely anxious to give the advice which they considered in the best interests of litigants and of the general community, and with the minimum of advertence <Col N="2281" /> to the interests of those who are still in the ring&mdash;those who are still active practitioners, whether at the bar or in the solicitors' profession.  I do not feel disposed to interfere with the recommendation of the Committee in that matter&mdash;certainly, not without a trial and without some observation of the results.  It is a rather serious thing to contemplate the complete abolition of pleadings, when you consider that very frequent and very serious miscarriages of justice might take place as a result, and when you consider that the appeal that lies is a very limited and very restricted appeal now&mdash;simply an appeal on stenographer's notes, without any further oral hearing.</P>
    <P>The argument is strong that the surprise defence may take even the most experienced practitioner off his guard and find him wholly at a loss to promote as he should, and as he might, with better notice, the interests of his client.  I recommend these rules to the Dáil, as put forward to me unanimously by the Rule-Making Committee of the Circuit Court, and I ask the Dáil to clear its mind entirely of any analogy with the County Court of the judicial system which obtained in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down two motions, one of which was to ask the Dáil not to approve of these rules, while the other had reference to the possibility of altering the figure £50 to £100.  The Ceann Comhairle has ruled that the second motion is not in order, and there has been circulated an alternative motion.  Slightly altering the language of the first motion.  The alternative motion was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all words after the word &lsquo;Dáil&rsquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the words &lsquo;refuses to approve of the Rules of the Circuit Court, because the Rule-Making Authority has not formulated rules which will enable all cases to be brought to trial in the simple form that at present exists, without the necessity for &lsquo;pleadings&rsquo; and the heavy charges upon litigants which the system of &lsquo;pleadings&rsquo; will involve.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to the Minister's <Col N="2282" /> statement and I have tried to appreciate the weight of the argument he advanced for making this system of pleadings the normal system in all cases where the issue is value for less than £50.  He did not by any means convince me of the necessity of making that the normal procedure.  I feel desirous of asking him at once whether, in fact, the working of the Circuit Court during the last two years has produced these cases of miscarriages of justice, and whether it has been ineffective in normal cases or not.  The effect of the rules, I am advised, will be in the normal cases&mdash;the cases which are less difficult&mdash;to increase greatly the charges upon the litigants. I can understand the plea of those who are very anxious that the regular machinery be invoked and that all the forms should be adhered to by the plaintiff and the defendant before the case comes into court.  I can understand quite well that the average barrister would desire that that system should be perpetuated and extended.  I have no doubt that he would desire that the £50 minimum should be removed. But while it is necessary to have proper regard to the advice of barristers, I think the business of the Dáil is to consider this matter from the point of view of the public, who are the litigants, and to consider what will be the likely charges involved by the new system as compared with the existing system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I ask, in the first instance, is where the procedure of the Circuit Courts at present has failed.  What are the faults to be found with the Civil Bill procedure?  I am not able to find out any very great objection, and while I am informed that it is desirable, and in many complicated cases necessary, that there should be pleadings, these cases can be provided for.  It is a comparatively small matter to get a court to decide upon the application of one party or the other as to pleadings, but the normal course should be to dispense with pleadings.  My information is that probably <Col N="2283" /> not more than 25 per cent. of the cases that are tried are cases that would require pleadings.  It is undesirable to impose the obligation for pleadings in the other 75 per cent. of the cases.</P>
      <P>The Minister has quoted £50 which is referred to in Rule 155.  That was the limit of the jurisdiction in the County Court.  On many other occasions we have been reminded that £50 pre-war was not quite the same as £50 is to-day.  The jurisdiction is, therefore, lessened, and we are imposing upon the public the obligation to follow out a more expensive procedure than was the case under the old county courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy mean when he says the jurisdiction is lessened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The meaning is that £50 was the limit of the jurisdiction of the County Courts and no pleadings were required.  £50 now will buy very much less than £50 in the days before the war and, therefore, the trader, or the farmer, who is indebted to the extent of £50 has not had the same value for his £50 that he would have had in pre-war days.  That is to say, the value of money is less to-day than in pre-war days, so that to bring us on to the old level of the County Courts in respect of the charges upon litigants you would need to raise that £50 to £100.  Are we to contemplate that the work of the Circuit Courts is to be, in the main, those difficult cases &mdash;libel actions and the like?  It is natural for the Minister to quote the difficult cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to believe that the great majority of the cases that will be tried in the courts, even for over £50, will be for goods sold and delivered. They will be for payments of accounts for goods which are disputed one way or another.  If we are going to make necessary this rather detailed and difficult procedure, which requires at once the bringing in of counsel, it is going to be an added charge upon the public.  It might reasonably be argued by some people that that will act as a deterrent for those fond of <Col N="2284" /> law.  I do not think these are quite the motives that should inspire us.  We have to do our best to make it possible for citizens between each other to get substantial justice in the courts according to law.  It has been the belief of many that substantial justice can be obtained where people meet face to face before a judge and state their case as well, and probably much better in the majority of cases, than if the cases are made by solicitors beforehand, with statements and replies and restatements and further replies.  The jargon of the court is such that the plaintiff probably does not understand, and very often finds himself involved in discussions and what seem sometimes to be mis-statements and perjury.  In a very large number of cases, indeed, the appearance of the parties before the judge is a much more satisfactory way of trial than having to go through the course which pleadings involve.  There is an alternative way possible where it is obvious that the case is going to be a difficult one, where one side or the other may make an application to the court for a statement of claim, and what are called pleadings.  That should be the course to adopt in the minority of cases, but we ought not to impose upon the majority the necessity for this course which will, undoubtedly, involve the bringing in of counsel to every case over £50.  The Minister dealt with the question of costs and with this proposal: that the High Court scale, less one-third, should be the scale for the Circuit Courts.  He explained these fees were only temporary; he was not prepared to justify them as permanent, but that they were sufficiently good to be going on with, and he hoped and intended that there should be a scale produced and submitted at some later time.  I wonder whether the Minister is really satisfied with this scale proposed, which is one-third less than the High Court charges, and whether there is any difference between himself and the Rule-Making Committee upon this matter. He spoke of this as temporary, but that is not quite satisfactory as an explanation or as an inducement to the Dáil to pass these rules.  The procedure <Col N="2285" /> is such that it will be for the Committee to decide whether they will be permanent or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot say &ldquo;they are only temporary&rdquo;; if the Committee think they are satisfactory they can say: &ldquo;We are going to make them permanent.&rdquo;</P>

The fact that he has not done so is tantamount to saying: &ldquo;I was dissatisfied with the District Court Rules, and I held them up.  I am passing the Circuit Court Rules with those charges, and that is sufficient to assure the House that I am temporarily satisfied with them.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The drawing up and agreeing on a detailed schedule of costs for the Circuit Courts is very much a bigger task than arriving at the schedule of costs within the District Court, and would require a good deal more time and more frequent conferences than were necessary in the case of the Rule-Making Committee of the District Courts.  I have agreed on this as a temporary expedient, and with as little delay as possible would set to the work of endeavouring to arrive at an agreement with the Rule-Making Authority <Col N="2286" /> of the Circuit Court on a reasonable schedule of costs.  This is there temporarily.  It is a rough rule that for the present costs will be what they would be in the High Court, less one-third, and I ask Deputies to remember, in addition to that, that there will be considerable reductions under the head of witnesses' expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite so sure that the saving will be so great in witnesses' expenses as the Minister suggests.  If it is a case that the court was sitting near the residence of the plaintiff it might be true to make that claim for the area covered by the Circuit. Take Circuit No. 3, from Castleblayney to Lifford, for instance.  That is such a very long journey that it is easier to get to Dublin.  Circuit No. 5 is from Sligo to Port Laoighise.  I think it might be easier in many cases to get to Dublin.  However, that is not material to my argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case I desire to put to the Minister and the House as a reason why they should not confirm those rules is one of a debtor who is not quite so familiar with the requirements of the law and the practice of the courts as a solicitor would be.  I can see a great deal of unnecessary trouble for that man in the requirements of those rules as compared with the comparative simplicity of the procedure at the present time.  I take Rule 143 and onwards. &ldquo;A defendant intending to defend shall, within ten days after service of the originating document, enter an appearance, by lodging with the County Registrar a memorandum that he intends to defend.&rdquo;  A debtor is served with a summons that he intends to defend, and within ten days he enters an appearance.  Then in 147 and onwards we find time-tables something like this: A summons is served on the 1st March, let us say; ten days afterwards he enters an appearance.  Then it appears, according to 147 (b) that the plaintiff serves a notice that he is going to move for summary judgment. &ldquo;Where the defendant has entered an appearance to defend the plaintiff may move the court by motion for summary judgment&rdquo; in certain cases.  &ldquo;Such a motion shall be made on not less than <Col N="2287" /> four days' notice not delivered more than ten days' after the date of the defendant's appearance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The defendant has entered an appearance and ten days after the summons is served and any time within the ten days the notice that summary judgment is to be moved for is served. The paragraph reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Such a motion shall be made on not less than four days' notice delivered not more than ten days' after the date of the defendant's appearance.&rdquo;  Any day within ten days, even two days or one day, notice may be served on the defendant that a motion for summary judgment is to be made, and within four days' that motion may be made.  If the case were where the defendant lived at one end of the district and the court was sitting at the other end of the district, if the plaintiff lived in Sligo and the court was sitting in Port Laoighise, what is the position of that defendant?  He has to appear at the court, and in the meantime instruct solicitors, and generally has to take such proceedings as will almost ensure that judgment will be entered against him for non-appearance.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the rules are going to work seriously against the interests of the poor defendant, especially the defendant who is not very familiar with lawyers, legal procedure and the jargon of the courts.  Everything in the rules rather suggests that the solicitor who is called in to advise the defendant or the plaintiff, as the case may be, would immediately have to call in a barrister, because formal pleadings have to be drawn up and the solicitor has too much to do.  So that is going to add very greatly to the cost.  I think it will be agreed that the judge in the class of case I am thinking of, which probably represents the bulk of the cases that will come into court, can get to the heart of it on the evidence given by the plaintiff, the defendant and the witnesses.  Something that happened in the course of the proceedings in court may not have been entered on the pleadings&mdash;and if I understand the matter rightly, no reference can be made to new facts that may come out in the course of the evidence&mdash;so <Col N="2288" /> the judge cannot deal with it. That may be necessary and desirable in intricate cases, where very correct legal procedure is required, but the great majority of cases that we are familiar with do not require that particular kind of procedure.</P>
    <P>I think it is a distinctly retrograde step to demand of litigants that they shall go through this process.  I think it is complicating legal procedure, complicating the work of the courts, and not simplifying them.  So far from doing what we all set out to have done, to simplify the work of the courts, and make the attaining of justice easier, we are going the other way and making it harder.  I think it is distinctly retrograde, and I think we ought to ask the Minister and the Rule-Making Authority to alter these rules, and to make new ones, which would ensure that in the great majority of simple cases, such as the recovery of debts, the procedure at present operating should continue, and that the normal course should be to carry on by civil bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. The Minister undoubtedly made a very strong case in favour of the rules and the pleadings that have to be entered, but I suggest that he is impressed by the opinion of the Committee that drafted the rules.  One can very well appreciate, from the lawyer's point of view, the desirability that he should know everything about the case to be made before he goes into the court.  To do so puts him in a very strong position.  If he does not understand the case very well he will be able to read up the law before the court sits.  In consequence of knowing the opposite side he will be able to make a case for his client.  But, when we are up against the position from the point of view of the ordinary layman, as to what it is to cost in order to obtain justice at the smallest possible expense, we have to consider whether it is worth the money or not.  The position of the Committee, which the Minister is supporting, would incline one to the view that it might not have been a bad thing to have had some one representative of the ordinary citizen on the Committee. <Col N="2289" /> I think there is great weight in the arguments of Deputy Johnson.  In the great majority of cases, as Deputy Johnson says, a lawyer would be able to see the point very early in the proceedings. If there are exceptional cases, where it is necessary that pleadings should be entered, a motion made by either side should entitle them to do so.  When that is so it will very often involve the employment of barristers. Many solicitors down the country will consider whether that costly practice is worth the money.  There is a case for the revision of this rule.  When considering the position outlined by Deputy Johnson, concerning Rules 143 to 147, I might say a letter appeared in the Press a couple of days ago over the signature of a lawyer, in which it was pointed out that if a Donegal trader issues a civil bill against a man on this side of Muckish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, like some of them.  I am in the Circuit Court area that Deputy White is in and that Deputy Dolan, of Leitrim, if he were in his constituency, would be in.  The Minister can imagine the position that would be created under Rule 147.  A defendant enters an appearance to defend and the plaintiff moves for summary judgment.  All this is to take place within a few days.  Let us suppose the court has risen in a particular district and moves on from the northern end of Tirconaill to the western end of Cavan.  Has the litigant in west Tirconaill to move on with the court?  It is the only thing he can do.  If he is to prove that he has a case he must do it.  That is not cheapening the law or making it possible for poor men to prove they have a reason for entering a defence.  It is putting them in the position that, regardless of whether or not they have a case, a decision must be given against them.  I do not believe that under such a rule as that the administration of justice can be satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say he believes the point of view of the Committee is the correct point of view, and he is not prepared to make any alteration in this rule yet.  If the position under this rule is as we understand it in its relation to the administration of justice in our courts, I say that before we meet again next November, the Minister will have forced on him the necessity for amending these rules.  I strongly support Deputy Johnson's motion.</P>

      <P>I feel, and the members of the Farmers' Party feel, that we cannot leave the statement made by the Minister for Finance to-day in regard to the change which is taking place in the position of the Land Bank, without making a protest against the manner in which the matter has been brought before the House and against the manner in which the absorption of the Land Bank by the Bank of Ireland is about to take place. I do not say that the bargain made by the Minister and by the Government with the Bank of Ireland is not a good bargain; that it is not the best bargain that could be made.  Quite possibly it is. I am inclined to think it is a good bargain, but, even so, I would go the length of saying that if we postponed this matter to a later date and made a bargain which was not so much to the advantage of the State as the present bargain is, we might be doing a thing which would be a service to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My proposal is that the Dáil does not approve of the action of the Minister for Finance pending the report of the Banking Commission.  I am referring to the final report and not the interim report which the Minister states has been presented and which favours the selling out of the Government's assets in the Land Bank to the Bank of Ireland. I believe the question of the status of the Land Bank ought not to be taken as an individual matter; it should be taken in conjunction with the whole matter of banking and credits.  The Dáil is not in a position to give its support to the present transaction without having an opportunity of examining the whole system <Col N="2292" /> of banking and credits in this country in the light of the information which will be given to them by the report of the Banking Commission.  Members of the Dáil, and the public generally, have no information as to the lines along which the report of the Banking Commission will be framed.  We have heard rumours and suggestions and, possibly, we have our own ideas of the lines on which the report will be based; but we have no definite information. One thing is certain: some arrangement or recommendation ought to be made by the Banking Commission for the provision of better credit facilities for the agriculturists of this country. We had it from the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, in his statement on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, that he favours something in the nature of the provision of medium term credits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Not as a banking transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly not as a banking transaction.  I believe it will not be as a banking transaction. I have formed the opinion that something of that nature is required.  The ordinary joint-stock banks are not at present meeting the full credit requirements of the agriculturists.  Situated as they are, carrying on business according to the ideas by which ordinary banking transactions are governed in this country, it is not possible for them to meet the full credit requirements of the agricultural community.  It is evident some change will have to be made in regard to the system on which the banks work in making advances, or otherwise there should be the provision of a new institution to meet the present-day credit requirements of farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have suggested that something in the nature of a mortgage institution of some kind should be formed for the purpose of making medium or long-term advances to farmers.  There are possibilities in that direction which I do not intend to enlarge upon.  It probably will be touched upon, or recommended by, the Banking Commission. It struck me that it is possible that the <Col N="2293" /> foundation which has been laid in this National Land Bank might be used in some way to act as a basis upon which such a financial institution could be built up.</P>
    <P>The officials of the Bank and the directors of the bank have been in close touch with the farming community, and with the farming problem of the country, and they should be in a better position to deal with transactions of that kind and have a more intimate knowledge of the requirements of the country in regard to matters of that kind than any institution which might be built up as the Minister suggests.  I do not suggest that it would be the best, but it might prove to be the best.  We cannot say whether it would or not, but I say if a decision is taken to-day by the Dáil in support of the Minister in concluding this transaction with the Bank of Ireland the possibilities in the direction that I have indicated will have passed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that matters of this kind cannot be dealt with by lengthy debates in the Dáil without doing serious harm to the credit of the Bank itself.  In that statement I am not in agreement with the Minister.  I think it would not do harm to the credit of the Bank itself.  We have heard on many occasions in recent years of proposed amalgamations between banks in England.  We have heard it mentioned in financial and other papers that certain banks were in negotiation with other banks for the purpose of one bank being amalgamated with the other.  In these negotiations the banks that were amalgamated with the other banks were small banks which were taken up by the larger banks.  We have never heard of any case where the credit of the small bank was injured through its being known to the public that these negotiations were going on.  In fact very often the result was an improvement in the credit of the small bank, and we have seen that in these cases the shares of the small bank that was going to be amalgamated with the larger, went up on the Stock Exchange as a result of rumours of this kind getting abroad.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that the National Land Bank is the State Bank, that <Col N="2294" /> though it is not controlled by the State it is financed by the State, and that its financial integrity is morally if not actually guaranteed by the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not refer to the credit of the National Land Bank at all. I did not say that the credit of the Bank would be injured, but I said its business would be injured and that its value as a saleable asset would shrink.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not anticipate that its business would shrink, because evidently from the statement made recently one would conclude that its business is not expanding at all, that it is practically at a standstill, that it has turned away of late from the particular form of transaction for which it was established to engage in ordinary banking transactions. Now we are in the dark to a large extent as to the position with regard to this Bank in many ways.  We are certainly in no position to give a vote in support of any transaction in which we are supposed to understand the financial position of the Bank.  We know that the sum of money which is being paid by the Bank of Ireland for the Bank is the exact paid-up share capital of the Bank.  I presume from that the shares are all held by the Minister for Finance.  At least I understand that the original capital was advanced from the Republican Bonds which were issued by the Dáil Eireann Government, which accepted responsibility for the payment of these Republican Bonds, and that in that regard the Government is really the one and only shareholder of the National Land Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other points of view with regard to this matter to which I wish to refer.  There is the point of view that certain people, particularly farmers, have received advances from the Bank.  It is well known that these advances were made on a too generous scale at a time when advances of that kind were being made on a very generous scale by the other banks <Col N="2295" /> throughout the country, and perhaps it may be the fact that they were given on a still more generous scale by the National Land Bank, which was not bound to conduct its business according to the ordinary financial rules which apply to banks generally.  There will, undoubtedly, be a feeling of semi-consternation amongst people who had advances of that kind from the National Land Bank when they find that it is being taken over by an ordinary financial institution, and there will be a feeling that perhaps undue pressure may be brought upon them to pay up their present indebtedness to the Land Bank.  In that regard I believe the State has a problem in front of it and a problem which it must deal with sometime by other means than the ordinary means of taking advantage of the law as it stands, and forcing people into bankruptcy in order to get as much as they can out of them, people who were in fact pressed by the banks and by the National Land Bank in particular at one time to accept advances for the purpose of purchasing lands.</P>
    <P>With regard to the details of the statement made by the Minister I have very little to say.  These details were given in very brief outline, but there are one or two points which seem to be rather extraordinary.  There is the point, so far as I can gather, that it is the intention to superannuate certain redundant officials by giving them per annum two-thirds of the salary which they had in the last year of their employment.  While I think it is desirable that they should receive compensation, I think it is extraordinary that the suggestion should be made that men, who cannot have been in this employment longer than seven years, should get a permanent retiring allowance of two-thirds of their present salary.  I see no reason why the bank which is taking over the National Land Bank should not retain the services of all those who are employed there.  I think this continual payment of pensions to men who are found to be redundant, for one reason or another, both in regard to public services and <Col N="2296" /> now in regard to banking service, is becoming a scandal.  The country is packed with superannuated officials. I see no reason why men who were found capable of doing the work of the National Land Bank should not be retained by the Bank of Ireland.  Possibly the Bank of Ireland may not find immediate use for their services, but in the ordinary course a bank of that kind has from year to year to call on the youth of the country to fill vacancies that may occur.  By stopping that call for a short time they could easily absorb every man now in the service of the National Land Bank. I feel that this matter has been rushed on the Dáil too precipitously, and that it ought to receive more consideration than it can receive to-night.  I propose this motion so that the matter can be postponed until the House and the public will be in possession of the full report of the Banking Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I confess that flinging this matter at our heads to-day without any notice puts Deputies in a difficult position to make a case against a Minister who has been associated with all matters and transactions connected with the Land Bank since it was called into existence.  Is it an indication of policy on the part of the Executive Council that, so far as the State is concerned, its policy in the future is going to be different to that enunciated by the First Dáil and followed up to the present?  Has the Executive Council made up its mind that, so far as the Government is concerned, it must remove itself out of the sphere of banking business, and that it intends to leave to these institutions the work of financing concerns which require accommodation, or new industries which may now, or in the future, demand assistance by way of credit, or otherwise, from these institutions?  If that is to be the declared policy, following on the action of the Executive Council in selling their rights in the National Land Bank to the Bank of Ireland, I feel that the Dáil should be given an opportunity of examining it in the full light of all the facts that are available to the Executive.  We are <Col N="2297" /> not in that position this evening.  We are met by the statement of the Minister that the handing over of the National Land Bank is practically an accomplished fact.  It is a decision of the Executive Council in which we are to acquiesce.  That decision has been taken by the Executive Council because of the information which they have at their disposal, because of the recommendations which have been made to them in the interim reports of the Banking Commission, and we are expected to say &ldquo;Yes, the Executive Council are doing right.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Dáil would be acting unwisely in approving of that action.  We would be acting without being in possession of the facts that enabled the Executive Council to make up their minds.  These facts have not been placed before us and, as I said earlier in the day, the wisdom of the action taken by the Ministry can only be judged in the light of the future, when we see the final recommendations of the Banking Commission, and when we see what the Commission recommends as the duty of the State in affording, where it can, facilities to those citizens for continuing, or extending, their business by obtaining credit which they are unable at present to obtain from the present banking institutions. The Minister tells us that they have received a number of interim reports from the Banking Commission. Inasmuch as the National Land Bank came into existence through the utilisation of funds subscribed to the Republican Loan, I would like to know whether the fact that that money is repayable next year has anything to do with the decision of the Executive Council. Is the Minister satisfied from the recommendations made by the Banking Commission up to the present that the State must remove itself entirely out of the sphere in which the credit of the State can be pledged to assist citizens desirous of extending their business and to come to their aid in times of stress?  Has the outlook of the men who deemed it necessary to bring the Land Bank into existence in 1919 or 1920 changed?  Has the Banking Commission, or have the representatives of the banks on that Commission, given <Col N="2298" /> an indication of a change of policy on the part of banking institutions?  Is the Government satisfied that these institutions are going to come along to do the work that the National Land Bank was set up to perform for the citizens of the State?</P>
    <P>Until we have evidence from the Minister that the possibilities point in that direction, we cannot be satisfied that the policy of the Ministry is wise, and we cannot be prepared to say that it is right that we should pass over to others this institution, brought into existence by money subscribed by the people of the country, and kept there in order that it might benefit the people in building up the State, and later find the State put into the position of having to bring into existence another institution practically similar to the one we have now.  I feel from the facts placed before us this evening by the Minister&mdash;the very few facts&mdash;that we would not be justified in any such course, and, however good on the face of them the figures given and however good the bargain appears to be at the moment&mdash;from the Ministry's point of view it may appear good&mdash;as far as we can see we have not sufficient evidence to declare that he has made a good bargain.  Certainly without some other facts being placed before the Dáil than those which the Minister has up to the present supplied, I urge that the Dáil would not be acting wisely in approving of the policy which the Minister asks us to accept.</P>

      <P>I support the views expressed by Deputy Heffernan and Deputy Baxter in the main.  I would like to draw attention to what was to me perhaps the most significant statement made by the Minister in view of the relations between the Land Bank and the State.  That was the statement that the first steps in this proposed sale were initiated by the Bank of Ireland.  It is rather an extraordinary course for a private banking institution to initiate the purchase of a State institution from the State without any preliminaries.  I wonder had anything gone on before this alleged initiation by the Bank of Ireland?  I wonder <Col N="2299" /> what would be thought if we said that a banking institution or some insurance society or some other private limited company, with big monetary reserves, came along and said: &ldquo;We are going to buy out the Army&rdquo; or &ldquo;We are going to buy out the Post Office&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We will not continue to send letters for twopence into the hillsides.  We will restrict our activities to the city where we can make a profit and pay off losses very easily.&rdquo; I wonder whether in the case of such an institution as the Post Office or the telephones, the telephones which promise to be profitable, if some banking institution were to come along and make an offer for the purchase of this State institution what would be thought and what would be said of the private company?  I do not know what would be said, but I know what would be thought.  It is difficult for me to believe that nothing had preceded the proposal to buy out the State Bank by the Bank of Ireland.  I read occasionally the reports of statements of chairmen of banking companies when they are making their annual statements and for a long time I have heard of items of 15, 18 and 20 per cent., dividend, year after year.  Whatever may be the state of the country the banks are always paying.  One of these banks, the most prosperous probably, is offering to buy out the State.  That may be a little exaggeration; perhaps they have bought out the State.  They have gone a long way at any rate to buy out the State.  They are able, one bank with another, to control the State by threats of one sort or another. That, of course, is not peculiar to the Free State.</P>

    <P>It is, I think, a fairly sound statement to make that the banks do control the public activities of most of the countries in the world to-day.  They are in a position to control them.  They will only act perhaps when necessity&mdash; what they consider necessity&mdash;compels <Col N="2300" /> but they are in a position to control State action.  I think very often they exercise their power of such control passively if not actively, and one means of having in reserve a check upon that control may lie in the existence of an institution of which the National Land Bank might well have been the nucleus.  But this private company comes along and offers to buy out the State interest.  I asked this afternoon whether there was any guarantee against the Bank of Ireland, which is buying out the State interest, being itself bought out by, say, the Bank of England.  I do not know whether the Minister can give us any guarantee of that kind or whether he has any assurance of that sort, but I should be surprised if within the next two years the banking businesses of this country do not follow the tendency in Great Britain and other countries to amalgamate. There will happen with the existing banks here unless some kind of check is placed upon them, what has happened to some of the Northern banks that have become associated with and bound up with some of the English banks.</P>
    <P>It may be said that that is not going to make very much difference; that at present they are practically bound to the policy which may be initiated by the English banks.  If you take that view, then you may, of course, as well bow down and worship the banking institutions as the real governors of this island.  It may be so, but at least let us not formally acknowledge by the acceptance of this proposition that a private bank can come along, buy out the State, and initiate such a proposal. I think it is well worth while trying to remind ourselves of the history of this National Land Bank and to consider the sudden turn of events that seems to have developed.  Deputy Baxter has reminded us that this institution was founded in times of revolution.  The Minister referred to it this afternoon. He said that it was founded with certain definite intentions, which were enlarged after a year or two.  It has not grown to the extent that some of us would have liked, but I venture to say that the responsibility for that lies to a great extent with the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2301" /> The House at various times has been asked to agree to Bills and motions of one kind or another, with the object of regularising the work of the National Land Bank in every way and bringing it quite definitely into the region of a State-owned institution.  We were informed that the Minister himself was on the board of directors, and that a nominee of his was also on the board.  They have been given certain rights and, perhaps, privileges by the State to do certain duties which could not be, and were not, done by the other banks.  I wonder whether if there had been a real desire on the part of the Ministry to give this institution a chance to develop and expand, and to some extent to supplant private banking institutions, it would not have been much more prosperous and very much more effectual from the point of view of assisting industry and commerce. Had there been a clear indication that this was a national institution backed and secured by the State, I think you could have had a very much greater support from private individuals.  Certainly the bank's own business might have been much more prosperous if the State had given it more of its business. In view of the history of the bank and its association with the Government, it is reasonably claimed by Deputy Heffernan that the break should not come in this fashion, and should not have been announced to the Dáil in this manner.  We were told some time ago that the Banking Commission was to be set up.  We were informed later of the terms of reference and the composition of the Commission.  I have not the terms of reference by me, but I imagine that incidental, at least, to the inquiry of the Banking Commission would be the relations of a national bank to the State, and, perhaps, even the relations of the National Land Bank to the State. That being the case, ought we not to have the inquiry completed before we decided to cut adrift this national banking institution from the control of the State?</P>
    <P>It seems to me the decision that has been taken and announced so suddenly to the Dáil, presumably without <Col N="2302" /> any real opportunity to reconsider the matter, is dealing with the report of the Banking Commission piecemeal and without giving the Dáil any inkling of what is the general comprehensive policy of this Banking Commission.  Is the Government entering upon a considered policy regarding banking credit, note issue, gold reserves, and the like? Has it yet formed any clear idea as to what its policy is to be in these matters, or is this only the beginning, taking the first step without knowing where the rest of the steps will lead?  Has it any direction in its mind in regard to a policy on banking matters?  One would have thought, at any rate, that we would have waited until the Banking Commission had reported and until we knew what the general line of policy would be, and that the Dáil would be informed of that before the first step was taken.  I do not know whether as part of the agreement there is any guarantee to other people besides the employees.  I wonder is there any guarantee that the depositors or the borrowers are going to be treated as well&mdash;perhaps I should ask are they going to be treated as generously as the employees?  Are the depositors going to be dealt with by the new bank at least as satisfactorily as they had been dealt with by the National Land Bank? There is no guarantee of that.  I suppose, therefore, the depositors will have the freedom of going into one of the other banks and dealing with another partner in the general association of banks.  There was a chance that the National Land Bank would have been a check upon the rather rapacious activities of the banks.</P>
    <P>This particular action seems to be a definite break from the policy that was outlined in the early stages of the National Land Bank and of the Governmental movement that led to the establishment of the bank, that is to say, we are abandoning, for all time, judging by this gesture, any thought that the State is to control banks and banking policy, or to direct or check banking policy.  The banks henceforth are to be left to work their will on industry and agriculture.  If it is announced that there is to be no check <Col N="2303" /> on the free play of the banks then we shall know where we are.  This certainly seems to be the beginning of a policy of that kind.  I think we ought to know from the Minister whether the Government has come to any decision regarding the privileges that banks at present enjoy&mdash;these private banks, and particularly the Bank of Ireland. Is there anything else besides handing over these Government rights in the National Land Bank being agreed upon, or rather are we to take it that this is merely an isolated act having no reference whatever to State policy regarding banks, credit, reserves, note issue and the like?  It would have been much more decent if instead of coming to the Dáil on the last day but one of our meetings and announcing this very important departure from the policy that had been hitherto enunciated, the Minister would have waited until the Report of the Banking Commission had been made public.  We would then have an opportunity to discuss the policy as a whole and not piecemeal.  I hope the Deputies will press this motion to a division, and that we shall have the opportunity of registering our protest against this method of carrying on State work.</P>

      <P>As far as I can see, the method adopted by the Minister is perfectly illegal and unconstitutional. The Land Bank, as far as I remember, was the property of the Dáil and not of the Ministry or the Minister for Finance.  The Land Bank was founded by the First Dáil.  It was started out of the proceeds of the first Republican loan.  I do not know but I believe that I am the only private member of this House who took part in the campaign for the recruitment of that loan in this country.  With the exception of the Minister for Local Government, I am the only member of this House who took part in the campaign for subscriptions to that loan in the United States.</P>

      <P>At any rate, I do not think that anybody who subscribed to that loan either in Ireland or the United States, or who was interested in the success of that campaign, ever thought that they were contributing for the ultimate interests of the Bank of Ireland.  I understand that, under the terms of the Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds Act, all the assets of the First and Second Dála are vested in the Minister for Finance.  Apparently, under the provisions of that Act, the Minister claims the right to dispose irresponsibly of all the assets of the First and Second Dála.  Since the passing of that Act, this Dáil has voted substantial sums to the Land Bank for general purposes.  Consequently the assets represented by the Land Bank cannot be disposed of without the express permission of the Dáil, as at present constituted.  If the Land Bank was solely the property of the First Dáil, the Minister might, perhaps, argue that, in virtue of the legislation which we have passed, he would be entitled to dispose of it at will, but since we have voted definite sums for general purposes to that State undertaking, I think he is not justified in his assumption that he can dispose of this State property without the direct and categorical sanction of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson referred to one matter vaguely, and other Deputies, also, referred to it&mdash;that is, the text of the agreement between the Minister for Finance, in his personal capacity as principal shareholder in the National Land Bank, and the Bank of Ireland. I think it is quite obvious that if there is any doubt as to who owns the Land Bank&mdash;whether it is the Minister or whether it is the Dáil&mdash;the Minister should lay before the Dáil the exact terms of the agreement or understanding between his Department and the Bank of Ireland.  We have heard the Minister's statement, that the employees of the Land Bank are to be given two-thirds of their salaries as pension if they are found unnecessary by the Bank of Ireland.  The Minister has not stated what the position is to be of <Col N="2305" /> the Directors of the National Land Bank.  He has not said whether there is any undertaking that the directors of the National Land Bank, or any of them, shall be included in the directorate or Board of Governors of the Bank of Ireland.  In view of the fact that, year after year, we have voted moneys for this Bank, we are entitled to know the exact terms of this undertaking with the Bank of Ireland and the implications of the undertakings.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter, in connection with this transaction, which has not been adequately explained by the Minister.  The Minister said, this afternoon, that it would be absurd to hawk round the National Land Bank and advertise for offers for purchase of it. What is the position of the Bank of Ireland which gives it the right to make a private offer to the Government for the purchase of this undertaking&mdash;a privilege which is denied to the other banking institutions of the country. What particular right does the Bank of Ireland enjoy in that respect?  I do not see that there is any statutory obligation on the Minister to accept an offer by the Bank of Ireland&mdash;a secret offer, apparently, because the other financial institutions of the country were not informed that the Government were willing to sell the National Land Bank. Surely, from the point of view of the public accounts, if any State perquisite is to be sold, it should be sold to the highest bidder.  I doubt if the successors to the present Committee of Public Accounts will not have to investigate as to whether the sale of the National Land Bank was conducted, in all the circumstances, in a manner calculated to produce the maximum return to the State.  When being sold&mdash;particularly after periods of confusion and periods of revolution and warfare&mdash;a State's perquisites are generally sold to the highest bidder.  I wonder whether the future Committee of Public Accounts will be able to stand over the secret sale of the National Land Bank to a private company without any attempt being made to find whether there would be a better offer forthcoming.  This question may not arise this year, but I think it will probably arise next year, when the new Committee of Public Accounts <Col N="2306" /> comes to consider this extraordinary transaction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we may accept the sale of this Bank as the beginning of a new departure by the Government&mdash;a departure from the policy which was at one time mapped out. While I do not say that the sale is not a good one or that the assets are not well disposed of, I think that, in view of the fact that the Banking Commission has not yet reported finally and in view of the position in connection with banking, generally, in the State, it is rather unfortunate that the sale of this institution should take place at present.  The banks of the country are practically one.  They have some kind of secret council by which the same terms are offered to all customers.  Sixty per cent or seventy per cent. of the assets of the banks here are invested in another country.  I had hoped that something would emerge from the report of the Banking Commission by which the Land Bank might have been used to counter, what I may call, the monstrous charges which the combined banking institutions of this country are imposing upon citizens.  There is no business carried on in this country which is paying as well as the banking business.  The banks are paying dividends of from 18 to 20 per cent., while at the same time, industry is said to be depressed and agriculture is struggling. The gombeen banks seem to be the only institutions which are making money at present in this country.  I think Deputy Esmonde is quite right in his view of the sale.  It is distinctly stated in Article 11 of the Constitution that any proposal for sale of the assets of this State should be brought before the Oireachtas.  The Deputy has dealt with that aspect of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned, particularly, with the case of the customers of the bank. Many of them are farmers and many of them are creamery societies which have, perhaps, too much money on overdraft.  I am concerned to know if the Minister has made any attempt to safeguard the interests of those borrowers. I looked upon this institution as a means by which we might be able <Col N="2307" /> to reduce the rate of interest charged by the combined banking institutions. While, as it was functioning lately, there was not very much use for the Land Bank, I thought that, as a result of the report of the Banking Commission, it might be utilised to provide better credit facilities for the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add a word of protest to the protest made by other Deputies against the proposed sale of the National Land Bank to the Bank of Ireland.  I think the most amazing feature of the whole proceeding is the casual manner in which the Minister for Finance intimated to the Dáil this afternoon that it was proposed to sell the State interest in this bank to the Bank of Ireland.  One would think, from the casual manner in which the Minister made this intimation, that he was dealing with an old war-horse.  We are asked to agree to the sale of the State's interest in the Land Bank without having an opportunity of perusing the conditions of sale, without having an opportunity of seeing the interim report of the Banking Commission, and without having any idea of the form the final report of the Banking Commission will take.  We are asked to take a step in the dark.  We are asked to take a step not knowing whether, when the final report of the Banking Commission is given us, that step will be in the right direction or whether it will be a false step and inimical to the interests of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister this evening made a case which might in substance be said to be that he saw no future whatever for the National Land Bank, that it was an institution dwarfed in stature, that he saw no prospect of its growing up, that it was in the category of small banks and that he saw no immediate prospect of its getting out of that category. If that is so and this institution is a State bank, then surely the State is responsible for the bank being in that position?  Surely if the State desires it, it could get it out of that category of small banks and into that of big banks?  Those of us who hoped to see the National Land Bank developed into a great State-owned bank must feel profoundly dissatisfied at the proposal <Col N="2308" /> of the Minister.  We have heard here on many occasions that the present policy of banks is one not in sympathy with agriculture or the nation's aspirations or with industries.  In short, the banking policy is dictated by what they can make out of their transactions&mdash;whether there is going to be a profit, regardless altogether of what an advance to industry, agriculture or a local authority may mean to the national well-being.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that the banks' policy at present towards agriculture and towards farmers who invested money in land is one that is a negation of everything that a banking institution with any regard to the welfare of the nation ought to have.  It is well known to the local authorities that they cannot get money for public health works, for schemes of reconstruction and housing, and, as Deputy Wilson said, there must be some secret council influencing the movements of all the banks.  That is clearly indicated by the decision of the Standing Committee of the Irish Banks which was taken some time ago to charge a fixed rate of interest on loans.  I am of opinion that that Standing Committee has decided that no bank will lend money to a local authority for more than 15 years.  Otherwise it would be possible surely for some bank to break through the 15 year limit to lend to any local authority.  Let any local authority endeavour to get through the 15-year limit and it will find the attitude of the banks is the same whether they be small or large.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the point that so far as the banking institutions in the country are concerned they are all united in getting a fixed rate of interest and in a determination not to lend the local authority money for a period of more than 15 years.  They desire to get whatever profit they can without incurring any risks in connection with it.  I had hoped that the National Land Bank, with the aid of the Dáil, which realised the need for a State-owned bank, would become an institution which would be an effective curb on the activities of the banks as we know them.  To-day, I think, this <Col N="2309" /> action of the Minister is retrogressive and does not indicate that the Government have any sympathy with the idea of a State-owned bank.  Rather does it indicate that the Government are satisfied with the present policy of the banks in their relation to the national well-being.  I had hoped that the National Land Bank, owned by the State, reflecting the sympathies of the State for industry, for agriculture and for the national well-being generally would be an instrument of banking that this country could well afford to equip itself with.  But the proposal of the Minister for Finance indicates that in industry or agriculture the country need not expect any better help from the banks in the future than they are getting in the present or have got in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that under the terms of the sale the Exchequer would benefit to the extent of £203,000. That may be a very big sum, but I think it is small when we consider the asset we are going to give away, and, what is worst of all, give away to a banking institution that has shown in common with other banks that it has very little sympathy with the national well-being and is not disposed to look at problems and requests for loans or advances from any standpoint other than that of its own profit.  I suggest to the Dáil that we are not in immediate need of £203,000.  We could do with it if it were a matter of a gift or grant.  There is no need to sell the Land Bank to pay any debt, and we should not, unless we are satisfied that we are doing a wise thing, sell the National Land Bank.  The Dáil, above all, should not allow the National Land Bank to be sold in the dark.  We ought to know what the terms of the sale are and what the interim and final report of the Banking Commission are. We should see the final report on the question of banking before the National Land Bank is sold to a private institution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in reply to Deputy Cooper, stated that the Bank of Ireland is taking over all the liabilities of the National Land Bank. I should like to know if it is taking <Col N="2310" /> over the liabilities incurred owing to the high prices paid for land for expediency sake.  It is well known that the Land Bank was established in order to get over the land trouble, but instead of getting over that trouble it created greater trouble by inflating the value of the land.  The other banks had to follow suit in order to keep their customers, with the result that the price of land increased to five times its original value.  They had the example of the Government of the day advancing money on the value of the land.  They believed that the land was going to be a gold mine.  The Minister says that the State will benefit to the extent of £203,000.  If the State will benefit to that extent it will lose to the extent of about £500,000 by reason of the Land Commission taking over the liabilities for the foolish investments made by the Land Bank some years ago.  I think if the Bank of Ireland is taking over the Land Bank with all its trade, custom and branches through the country, it ought to take over the liabilities also for those purchases. I should also like to ask the Minister whether it is the Bank of Ireland or the State which is going to pay the salaries for the redundant officials?</P>

Some of the officials that are being pensioned were often opposed and, instead of being helpful to the State, were inclined to give information. If a good bargain is made I think it is on the side of the Bank of Ireland. I think it is proved when the Bank of Ireland stock went up 15 to 20 points within the last ten days.  I think the stock went up because it is a good bargain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of emphasis has been laid on the fact that the interim report of the Banking Commission is not in the hands of Deputies. It has been stated that we propose to take this action because of the interim report of the Banking Commission. That is not correct.  We are not taking action because there was a positive recommendation that the Land Bank should not be continued.  We are taking it because there is no recommendation of any function to be given it which would justify its continuance.  We have been quite clear for a long time that we could not justify the continuance of the Land Bank on the present basis.  Its continuance could only be justified if new functions were assigned to it, or suggested for it.  These new functions have not been suggested. That is the main thing, and would have been sufficient without positive recommendation that the Land Bank should be continued.  As a matter of fact, although we have not got the final report of the Banking Commission, I think all the ground has been covered, and that the final report will be something in the nature of a resumé, a linking together of the various recommendations contained in the interim reports. There will be nothing in any report which would cause us to hesitate in concluding the bargain which it is now possible for us to conclude. Certainly we do not desire a big State Bank organised on anything like the lines of the National Land Bank.  I have no hesitation at all in saying that whatever might be the fact at some other time in this country, or in some other country, a State Bank organised <Col N="2312" /> on the lines of the National Land Bank could not be satisfactorily carried on. When a person goes to an ordinary bank and applies for an advance, if he does not get it he may go somewhere else, or make whatever protest he likes to the manager or directors, but he does not attempt to use political pressure. We have people who did not get the accommodation that they thought they should get from the National Land Bank continually coming to Ministers and attempting to exercise political pressure.  If the institution had been a big institution that evil would have been increased enormously, and to such an extent that I believe the position of directors and Ministers would have been made impossible.  As a matter of fact a recommendation of the League of Nations Committee in connection with central banking is that it should not be subject to political control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to continue the National Land Bank and if we intended to expand it, it would be necessary to dispose of the sort of interest we have in it, and the control we have over it.  If we did not do that I have no doubt that one time or another, under some body, the powers vested in the hands of people with political responsibility would be bound to be misused, either through the exigencies of the State or political pressure.  I do not believe that banking business is a business that could be conducted by people who have political responsibilities, who must, more or less, be subject to pressure which can be put on people with political responsibility. Deputy Johnson suggested that the tendency of banks to amalgamate would cause the different banking institutions in the Free State to be swallowed up by banking institutions outside it.  As a matter of fact, one bank which is controlled outside disposed of all its branches in the Free State because its policy was not to have branches in a place which was separated politically from Great Britain. There is certainly a counter tendency. There is no intention of cutting ourselves off from any idea of helping industry or of concerning ourselves with credit.  I believe that before very long, as a result of the Banking Commission, <Col N="2313" /> we will be able to make proposals to the Dáil both for agricultural credit, long credit and credit for manufacturers and for industry.  We do not get anything by keeping the National Land Bank.  The National Land Bank was not able to do anything for credit because it could not get the resources.  Very little public money ever came into the National Land Bank.  At one stage of its existence it could have hardly carried on if the White Cross money had not become available.  Since the White Cross money became less, in order to keep the bank in cash every sort of attempt has to be made to transfer Government funds which we were not bound by law to keep at the Bank of Ireland.  We had to endeavour to transfer them to the National Land Bank to keep it in funds.  It was always a difficult thing to have the money available when wanted.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the National Land Bank was simply this, that people who wanted credit and perhaps who had a fairly good proposition went to it, but people who could make deposits did not go to it in any number.  The existence of the National Land Bank did nothing towards providing competition or towards making it possible that there should be competition for reducing the rates of interest. It was simply a very small bank which had to carry on just the way the other banks carried on.  It had not the germs of growth in it.  It served the immediate purpose for which it was set up. It has not been able to serve any other purpose.  It did something towards preventing the national struggle developing into a land war.  Beyond that it has not been able to do anything but mark time.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the interests of the customers.  I think the interests of the customers are safeguarded and also the interests of the staff.  The present directors will be continued in office for another year and they will deal with the customers of the bank as heretofore.  Thereafter, the engagements entered into with customers by the National Land Bank will be continued and people will be given the accommodation from the Bank <Col N="2314" /> of Ireland that they have had, and will not be subject to any pressure that they would not have been subject to if the change had not been made.  No people with one or two years' service will get two-thirds compensation.  The people it will be difficult to fit in, and who may not be taken over by the Bank of Ireland, are people in fairly high positions.  People lower down the scale can easily be taken in, and will, I should say, all be taken in.  The people higher up it may not be possible to find a place for, but they will be protected by the provision in regard to compensation.  I think it is only fair that they should be protected.  If all the staff in the branches were to be discharged and get two-thirds compensation the capital cost would be about £60,000.  Our liability in the matter is limited to £13,000.  I do not think it will amount to £13,000.  It is not contemplated that there will be very many for whom places will not be found. There is power under the Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds Act for the Minister for Finance to dispose of the shares held in his name in the National Land Bank so that legislation is not necessary.  The Report of the Banking Commission will be submitted to the Dáil before it re-assembles in November.  No action for the carrying out of the Report will be possible.  I have not yet had an opportunity of examining the interim reports that have come in, but so far as I have looked through them, it seems to me that in all cases legislation will be necessary to give effect to the recommendations. I would like to deny the allegation of Deputy Nolan that the Land Bank was responsible for inflating the value of land.  As far as I know the Land Bank was more conservative than many of the Joint Stock Banks.  While it was not as prudent, as events show, as it ought to have been, it, at any rate, did take a good deal of care and in many cases, as I know, greater care than was taken by the other banks.  As for the suggestion of Deputy Norton that it is a valuable asset, greater than the price paid by the Bank of Ireland, that is nonsense. I doubt if we have ever had as much as half a million in deposits from the public.  The country branches, I think, involved a loss, greater or less.</P>
