      <P>Go dtí an t-athló chun Sos an tSamhraidh go suidhfidh an Dáil Dé Luain; ná beidh ach gnó Rialtais ar Riar Oibre an Luain, agus go dtógfar Ordú an lae, chun an Dáil do chur ar athló, ar 10.30 p.m. an tráth is déanaí dhe.</P>
      <P>That until the adjournment for the Summer Recess the Dáil sit on Mondays; that the Order Paper on Mondays be confined to Ministerial business, and that the Order of the day for the adjournment of the Dáil be taken not later than 10.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of a series of resolutions which would be operative until the adjournment for the Summer Recess. After careful consideration we have come to the conclusion that it is a great tax on the time of members to attend here during the month of July, and by this alteration in the hours and in the days of sitting it is hoped that we will be able to get away early in July.  It imposes a very considerable tax on the time of members up to that period, but there is a general expression of opinion amongst members that a little more time devoted to the business and an earlier adjournment is more satisfactory than a lesser number of hours and a longer period of sitting. I think, although there are some who may not, perhaps, be taken as wholeheartedly in favour of the change, that they have been generous enough to give way to those who have very considerable demands upon their time during this season.  I think that while it may not give the utmost satisfaction to everybody, the proposed new arrangement will give the greatest possible meed of satisfaction all round, and <Col N="2150" /> will enable the Dáil to devote just as much time to the consideration of the business as if there had been no alteration. I move accordingly.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to the President that he should approach Ministers with a view to curtailing some of their statements.  We had a time-table before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges prepared by the President which allowed six hours to one block of four Votes.  On one of these Votes the Minister in charge spoke for nearly one and a half hours. If a Minister in charge takes one and a half hours on one Vote it will be very hard, however keen we may be to limit discussion, to cut it down so as to keep to the President's time-table.  I think I am right in saying that Deputies do want to adjourn at the beginning of July and that they are prepared to make certain sacrifices by foregoing time for criticism which they would otherwise enjoy, but I think that such a self-denying ordinance must not be expected from Deputies alone.  It should, I think, apply to Ministers as well as to everybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in a very considerable difficulty with regard to that.  On one occasion, in connection with the discussion of the Estimates, the Minister in charge was invited to make a statement expounding his policy.  Now, in view of a certain species of activity which has evidenced itself principally amongst the Press&mdash;I do not think anybody else takes any notice of it except Press people&mdash;Ministers have thought it well to devote more time to the preparation of a statement of their case as a justification for the sums that are in the Estimates than would otherwise happen.  In the case of one Minister at least an inquiry which he felt called upon to make certainly put a tax on the time of the House, but at any rate it disposed of the flippancies, inaccuracies, and exaggerations which occurred in the Press recently.  To that extent I find myself in a difficulty, because it would <Col N="2151" /> look as if one side were allowed an innings and then when the time for the return match came it was not to be played.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest to the President that he should either read the statements Ministers are going to make and revise his time-table in view of that, or that his Parliamentary Secretary or himself should sub-edit these statements.  It is not always necessary for Ministers to go into such detail. A Minister might easily make a statement lasting from twenty to twenty-five minutes that would cover the general activities of his Department. If further details were required the Minister could deal with these when he came to reply in winding up the debate. In that way we could economise on the time-table.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Go dtí an t-athló chun Sos an tSamhraidh, agus in ainneoin éinní atá in Ordú na Dála den 10adh Deire Fomhair, 1923, go suidhfidh an Dáil níos déanaí ná 4 p.m. Dé hAoine, agus ar na laetheanta san go dtógfar Ordú an lae, chun an Dáil do chur ar ath-ló, ar 8.30 p.m. an tráth is déanaí dhe.</P>
      <P>That until the adjournment for the Summer Recess, and notwithstanding anything contained in the Order of the Dáil of the 10th October, 1923, the Dáil sit later than 4 p.m. on Fridays, and that on those days the Order of the day for the adjournment of the Dáil be taken not later than 8.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2152" /> This motion fixes the hour of the adjournment of the Dáil on Fridays at 8.30.  As I said in my opening statement, these three resolutions do not commend themselves to all parties. There are objections to all three, but there has been a general acceptance of the principle involved in the three of them.  I would appeal to Deputy Gorey to modify his objection to the extension of the hour on Friday in view of the advance that has been made in order to make it possible to get all three motions accepted.  It really means only three and a half hours extra on Friday, because if one were to take in the time for questions on Fridays as a rule during the earlier portion of the Session, they occupy half-an-hour.  That has been taken off, so that the advantage derived by this arrangement would be four hours, and four hours for five weeks would be twenty hours, or almost a week.  While the Deputy would sacrifice a portion of one day it will be seen that the advantage derived is practically a week owing to the earlier adjournment, so that I would appeal to Deputy Gorey not to press his objection to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I cannot see eye to eye with the President on this.  It does not matter much to Deputies resident in Dublin whether we adjourn at 4 p.m. or 8.30 p.m.  With these Deputies it is only a question of getting to their homes a little later.  It is different with Deputies who have business in the country that needs sometimes as much, if not more, attention than the business of Deputies resident in Dublin.  The week-end is the only time they have any opportunity of attending to their own business.  If this resolution is passed Deputies would have to go home on Saturday and return on Monday morning.  You can have too much of a good thing, and this is too much of a good thing.  I, for one, will leave the Dáil on Fridays and catch my train at 5 o'clock no matter what is the business in the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Dáil desires to meet every day, or say on Wednesday or Thursday, at 12 or 1 or 2 o'clock, it would be much more reasonable from the point of view of country Deputies than the proposal in the motion which would make it impossible for Deputies to pay any attention to their own business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may see by to-day's Order Paper that the Committee of Public Accounts held a meeting at 11 o'clock in Room No. 2. That committee sits every day in the week, and if there were an early sitting of the Dáil, as suggested by the Deputy, it would mean that the Committee would not be able to do its work and would have to come back at the end of the adjournment to deal with that particular business.  This is a case in which it is hoped to crowd into five weeks business which should really occupy up to eight or nine weeks, and not limiting the time spent on any particular item.  It is hoped by concentration to achieve the same purpose as would be obtained if we were to sit until the 1st August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever may be the object in adjourning on 7th or 8th July I have already made the case that the only time we can get away from Dublin after the 8.30 p.m. adjournment on Friday would be at an early hour on Saturday, and on our return we would have to leave by an early train on Monday, with the result that we would have only Sunday at home in our own places.  We are not in the same position as Deputies resident in Dublin, who have their mornings to attend to their business.  We do not know during our absence from home what is happening until we return to our own places&mdash;although some Deputies may think we have no business to attend to.  We cannot agree to this suggestion. If Deputies think it is necessary the business of the Dáil should be carried out after 4 o'clock, and I think there are some Deputies on the Government benches who have the same mind as I have in this matter, then it must be done without us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the point of view that the business of the Dáil is of such a character that it could be gone on with in the absence of some Deputies.  I do not think any Deputy who conscientiously wants to do his part can feel that he should be absent from the House while certain Estimates are under discussion.  Every Estimate is of particular interest to every Deputy.  This is really a matter of arranging the programme so as to enable us to be present when the Dáil is in session, rather than to permit business to be managed in such a way as to have on at a particular time matters that some Deputies may feel are of no particular interest to them.  I want to protest against being asked to crush all this work into such a short space of time, especially in view of the adjournments that have taken place since the opening of the session.  In some weeks there were two or three days that the Dáil did not meet, and there were also some weeks that it did not meet.  I think it is not fair to ask the House to agree with the request made now.  It is undoubtedly a considerable strain on Deputies at present. Some Deputies will find it very difficult to attend on Mondays unless they remain over for the week-end.  If they attend here on Mondays it is only reasonable that they should be allowed to leave for home on Friday evening. Members of the Farmers' Party want to see the work that has been done on their farms during the week.  The pro-in pursuance of that understanding I would be reasonable if we met on other days at 2 instead of 3 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like Deputies to understand that I am not exactly a free agent in this matter.  I had an understanding with a Committee of the House that was, I understood, representative of all Parties, and in pursuance of that understanding I put down these motions.  If I am asked to agree of my own motion to make <Col N="2155" /> any change in the proposals I can only say that I cannot do so.  I could certainly not do so without seeing the same Committee again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be well for me to say that the Committee on Procedure was, as the President pointed out, representative of all sections. It agreed to the proposals which the President has put forward with a view to endeavouring to curtail the length of this part of the Session. Earlier meetings were suggested, but it was pointed out to, and accepted by, the Committee, that there was very little time for Committees to meet in the morning, do the necessary work, and then meet again at 2 or 2.30 o'clock.  It was considered that 3 o'clock was a reasonable hour to meet if Committees were to sit in the morning until 1 or 1.30.  There was a sort of suggestion that on Fridays business which was not considered contentious might be discussed, but there was no bond to that effect.  I must say that it gives me a great deal of pleasure to realise that Deputies have become convinced of the importance of being at all times present when the House is sitting. It has not been the practice in the past for Deputies to be so assiduous in their attendance, and I am very glad to hear the views expressed by the representatives of the Farmers' Party, that they desire to be present at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they give as much attendance as any one else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not putting one against the other in this matter. The observations that came from members of the Farmers' representatives do not accord with the practice hitherto, and I think the Committee had a right to assume that business could be found which would not compel the attendance of Deputies belonging to the Farmers' Party on Friday night, especially those who desired to go away.  As a matter of fact, I think it has not been unusual to find that even on Friday afternoon business has been found which was not of particular interest to the Farmers' Party or to any other Party.  However, <Col N="2156" /> if a new view of their responsibilities and duties has come upon any Deputies I think it is to be commended, and I would say that the proposal for meeting on Friday evenings might well, after a week or two, be found unnecessary. It may be found that the time table can be altered somewhat, in view of the celerity with which the business is passing through, unless, of course, we get an announcement of the kind we had yesterday from one Minister, that a new Bill that had not hitherto been under consideration was to be brought forward, and passed before the adjournment.  I think I am right in saying that there was no reference hitherteo of the extension of the Trade Loans Acts.</P>

      <P>If the hours for transacting the business are to be reconsidered, as a medical man, I hope they will not be prolonged.  A suggestion has been made that the Dáil should meet at 12 o'clock and sit until 10.30 p.m.  I believe it is both physically and intellectually impossible for Deputies to undergo that strain.  It may be said that the hygienic arrangements of this House are the last word of their kind.  All I can say about the atmosphere of this House is that at times it is most depressing and vitiating. How much the rhetoric of Deputies contributes to that vitiation I do not know, but when I look at the wan faces of Ministers, who come here after doing a hard morning's work and stick it out until 10.30 at night, I must say that my sympathies are with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy Hennessy know that there are a number of Deputies sitting on Committees who start work at 11 a.m. and go on until 10.30 p.m., and would he attribute a wan face to me?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the President to agree on this matter with us. <Col N="2157" /> We have accepted the Monday sitting without question.  We are prepared to go as far as anybody else in reason, but there is a point beyond which we cannot go.  Everybody knows that there is important business to be done in the country which has to be attended to.  Agricultural work is work that must be given attention at the proper time.  What is not done in spring cannot be done in summer or autumn.  I was pleased to hear Deputy Hennessy express so much sympathy for the Ministers with their wan faces. Probably that is due to the fact that they are the only faces he happens to see.  There are other Deputies here with their backs towards the Deputy who deserve just as much sympathy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. HENNESSY Dr. HENNESSY">

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hennessy hinted at one sensible course.  We could agree among ourselves&mdash;those of us who stand up on almost every occasion &mdash;to curtail our contributions to the debates.  We might be able to save a week in that way.  Some of us, including myself, very often talk for the mere sake of talking.  If we could curb that tendency, we might be able to get along with the business more quickly. Reference has been made particularly to members on these benches regarding attendance here.  Deputy Johnson spoke as if he were speaking of the Deputies on those benches.  He certainly looked at those benches when he was speaking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the attendance of Deputies on these benches has been as good as the attendance of any of the Deputies of any other Party in the House.  Time after time we have sat here from 3 o'clock until 10.30.  I admit that Deputy Johnson has been also a close sitter.  The reason I was not here yesterday&mdash;I may say that I think my attendance will compare with that of Deputy Johnson or anybody else&mdash;was that I was attending to other important public business.  I had to attend a meeting of the directors of the Waterford <Col N="2158" /> Meat Factory.  To come back to business, I would ask the President to have unanimous agreement on the question of a 4 o'clock sitting on Fridays.  We cannot sit an hour later than that.  The 5 o'clock train is the only train we can get for the South.  Even if an adverse vote be given on this question, we would have to get that train.  I think the President should meet us in a generous way and agree to our suggestion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, Section 2, line 25, to delete the figures &ldquo;1929&rdquo; and substitute the figures &ldquo;1932.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to extend the period during which the Rent Restrictions Act shall continue. The proposal in the Bill is that the Act shall expire in June, 1929.  The object of the amendment is to extend the period until 1932.  My principal reason for that is the belief that the housing supply cannot, by anything that is foreseen, meet the demand before 1932, that certainly for that period we are justified in expecting that the supply will be very much short of the demand. As a consequence of a free market houses would automatically rise in price.  I say &ldquo;automatically,&rdquo; because the urge has been from landlords and householders to be freed from these restrictions, so that they might collect higher rentals from the tenants.  It is not an extravagant prophecy to say that as soon as these restrictions are removed, with the supply of houses much shorter than the demand, there will be showers of notices for increase of rent.  There will be no protection for the tenant.  I am asking the Dáil to agree that the period of three years is entirely too short and should be extended at least to the year 1932.</P>

      <P>There is a slight difference between this amendment and one which was moved on Committee Stage, which was to extend the period of control until 1933.  This amendment <Col N="2161" /> is really for a year shorter.  As Deputy Johnson said, the main question is the supply of houses.  The supply of houses, we are informed, is, to some extent, affected by these Bills and Acts for restriction of rent and mortgage interest. That is the case that is made. I think it will be admitted that in very few cases of ordinary house-owners has there been any activity on their part since the first introduction of these Bills and they were the main providers of houses at the time when the first Rent Restriction Bill was introduced. Putting out of commission the main suppliers of houses was a very serious act.  The circumstances of the time and the necessities of the time certainly made a case for bringing in these Acts, and the question now which concerns us is whether these Acts are not reaching the end of their usefulness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Merely fixing the date at 1929 does <Col N="2162" /> not mean that in no conceivable circumstances will there be any serious consideration of the problem up to that time.  Putting down 1929 is an indication that this particular method of dealing with the matter must come to an end.  The 1923 Act has had a three years' course.  A considerable modification is noticeable in this Act.  If exactly the same set of circumstances existed in 1929 it will then be the duty of the Executive to introduce a measure for the consideration of the Dáil to deal with the problem that will then exist, but a proviso for a longer period than three years is, in my opinion, particularly unwise, in view of the circumstances, that considerable contribution has been made towards the provision of houses for the last three years.  In the circumstances I must resist the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 2, Section 4, line 51, to delete the figures &ldquo;£52&rdquo; and substitute the figures &ldquo;£40.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Committee Stage there was a discussion on the size of the houses which should come within the scope of the Bill.  In Dublin the figures were £52, £40 and £30 for the three successive years of control, and for the rest <Col N="2163" /> of the country the figures were £35, £30 and £26.  The Minister for Justice indicated that he would be prepared to consider fixing the figures at £40, £35 and £25 for the Dublin area, and £30, £25 and £20 outside the Dublin area. On this understanding amendments, which were put down in Committee, were withdrawn, and the Minister for Justice, in accordance with his undertaking, has proposed that these amendments, Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 should be put down.  I accordingly move amendment No. 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is pretty strong objection to the amendment reducing the figures from £52 to £40. Some justification might be made in respect of larger houses of higher valuation which cannot be adduced in respect of those of lower valuation, but, as we are dealing with amendment No. 2, I want to say that the reduction from £52 to £40 is very great.  It will, in many cases, mean that whereas in the original proposal a person paying £100 a year rent would be subject to <Col N="2164" /> the landlord's will after June, 1927, the new proposal is that houses of actually less rental, perhaps in the neigh-bourhood of £80, in the Dublin district, would be released in that way in June, 1927.  As I said at an earlier stage, the objection in respect of these larger houses may not be so great as in respect to smaller houses.  First of all, there are fewer of them and, consequently, perhaps more of them belong to the occupiers, but the distinction between £52 and £40 is too great and it brings too large a number into the landlord's power.  It has been represented to me that there are many cases where father and son, mother and daughter, have been obliged to occupy the same house and that they will be mulcted and brought into the region of the landlord's will in the matter, apart from any choice, in a year's time.  I do not think that the objection is so great in respect to houses of £52 valuation, but I think there are distinct objections when you come to those of £40 valuation, and I therefore oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>The objections to this amendment are very much stronger than in the case of Amendment No. 2.  We are asked to make free of all restrictions from June, 1928, all houses of £30 valuation, assuming the standard rent is always higher than the valuation. That includes a very great number of houses in the county and city of Dublin and in the city of Cork.  I want to draw special attention to the significance of the voting on these amendments. What I have to say applies more particularly in regard to this and to the subsequent amendment.  There are eight Deputies returned from the county of Dublin, fifteen from the city of Dublin, and five from the city of Cork.  These are the three places that are affected by these amendments. There was a good deal of discussion on the Committee Stage from the representatives of the county of Dublin, who are perhaps more affected than the representatives of any other constituency by this amendment.  But we have the curiously significant fact that Deputy Cooper, Deputy Good, Deputy O'Connor and the Minister for Justice, who were prominent in the discussions on these proposals in the Committee Stage have not voted on a single one of these proposals to-day.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry to hear that that is the explanation of <Col N="2166" /> the Minister's absence.  I have no doubt that if he were here he would be quite prepared to stand over his proposition.  But can the same arguments apply to the other Deputies representing Dublin county&mdash;Deputy Bryan Cooper, Deputy John Good, Deputy Bartholomew O'Connor, and the Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Desmond FitzGerald, all representative of the County Dublin and all representative of these people affected by this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Minister for External Affairs is concerned. I might mention that Mrs. FitzGerald has been unwell for a very considerable time, and he has had to take her away to the Continent.  The journey is very long&mdash;I think it took four days to get to where he went&mdash;and he cannot be back for a couple of days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I express my sympathy.  I may take it that if Deputy FitzGerald were here he would have voted against this proposal of the Minister to bring a larger number, an immensely larger number, within the powers of the landlords in 1928 than was originally proposed.  Let us take the City of Dublin.  Where are the representatives of the City of Dublin, representatives of these very large numbers of their constituents who are to be brought into the power of the landlords by this proposal of the Minister? We have one of those Deputies on the front bench amongst the Independents. Deputy Doctor Hennessy is absent.  We have one Deputy out of fifteen Deputies for the City of Dublin who is prepared to stand for the landlords on this matter, all the remainder being absent and not voting on this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they may not like to vote in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect that that is the reason.  They are in fact against the proposition of the Minister, but they are not prepared to vote against it.  I want to suggest to the rest of the House this consideration: in view of this immense preponderance of representative opinion from the City and <Col N="2167" /> County of Dublin against the proposal of the Minister, the House ought not, in the face of these facts, vote for the proposition.  Let us take the City of Cork.  Again that is a constituency that is affected by this proposal.  We have Deputy J.J. Walsh, the only representative from the City of Cork who has braved all the dangers and who has come here to-day to vote on this proposition to raise the rents of the occupants of houses which are valued at £30 a year and upwards from the year 1928.  Perhaps I am wrong, perhaps I may be a false prophet&mdash;but that is the proposition that the Deputy is going to vote for&mdash;to raise the rents of those houses in Cork city which are valued at £30 a year and upwards.  The remainder of the representatives from Cork do not dare come to vote for that proposition.</P>
      <P>Now there are five representatives from Cork, fifteen from the city of Dublin and eight from the County of Dublin&mdash;twenty-eight representatives, and probably not more than three out of the twenty-eight are prepared to vote for that proposition of the Minister; those three voting in fact for a proposal to give liberty to the landlords to rack-rent their tenants on and after June 1928.  I wonder will the representatives of the farmers on the other benches agree to allow to be done to the tenants of houses in the towns and cities what the tenants in the towns and cities refused to allow to be done to them years ago.  The tenants of the towns fought the battle of the land tenants against the rack-renting landlords.  Will the representatives of the country districts now help the town tenants against the rack-renting by the town landlords?  That is what you are asked to do.  You are asked now to give freedom to the owners of houses in the towns or cities to rack-rent their tenants in a time of acute shortage, after a given date, that date being 24th June, 1928.  I wonder do Deputies realise what they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about heavy taxation, and the undue burden of taxation.  I would ask Deputies <Col N="2168" /> if they have ever considered whether the burden of taxation is greater because it is imposed by the State than it is when imposed by a landlord.  So far as the tenant is concerned, he is as grievously affected by an annual charge in the shape of rent as he is by an annual charge in the way of rates, or an annual charge in the way of taxes.  And when you are proposing to raise that annual charge upon the tenant in the way that is done by the amendment, you are practically telling the people that all the talk about over-taxation is so much bunkum, that you are deliberately imposing this extra burden of taxation for no value received by them.  When you are dealing with social services, which cost so much in the way of taxation, people are getting some value, but when you are dealing with a tax in the shape of a rental, the increased tax that is now proposed, it is for nothing; it is merely to hand it over to the landlord, for no value whatever in return.  I say that there is no justification for inviting us to support this proposal to give the landlord power to levy an additional tax upon people occupying houses of £30 valuation after the 24th day of June, 1928, and I ask the House to refuse to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>It is hard to reconcile the speech we have just listened to with Deputy Johnson's well-known good memory.  He has given a colour to the absence of the representatives of Dublin County and others who definitely supported the principle of this amendment on the Committee Stage, and who had themselves put down amendments which went even further than this.  Deputy Johnson would appear to have forgotten entirely that the whole matter was threshed out when these Deputies were present and that, as the result of the arguments, and as a compromise, these amendments were withdrawn and this one has been put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what letters have been received.  I know that for my sins I took up this <Col N="2169" /> matter, not in the interests of the landlords, but in the interests of the tenants. I received a good many letters since, but I did not before.  The point I wish to draw attention to in this case is that the absence of these Deputies cannot be pointed to as showing that they are not in favour of this amendment, but that it points entirely in the opposite direction, that they had taken the matter as settled when the Minister promised this amendment.  Deputy Johnson has chosen to represent this amendment as giving a power of rack-renting. If his eyes had not been closed to the other point of view he might have seen that what it will really do will be to make it worth while for people to put their money into houses, so that better provision may be made for housing tenants, and their conditions improved and not made worse, by a better supply of houses.</P>
      <P>I think that anybody who considers the question at all must realise that it is that lack of confidence in houses as an investment which is largely responsible for the shortage which has put tenants in their present difficult position, that it is not worth while, and will not be worth while, as long as we have these rent restrictions in force, for money to be employed in that way, and that as long as that continues money will not be put into houses.  I think Deputy Johnson was hardly fair in attributing the absence of these Deputies to an unwillingness to support this amendment.  They were in perfect agreement with the Minister that the amendment was an attempt to reconcile their different points of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Morrissey lets me finish my sentence I will tell him why it will benefit the tenants. It is because it will create among landlords competition to get a good tenant, and once there is free competition&mdash;I admit that it will not come in one or two years, but within a comparatively limited period&mdash;once building starts again, as I believe it will start, there will be competition amongst landlords to get a good tenant who can be relied on to pay his rent and not to damage the premises.  Deputies on the Labour benches seem to argue on the principle that every landlord is immensely rich, which is not the case; that every landlord is infinitely wicked, which is not invariably the case, and that every landlord is entirely insane&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which is not always the case; that every landlord is prepared to extract a rack-rent by letting to a tenant who will be here to-day and gone to-morrow, probably not leaving any assets behind him, by taking a tenant who will damage the property far more than the additional rent that he will pay will compensate the landlord.  That is not the case. You have got to get back to normal commercial conditions.  You have got to get back to the atmosphere that exists in every other sphere of life, the atmosphere of free bargaining.  The tenant will gain from that as well as the landlord; at least the well-conducted tenant will.  The tenant who takes a tenancy for three months or six months and then departs leaving the premises in very bad repair, possibly will suffer, but I do not know that it is any business of the Oireachtas or of the Labour Party to protect that type of tenant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not, and in the poorest houses they are not. But the good-class tenant will gain, in the long run, because the landlord realises that it is to his own advantage or her own advantage&mdash;a great many landlords are women&mdash;to get a good tenant and to keep him.  Decontrol will produce that situation which existed in the past.  I do not believe there was a town tenants' agitation or a case of rack-renting before 1914. There was no grave or serious discontent as to the conditions of tenancies in towns, certainly not in the way that Deputy Johnson has held it to be in the City and County of Dublin.  There were houses being built.  There was great competition, and the tenant was able, in many cases, to pick and choose. I hope Deputy Johnson read the letter by the President of the Irish Auctioneers' and House Agents' Association that appeared in the Press, I think, on last Saturday, describing the conditions in the County of Dublin.  He is a man who is prejudiced rather in favour of letting than selling, because, on the whole, a lease gives a commission more often than a sale.  That was the condition in the County Dublin before the war, and it was advantageous to the tenant.  On the whole rents in the County of Dublin were not considered excessive.  I was a representative of the County of Dublin for a period at that time, and I got no representations as to unfairness of the existing laws.  We want to get back to that condition, a condition of free competition among landlords and builders to supply the needs of the tenants, and in the long run this Bill is going to work in that direction.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Cooper that this amendment is more or less tabled for the purpose of doing good to the tenant.  It would give the landlord a free hand to charge what rent he likes.  There is no legislation to prevent him charging 100 per cent. or 300 per cent. to an incoming tenant over and above what the outgoing tenant was paying.  Surely that is not in the tenant's interest.  I agree with what Deputy Johnson said as regards the representatives of the <Col N="2172" /> farmers.  It is up to the representatives of the farmers to support the tenants in the towns, because it is a well-known fact that were it not for the people in the towns the farmers would not be the owners of their homes to-day.  We find here to-day a body of good, solid representatives on the Farmers' benches being led away be the sweet words of the Ministers and their supporters on the Government benches.  We find them being led to believe that an amendment like this is tabled in the interests of the tenants. With control gone, and with the competition of tenants, the landlord would be able to select a good tenant who would be careful in looking after his property, while he could charge 200 or 300 per cent. extra on the rent.  Surely the farmers' representatives are not here in the interests of the rack-renters, the evictors or the bad landlords.  I think it is up to the farmers' representatives to support the demands of the people of the towns, and it is up to every honest-minded Deputy on the Government benches to support their demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said before, these Deputies went to the country and told the people that if they were returned they would support legislation on behalf of the town tenants.  This is legislation against the town tenants, and it is up to Deputies to fulfil their promises and to vote against this amendment.  It is up to every honest-minded man who gave his pledge to the people of the country to do that.  Of course, the Government has only to press the button and they can have a huge majority. Their supporters will flock in like bees into a hive and surround the queen bee &mdash;the Minister in charge of whatever Bill is under discussion.  I ask the Dáil to vote against this rack-renting proposition.  If passed, it will mean that when a house of from £20 valuation upwards becomes vacant, the landlord can have the choice of putting the house up for sale, or accepting the highest rent offered.  There is no question of fixity of tenure.  The whole Bill is in the interests of the landlords, and this amendment is introduced to give them more rights, and possibly to put more profits into their pockets for <Col N="2173" /> houses that they might have bought at cheap prices, probably twenty-six years ago.</P>
    <P>We are giving them an opportunity now of having these houses decontrolled, with the result that they can charge what they like for them, or sell them at prices that the occupying tenants cannot afford to pay.  Does the Saorstát Government stand for evictions now?  Surely that time is passed. I heard Deputy Gorey laughing.  He must bear in mind that if all the farmers' representatives of the Saorstát were of the same mind as himself, you would have a lot more evictions than you have.  We want to put an end to evictions.  We want to get the representatives of the people to see that justice is done, not to a particular class, but to the masses of the people.  I ask the Dáil to vote against this amendment and not to give the landlord an opportunity of saying, in 1928, to a tenant: &ldquo;That house you are living in now is decontrolled, I will have to charge 140 per cent. extra, because it cost me so much to erect, or it cost my father so much to buy, and I am not making any profit on it.&rdquo;  The result will be that the tenant, not being able to pay the rent, will be evicted, and he can throw up his hands and say: &ldquo;Thank God I succeeded in getting my own Government.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Cooper has again flown, but as he spoke, apparently with some authority, on behalf of some people at all events, about conditions in County Dublin, I, as a representative of County Dublin, wish to controvert completely many of the things which he said in connection with rents for houses in County Dublin. I have in mind at the moment one case where a person who desired a house went to the owner of a vacant house and asked him to let the house.  This particular man was prepared to pay one year's rent in advance, and he thought that that bait would induce the landlord to let the house, but when he went to the landlord the minimum terms on which the landlord was prepared to let the house was £50 for the key and two year's rent in advance.  I <Col N="2174" /> think that is evidence of the exploitation of tenants which will go on when houses are decontrolled at a time when there is not sufficient houses to supply the demand of the community.  I think Deputy Cooper cannot be altogether unaware of the fact that a good deal of exploitation is going on in the case of recently-built houses where those houses have been let.  Deputy Cooper made a point about tenants not writing to him complaining about the rents charged for the houses which they occupied, but after the speech which Deputy Cooper made to-day one must compliment the tenants on their good sense of judgment.  One might as well write to a landlord as write to Deputy Cooper if Deputy Cooper's sentiments then were just the same as they are now.</P>
      <P>My view of the matter in connection with County Dublin is that there are not sufficient houses to supply the popular demand and that exploitation of tenants will go on until such time as there are sufficient houses to supply that demand.  Decontrol is going to intensify the exploitation of tenants rather than to alleviate it in the way Deputy Cooper talked of.  Deputy Cooper talked of relinquishing control and of going back to pre-war conditions in the matter of house letting. Everybody knows that the shortage of houses is now much greater than in pre-war days, and if we are going to get back to free bargaining in the matter of house letting, then I think we ought not get back to free bargaining until such time as we are satisfied that the number of houses for letting to the public is sufficient to prevent landlords charging exorbitant prices for their houses.  I think that in County Dublin, especially in South County Dublin, there is a terrific demand for houses. Tenants are prepared to pay very exorbitant rents, and that is not to be wondered at, considering the scarcity of housing accommodation.  I think if this amending Bill goes through in this manner it will simply enable the landlord to exploit the tenant, and it will give no protection whatever to persons who are tenants of houses at present or who intend to become tenants in the near future.</P>

      <P>I am afraid we have strayed away from the amendment.  Deputy Norton made that quite clear when he referred to this amendment and then corrected himself and called it an amending Bill.  We have had a debate on de-control.  We have decided the principle of de-control. Deputy Gorey need not interest himself in the question of de-control at all.</P>

      <P>Some remarks have been made in connection with our attitude to this amendment.  Some Deputies take exception to laughter coming from some of the benches.  I do not think that Deputies should be annoyed if they raise a laugh, because it is really paying a compliment to some Deputies that they do not deserve.  We have heard a lot in this debate about honest claims and just claims.  I do not think there are two more abused words in the language than &ldquo;honest&rdquo; and &ldquo;just.&rdquo;  We have heard housing accommodation in Dublin and in some of the other towns in Ireland talked about very eloquently by Deputies, although these Deputies said not a word at all about the real cause of the shortage of houses.  It would probably be out of order to go into details now. One thing is clear: that we have not enough houses to go round for the people, but the direct road to having <Col N="2176" /> cheap houses is to have more houses, and plenty of houses.  I think that the principle of de-control as embodied in this amendment will aim at that, and for that reason I think it should be commended.  If these restrictions are removed the chances are that somebody in Dublin will be tempted to start building houses as a commercial proposition, and that is the direct road to better houses and cheaper houses.  We hear no references at all to the rents that are asked from tenants of flats or rooms, and when Deputies stand up here to talk about people who own houses they never tell us how much people are charged for rooms and flats in these particular houses.  There are people who deserve consideration besides people who own houses.  They are people who want home accommodation and they have to confine themselves to one room.  It would be interesting if Deputies told us what people have to pay for this room accommodation.</P>

Cork has not been re-valued for a great number of years; I do not know that it was ever re-valued.  Very valuable houses would not have a higher valuation than £30.  The vast majority of valuations of residential houses in Cork is under £30&mdash;under £20, as a matter of fact.  In County Dublin I know one particularly fine residential house with a valuation of £26 a year.</P>

      <P>Strong as the objections were to accepting the last amendment, the objections to accepting this are even stronger.  It gives landlords freedom to deal with houses, and to evict tenants in a much greater number than Deputies appear to imagine. It is proposed, at the end of three years from now, that all tenants of houses of £25 valuation will be charged a higher rental than they are paying now. Baldly and plainly that is the meaning of this amendment, and, as in the last instance but one, we were dealing with houses of £30 valuation, a very much greater number of houses of £25 valuation are brought in under this amendment. Thousands of houses in Pembroke, Rathmines, Dún Laoghaire, as well as in North Dublin, and in some parts of South Dublin, are brought within this category.  It is a notice embodied in this Act to those tenants, with the signature of every Deputy who votes for the amendment, that on and after the 24th day of June, 1929, their rents shall be increased to such a degree as the landlords are able to extract. There is to be no restriction whatever, and the notice that Deputies who vote for this amendment are going to give to the occupants of those houses is that, on and after that day, they will be bound to incur an increased rental, or to leave their houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the attention of Deputies to that aspect of the question they are now asked to decide.  The proposition made in defence of it, the only justification proposed in favour of this action, is that, in the meantime, before 1929, house-builders will be so encouraged by the prospect of being able to get whatever rent they can, from existing tenants of old houses, there will be such a competition that instead of having a shortage of houses by that day he supply will equal the demand.  That <Col N="2180" /> is optimism I cannot share, and can see no possible justification for.  We have had three or four thousand houses built in two or three years in and around Dublin.  The proposition we are asked to accept now is that within the next three years, ten thousand or perhaps twenty thousand houses will be built, so that the supply and the demand will approximate, and that the real value in a free market will have been arrived at.</P>
    <P>I say until you can show some evidence that the supply will equal the demand that there is no justification for placing this power in the hands of the landlords.  Deputy Gorey told us that it was necessary to take into consideration the charges upon tenants of rooms.  He imagined, sweet innocent, that was a subject that nobody else had ever given any consideration to but himself.  I would ask any other Deputy who is impressed by the fact that tenants of houses do charge, and are able to obtain, an exorbitant rent for rooms that are sub-let, why that is the case?  It is the existence of this inordinate demand for a supply of houses which is not present that incites the tenant of a house to sub-let at an excessive rent.  That existing fact will apply just as readily and with greater force to the owner of a house after this restriction is removed unless the supply of houses is somewhat equivalent to the demand.  We are concerned in this case with the tenants of houses of £25 valuation, and I ask Deputies to recognise the immense number of houses in that category that are in the County Dublin, in North City Dublin and to a lesser extent in South City Dublin, whether they are prepared to serve this notice of an increased rental upon the tenants of those houses, as on and from the 24th June, 1929.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to register my protest against this amendment, as I did against the last one.  As far as I can see, the acceptance of the amendment will mean that the occupiers of houses of £25 valuation will be completely at the mercy of the landlord.  I do not believe that if the amendment is accepted it will mean that more houses will be built.  Houses with a valuation of £25 do not spring up like <Col N="2181" /> mushrooms in the night.  Neither do I think that the landlords and builders are so interested in the welfare of the people, that because the valuation of these houses is reduced from £30 to £25 it is going to be an encouragement to them to build more houses of the same value.  Consequently, the question of more houses to accommodate people living in rooms does not arise on this amendment at all.  As Deputy Gorey mentioned, the people who are living in tenement houses could not afford to pay the rent that would be charged on a house with a valuation of £25.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I do not see how, under this amendment, you are going to relieve the congestion that prevails as regards the large number of people in the Saorstát who are without houses. In my opinion the acceptance of the amendment will mean that a large number of people who are at present able to rent a house will be driven into living in rooms.  The landlords will be put in the position that they can increase rents to such a degree that people able to rent a house now, will no longer be able to do so.  These people will have to go into rooms, and houses can only be rented by those who have larger incomes than the old tenants. In my opinion, if this amendment is passed, you will have more people than ever obliged to go and live in rooms or in tenement houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the industrial point of view, the amendment does not aim to do anything at all.  Its aim, as far as I can see, is to put more money into the pockets of the landlord.  Under it you are giving the landlord a free hand, and you are going to let him have his pound of flesh as well as his pound in cash.  I ask the Dáil to vote against the amendment, and to see that landlords are not allowed to charge rents which would be beyond the means of the people to pay.  I would be in favour of the acceptance of this amendment, <Col N="2182" /> if we got a guarantee that a number of houses would be built in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and other places.  We have no such guarantee, and it is simply throwing dust in the eyes of the people to tell them that the amendment will be instrumental in having more houses erected.  That is nonsense, and is only political propaganda from the capitalist's point of view&mdash;political, in that the supporters of the amendment can go to their own class and say: &ldquo;We as members of the Dáil gave you an opportunity of increasing your rents, so elect us again.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Government are elected by the people as members of this House, and if they are slightly influenced by the capitalist class, that is their sin and not ours.  The landlords can say to the Government: &ldquo;We are the people with capital, and without capital you cannot run the State. If you give us a free hand we will be able to raise capital with excess profit. If you do not give us a free hand we cannot support you and give you the money to run the State.&rdquo;  Consequently you cannot blame the Government, but you can blame the supporters of the Government.  I ask the Deputies who pledged themselves to the citizens of the Saorstát to be men at least for once and say that there is to be an end to rack-rents.</P>

      <P>I am quite sure there will be few Deputies representing country constituencies and small towns who will be influenced by this amendment. I know there is a very considerable feeling in the country that Dublin and County Dublin do not matter, but at least Galway, Waterford, Limerick, Cork, and the small towns in Mayo are affected by this amendment.  I will ask the House again to divide upon this proposal to bring in houses of £20 valuation and upwards.  That would cover a very considerable number of houses in the country towns, and I want the House to record itself as being either in favour of or against this attempt to impose further rents upon the town tenants in the country districts.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson's plea would carry greater conviction had it come from a country Deputy. Apparently country Deputies belonging to the Labour Party, with the exception of Deputy Doyle, have such complete confidence in Deputy Johnson that they feel themselves at liberty to fly.  Deputy Johnson has not put forward any argument at all.  The whole Bill has been drawn up on a basis of comparison of value.  Taking the metropolitan area on the one hand and the rest of the country on the other hand, a definite ratio has been arrived at.  Deputy Johnson now suddenly asks us to throw over that principle of reduction in the original Bill which has been accepted and carried by a majority. I think it would require more argument, particularly from country Deputies, before the Dáil should accept Deputy Johnson's amendment or even be persuaded to waste time taking a division on it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, before Section 5, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>5.&mdash;(1) Where the landlord of a dwellinghouse to which the Principal Act applies and of which both the standard rent and the rateable value exceed £15 is in possession of the whole of the dwellinghouse at the passing of this Act, or comes into possession of the whole of the dwellinghouse at any time after the passing of this Act, then from and after the passing of this Act or from and after the date when the landlord subsequently comes into possession, as the case may be, the Principal Act shall save as hereinafter mentioned cease to apply to such dwelling-house.</P>
      <P>(2) Where part of a dwelling-house to which the Principal Act applies is lawfully sub-let, and the part so sub-let is also a dwelling-house to which the Principal Act applies, the Principal Act shall not by virtue of this section cease to apply to the part so sub-let by reason of the tenant being in or coming into possession of that part, and, if the landlord is in or comes into possession of any part not so sub-let, the Principal Act shall cease to apply to that part notwithstanding that a subtenant continues in or retains possession of any other part by virtue of the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>(3) &ldquo;For the purposes of this section the word &lsquo;possession&rsquo; shall be construed as meaning actual possession and a landlord shall not be deemed to have come into possession by reason only of a change of tenancy made with his consent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the discussion in the Committee Stage, Deputies Thrift and O'Connor <Col N="2189" /> proposed that dwelling-houses should cease to be controlled when they became vacant.  The Minister for Justice undertook to consider the matter and accordingly, amendment No. 10 has been put down.  The amendment is, however, limited to houses whose Poor Law valuation exceeds £15.  The amendment also takes care to protect any sub-tenants there may be where the sub-tenancy is also a dwelling-house within the meaning of the Principal Act.  This means that where the landlord gets possession against the tenant of a house whose valuation exceeds £15, control ceases, but subtenancies remain protected even against the landlord until they become vacant.  The Minister for Justice in Committee indicated that even if he were to accept the proposal to decontrol houses on vacancies occurring, he would restrict it to cases where such vacancy arose by the voluntary surrender of the tenant.  On further consideration, having regard to the fact that tenants are fully protected and cannot be put out without proper cause it became clear that there was really no point in limiting the proposal to cases of voluntary surrender.  Every vacancy must be presumed to take place in a proper manner for sufficient cause and without undue pressure from the landlord.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 11, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 3 to delete the figures &ldquo;£15&rdquo; and substitute the figures &ldquo;£20.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My reason for this amendment is that the number of houses of £15 valuation occupied by clerks, artisans and shop assistants is very much greater than the number of the larger houses, and the number of those people who would be in a position to take houses at the larger figure when decontrolled is much smaller.  Even accepting, for the sake of the present argument, the contention of the Minister, that it is desirable to move towards decontrol, it is too big a jump to exempt all houses down as low as £15 valuation once they have become vacant.  I said on the Second Reading that I could see some reason for exempting houses that have once become vacant, inasmuch as most of those houses in and around Dublin are not re-let but sold.  But that applies more particularly to the houses of £20 valuation and over.</P>
      <P>I would point out in this respect that the sub-tenant, as I may call him, of a house which has been altered into different dwellings is not by any mean clear in this case.  In the case of tenements, once they have become vacant, provided that part of the house which is the tenement is of £15 valuation, any charge could be levied.  I think if the figure of £20 is inserted it will meet the case that was made and avoid what would be a hardship to a big number of people aiming at that particular kind of house.  The argument is stronger in the case of portions of houses sub-let, that is to say, made into a separate dwelling, and it is unwise, I think, that freedom from restriction should be made applicable to that class of dwelling.</P>

      <P>In line 5, after the word &ldquo;dwelling-house&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;by the voluntary surrender of the tenant of the tenancy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put in this amendment because of <Col N="2191" /> the fact that the Minister has drawn special attention to the needs for some such provision, and while it is true, as the President pointed out, that there is a certain protection in the case of the tenant who has paid his rent it is possible for the tenant to be deprived of his tenancy, and the house, in that way, could become decontrolled.  I think we could find at least an ingenious house-owner, more particularly an ingenious house agent, who could find many ways of putting the tenant here, to any degree a defaulter, out of his house for the purpose of securing freedom to impose any rent he liked.  Therefore I think the Minister's first thought was the wiser and that we should have words inserted to the effect that such decontrol should arise only when the house was voluntarily surrendered. I think it is desirable that these words should be inserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there is any necessity for the insertion of those words.  In no case can a tenant void his tenancy unless he does not pay his rent or damage the place to some extent.  I think it necessitates a certain definite and positive act on the part of the tenant before he would surrender any rights he had and I do not see the necessity for the insertion of the words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the position of the tenant who, by sickness or unemployment, would be unable to pay regularly and in whose case an application is made for resumption of possession?  Owing to the law in the matter the Justice has to give that possession.  With this kind of inducement to a landlord there is very much greater likelihood of that course being adopted by him to bring pressure upon the tenant than there would be if there were not this prospect of freedom from restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a discretion left to the court in that matter. An order for possession shall not be given unless the court consider it is reasonable, and I must say that while a very strong sentimental case can be put up in respect of matters mentioned <Col N="2192" /> by Deputy Johnson we must remember we are not dealing here with the ordinary commercial case.  We are dealing with a case in which profits are restricted out of all proportion to ordinary commerce, to the wages of the individual concerned, and so on, and I must say that, while a very strong sentimental case can be put up in respect of sickness and unemployment, an equally strong case can be put up in respect of a considerable number of people who have small property, and whose only means of support is out of this property, and who would be very hard hit if, in the case of three or four houses which they own, it happened that the three or four tenants were unwell at one time.  The guarantee in respect of those people is that the court must consider what is fair and reasonable. One person has the court behind him in respect of those rights.  The other person has no rights except those in this Act, and it is those rights which are restricted.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, before Section 8, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 16 of the Principal Act shall not apply to a dwelling-house while such dwelling-house is empty or unoccupied for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations, <Col N="2194" /> or repairs thereto or by reason of the landlord therefor being <i>bona fide</i> unable to obtain a tenant therefor at a rent equal to the standard rent and the increases permitted by the Principal Act as amended by this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the Committee Stage the Minister for Justice undertook to consider whether some provision could not be inserted in the Bill to cover cases of hardship arising under Section 16 of the Principal Act dealing with rates on unoccupied houses.  The cases of hardship are where the house is kept unoccupied for the purpose of repairs or where a suitable tenant cannot be found.  Amendment No. 18 covers the point.  There have been cases where population shifted leaving us as many as 20 houses, in a given town, vacant. No tenants could be found at any rent and it was great hardship on the landlord to be compelled to pay rates.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 19:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that the period of exemption of liability for rates in respect of houses which are empty or unoccupied for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations or repairs to shall not exceed three months.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the discussion on the Committee Stage the question was raised as to the legitimacy of the effort to find a <i>bona fide</i> tenant and the period of exemption. Under the proposed new section there is no period fixed during which the house may be considered unoccupied for the purpose of the execution of additions or repairs.  For the purpose of evading responsibility for rates a landlord might easily put in a couple of ladders, a whitewash brush, and declare that while those remain there the house is under alteration or repair. By that means he could prove, if there were a very slow-motion plasterer&mdash; perhaps Deputy Good knows of such&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have heard Deputy Good speak of such matters.  In such a case, this house, being unoccupied, would be exempt from rates for two years, and the Pembroke or Rathmines Urban Council would be deprived of rates on this house, and, therefore, would be unable to meet the loss on fines and such like losses imposed upon them by another Bill.  I think it will be seen that there is need of some period to be applied to this section, and I suggest three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not like to confine it to three months.  I have in mind a house, such as that which I mentioned to Deputy Johnson this afternoon.  I refer to a good dwelling house of £26 valuation, and in connection with which it took four or five months to complete the necessary alterations and repairs.  If considerable alterations and repairs were made in respect of a house, if they occupied more than three months, and if, in addition to that cost, the landlord was liable for rates, I think it would be unfair. I have not made up my mind definitely on the merits of this proposal but I think the period should, at least, be four months.</P>

If the second moiety were brought in from October to April for the execution of repairs it would be better.  I rather favour six months.  A period of four months means an operative decimal in respect to rates, but it is an unequal decimal, and I suggest that the period should be six months and we could have the matter considered. A different suggestion may come from another place.  If six months were put down it would not matter much, and it would achieve the purpose of the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In page 5, before Section 12, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a tenant retaining possession under the Act assigns or sublets his tenancy or any part thereof and the rent received by the tenant exceeds 50 per cent. of the rent paid by the tenant to the landlord the tenancy shall cease to be subject to the provisions of the Act of 1920, or the Principal Act, and of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was an amendment about which we had a great deal of discussion in Committee.  I think that everybody thought that we had come to a certain amount of agreement on the matter, but I understand there is a definite reason why the Minister has not adopted something on the lines suggested in this amendment.  I would like to take this opportunity of raising the point again, without, however, going over the arguments at length.  I understand that we will be told that, to a certain extent, this has already been met under the present law, inasmuch as a definite decision has been given that a sub-tenant becomes to his tenant exactly as the tenant is to his landlord, <Col N="2198" /> in so far as the Rent Restrictions Act applies.  There are two things to be said in that connection.  First, that that fact is not sufficiently known, is not known perhaps at all, and, secondly, if that is the case, it makes the case for this amendment even stronger.  If it is not in accordance with the present law that extortionate sub-letting should go on, it is clear that something further in the law is necessary.  I think an amendment of this kind will have a definite, deterrent effect on a tenant from attempting to sub-let at an extortionate rate.  If he attempts to sub-let at an extortionate rate he will be afraid of losing the rights which he possesses as tenant.  It may be said that the amendment does no harm, but I think it may do some good, and that there is a case for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a very strong argument in favour of this amendment, and one must recognise that the position that has been created by sub-letting, is a position unlawful in itself.  All this sub-letting that has arisen out of the exigencies of the case, and it has been admitted to be a more or less insoluble problem, arises against the law.  Because in an enormous number of cases, if not in all cases of letting, there is already a clause against sub-letting.  The tenants cannot sub-let in contravention of the arrangements under which they have taken the houses, in a vast number of cases.  All that this amendment asks is, where the tenant does sub-let, owing to overcrowded conditions, that, at all events, he shall not profit unduly out of doing that.  I think that is a reasonable proposition, and I should like to express the opinion that it will be very effective in the matter of this question of sub-letting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I rather gave the impression that this was exactly the same amendment that I put forward at the Committee Stage. I did not intend to give that impression because it is not the same.  I have altered one word.  I altered the word &ldquo;house&rdquo; to &ldquo;tenancy,&rdquo; in order to make it clear that if this more than 50 per cent. is demanded, it shall only affect the actual tenancy, and it shall <Col N="2199" /> bring the house outside the provisions of the Act.  It does not permanently put the house in the position of being affected by the Rent Restrictions Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I said the last day this subject of sub-letting and of sub-tenants making exorbitant charges was a very thorny one.  In approaching its solution by this amendment we are faced with having to admit that we base a case in law upon what is an unlawful act.  A sub-tenant is charged a rent in excess of what is laid down by the Rent Restrictions Act. And by having the law broken we proceed to make the law operative.  I do not know that it is an advisable way to proceed.  What this particular method of solution might mean is that a sub-tenant in a house persuades his immediate landlord that he ought to take a higher rent.  The moment the landlord agrees that sub-tenant lodges an objection and the house is decontrolled. I am not satisfied that this is going to solve it.  I do not know that Deputy Thrift ought to press it.  Sub-tenants have, in my opinion, certain rights.  I think they could exercise them.  They have made no move towards exercising these rights, and while they are a much down-trodden class, if one can believe the stories of the exaggerated impositions that they have to meet, they ought to make some effort to put themselves right and to be relieved from those overcharges.  Our proposal for dealing with gradual decontrol is a definite settlement.  This will be more decontrol. To that extent the amendment offends slightly against the principle of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have asked for up to this what I mentioned to Deputy Johnson a few moments ago, the voluntary surrender of all those premises.  This is something that is not voluntary.  It has its second disadvantage in the fact that those sub-tenants may have been receiving those rents for some considerable time.  In one case that I heard of, there have been sub-tenants in a very small house, and very considerable sums in excess of the ordinary rent paid by the tenant have been received for something like ten or fifteen years, <Col N="2200" /> perhaps even longer.  On the whole, I do not think that Deputy Thrift ought to press the amendment.  At the most, decontrol being gradually arrived at, this problem will solve itself.  The question then that we have to consider is whether or not, by an amendment of this sort, perhaps creating a very considerable amount of litigation, the results will repay us for the costs and disturbances that will take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite admit that I cannot see what the effects of this will be from the purely legal point of view, and in view of what the President has said, I am quite prepared to withdraw it, and perhaps it can be argued elsewhere.  I have done my duty.</P>

      <P>I think it must be borne in mind also that while the protection of the Act is afforded to sub-tenants of what is called a dwelling-house, provided it was a dwelling-house before 1919, the case of a house which has been constructed, or reconstructed, and turned into two dwelling-houses, or if rooms are let, as a separate dwelling-house and that that has only been done since this date in 1919, there is no protection at all.  The protection only applies in the case of a dwelling which was a separate dwelling in 1919.</P>

    <P>It will therefore be seen that whilst the estimated deficit for the present year is lower than that of last year, it is somewhat higher than for the year 1924-25.  The Post Office being a commercial establishment must, necessarily, have audited accounts like other commercial establishments.  In this case we happen to be two years behind time; the accounts for 1924-25 have now been audited and will, in due course, be presented to the Dáil.  They reveal not a loss as shown here of £535,309, but a very much smaller one of £471,000.  The difference is made up by having included in the Estimate the total cost of the abnormal pensions consequent on the Treaty, and, as in the case of the Commercial Account, having that abnormal thing capitalised. It works out somewhat in this way: In the present year a sum of £112,000 has been voted or is to be voted for pensions.  This sum will, in reality, work out in the case of the Commercial Account at about £30,000.  Therefore, the Commercial Account for the present <Col N="2203" /> year will not show a deficit of £548,738, but something in the region of £466,000.  I do not wish to weary the Dáil with complicated figures of this kind.  It should be understood that this Department differs from others.  It is a commercial one and it is, perhaps, necessary to give these figures in detail because of that fact.  I have just said that the last completed commercial balance sheet, that for the year ending March, 1925, reveals the actual loss in that year to have been £471,000.</P>
    <P>It will be interesting to learn how this loss is allocated between the different services.  A question bearing on that was put to me twelve months ago.  The figures given then were speculative. I now have the exact figures.</P>

    <P>These are round figures, of course.</P>
    <P>It may be as well to show how the postal loss of £290,000 is further allocated.  In the case of letters we netted a sum of £231,000.  The letter section of our business showed a gain to that extent.  In the case of postcards we had a profit of £3,080.  These were the only two items which showed a gain, the total being £234,080.  On the other hand, under the head of postal we lost £119,500 on printed paper.  This is generally termed printed paper matter as distinct from newspapers.  On newspapers we lost £66,200, on parcels £104,329, on registered parcels £81,600, on money orders £11,660, and on postal orders £11,600.  The total loss there is £524,199, as against the profit in the case of letters and postcards of £234,080, leaving a net loss on the postal side of £290,119.</P>

      <P>No.  There is no question of delivery in the case of money or postal orders.  Delivery would come in in the case of letters and printed matter, newspapers, postcards, registered parcels, and parcels.  Then you <Col N="2204" /> have also not only the delivery but the handling and the acceptance and all the other acts and transactions connected with the postal side.  Last year we made a substantial reduction in telephones.  The reduction amounted to £34,000.  Notwithstanding this reduction the loss on telephones during the past year did not exceed £5,000. You understand that we had a profit last year of about £29,000, and, whilst that profit is wiped out, we have suffered in the telephone section the small loss of £5,000.  We expect next year to turn that deficit into a surplus of about £2,500.</P>

      <P>The previous year we had a profit of about £29,000.  We made a substantial reduction, and because of that reduction we anticipated a pretty substantial loss.  The actual loss is about £5,000, and for the current year, because of the extension of the use of telephones, we anticipate a profit of £2,500 or £3,000.  In the case of post cards, which were reduced last year from three-halfpence to a penny, we anticipated a consequential loss of £15,000.  This loss has materialised.  The net gain in postcard business has been very disappointing.  It increased only to the extent of five per cent.  It is sometimes argued that cheap postage will mean an extended use of the post. In England, when the postal rates were reduced from twopence to three-halfpence the consequential increase was about three per cent.  In our case, where post cards were reduced, because of representations that were made to us from Chambers of Commerce and other places, from three-halfpence to a penny, the net increase has been five per cent.  I do not think that anybody will consider that very satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be well to give the Dáil some idea of the extent and nature of the work handled by the Service, taking for this purpose the year 1924-25, because of the fact that for that period we have been able to get a complete <Col N="2205" /> return, and the return has not been complete for the year just terminated. In the year 1924-5 the number of letters posted amounted to 123,000,000, delivered 130,000,000; printed papers posted 32,000,000, delivered 48,000,000; inland post cards posted 7,000,000, delivered 9,000,000; parcels posted 4,818,385, delivered 5,184,604; newspapers posted 8,698,000, delivered 11,000,000; telegrams forwarded&mdash;that is, ordinary private telegrams as distinct from Press&mdash;3,469,000, received 3,250,000; pages of Press forwarded 37,000, pages received 120,000; express delivery service performed&mdash;ordinary express letters handed in at counters&mdash; 10,516, and express telephone messages 664, making a total of 11,180; inland money orders issued for payment in the Saorstát 701,000, value £5,066,000, and for payment in Great Britain and Northern Ireland 152,000, value £851,000; foreign money orders issued 17,986, value £67,000; money orders of Great Britain and Saorstát origin 1,176,000, value £7,191,000, and from foreign countries 291,000, value £1,094,000; postal orders issued 3,572,000, value £1,437,000, and paid 2,702,000, value £1,189,000, and pension orders paid 6,162,000, value £2,742,000.</P>
    <P>I merely give these figures to indicate to the Dáil, firstly the nature, and secondly the extent of the particular items.  There are a good many others. We have followed up our process of extending the use of motor vehicles for the carriage of mails throughout the country.  Not only have we extended our Post Office service, but we have also changed the old horse-vehicle method of conveyance in an increasing number of cases where contractors are concerned.  That increase has gone steadily on.  Doubt was expressed at the time that we hinted at the discontinuance of staffs on the cross-channel services, as to whether these services could be maintained from the timing point of view.  We said then that we believed the setting up of a sorting office at Westland Row, and other changes which we were enabled to bring about, would make that possible, and we have certainly kept our word. Not only has the day staff been discontinued, <Col N="2206" /> but also the night staff, and the retrenchment brought about has resulted in adding £21,000 to our finances.  I might mention that we intend building a large sorting office at Westland Row.  The present office is suitable enough to go on with, but cannot be regarded in any sense as a permanent one.  It is being somewhat extended, but plans have been drawn up for the erection of quite a big sorting office there, to deal exclusively and entirely with Dublin postal matters.  In addition to the erection of this building, improvements in other buildings throughout the State are contemplated during the year.  The Limerick Post Office is being extended; we are hard pressed for staffs down there.  Improvements are also being made in Dalkey, Killiney, Dundrum, Terenure and some other offices around the country.  The rebuilding of the Dublin Post Office is proceeding.  It is hoped that the front block will be open for public business before Christmas. I expect also, that the Henry Street wing will be finished about that time. The front block, of course, is the one that we are mainly concerned with, though the other will be a help to centralise some of our work.</P>
    <P>During the year, the foreign letter mail services have been extended. Sealed despatches are now exchanged between the Saorstát and Belgium, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the United States, Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, India, the Federated Malay States, the Straits Settlement, Mexico and the Argentine.</P>
    <P>It will, therefore, be seen, that practically all of our foreign mails are despatched direct.  This is a policy that was initiated soon after the Treaty.  It has been pursued pretty vigorously, until we have now almost reached the stage when a direct exchange of mails is made with practically all foreign countries.  This, of course, refers to letter mails.  Parcel mails come under a slightly different category.  It will be understood that the volume of parcel mails from many of these countries would not justify a direct despatch, but it has so justified itself in the case of the United States, Canada and Germany. <Col N="2207" /> The number of parcels received from the United States has been calculated to exceed the number sent from this country annually by 137,000. Hitherto, this surplus of American parcels was delivered here without compensation from the United States authorities, and some twelve months ago, we requested a Convention on the subject.  The United States, in the first instance, offered what we considered rather meagre compensation for that surplus delivery, but after many exchanges of correspondence we succeeded in getting 30 cents per parcel for that excess.  That amounts to £9,000 a year.  In other words, we have got a nest-egg here which very few people had even thought of.  I wonder if it ever occurred to the British in their time, that £9,000 could be got for the delivery of American surplus parcels? The Cobh route has been utilised to the fullest possible extent for mails to and from the United States and Canada, and no less than six shipping companies now call at Cobh, and nearly 4,000 sacks of mails pass through there during the year.  In this connection, we have followed the principle of giving encouragement to every steam-ship company that calls at Cobh.  The individual encouragement certainly is not great, but it is something, and it is recognised at any rate that the State is prepared to assist and encourage that development.  All the companies are quite pleased to get even the small quota that can be allocated to any one of them.  I venture to say that this attitude has had something to say to the fact that we have so many steam-ship companies calling there now.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made with the United States for the acceptance of Saorstát correspondence for transmission by the New York-San Francisco air mail service.  The amount of correspondence for this service is not very great, but yet we find it necessary to maintain and to keep in contact with a service of that kind.  In the case of the Cairo-Bagdad air mail service we find a very general use has been made of it. This service offers a short route to India, and the correspondence with India is pretty considerable.  We find <Col N="2208" /> that the air rout to India is being fairly generally availed of here.  The whole question of Saorstát air services and their possible utilisation for the conveyance of mails is at present being examined by an inter-Departmental Committee.  Covenants for a direct exchange of money orders were concluded during the year between this Government and the Governments of Australia and South Africa, and it is expected that arrangements for a similar service with France and India will be completed in a short time.  Direct exchanges are also in operation with the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Germany.  More expeditious services are thereby afforded to the public, who are relieved of the charge of through-commission at the rate of 2d. in the pound formerly deducted in London.  Formerly, these foreign money orders passed through London, and in all cases the deduction of 2d. in the pound was made for that service. In the case of this country that deduction has now terminated to the advantage of the sender of the money order.</P>
    <P>Prior to the imposition of the 6d. delivery fee from the 1st September, 1924, about 19,600 post parcels were despatched weekly to places outside and 54,000 weekly were imported.  According to the latest returns taken in November last the number of parcels despatched remains, roughly, the same, but the number of incoming parcels has fallen to 36,600 weekly.  About 4,000 of these come from places other than Gt. Britain and the Six Counties.  This leaves a balance of about 13,000 surplus incoming as against outgoing parcels, but the fact is that since the imposition of the tax the number of incoming parcels has fallen very appreciably. The revenue from the parcel delivery fee, non-dutiable parcels, is £33,000 a year approximately, and from the Customs clearance fee, dutiable parcels, £15,000 a year, giving a total of £48,000 a year.  As to the inland parcel post cash-on-delivery service, Deputies, I am sure, will be anxious to know how it is progressing. It was introduced as an experiment in 1924 as a result of demands from Deputies and the general public.  The extent of its utilisation, however, fell <Col N="2209" /> much short of anticipations.  We found it hard at the outset, notwithstanding repeated efforts on our part, to advertise the service, to get it going and to get people to realise its utility.</P>
    <P>Latterly, however, it has shown an improving tendency, though that tendency is practically confined to Dublin. We had hoped that agriculturists would have availed of this service to send goods to cities and towns, but I must say we have been disappointed. So far, at any rate, very little use is being made of it.  In April of last year the number of parcels posted on this cash-on-delivery basis was 345.  That was somewhat above the normal, because in May and June following the numbers were 288 and 258 respectively. January of this year shows an upward curve with 487; February, 436; and March, 594.  As a matter of fact this cash-on-delivery business is practically doubling itself every year.  Whether it will continue to do so or not is another thing, but that is the experience so far. Its institution has not resulted in loss to the service, but I cannot say that we have made any very great profit, though it will, however, pay its way and has been doing so.</P>
    <P>I now propose to give a comparative statement of telephone development since 1922.  In 1922 there were 194 exchanges in the country.  I suppose Deputies know what an exchange is as distinct from a call office.  An exchange is an office in which there are a number of subscribers, and a call office is merely a terminal post office. It terminates with the post office.  That is the difference between the two.  In 1922 the number of exchanges was 194, and in 1926, 388, showing an increase of 194 exchanges.  In 1922 there were 552 call offices, and in 1926 that number had increased to 826, an increase of 274.  As regards stations, otherwise subscribers, in 1922 there were 19,101, and in 1926, 22,946, an increase of 3,147.  Rural party lines have only increased by 1, otherwise from 3 to 4. There are 19 subscribers.  We endeavoured to extend this party line system during last year.  The minimum cost per station is £4.  It provides a service not only between the various subscribers on the single line, but also <Col N="2210" /> with the local exchange, free, gratis and for nothing, the total cost being only £4 in cases where there are three subscribers to the mile on the line.  Up to now we have not been very successful in spreading this party line system. That is rather unfortunate, as that system is in very general use in other countries, particularly among farming communities.  It may be that it will extend here later on, but up to now we have not had a very encouraging response. In the case of subscribers I have said that the net increase amounted to only 3,147.  As a matter of fact, since 1922 we have actually put in over 12,000 installations, but we have lost over 8,000 subscribers in that time.  The loss of many of that 8,000 could perhaps be traced to a reduction of the telephone service used by the military.  At the same time it cannot be denied that many business people who had the telephone have given it up, I suppose through a decline in business, failures and causes of that kind.</P>
    <P>We have extended the telephones very generally throughout the country and done our best to get new subscribers. It appears to me that the telephone habit has not yet caught on here and the public have not fully wakened up to the value of the telephone.  We have done our part.  We have made the service practically universal.  Every town and village, I think I can truly say, will have an installation by the time the next report is presented here, yet the public do not seem to cut in. They do not seem to realise the commercial value of this service, and it can hardly be claimed that the telephone is expensive.  A very substantial cut was made in it last year.  A private person may have a telephone, let us say in Dublin, for a sum not exceeding £8 a year.  That is not excessive, but nevertheless we find it difficult enough to get subscribers.  I hope the outlook will change.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is slightly lower than that in England.  I am not in a position to say how it compares with <Col N="2211" /> Continental countries, though I have a feeling that it is higher than in some of them.  I am equally satisfied that the telephone must be made cheaper.  I am satisfied on that, and whatever reduction can be made because of the financial position of the Post Office at any time should, I think, in the first instance pass its weight on to the telephone. I see a greater hope of development through this medium than through any other.  During the past year 147 new exchanges and 101 new call-offices were opened, and 31 new trunk circuits with a mileage of 1,350 were erected. Eighty-seven additional telephone circuits were provided for the Gárda Síochána, and 45 life-boat saving stations were equipped.  Western Deputies will possibly expect to hear something about the progress in Connaught. With the exception of Galway, Connaught had no telephones whatever until last year.  In my last statement I promised a rapid development in that quarter, and I hope Deputies will realise that I am trying to keep my word.  Development in western areas is progressing rapidly, and new exchanges have been opened at Roscommon, Tuam, Loughrea, Ballymote, Manorhamilton and Castlerea.  The programme for this year includes exchanges at Carrick-on-Shannon, Boyle, Ballaghaderreen, Bundoran, Ballyshannon, Donegal, Claremorris, Ballina, Castlebar and Westport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>We intend to construct, during the coming year, 20 additional trunk circuits to meet increased traffic and about 20 junction circuits which will be required for new exchanges and the continuance of underground schemes.  We intend also to put up a number of overhead trunk lines, which will connect with existing exchanges, to meet increased traffic and to serve proposed new exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work in connection with the provision of automatic exchanges at Ship Street and Merrion Street and the replacement of private branch exchange <Col N="2212" /> equipment in preparation for automatics, is proceeding.  New equipment for the existing exchange at Limerick and for constructional alterations at Cork, Limerick and Cobh is on hands. We are converting a great number of the smaller telegraph circuits into telephones. The telephone is more easily manipulated, and it is also possible of utilisation as a medium of public call.</P>
    <P>Telephone kiosks have been installed at several railway stations.  One has been erected at College Green.  The delay in erecting others is due to the difficulty of securing sites from the Dublin Commissioners.  We are extending the system of kiosks to other cities.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that we lost on telegraphs, in the year 1924-5, £178,000. That loss is continuing to grow.  Telegraph services are being replaced everywhere possible by telephones.  I see no future for the telegraphic service. I believe it will finally be reduced to Press work and long-distance traffic. It is certainly a reducing service.  It is also a very costly service to the State, as I pointed out on previous occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

      <P>Every telegram costs the State, in addition to the charge of one shilling for twelve words, an extra shilling.  That means that the taxpayer contributes one shilling for every message sent over the telegraph wires. Telegraph porterage fees collected during the current year amount to about £25,000.  The figure for porterage fees during the previous year was, roughly, £41,000.  I attribute this decline to the extension of the telephone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and also to the fact that people are not sending telegrams because they are learning sense, or have less money to spend, or rather to throw away.  During the year&mdash;since the date of the last report&mdash;examinations have been held for the following classes:&mdash;Boy messengers at Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford; boy messengers at provincial offices generally; girl probationers at Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford; specially <Col N="2213" /> nominated auxiliary postmen for provincial offices; skilled workmen, engineering branch; storemen in the stores branch; post office assistants, grade B, confined to temporary officers and ex-National Army candidates with necessary telegraphic and other qualifications; and clerical officers, confined to Post Office assistants and postmen.</P>
      <P>The Dáil will be interested to hear something about the working of the Savings Bank.  This is a new service, new to the extent that the work was carried out in its entirety in London formerly; we were merely collecting agents, and now we are solely in control. The balance due to depositors on the 31st December, 1924, amounted to £2,124,000.  Deposits by cash during the year 1925 amounted to £1,181,605, and the number of depositors 449,460. The gross total of deposits on the 31st December, 1925, was £3,306,304.  Withdrawals during the year 1925 numbered 197,772, and the amount totalled £927,263.  The balance due to depositors on the 31st December, 1925, was £2,372,279.</P>
      <P>Savings Certificates form another branch in regard to which we are responsible to the Minister for Finance. The balance due to investors on the 31st March, 1925, was £1,175,285.  Sales of Savings Certificates during the year ending 31st March, 1926, numbered 3,210, and the total of the purchase money was £462,571.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now come to the stores and factory. On the 1st January, 1925, we had 250 hands employed in the factory. A year later that number was reduced to 154, contracts which were formerly completed at St. John's Road having been handed out to private contractors. That would be one of the main reasons for the decline.  The Stores Department of the Post Office handled the following contracts during the year:&mdash; For the Post Office and common services, £173,000; for use of other Government Departments, £168,000. Out of these two sums, £258,000 was spent on Irish manufactured articles; £48,000 was spent on British manufactured articles and £35,000 went to other countries.  The creosoting of telegraph poles was formerly, in the <Col N="2214" /> main, done in England.  I believe some small quantities were done in Belfast, but very little, if any were done in the Saorstát.  Now all the creosoting that has to be done is done here.  Two new factories, one in Cork, and one in Dublin, are largely maintained through this post-office work.</P>

      <P>It will, perhaps, be no harm to refer to a question, which has been mentioned more than once in recent times, that of civil servants who retired under Article 10 of the Treaty.  I think it has been alleged, on more than one occasion, that the Government is responsible for many of those people quitting the service.  Here is our return in regard to the post-office.  The number of applications received, up to 31st March, 1926, was 1,026; the number forwarded to the Department of Finance, up to that date, was 1,021; the number allowed to leave the post office was 658, the number disallowed 69, and the number of withdrawals was 99.  Ninety-nine per cent. of the total applications were resisted.  It is well to remember that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the number has been approximately about one hundred.  Last year several Deputies advocated the adoption of a reduced rate for local letters and parcels.  I think I am right in saying Deputy Good associated himself with the proposal, or perhaps it was Deputy Hewat. It was one of them at any rate.  We have gone carefully into the question, <Col N="2215" /> but found that it would result in a very heavy loss, and, if applied to, let us say, the three cities of Cork, Waterford and Dublin, it would mean a loss of something like £70,000 or £75,000. We do not anticipate that the volume of correspondence consequent upon that decrease would appreciate very much.  It is our opinion that it would not.  We have given the matter a considerable amount of consideration and we are satisfied that we would not be justified in embarking on a reduced charge for local deliveries.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies last year suggested that we ought to facilitate the farming community at fairs by keeping the post offices open up to 8 o'clock, or even later.  Deputy D'Alton was specially associated with that request.  We accepted the proposal, and put it into practice for a year, but, I am sorry to say, it has not been utilised.  I will just give a case in point.  In Ballina, where eight fairs were held during the year, we did not transact one single item of business in these extra hours during any one of the eight extensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, to the evenings before the fair.  I have referred to a number of the main services, but there are a number of other services which I have not touched upon, such as Old Age Pensions, issue of Unemployment Insurance, National Health Insurance, Entertainment Tax.  Inland Revenue Stamps, the issue of Dog and Inland Revenue Licences, Army and Navy allowance forms and the collection of rates in certain counties.  These services, though apparently insignificant, are nevertheless pretty important, and they occupy quite a considerable part of our time.  There are other similar services to which I have not referred, but I think I have sufficiently dealt with these main ones.  Two years ago I predicted that within the next half a dozen years the postal service should pay its way. It is moving in that direction, not quite as rapidly as I had anticipated, but nevertheless it is moving towards a balance.  The revenue has been declining steadily, unfortunately.  In 1923-24 our revenue amounted to £1,752,000; in 1924-25 £1,704,000, and in 1925-26 it dropped to £1,688,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, though we economised to the extent of about £100,000 during those years, we lost practically that sum through declining revenue. If business should increase, and assuming, also, though it may be optimistic to assume it, that the cost of living will decline, I venture to say we will be moving fairly rapidly to the ideal which I held out.  In any case, I do not think we will suffer a further decline in revenue.  During the last three or four months I noticed that our revenue was on the upper grade.  It possibly portends increasing business in the country.  As a matter of fact, we have anticipated an increased revenue of about £30,000 for this year.  I hope this will materialise.  There is nothing else that I wish to say in connection with the report, except that the staff has continued to give loyal service. As far as the public are concerned they seem reasonably well satisfied with that service.  We are doing everything possible to meet the desires of not only the commercial community, but the public generally.  I do not suppose that we can satisfy everybody; that is a rather high ideal to aim at. <Col N="2217" /> But on the whole I am satisfied that the public realises that the Post Office service is satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Say Press messages. The messages sent were 37,000 and the messages received 120,000.  That is a big excess.  I wonder is there any equivalent payment similar to the payment in respect of parcels from America.  I gathered that there was a considerable loss in the telegraph service, as a whole, and that very great excess presumably does not represent any payment on account of those messages. What I desire to know is, is there any payment made in respect of messages received in excess of those that we send?</P>

      <P>There are two things that I want to say.  One is that I think the Post Office are entitled to great credit for the manner in which they have adapted themselves to the situation arising out of the strike in Great Britain.  The Post Office, it seems to me, have explored every avenue in order to get mails away both to Great <Col N="2218" /> Britain and to the Continent of Europe, and they are entitled, I think, to the gratitude of the Dáil and the community on that ground.  The other point is less satisfactory.  The Government programme allots three hours for this Vote.  Of these three hours one hour and ten minutes have been occupied by the Minister.  I do hope that, as we have been invited repeatedly by the Minister for Finance, and other Ministers, to criticise them, that we shall be given a fair opportunity of doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us some information as to the nature of the contracts carried out by the Stores Department?  He simply gave us bulk figures, showing the total amount of the contracts without giving us any details.  Could he give us also some information as to whether competitive estimates were obtained by any of these Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>In all cases competitive estimates have been obtained for contracts for the Stores Department. Estimates are given by the Government Contracts Committee.  The Stores Department is engaged, of course, mainly in repair work.  The contract work is a very small section, scarcely worth mentioning.  As I have stated, we have pretty well got out of the contract business, and this staff of 150 odd men, to which I referred, is engaged mainly in Post Office repair work which we must necessarily do.  We save pretty considerably on it.</P>

The Contracts Department is under the manager of the Stores Department.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we come to the sub-heads, I would like to say a few words on the main question of policy.  I want to say that while I appreciate the efforts which have been made to economise in the Post Office service, and while I am glad to see that the Post Office is being run at a smaller loss than in past years, I think we should recognise that the Post Office is a business concern, and should be so regarded by those in charge, and that it should be run so as to put it on a paying basis, rather than that the Minister must come to the Dáil each year and report a deficit.  There are just one or two matters that I want to refer to, which may be regarded as questions of general policy.  I want to talk about the telephone service which the Minister has referred to, and with particular advertence to the party-line system.  I was very sorry to hear from the Minister that during the past year there has only been an increase of one party-line.  I spoke on this matter last year, and I urged the Minister to get this party-line system taken up by the rural population.  I am sorry to see that it has been so badly responded to.  I have been thinking about it recently, and I believe one of the difficulties regarding a party-line installation in the country districts is that the people of the towns have not taken up the telephone system in the way that they should.  It is very little use for farmers joining together for a party-line installation, if, when they have taken it up, they cannot call up the people whom they want to call up in the towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2220" /> My experience of the use of telephone systems in other countries was that every business establishment in the towns had an installation, so that a farmer or anybody living in the rural districts who wanted to call them up could get them, but as things stand at present we find that there are only three or four telephone installations in small towns, and they are not very often in business establishments at all.  I am inclined to think that before we can hope for any great success in the establishment of the party-line system, we will first need to get people to take the telephone system more readily than they have up to the present.  That I regard as an inevitable development. What we must do is to try to encourage and by every kind of advertisement and propaganda, try to make business people realise it is to their own interest to install telephones.  We hear a lot about the backwardness of the farming community.  My opinion is that if it is backward, it is certainly not alone in that position and the business people in the small towns are just as backward.  I do not know if there are any other people who are slower to take advantage of modern improvements, but I would suggest that every effort should be made to get business people in towns to install telephones. Then we can get the country people to respond.  I think it should be pointed out to them that it will surely be a great advantage to them, from the point of view of business, that it will facilitate business, and perhaps keep business away from the larger cities.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister has not seen his way to make some reduction in postal charges.  The Minister has shown that his revenue has decreased from year to year.  I am inclined to think that possibly the best way to increase revenue is to make a decrease in the postal charges.  I think it is generally found that people respond quickly to any decrease in postal charges, and if the price of a stamp for ordinary letters were reduced to three-halfpence I believe that the response might actually bring in a greater revenue than the Minister gets on the twopenny stamps.  The present price certainly hampers and retards <Col N="2221" /> business.  People are slow to write letters when it would cost twopence for a stamp.  The same thing applies to charges for the delivery of telegrams in the rural districts.  That is nothing new.  We have made strong complaints already about it, and it is a pretty serious grievance, that we who live in outlying districts, have to pay such enormous charges.  I live just beyond the three-mile limit, and I have to pay 1/6 for my telegrams on delivery. That means, for instance, that if I am going home, and if I telegraph to someone to meet me at the station, it costs 2/6, including delivery charge.  It would be almost as cheap for me to hire a car at the station as to telegraph for someone to come and meet me.  I would almost suggest that it would be worth the Minister's while to risk a certain loss in this regard, in the first case.  There is also the point of view of policy and general principle, and we maintain that the same privileges which are granted to the urban population should be granted to the rural population, that we contribute as much, if not more, to the upkeep of the State and the Post Office as they do, and we should have the same rights as they have in regard to postal deliveries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask Deputy Heffernan, if I might, to tell us exactly what is meant by this plea for treating the postal service as a business service, that it should be put on a paying basis, that it should not be necessary for the Minister to come to the Dáil to report a deficit.  I felt curious to know how the Deputy would follow that proposition, but I was amazed when I heard him calling for a three-halfpenny rate on letters, following his demand that it should be put on a business basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had explained that a reduction of the postal fees to 1½d. would actually increase the revenue by increasing the number of letters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed by the Deputy, not having listened to the Minister, that a decrease in the rates would increase the revenue.  He also claims that the same facilities should <Col N="2222" /> be given to rural residents as are given to the towns.  While I am prepared to concede that point, to a very great degree, I realise from the Minister's statement that it would be impossible even to give the same attention to rural services unless he received the profit which he derives from the town services. We were told there was a very considerable profit on the distribution of letters, and, having heard the Minister, I am pretty confident that the profit arises from the posting and delivery of letters in towns and not in the country districts.  If we are going to put this on a business basis it means that the rural services will have to be cut very much further than at present. I think it is desirable that we should know exactly what is the policy represented by Deputy Heffernan in this matter.  Is it desired that the Post Office should be put on a business basis, that services which are not profitable will be cut, and that only services which are on a business basis economic shall be continued?  I think we should know what is the desire of that section of the community represented by Deputy Heffernan and his colleagues, because the urban districts could be run upon a lower-priced letter service if there were not the call for equivalent services in country districts.  If Deputy Heffernan really represents the public opinion of the country population in this matter, then those of us who might claim to speak more particularly for the urban districts might put in a plea for lower charges for letters and telephones.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson has pointed out that there was a profit on letters and postcards and he presumed that was in the cities.  The Deputy said nothing about the tremendous loss of £524,990 on printed papers, newspapers and parcels.  Were these for the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Newspapers and printed papers!  Would it not be just as well to assume that the losses in that particular Department of the Post Offices were attributable to the cities, just as he assumed the gain was attributable <Col N="2223" /> in the other case?  Deputies on these benches are hoping for the day that the Post Office will be a paying concern.  The Minister has given us reason for that hope.  He stated that if the cost of living comes down and if the trade of the country increases, we shall, in a short time, at the present rates reach equilibrium.  That is a very reasonable proposition if it can be done.  While we feel that it is a mistake to differentiate against us in the delivery of telegrams, we would be prepared, in view of the forecast which the Minister has given, to wait for a year or so before making a change. That opinion does not fall in with that of my colleagues, many of whom are suffering very severely by the present arrangement.  I suffer myself, inasmuch as I have to pay 1/- on every telegram I receive.  As the Minister has pointed out I realise that on every telegram there is a loss of 1/-.  Last year where telegrams had to be delivered the delivery fees represented £40,000, which if abandoned, would have to be added to the big loss of £178,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>After all, a loss of £41,000 in a half a million is not such a large amount.  As you are out to lose half a million you might as well lose the £41,000 and place all sections on the one basis.  That proposal, of course, will not coincide with the proposal to make the service a paying one.  To that extent I think we are a little bit inconsistent.  The point I wanted to make was that Deputy Johnson referred to the gain in the urban areas, but neglected to point out that there was also a loss in the urban <Col N="2224" /> areas in connection with the other services.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Heffernan, complained of the apathy of business people in small towns not going in for telephone extension.  I come from a small town where we are very anxious to have the telephone extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">

    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Minister and the Dáil that the Post Office authorities will not meet us on any sort of a reasonable basis.  There is at present a vacant line of poles between Carndonagh and Buncrana which could be used for the extension of the telephone, but the figure that we are expected to pay for that extension is prohibitive. I also complain about too much money being spent on broadcasting, while too little is spent on the extension of the telephone in the county that I come from, which is a sort of no man's land. The Minister mentioned that extensions are being made in various parts of the South and West of Ireland, including Bundoran and Ballyshannon, but they are only on the outskirts of Tirconaill. I do not think that the county I have the honour to represent, Donegal, is being treated very fairly by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in the matter of telephone extension.  I mentioned this matter in 1924 and 1925, but we have got no further than an impossible demand on subscribers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to letter delivery, I am not in a position to apportion the blame for what happens between the Post Office and the Lough Swilly Railway Co. in a big area in the county I come from.  We got letters recently at 6.30 in the evening.  Outgoing letters are despatched at 11.50 a.m., which is the only collection for the day.  I would suggest to the authorities of the Postal Department that they should consider the question of having a motor mail service put on, both ways, between Derry and Innishowen.  There is a big volume of business in the area, and I believe if the matter was gone into there would not be a serious loss on it. The loss that would be sustained in running a motor mail service from Derry City to Innishowen would be a <Col N="2225" /> very small item when compared with that half million or seven hundred thousand pounds of which Deputy Wilson spoke.  It would be like dropping a needle in Lough Swilly.  I hope that these grumbles which I have given expression to will receive, if not practical consideration, at least sympathetic consideration from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the plea put forward by Deputy Heffernan in so far as it applies to the sending of telegrams at a fixed rate, which would include delivery as well as forwarding. This question was raised in the Dáil and was debated at considerable length twelve months ago.  At that time Deputies of all parties expressed the view that the Minister should consider the advisability of inaugurating a system which would enable telegrams to be sent at a charge which would include the cost of delivery.  The Minister has maps of the Free State.  He knows where his post offices are situated and he knows the farthest point that any post office is from a particular house.  With that information he should be in a position to fix an average inclusive charge.  That might mean the risk of a loss.  but it would be on a gradually reduced basis, keeping in view the time when the Telegraph Department will pay its own way, as the Minister hopes.</P>

The matter was mentioned twelve months ago and approved, I think, by all sides of the House, and I am surprised that the Minister has not given us any reason why he has not complied with that request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that if the Post Office is working at a loss which will be gradually reduced, the Minister should take into consideration the average loss on the working of this Department the same as any other Department, and gradually work towards putting the Post Office, including this <Col N="2227" /> Department, on a business basis.  If it is necessary to charge 1/3 for forwarding and delivery instead of 1/-, I say that 1/3, to include all service, should be fixed instead of the 1/- minimum. That is clearly what was approved by the House 12 months ago, and, I think, two years ago.  If it is not feasible, of course we cannot expect the Minister to do impossibilities.</P>
      <P>Arising out of that aspect of the question, I should like to know if telegraph offices in rural areas are under any obligation to see that there is immediately available a messenger who will deliver telegrams forthwith.  Five weeks ago I happened to be in my constituency. An urgent telegram was sent to me and was received in the local post office about 2.30 p.m.  It was handed to me, four miles away, at 5.5 p.m.  As a result of the telegram, I had to catch the mail train back to Dublin.  I caught the train, but I had to leave my wife and family behind.  I did not like to make a written complaint because I had no desire to get anybody into trouble, but I discussed the matter with the people concerned. The cause of the delay in that case was that there was nobody immediately at hand to deliver the telegram.  The person who was in the habit of delivering telegrams was digging his garden some distance away, and the people in the Post Office had some difficulty in getting him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much to have to refer to this matter again this year.  I referred to it last year, the year before, and I think the year before that.  I regret the attitude of Deputies who put the personal view-point before the national view-point, and who expressed the view that, because they live near a telegraph office, they deserve facilities which the residents in the rural areas do not deserve. I want to know on what right they can claim better service as citizens than any other members of the community. I asked the Minister last year to give us the total cost of this service, both within and without the two mile limit in cities and towns.  There is a free delivery in cities and large towns and within a mile of the rural telegraph offices.  I said last year that the loss outside those limits was defrayed absolutely by the charge for delivery recovered from the people who received a telegram.  It was not contradicted then.  I am waiting to hear it contradicted now, and to hear the number of telegrams which were delivered last year and the year before outside this particular area, how that compares with the total number of telegrams sent out, and also how both balances with the total loss.  The Minister tells us that £178,000 of an annual loss was suffered on the telegraph service last year.  £25,000 was recovered on the delivery of telegrams outside the limit, and £41,000 the year before, showing a loss of £16,000 in the two years.  But there is a loss of £178,000 on the service still.  The people of the country have to bear that loss in addition to paying £41,000 the year before last, which came directly out of the receipt of telegrams outside the limit.  I make the assertion again that the cost of all the telegrams sent and delivered outside the mile limit and the two-mile limit did not amount to more than one shilling a telegram, taking into consideration <Col N="2230" /> the mean between the small and the large charge.  Therefore, the charges for delivery cover the cost of delivery from the post office to the recipient, and the total loss in the telegraph service is confined to the two-mile and the mile limit.  We are asked, calmly, to bear this loss.  The people who pay £40,000 for their own service are also paying their share of the loss, and we are asked to assume that is fair play, and that that is the way the citizens of this country ought to understand equality and equity.</P>
      <P>I do not hold the view that this service ought to be a paying concern, because I do not see any possibility of it. It is one of those services in which people demand equal rights.  The nation does not seem to have sufficient business to carry on this as a paying proposition. If we are to come down to the basis that everything must pay for itself I say this is one of the things in which an exception must be made.  I say, further, that the charges for delivery made in rural areas provide more than the whole payment made to the telegraph messenger in the rural areas. I challenge contradiction on that.  A messenger is paid in the rural areas by the charges of the outer circle.  The outer people are paying for the service.</P>

      <P>They are.  I know the weekly wages which messengers are getting.  I made it my business to find out and I found, in one office, that there is even more coming in than the messenger is getting.  If we are to lose £178,000 for the charmed circle inside I think we ought to be satisfied to lose an additional £25,000 for the people outside.  They are as good citizens. They are not financially well off.  They have to live on the mountain side, but that is not their fault.  It is more their misfortune.  The people inside have a lot to be thankful for.  They have access to villages and post offices, and why they should be placed in this favoured position I cannot understand. If the telegraph service is to pay for itself, instead of a shilling charge 1/3 or 1/6 for every telegram sent out, and then every citizen of the State will be <Col N="2231" /> paying an equal amount for his telegram.</P>
      <P>The whole thing will be shared by everybody, but at present those outside are carrying their load and carrying the other fellow's load as well.  If that is fair play, I cannot understand it.  I have yet to meet anybody with intelligence who would defend the position, and I have yet to meet anyone with public spirit who would say that residents in rural areas do not deserve the same consideration and the same services as people inside.</P>

      <P>I support the views expressed by Deputy Gorey.  Like him, I cannot understand why people living in rural districts, say, one mile from a town, are placed in a less favourable position in regard to national services than people living in the cities and towns.  Many people living in rural areas complain about being called upon to pay more for such services than their more fortunate brethren who live in towns or villages provided with telegraph offices.  Deputy Gorey believes that nothing more than a shilling is paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>Not by any means.  I would like to hear from the Minister as to whether it is reasonable to ask a person in a rural district, say, two. or two and a half miles from a post office to pay 2/6 for the delivery of telegrams, while a big business firm in Dublin can receive telegrams every five or ten minutes during the day at no cost whatever.  Why that distinction? Why not do as Deputy Gorey suggests? <Col N="2232" /> If the Minister wishes to meet the cost of sending and delivering telegrams, why not apportion the cost over every individual who uses the telegraph service, and why not raise the rate to 1/3, or even 1/6, and thus allow the sender to pay for his telegrams?  It is a most ridiculous proposition to ask any person in the country to take a telegram from a messenger with one hand, and with the other hand out a shilling, two shillings, or two and sixpence for its delivery.  It is probable that a wire would have no particular value and that it probably is from a person simply saying, &ldquo;Please meet me to-morrow at such a place.&rdquo;  Its contents may be of no material value, yet the recipent has to pay 6d., 1/-, 1/6, 2/- or perhaps 2/6 for it.  It is time that the Minister took some steps to meet that situation, and, in my opinion, it would be best met by making everyone pay the same amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisMcCullough" hpid="Mr. McCULLOUGH Mr. McCULLOUGH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCULLOUGH</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with another matter which has, perhaps, rather an opposite effect to the complaint in regard to telegrams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the same matter last year, namely, the unfair incidence of the parcel delivery tax.  The tax has my wholehearted approval, as I know that it was directed towards making those who are doing their shopping outside the country, pay in some measure for the cost of delivery.  Until we get a measure of industrial development, perhaps through the medium of higher or more extended tariffs, many business houses in the city will, perforce, be compelled to get many of their requirements for their clients from across the water.  Every well ordered business house is naturally anxious to treat its clients with promptitude and attention, and thus they cannot keep their clients waiting for a particular article manufactured outside the Saorstát until they get a number of similar orders.  Consequently, nearly every business house is often required to send an order separately, and on each parcel received it has to pay the ordinary charge and, in addition, the parcel tax.  It occurs to me that some method might be found by which a rebate might be given on <Col N="2233" /> parcels exceeding a certain number, so that a business house might submit a return at the end of a year and apply for a rebate on such parcels as exceed a certain number.  In that manner the charge on business houses in that respect would be lessened.  Many of them receive parcels daily, or twice a day, and in such instances the charge would amount to a couple of pounds.  If a man who delivered such parcels went with one parcel to a district, such as that of which Deputy Gorey spoke, he would get sixpence, though it requires ten times the amount of time and energy to deliver such a parcel, as to deliver a huge number of parcels to a city firm. I would also support Deputy White in regard to the extension of the telephone service in Tirconaill.  I must say that whenever I approached the Minister on the matter he has been able to show that every effort has been made in that direction, but I would point out to him that Tirconnail, owing to present conditions, is suffering from many disabilities, and its trading system has been entirely upset.  It would not be asking too much of the Department, even at some disadvantage&mdash;possibly it could not be done as advantageously as in other parts of the Saorstát&mdash;to make the telephone extension in that county more rapidly, and to make some concessions to small towns and districts desirous of such extension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the examination of the accounts of the Minister in detail is not possible within the time limit that has been placed on the Vote and the general nature of the discussion that has taken place on the Estimate.  I therefore wish to concentrate on the aspect of the case which appeals to me particularly. We have before us an Estimate for an expenditure of £2,462,000.  The Minister indicated the very substantial loss that has been and is going to be incurred in the carrying on of the functions of the Post Office.  The only cheery part of his Estimate, as far as that is concerned, was the statement that he hopes to get this deficit wiped off within a certain number of years. I commend the Minister in that view of the running of the Post Office service. There is a reason at the moment why there is a loss on the service.  It <Col N="2234" /> is easily explainable.  It is a business concern.  That is what the Post Office is under a monopoly.  At all events I think no Deputy ought to put forward a proposition that the Post Office should, for ever, or for longer than is absolutely necessary, be run at a charge on the country as a whole.  When Deputies take the view that the Post Office is necessarily a non-self-supporting organisation I think they are raising a wrong headline.  I consider in criticising the Post Office accounts that if there is a loss, the question to be asked is why there is a loss, and we should be able to explain the deficits as they occur.</P>
      <P>Now the explanation I presume for the loss in the working of the Post Office is the very scattered and sparse population of the country districts. There has been put forward a claim in the Dáil that as regards telegrams, which are a very substantial source of loss to the Post Office, there should be delivery in all rural areas free of all porterage.  I think in that connection that the porterage is due to the fact that you must draw the line somewhere, and if the arguments put forward for free delivery of telegrams in outlying areas are going to be accepted, one might also logically say that a man living next door to the Post Office should not have to pay as much as a man living a few streets away.</P>

I quite recognise Deputy Gorey's idea that business is parasitical on the agricultural industry, but at the same time while I am here I am going to maintain that the business aspect of this transaction shall be taken into account, and I do say that I do not think any department of the Post Office should put up the claim that it should be run at a loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if I may say so, the most promising line in connection with the Post Office development is the one which I think the Minister has all along recognised as the line of development that is of the greatest use to the country.  That is the telephone department.  Undoubtedly telephone extension throughout the country is at present, and is going to be, the most valuable asset the country has got for communication.  I imagine that, internally, telegrams will be largely displaced in the course of time by the use of the telephone service.  The telegraphic service will have to be carried on more for the purpose of sending messages out of the country.  Internally I think that the development of the telephone system will largely do away with the need for the very considerable use of telegrams.  As regards the details of the working of the Post Office, I think it is recognised that as a concern it is very well run, and, therefore, while I rather protest against the <Col N="2236" /> inability to examine this very lengthy account in detail, I think that the information that is to be got from the account as we have it here would not really entail very much criticism.  At the same time, the main thing that ought to be aimed at, and which the House ought, I think, to give close attention to, is as to whether the postal service as a whole is progressing towards the point when it will cease to be a charge on the country.  I do not think that the comprehensive service rendered by the Post Office justifies a loss of half a million pounds, and all the examination I have been able to give the matter does not change the opinion which I have formed, that the country should not be expected to maintain the service at this great loss. The answer that the Minister may make is that he cannot balance his budget without cutting down services, and I think that that also would be the argument of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture on his Vote.  If that is so, I say that within reasonable limits he ought to cut his coat according to his cloth.  I do not think it is sound that clamours for services beyond what are reasonably required by the needs of each district should be acceded to.  I maintain that if we have to submit to a curtailment of facilities within reasonable limits, in order not to have to shoulder this big burden of loss, we ought to do so.</P>

I believe that if that is done a large portion of the cost of porterage of telegrams would be saved, because there have been very considerable developments in connection with offices that have been opened, and these offices are being used very extensively.  I do not believe that at present sufficient attention is paid to informing the public as to where these offices are available. The business in the offices that have been opened is daily increasing.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies have found fault on this Vote with regard to various services, but I highly compliment the Minister on the great improvement and the efficiency of the very many developments that he has carried out under the most extreme difficulties during the past few years.  If it is at all possible to meet people he does so, because in my experience of Government Departments none give such immediate attention as to any matter that is brought before it as his Department, and if it is at all possible to carry out any request put before them they do it as soon as possible.</P>

The Minister's statement to the effect that a reduction in the cost of living, or an extension of trade would mean a better service, is undoubtedly the old saying, &ldquo;Live horse, and you will get grass.&rdquo; As far as rural areas are concerned, there is absolutely no indication as to when they may expect better postal and telegraph services.  Undoubtedly <Col N="2238" /> there is a good deal to be said for the case that trade should, to some extent, determine the extent of the service, but I would like to hear, when the matter of the curtailment of services in rural areas was under the consideration of the Department, what steps were taken by the Department to point out that unless there was an improvement in trade the service would have to be curtailed? What is being done to-day in this respect?  The rural population in practically two-thirds of the country has to do with only a three-day letter delivery.</P>

I think it would be very good business on the part of the Department to make an effort to organise business for the Department. I think it would be advisable that an effort should be made everywhere that there has been a curtailment to point out to the people that if business is forthcoming the service would be restored.  If nothing is to be done by the Post Office, and if trade is to continue as at present until there is an upward curve, the only thing our rural dwellers can do is to look years ahead, in the hope that something may happen to give them a better service. I feel that the Post Office itself should make an effort in every district to determine what increase of trade would warrant an extension of the present service.</P>

      <P>Figures have been given to us by the Minister showing that on the letter and postcard branch there was a gain of £231,000.  It is difficult to determine in what way that gain has been brought about.  This gain that we have given us is on the <Col N="2239" /> whole service.  Figures have also been given to us as to the losses.  Are we to accept it that these figures point to the fact that all of the loss on printed paper, newspapers, parcels, registered parcels, money orders and postal orders is on the service in the rural districts? I would be prepared to suggest that a considerable amount of this loss of £104,000 on the delivery of parcels is sustained in the area represented by the 15 Deputies of Dublin constituencies in this House.  I would like to have such a discrimination made in the figures given to us that we would be enabled to determine whether or not the gain on our letter and postcard branch of the service was over the whole branch of the service, or whether there is a loss in one part of it and a gain in another.  The Minister has not indicated that to us.</P>
      <P>Unless we get figures to prove conclusively that the loss of £119,000 on printed papers, of £66,000 on newspapers, of £104,000 on parcels, and of £81,000 on registered parcels and so on has been sustained on deliveries in the rural districts, then we must assume that the loss has been sustained not only in the rural districts but on the service as a whole over the country. If that is the position, and we believe it is, what is the justification for the policy pursued by the Minister at the present time?  If the Minister is to continue in the attitude that he cannot afford to extend to rural districts the services they had until there is a revival of trade and until the cost-of-living bonus comes down, because these services can only be maintained at a loss, then he should be consistent.  Let him curtail the services within the charmed area that Deputy Gorey referred to if he wants to be fair to all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confess that I am prepared to join with the Deputies who paid tribute to the administration of the Department and to the courtesy extended to Deputies by the Department.  While we are prepared to agree that we get good service as far as the policy pursued by the Minister makes it possible for him to give it, and while we get courtesy from his Department, yet we are not <Col N="2240" /> prepared to agree that the policy at present pursued by the Minister is fair. Undoubtedly every time a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs comes to the House with his Estimate, either the present Minister or the one who will succeed him when he himself advances to a higher post, will be faced with this very same case.  No statement has been made here to show that the losses in the working of the Post Office are due to the service given in the rural districts. As long as that is so, Deputies representing rural constituencies must insist that inasmuch as there is a loss on the service no one citizen of the State is entitled to better service than another from a Department that is being run at a loss.  Deputy Hewat talked about a scattered population and the loss in the service due to that fact.  That may be the point of view of Deputy Hewat and of other Deputies, but they have not the experience of people who come here from the country.</P>
    <P>When we consider the disadvantages and the disabilities that our people suffer from because of the policy pursued by the Minister to-day, it is our duty to bring these disabilities to his notice and to press on him that more favourable consideration be given to our people in the future than has been given to them up to the present.  If there is a loss in the service we do not want to have one section of our people made to suffer it, and at the same time pay their share of the loss sustained because a better service is being given to other citizens in the State than is being given to them.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Baxter and Deputy Gorey I have the same complaint to make with regard to the rural districts.  In very few instances, as Deputy Baxter pointed out, do the people in the rural districts get more than a three days' postal delivery in the week, and it often happens that these deliveries are made very late in the day.  I agree that the people living in the rural districts may be as useful and may contribute as much to the support of the State as those living in the cities and towns.  I consider that they should be put in as favourable a position as the people in the <Col N="2241" /> cities and towns are with regard to the postal service.  There is no doubt but that sometimes the charge for the delivery of telegrams in rural districts is very exorbitant.  A Deputy on the Labour benches said that the charge often amounted to half-a-crown.  I can substantiate that statement.  We are all anxious to promote the industries of the country and to see her prosper.  I think that the Post Office Department could contribute to the prosperity of the country by having a better telegraph and postal service in the rural districts.  I must say that at all times the Minister has done all that it is possible to meet the wishes of Deputies when they come forward with complaints to him.  Undoubtedly the service is not what we want it to be, and the sooner the Minister would consider providing such a service as is needed by those living in the rural areas the better it would be for the entire community.</P>

      <P>There is one point I would like to make in connection with the question of the losses on the working of the Post Office.  I gathered from the figures given by the Minister that the total cost of Press telegrams works out at £50,000 a year, and that the revenue from Press tele grams amounted only to £6,500.  It would appear, therefore, that there is a total loss to the Post Office revenue on Press telegrams of £43,500.  In addition to that it would appear that the total loss on newspaper deliveries, taking newspapers of all kinds, is £66,000.  If you add these two figures together you get the large total sum of £109,000 of a loss on Press telegrams and on the delivery of newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Post Office was in a normal condition, and if there was not a loss on it, it might be considered worth while for the country to bear this burden on what is, to some extent at least, a luxury service.  But in view of the fact that there is a very heavy loss on the total working of the Post Office, of which this sum of £109,000 makes up a fairly considerable part, I would suggest to the Minister that it is worth considering whether the country can afford to pay such a sum as that, which amounts practically to a subsidy to <Col N="2242" /> private individuals.  It would seem from the Minister's speech that the greatest loss on the working of the Post Office is on the three items, newspapers, printed matter, and parcels.  If the Post Office is to be worked on a paying basis it would appear to me that the proper end from which to tackle the problem is these three items.  I suggest that the £109,000 loss is one figure that could be inquired into with most salutary effects in view of the present condition of the working of the Post Office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a very full and comprehensive statement in moving this Vote.  My first feeling was to pay him a tribute, but on reflection I begin to see that there is something in the nature of a subtle policy behind it, and I have come to the conclusion that it is an effort to throw into bold relief the very sombre situation in regard to the loss on the working of the Post Office.  There is one thing in connection with this Estimate one would like to be assured of, that is, that there is no such thing in connection with it as over-estimating, that it has been, in fact, cut down to bedrock, and that it represents the normal charge, duly scrutinised, which will fall on the Exchequer of the Saorstát. In the absence of precise knowledge, certainly in the absence of the fuller knowledge which the Minister possesses, and not having his intimate relation with the administration of the service, it is not easy to point out where the savings can be made.  For instance, take the conveyance of mails and the engineering service; there the charge naturally is a matter of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking supernnuation charges under sub-head A, I find in this year's Estimate there is a sum of £205,000. On the Vote last year there was a sum of £213,000.  The expenditure in respect of this service in the year 1924-25 amounted to £181,752 13s. 9d., and the Estimate that year was over £249.630. The actual expenditure in 1924 was less by a sum of £24,000 approximately than the charge this year.  I am inclined to wonder whether this expenditure in 1924 was of a normal character, and whether there is an excess coming on the Estimate in respect of this <Col N="2243" /> year's charge.  One would like to have an assurance that in this year's Estimate this sum of £205,000 is not an over-estimate.  With regard to the working of the Post Office it has been suggested here by certain Deputies that it should be on a commercial basis. I think a commercial basis can have two aspects and may be interpreted in two different ways.  You can have first and foremost the idea of cutting down unprofitable services, curtailing the services you give to the community, or, on the other hand, which is a better, higher and more intelligent way, you can adjust your charges so that you can get an increased volume of business.  To curtail the services would be a most retrograde step.  We farmers would object to and resist any attempt to curtail the facilities of service which were given to us some years ago.</P>
    <P>With regard to commercial principles, has it dawned on anyone how much better the Post Office is placed than an ordinary business house? Everything is on a strictly cash basis. There is no such thing as making provision for bad debts as has to be done by business concerns.  Everything in connection with the Post Office, I repeat, is strictly on a cash basis, and therefore everything could be cut down to the minimum, for no risk has to be taken with regard to bad or uncertain debts.  That is one of the reasons why I claim the Ministry of Posts is in a better position than a concern that is obliged to give credit.  I contend that the higher charges by the Post Office are detrimental as regards making it a paying concern.  According to the Minister's own figures revenue is decreasing. That, clearly, is indicative of the fact that he has touched the peak point, and therefore it is no longer advisable that the Minister should maintain high charges.  In the late 'forties in Great Britain, when the idea of the penny post was mooted, the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that Sir Rowland Hill was absolutely insane, but when the penny postal service was tried it was found that the volume of business increased many times over, and that it presented to the Chancellor <Col N="2244" /> of the Exchequer a financial gain over the preceding period.</P>

      <P>No. I maintain that the Minister, in order to increase business. should reduce his charges, particularly as regards letters. I believe the time has come when the charge should be reduced to 1½d.  Can we, a small, isolated State, carry on with a 2d. letter charge, when Great Britain and Northern Ireland have a 1½d. letter charge?  I say we cannot, and that the principle underlying this heavy charge is defeating its own object, that is, it is preventing revenue coming to the Exchequer.  We have in one respect a poor country, an uneducated country, and yet we have a prohibitive letter rate.  These three things, taken in conjuction with each other&mdash; they inter-act, as it were&mdash;are producing a position which, I fear, will lead to diminished returns in the future. The Minister desires to establish business. Already he has laid the foundation. I presume that with his present staff, with trifling additions, he could deal with a volume of business twice as great, or three times as great, as is being at present transacted.  Even with an increase of business to the extent of fifty per cent., in my opinion the system would begin to right itself, and the Post Office would be a paying proposition.</P>
      <P>I believe that a cheap letter rate would form the foundation of a good business.  If there are cheaper facilities given in that direction, there is bound to be increased business.  I believe you will increase your business in the parcels post direction.  At present, owing to prohibitive charges, people refrain from using the parcels post to the extent that we would consider desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to rural telegraph services, <Col N="2245" /> the Minister's statement failed to convince many Deputies that the charge of 1s. outside the mile limit was justified.  He mentioned that the amount received by reason of this charge is £41,000, and that there was a total loss in respect to telegrams of something in the nature of £180,000. If the Minister makes the case that he pays the deliverer of a telegram the extra amount charged to the rural dweller&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole point centres around the rural dweller.  In my opinion it is absurd to impose this charge for the delivery of a telegram. It would, for instance, be absurd to ask a person living in a rural area to put an extra penny stamp on a letter before he posts it.  In the same way it is, in my opinion, both illogical and absurd to impose an extra charge of 1/- for the delivery of a telegram to a person living outside the mile limit.  What is the basis of this charge?  We are told that the telegram costs the sender 1/-; the charge to the State is another 1/-, and the rural dweller living outside the mile limit has to pay an additional 1/- for delivery.  That means that a telegram sent to a person living outside the mile limit costs 3/-.  How are these costings calculated?  Are we to understand that the Post Office authorities have, with mathematical <Col N="2246" /> precision, calculated the actual time spent in despatching and receiving the telegram by Post Office officials, and the time it takes to carry out the delivery to the addressee?  If the system were not worked out to a fine point it is not likely we would be told that each telegram costs the State 1/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression that you were charging up the time of the operators in despatching and sending the telegram.  In rural offices the officials in charge are ordinarily engaged on different services, such as issuing money orders, dog licences, stamps, and things of that kind.  Then, of course, in the case of telegrams arriving, they have to make arrangements for their delivery.  I have no doubt all these matters have been taken into consideration in arriving at the cost to the State that has been mentioned by the Minister.  I contend that the Minister is not justified in making this additional charge for the delivery of telegrams outside the mile limit.  It is an unfair discrimination against the rural community.  Seeing that this service is made a national charge, there is no reason why a person who, by mere accident, lives outside the mile limit, should be saddled with this extra shilling.  A person living in a town will have the telegrams delivered to him within a two mile radius without any additional cost.  There is no justification for this imposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to allude briefly to some items referred to by the Minister in the concluding part of his statement. He touched on the collection of rates through the Post Office.  I understand this method of collection was resorted to in two counties, Kerry and Sligo.  I would be interested to know if that system of collection is a paying proposition from the Minister's point of view.  I heard it rumoured on more than one occasion that the collection of rates actually means a loss to the Post Office.  I would be anxious to get accurate information on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point to which I would like to refer.  The Minister spoke of the growth, during the past <Col N="2247" /> 12 months, of the cash on delivery system.  I would like to know to what extent that system has been availed of by the farmers.  In other countries where a system of this kind exists, it is availed of very generally.  In this country I imagine the extension of the system would help materially in the development of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister contemplates a big scheme of telephone development in the western counties.  Does he intend to connect the smaller Post Offices with the telephone exchanges?  In a number of western counties many of these Post Offices have neither telephonic nor telegraphic facilities.  In modern times it is, I think, absolutely essential that every Post Office should have telegraphic and telephonic facilities.  Recently I had occasion to call the attention of the Minister to several Post Offices in the constituency I represent.  These Post Offices are not in a position to send or receive telegrams, or permit telephone calls.  I will be glad to hear from the Minister, that when this scheme he has in contemplation materialises, it will embrace such offices as I have referred to.  There is no doubt that if such facilities were extended to every Post Office in the Saorstát, the community in general would derive great benefit.</P>
    <P>In connection with the porterage charges referred to by Deputy Gorey and others, I happen to live in a rural area, and, like Deputies Gorey and Heffernan and many others, I have had to pay on various occasions the charge of 1/-.  I remember about twelve months ago, on the occasion of my election to the Dáil, I received a good many telegrams congratulating me upon the result. I was not at home at the time when they arrived, but I happened to call into the Post Office a week later and I was told there that I owed a bill of 28/- for telegrams delivered at my residence.  It seems to me that really the Minister should consider the advisability of taking some steps for the relief of people living in rural areas from this charge.  I must confess I cannot see quite clearly, at the moment, <Col N="2248" /> how it can be done.  I have heard quite a number of complaints from many people living in rural areas with reference to the injustice of this particular charge.  Very often members of the Dáil, and particularly Deputies in the country, receive telegrams on matters of business and they have to pay this charge of 1/- or 1s. 6d. porterage.</P>
    <P>I cannot quite follow Deputy Gorey when he suggests that this charge should be spread all over the country, and that people in cities and towns should bear a proportion of the charge as well as the men living in the rural areas.  I think, at all events, the Minister, in conjunction with his advisers, should try and devise some means of relieving people, in the rural areas, of this charge.  I confess, as I said already, I am not in a position to suggest any way out of the difficulty, but I suggest that the sender should be made to bear some of the cost of the delivery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this Vote appears to have centred round two points in the main: (1) criticism of the porterage charge on rural deliveries and (2) telephone extension.  Now, taking the question of telephone extension first, I wish to assure Deputies that we are very anxious to get our telephone system in, even to the most remote districts.  We can only advance by stages, tapping the larger quarters first, and, then, moving downwards.  In this way we hope to be able to get at the districts referred to this evening by several Deputies.  I have no doubt, myself, that within the next two years, at the present rate, it will be found that we have penetrated the entire area of the Twenty-Six Counties.  I do not believe that anybody anticipated such rapid extension a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telephonic extension costs money. When we extend, the Minister for Finance rightly insists that a certain amount of support shall be forthcoming. There is nothing unreasonable in that.  He does not definitely assert that every telephone extension must pay its way, but he does insist that a certain reasonable guarantee should be forthcoming in every district.  In following that rule, the Minister is simply <Col N="2249" /> adopting the one that prevailed under the English system, and, if anything, he has modified the charges in favour of the users.  I have personally suggested that further modification of these charges may be advisable, and he is considering that subject.  We have not been able to tap Carndonagh as soon as Deputy White would desire, simply because the residents of Carndonagh are not prepared to come to the scratch in respect of the guarantee.</P>
    <P>We come now to the other point, that of porterage delivery fees.  I concede that a resident within a mile area who receives a free delivery of a telegram has an advantage over the resident outside that area, who pays full price for the delivery.  We make no profit on the transaction.  I have gone into that.  It merely suffices to pay the expenses of the messenger who makes the delivery.  There is no doubt the resident outside the mile area is under a disadvantage, but when we adopted this system we simply adopted the system that prevailed in the time of the British.</P>

      <P>No matter; the principle was the same.  We felt we could not continue to lose the very heavy sum we were losing.  That was in 1924, and the sum then was in the neighbourhood of £60,000.  We could not continue to lose that sum, which appeared to me to be an increasing sum.  People discovered it was quite a convenient thing to scribble off a telegram, which only cost a shilling, at a Post Office counter.  They never worried about the fact that it cost the taxpayer three or four shillings to deliver.  This class of telegram might have no element of urgency about it.  It might simply be a notification to the members of the family that the sender was travelling home by train.  It was more convenient to scribble a telegram rather than get paper and envelopes and write a letter. But the taxpayer has to pay three or four shillings.  There was another class of telegram dealt with, and that was in regard to betting.</P>

I will agree that the time has come at least for a review of the position.  I will not say what we can do and I will not say that anything I suggest with regard to it will be agreed to by the Minister for Finance, nor do I hope that there is any solution to be found in the levelling up of the general charges for telegrams.

      <P>Would the Minister excuse me while I ask him to reconcile this position, just as a matter of clarification? I find on page 251 of these Estimates that the number of boy messengers totalled 378, at a wage ranging from 6/- to 19/- plus bonus.  If I assume that 25/- is a fair mean of the weekly earnings, I take it that 378 boys at 25/- gives a total of £24,500.  That included all the boys delivering messages, whether to the rural areas or to their own districts.  The porterage received, I gather, was £25,000, so that we have a cost of £24,500, including all the boys in Class 2 and 3 offices.  The porterage does give a balance of £500, so that I think that proves Deputy Gorey's case.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that there are few telegrams sent now except on business or family matters. Surely telegrams are supposed to be secret.  There are penalties imposed on any postal official who communicates the contents of telegrams.  Does the Minister receive reports as to the nature of telegrams?  One gathers from what he says that he did.  I hope that is not so.  I hope he will disillusion us on that point.</P>

      <P>I realise that the members from different parts of the country are honestly expressing a feeling in regard to this matter that there is that differentiation between the free telegram within the mile area and the unfree one outside.  I cannot say at the moment what the Minister for Finance might agree to in regard to this matter, but I am prepared to have the matter re-opened.  Deputy Davin urged that married men, acting, I presume, as rural deliverers, should get preference in retention of employment over single men.  That, too, is our view, and if there are any cases in which we have departed from that principle, I would be very glad that the Deputy should bring them to my notice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got to take every case on its merits.  On the assumption that both services are equal, obviously we give preference to the married man.  On the other hand, if we are up against a position of a single man with long service and a married man with short service we have got to trim our sails otherwise.  Deputy Baxter complained that we have reduced practically the whole rural services. That is an exaggeration.  As a matter of fact, less than 25 per cent. of those services have suffered a reduction. This policy of retrenchment in rural deliveries is not applicable to this country alone.  It had been initiated by the British before the Treaty, and it is being pursued by them in England and in the Six Counties at the present time.  I cannot say whether they are taking it quite as far as we are, but I know very well that it is a policy of theirs, and it is being carried out.</P>

      <P>We have never advanced on the principle that rural deliveries must pay.  Not five per cent.  of those deliveries pay their way.  I think I would be justified in saying that on the average, the men engaged in rural deliveries do not earn, notwithstanding the reductions we have effected, 25 per cent.  of their cost.  We must, of course, continue to suffer that loss for the common good.  There is very little use in harping on the fact that the urban service on the whole is a paying service, and the rural service a losing one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of postal orders, money orders, registered parcels and registered letters, even where these items are confined within an urban area, there is a loss, a smaller loss, of course, than were these items to be taken over a big part of the 26 counties.  In all other cases, treating them from the purely urban point of view, I should say there is a gain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt about it in the case of letters, printed papers, and postcards.  I am not sure about parcels, but I would almost venture to say that parcels clear their way in the urban areas.  Taken as a whole, as the Deputy pretty well understands, the service does suffer a very much heavier loss in the rural areas than in the urban.  There is no need to convince him on that point.  Everybody knows that we have great numbers of men travelling through the <Col N="2255" /> country with comparatively little material to deliver.  If those who advocate running the service on a business basis were to get their way, then we should have to clip our wings very seriously in the rural districts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a general feeling that the service should be run on a purely commercial basis, we can do it.  On the other hand, if it is desired that we ought to spend more &mdash;that instead of half a million that we spend a million or a million and a half &mdash;on the general postal service, we can also do that, but between the two extremes, between the man who wants a full service regardless of cost and the man who wants a paying concern, we have to determine our own course, and we are satisfied that we have produced, after the curtailments that have been brought about during the last couple of years, a minimum inconvenience to the people.  I want further to say that Deputies have hinted at, or alleged that we have in no way penalised the urban citizen, that we have continued to serve him with that very full service which existed at the time of the Treaty.  That is not true.  In the case of Dublin City and County, we have reduced the deliveries from four to three, in Cork from three to two, and so on right down through the other cities and towns.  The Dáil can rest assured that wherever we got an opportunity to economise, without inflicting any serious inconvenience on the people whether in the urban or rural districts, we have availed of it.  Deputy Tierney has drawn attention to a loss of £100,000, on the transaction of Press business, £66,000 of which would come under the heading of newspapers carried through the post, and the balance <Col N="2256" /> of £43,000 on the transmission of Press telegrams.  That undoubtedly is the case.  It is true that the Press is being subsidised pretty much like other services.</P>
