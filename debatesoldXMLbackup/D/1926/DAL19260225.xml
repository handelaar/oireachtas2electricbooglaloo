      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that a registered letter packet containing one lady's gold watch addressed to Miss Julia Flanagan, Pluckerstown, Kilmeague, County Kildare, by a friend in the United States, America, has been retained as a seizure by the Customs Department, 10 Parnell Square, Dublin, under Section 207 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876; that Miss Flanagan, in reply of the 16th February, 1926, to the Department's letter of the 15th February, 1926, gave permission for the opening of the packet, stating that she was willing to pay duty on receipt of packet at Kilmeague Post Office; that the Department on the 18th February, 1926, wrote, stating that the packet would be retained as a seizure; and whether, in view of the fact that there was no intention to defraud and also of the illegible figure entered on the Department's letter of the 15th February, stating the number of days' notice, he will authorise the delivery of the watch, on payment of duty by Miss Flanagan.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he has considered a claim for an old age pension by Bernard Malone, of 8 Richmond Place, Rathmines (Register No. 1173, Rathmines Urban District), and whether, in view of the fact that Mr. Malone, though naturalised as a citizen of the United States of America, has been resident in the Saorstát for the last fifty years, has become a Saorstát citizen under Article 3 of the Constitution and has not elected not to accept citizenship, the Minister would be prepared to treat the claimant as having sufficient qualification in respect of citizenship.</P>

      <P>It is the case that telephone silence cabinets manufactured outside the Saorstát have had to be imported for use in this country. Recently, when a supply of over 50 such cabinets was required, forms of tender, specifications and drawings were forwarded to all firms in the Saorstát likely to be able to manufacture such cabinets, including the Post Office factory.  The lowest Irish tender received, even conceding the usual preferential allowance, was, however, so <Col N="1057" /> much in excess of the London firm's price that the Government Contracts Committee had no option but to accept the latter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether the Land Commission propose to acquire compulsorily the lands of Mr. W.A. <Col N="1058" /> Wallis, at Rathregan, Co. Meath, whether he is aware that Mr. Wallis is a salesmaster and will be impeded in his business by the acquisition of these lands, also whether Mr. Wallis has offered other land of an equally suitable nature, or, alternatively, has asked to be allowed to retain one-third of the lands of Rathregan for the purpose of his business; whether the Land Commission have ignored both these proposals and on Monday, February 22nd, have issued an order fixing the Appointed Day as Friday, February 26th, and whether he will postpone the Appointed Day to allow further inquiries to be made into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission proposed to acquire under Section 24 of the Act of 1923, 515 acres of the lands of Rathregan, owned by Mr. Wallis, part of which are let by him for grazing, and the owner lodged an objection to the acquisition of the lands which was heard by the Land Commission, who, after hearing counsel for the owner, and his evidence and that of his witnesses, disallowed the objection.  The price was then fixed and notice thereof published.  The owner appealed against the price and his appeal was heard by the Judicial Commissioner, who fixed the price at £18,900.  The lands will be vested in the Land Commission on the Appointed Day, which has been fixed as 26th February, 1926, and the Land Commission do not propose to discontinue the proceedings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say a year ago, except that it would not be technically accurate.  Notice was given about a year ago for the acquisition of these lands.  During all that time&mdash;that is to say, during about a year&mdash;Mr. Wallis had an opportunity of making objections, and in fact, made many objections. All these objections were dealt with by negotiations which lasted, I should say, on the average, for a month in the case of practically each objection. <Col N="1059" /> Some of them were heard before the Commissioners, with counsel on each side, and some went to the Judicial Commissioner.  The last objection was on price.  That has gone before the Judicial Commissioner, and has been ruled upon, and now, after a year's negotiations&mdash;a year's notice&mdash; the Appointed Day expires on 26th February.</P>

    <P>The Dáil went into Committee on Finance, and debate was resumed on Vote 11 (Public Works and Buildings).</P>
    <Col N="1060" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel almost disposed to move a reduction in this Estimate, but I am afraid it would not have the desired effect.  I was rather amazed and disappointed at the statement made by the Minister for Finance last night, and the doubt expressed by him, in very carefully selected language, as to whether or not the Government had decided to proceed with this work on the Barrow.  I am surprised and disappointed, especially in view of the very definite statements made by him on public platforms during the recent by-elections.  On 24th January, speaking in Portlaoighise, the Minister is reported to have said in connection with this matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They were confident it was worth while going ahead with the scheme.  They were going to start work as soon as preparations were completed.  They had a staff working on the voluminous plans and specifications, and when that work was sufficiently advanced, a Bill would be submitted to the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the 7th February he was much more definite, and apparently had more detailed information at his disposal, when he is reported to have said at Mountrath:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The scheme would be a most expensive one.  It would run into not less than £750,000, perhaps £1,000,000.  If it ran to more than £1,000,000, at least half would have to be contributed by the Central Exchequer. The Government believed that it was justified in making that contribution because of the unemployment prevalent.  Some work would be done on the scheme next Summer, but the main work, probably, would not be in operation until the following year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Speaking here last night&mdash;I have not the Official Report before me, but I have a report published in the same journal as I have already quoted from &mdash;the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the work were to be gone on with, the localities and places benefited would have to pay half the cost&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently there is an element of doubt in the Minister's mind.  To me it <Col N="1061" /> seems clear that the Executive Council have not come to a final decision as to what they intend to do in connection with the Barrow drainage scheme. This scheme has been talked of for many years; it comes in for special reference during the periods of general elections and by-elections.  If the Minister made inquiries from the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, he could, I am sure, easily satisfy himself that sufficient unemployment and distress exist in the counties adjoining the Barrow as would justify him in going ahead with this work at once.</P>
    <P>On another occasion the Minister stated that a sum of fifty thousand pounds was available; they were, as a matter of fact, advised that the amount might be quite usefully spent and he indicated that a considerable sum could safely and economically be spent prior to the completion of the plans.  That sum of fifty thousand pounds that the Minister stated would likely be spent during the financial year that is now coming to a close has not been spent. We are now asked for £2,300, an amount which will not give much relief to the workless individuals residing in the Barrow drainage area.</P>
    <P>I always gave the Minister credit for being quite frank; he has been brutally blunt on some occasions.  I want him to be perfectly frank with the House and with the country now.  Will he tell us what are the real intentions of the Ministry in regard to this scheme?  If the Minister, when he visited the country recently, had gone into Mountmellick or Portarlington, instead of Edenderry and Mountrath, he would have discovered many houses in the town of Portarlington flooded to the extent of five feet and he would have found similar conditions at Mountmellick. People in those towns had to live in the upper rooms of their houses. Around that area there are thousands of people workless and there is destitution and starvation to a degree that one can scarcely imagine.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister&mdash;he could go in disguise if he wishes&mdash;to visit the Barrow drainage area, especially that portion from Athy and Carlow <Col N="1062" /> over to Shannon Harbour and on to Monasterevan.  There he would observe the conditions under which the people have to live.  Many houses around there are flooded annually, and the people have big difficulties to contend with.  It would be well if the Minister made an effort to find out the actual conditions prevailing.  I am sure he would satisfy himself that the unemployment and distress existing amongst the working classes and the small farmers constitute a sound reason for the immediate commencement of the work.</P>
    <P>This thing of relieving distress in the Barrow drainage area has been talked of too long.  I know the present Ministry has been considering this matter since the early part of 1923. Deputations representative of the residents in the affected areas placed their cases before the Ministry, and definite promises were made in 1923 and subsequently, particularly at the election in Carlow in 1924, that the work would be started in 1924.  Two years have elapsed and we seem to be as near the commencement of the work as when Ministers spoke in the Carlow election. The drainage of the Barrow is a work that would be of advantage to the State and of benefit to the community living in the areas adjoining the river banks.  The Ministry must have arrived at a decision as to whether the work would be a national advantage, apart from the benefit it would confer on the people in the affected areas.  I am sure the Ministers constituting the Government have made up their minds on that question.</P>
    <P>In the recent by-election I spent most of my time in the Barrow drainage area that is included in the Leix-Offaly constituency.  Wherever the opportunity occurred, I asked the people to vote on the issue of whether or not they were anxious to have this work done.  I asked them to cast their votes for the nominee of the party I was associated with as a protest against the failure of the Minister for Finance and his colleagues on the Executive Council to fulfil the promises they made in 1923-24.  If the Minister wishes to ask the agents representing his party at the counting of the votes what was the result of the <Col N="1063" /> voting in Mountmellick, Stradbally, Vicarstown, Monasterevan, and other portions of the constituency in the affected area, he will discover that every vote cast there was a very emphatic vote against the Government. I am sure that the majority of the voters there voted for the Labour Party nominee.  As to the result of the election, we are not disappointed.  The fact remains that the Minister has to recognise that in the recent by-election down there 24,400 people voted against the policy of the Government.  They did not vote against the Treaty, but they voted against the Government's policy.  The Minister will also find that 16,400 voted for his policy of &ldquo;go slow&rdquo; in regard to matters of this kind and other matters which affect the people in the locality.  The Minister must take a note of that warning. It is a message to him, and it is particularly directed at promises that have been made but not carried out.</P>
    <P>In this matter of the Barrow drainage those who constitute the Government have either to go on with the work or give reasons why they are not in the position to carry out their promises. There is a dispute as to the area of charge for portion of the cost. I think the Minister said that portion of the cost will be on the localities. That is a matter of detail.  Ever since the agitation started it was always accepted in Kildare, Leix, Offaly and other surrounding counties that the people would have to pay some portion of the cost.  The area of charge is in dispute.  Deputies Dwyer, Egan, Bulfin and Conlan, and other Deputies, will, I am sure, have something to say in regard to that matter.  The people they represent should be consulted, however, before the matter is finally determined.</P>
    <P>There are several important points to be considered.  When is the work going to be started?  Will it be started this year?  How many men will be employed? Will the workers be taken out of the particular areas where most unemployment and distress exist?  Is the Minister in a position to give a guarantee that whatever may be the area of the local charge, that area will be the <Col N="1064" /> one from which the unemployed will be taken to carry out the work?  Whatever portions of Leix, Offaly, Kildare, Carlow or Kilkenny are eventually selected as the area of charge, I make the claim that it is from that area men should be drawn to do any work that is necessary in connection with the scheme.  I want the Minister to make a clear statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>In the 1918 election the Minister for Justice said in Leix that if the people turned out the British Government and put in the Sinn Fein Party, the Barrow would be drained immediately.  Nearly eight years have gone by, yet nothing has been done.  The Minister for Justice has had ample powers since 1922, yet he has made no move.  It is up to him and the Minister for Finance to justify the promises they made in 1918. The time has arrived when the Government should be straight with the people.  They should not leave this matter of the Barrow drainage over until there is another by-election, and they should not be making themselves the laughing-stock of the community.</P>

      <P>I join with Deputy Davin in urging the Minister to have this work started during the summer. We have had repeated promises by the Government in regard to the drainage of the Barrow.  It is time to honour those promises, if there is to be such a thing as straight dealing in public life. The last by-election was properly called the &ldquo;Barrow drainage by-election.&rdquo; The Minister knows quite well the extent of the destitution in the counties drained by the Barrow.  He is aware of the high rates that were imposed this year to meet abnormal circumstances of unemployment and bad prices.  When he mentions that half the cost should be borne by the people in the affected areas, I think he is asking too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a deputation waited on Mr. McGrath, who was Minister for Industry and Commerce early in 1923, I put forward the proposal that the Government should pay two-thirds of the cost and the farmers one-third.  Most of the deputation agreed with that, but, at a later period, the late Senator MacEvoy said they were prepared to pay pound for pound.  There were a <Col N="1065" /> lot of dissentients amongst the deputation. Considering the adverse conditions the country had to face since, I think my proposal would be nearer to what the people are able to do.</P>
    <P>You must deal with this Barrow drainage scheme as a national scheme. It is no use to talk about it as a local scheme.  It affects the whole country, and, therefore, it cannot be considered otherwise than as a national problem. I would appeal to the Minister to start the work this summer.  As far as plans are concerned, I suppose there were enough plans made out to fill this Chamber.  I would urge that the work be started so as to relieve the unemployment that exists.  I understand the trunk road scheme has been turned down.</P>

      <P>I understand there will not be any votes for relief grants brought forward in the coming Budget.  What are the people going to do?  Are you going to say to them &ldquo;starve&rdquo;?

      <P>I desire to support Deputies Davin and Colohan in the plea they put forward.  I represent Carlow and Kilkenny, and my constituency includes areas in which people have been flooded for centuries.  I have been listening to politicians during the last three or four years, and I have heard all kinds of promises about the drainage of the Barrow.  The position is just the same to-day as when those politicians were endeavouring to make their way into power.  As far as I can see, the present Government is more interested in political pettifogging than in the safety of the people. Down in the district of Carlow-Graigue there are many people who, some two <Col N="1066" /> or three weeks ago, practically had to hang on to the very picture-railings on the walls of their houses, in order to keep themselves from being flooded out.</P>
      <P>During the last by-election we heard a lot about the drainage of the Barrow. The Cumann na nGaedheal candidate floated in, so to speak, on the flooded Barrow.  What are the people going to do in the affected areas? Around Bagenalstown, Leighlinbridge, St. Mullins, Graiguenamanagh, and especially round Carlow-Graigue, the people are seriously affected.  Something must be done for them.  As Deputy Colohan said, this is a national question.  The Government owe a duty to the people down there.  Members of the Government have made many promises in regard to the Barrow.  I hope it will not be left like Tennyson's brook:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister for Finance will take up this matter seriously.  So far nothing has been done beyond the making of utterances on public platforms by men looking for a seat in the Dáil.  I hope that the matter is going to be taken up seriously, and that the Barrow drainage scheme will be put into operation this summer to relieve the unemployed and to make the lands an asset not only to the landowners, but to the State in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. J. CONLAN Mr. J. CONLAN">

      <P>It appears that this question of the Barrow drainage serves, at least, one useful purpose. Judging by the speeches we have heard, it has served as a topic at elections within the flooded area.  I must confess that in my address to the electors I put it forward as a prominent plank, if you can call it such, in my platform. The statements that have been made by Labour Deputies are in no way exaggerated.  The amount of suffering and loss occasioned there year by year to the people resident in the district is something appalling.  I urged when this subject was before the Dáil before that the local people, the people who are interested and who will have to foot the Bill, should get definite information as to what the Government intend to ask as their contribution to the cost. <Col N="1067" /> During the course of the by-elections the Minister mentioned a sum of £700,000, and also said that it might run to £1,000,000.  In the report of the eminent Swiss engineer who was sent over to inspect the Barrow, the amount was set down at £1,100,000.  If you intend putting that on a limited area, such as Kildare and Leix and Offaly, I am afraid that it will impose an impossible burden on the people, and it is almost certain to give rise to opposition. When we speak of Kilkenny and Carlow it should be pointed out that there are no large areas damaged by the Barrow in either of these counties. The damage is confined to certain portions of Kildare, Leix, and Offaly.  On that account I think the Minister should introduce a Bill showing the provisions that have been made and the demands that will be made on local bodies or residents within the flooded areas, and obtain their opinion as to whether it is feasible to pay such a sum. I think, if the demands are reasonable and if the people will agree, it will greatly facilitate the carrying out of the work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any necessity for anyone in the Dáil further to emphasise the necessity of the drainage of the Barrow.  The Minister for Justice informed us some time ago that it had been a matter of controversy since the year 1815, and I think that everybody will agree that the grievance has somewhat matured since then.  Here we are definitely asked to vote a sum in connection with the Barrow drainage.  That, at least, is an indication that something is being done, notwithstanding the various reproaches levelled at the Executive Council for their tardiness in carrying out the work.  It is apparent to everybody that before the work can be undertaken the greatest possible care must be taken to see that proper plans are formulated.  I have been in the district within the last few days and I have seen surveyors and engineers active there.  Obviously, all these necessary preliminaries will take time, because it is a job of such tremendous magnitude that nothing must be left to chance.  It has been pointed out before <Col N="1068" /> that notwithstanding the fact that the Barrow drainage has been discussed for a number of years, there have not been up to recently any definite plans to enable the Government to go on with the work.  Deputy Conlan referred to the area of charge.  That is a very important matter.  I have no doubt that we will get more information when the actual Bill is before us as regards that point.  I would agree with Deputy Conlan that the people in those areas ought, as soon as possible, to have some indication of the precise machinery which is to be set up for fixing the area of charge.  I am aware that this matter of fixing the area of charge is a highly scientific operation. You have probably thousands of people affected.  Some of them will not have their land improved to an appreciable extent.  Some of them will have their land improved to some extent, and, perhaps, some land will not be improved at all.  The degree of improvement will have to be carefully measured.  It is possible that some of these people whose land may not be improved are afraid that the charge may be put on them.  I do not know if it is too soon to ask the Minister to give us some information on that aspect of the question, but if he were in a position to do so it would allay the fears of people there as to the future course of the work.  I have not listened to the Minister's statement in full, but I would like to have an intimation from him as to when we may expect the introduction of the actual Bill dealing with the Barrow drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise the doubts that have been created by the Minister's statement as to whether there is any serious intention of proceeding with this scheme at all.  We are going to vote the necessary money for the preliminaries, and I have no doubt that in due time the Bill, so long promised, will be produced.  The Minister's statement yesterday, however, rather suggested to me&mdash;I was a little doubtful on hearing it, but on reading the report, which seems in this case to be a fair one, I came to the conclusion that the doubt is emphasised &mdash;that the Minister is not quite sure whether the scheme will be put into <Col N="1069" /> operation or not.  On the whole, his inclination seems to be in favour of the scheme provided the present indications in favour of it continue, that there is not much prospect of the lands benefiting by the amount of expenditure, that there are all kinds of considerations to be taken into account, and that, in view of the fact that there is widespread unemployment, the balance is in favour of going on with the scheme.  That, I think, is a fair presentation of the Minister's case.  If one is to assume that the state of employment is going to be improved, then the balance would be tipped on the other side and the decision would be not to proceed with the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the point raised by Deputy Egan, as to the question which would arise when the Minister's proposal regarding the proportion of local expenditure is brought forward, it may be said that we may have difficulties with one council or another, and there may be objections from those people who think that their lands, at any rate, are not going to be benefited.  Again, the balance may be tipped against the scheme and the prejudices apparent in the Minister's speech against the scheme as an economic proposition would prevail and there would be no scheme at all.  I would like to know whether the new Deputy for Leix and Offaly&mdash;Deputy Dwyer, whom we welcome&mdash;has had any definite assurances on this point.  We know that the proposals put forward during the election were definite and specific and that &ldquo;the Government have determined to sanction a grant of £500,000 and a long-term loan of £500,000.&rdquo;  I think the Minister should give some information regarding the terms of this loan and the amounts to be levied against the locality.  It would remove many doubts and solve some problems as to whether the scheme is still in the hesitation period&mdash;whether there has been a definite decision on the part of the Ministry that they will bring in a scheme, whether the scheme will involve a certain charge on local authorities which will be mandatory, whether, if the local authorities approve or not, the scheme will go on, or whether it is all dependent on the reception of the <Col N="1070" /> scheme by the local authorities.  These, I think, are matters about which the Minister could give us some information so that the doubts raised in his speech yesterday will be dispelled and we will know what exactly is the policy of the Government in regard to this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to be as clear and definite as I can.  Professor Meyer Peter, last March, produced a report with an estimate of £1,130,000 as the cost of the scheme.  The Government, after some hesitation and with some difficult, decided that in all the circumstances the scheme should go on, and they were prepared to stand for a policy of paying half the cost out of the National Exchequer.  There has been no alteration whatever in that regard. It is still the policy of the Government to go on with the scheme and to stand here in the Dáil for the payment of half the cost out of the National Exchequer. The scheme, however, is not, strictly speaking, economic and even half the cost will leave a very heavy charge on the benefited lands and the surrounding areas.  It is most desirable, if it can be done without injuring seriously the utility of the scheme, that the cost should be reduced by any possible elimination of the works.  Professor Meyer Peter's scheme as presented to the Government was a general scheme and detailed working out of it was necessary.  In that detailed working out we tried to reduce the cost by any eliminations that fulfilled the conditions that I set out.  We do not know at present, therefore, exactly what the cost of the scheme will be.  If on the detailed working out it would appear that it could not be done except at a greater cost than the estimate of course we would have to reconsider the situation.  That does not arise.  But at how much less could it be done?  We cannot even say exactly how the cost will be distributed, as between the benefited lands and the other people in the areas, until we have had the reports of the land valuers and until we can have a fairly definite estimate of what the benefit to the particular lands drained will be, because the scheme is that the State should contribute half the cost and that the other <Col N="1071" /> half should be borne by the benefited lands and by the rates of a certain area.  The benefited lands would be charged up to the land-valuer's estimates of the benefits received.  The remainder of that half of the cost of the scheme will have to be contributed from the rates of the counties, chiefly Leix, Offaly, Kildare and something from Carlow.  Until we have actually decided the works to be done it will not be possible to fix the proportion as between these different counties.  So that until the work for which this Vote is being asked, and which is now proceeding, has reached completion, or an advanced stage, we cannot give any details that would be of use to the people of the district.</P>
      <P>As I said, I unfortunately regard the depression in regard to unemployment as something that will not pass away rapidly.  If there was no unemployment, or no unemployment worth talking about, I for one would certainly be against going on with this scheme.  But I have not the least anticipation that between now and the completion of the work a condition will be reached in regard to unemployment that will make it desirable not to proceed, so that the influence of unemployment on whether or not we will go on is an influence that, so far as all practical considerations are concerned, will not vary.  The scheme will go on.  With regard to the local authorities, it might well be that the local authorities, when we have full and absolutely definite figures that we can put up to them, will object to going on.  You had the Carlow County Council passing a resolution on the 12th May, 1925, protesting against the catchment area being the area of charge, and stating that the scheme should be a State charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  These are figures that I have seen before.  They are tentative figures.  If the areas were willing to pay anything like that, of course it would be sufficient.  You have Deputy Colohan saying that the local people, including the benefited lands, I presume, should only pay one-third of the cost, so that I anticipate that when the final figures are issued showing how much will be contributed by the State, how much will be charged to the benefited lands, and how much will be charged to the rates, a good deal of controversy will arise, and it is quite possible that a particular area will say that it would not go on, that it would prefer the scheme not to be proceeded with.  Then a decision would have to be taken as to whether or not the Government will stand for anything but for putting certain provisions into legislation to compel the payment of local contributions.  The question as to whether the local authorities are to have a voice about going on or not has not yet been definitely decided.  It may be that we will have to deprive them of a voice, because I think that even if they wanted it, and even if they were prepared to pay all that they were asked to pay, they would begin by refusing to go on in the hope of reducing it.  I would anticipate difficulties from the local authorities. This is just the one point of <Col N="1073" /> doubt in regard to the scheme as it exists at present, that is, whether the Government will decide to stand for a policy of not paying attention to the wishes of the local authorities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, yes.  That would not prevent certain preliminary work being done by the Government. It would not be a very costly thing and it would do some little good to the river.  Before the Bill is passed, and before the main work is undertaken, we must have some decision in regard to the local contribution.  That can be done by publishing our proposals and by asking the councils to agree to pay and to accept the scheme, or it may be done simply by giving statutory force to the scheme and by requesting the councils to pay us, in the same way as they were requested to pay the present 6d. rate.  The Executive Council when it considered this matter did not feel that it would be justified in asking the people of Kerry, Mayo, Donegal, Louth, and Dublin to pay for more than half the cost of the scheme. Whatever way the decision is arrived at we do not propose that the Exchequer and the general taxpayer shall be charged more than half of the cost, and our view is that it is not a matter of the catchment area either.  We would simply have to take the counties which will be most benefited, in addition to what the charge will be on the benefited lands, and to have a rate struck for these particular counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not tell Deputy Davin how many men will be required this year on preliminary works.  At any rate that work must be pending decisions as to the exact form of the scheme, and as to the precise work that is to be done in connection with the scheme, somewhat <Col N="1074" /> limited in character, just the work that can be done without involving expenditure that may, in the event of subsequent decisions, prove useless.  But if we did not spend £50,000 or any portion of it last year on the Barrow, at any rate we spent a considerable sum in various parts of the country on drainage work, and we had at a time as many as 2,700 men employed on drainage work last summer.  But the money that might have gone, had there not been other difficulties, towards a start on the Barrow was spent on other drainage work.  I do not know whether it would be possible to arrange that the people who are to be employed should be from the area concerned.  I think that that might be difficult to arrange.  Undoubtedly the work will have to be carried out under some form of contract, and I am sure it would not be possible to tie the contractors down to the local areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, particularly as there will be a substantial local contribution, that so far as possible local unemployment should be the unemployment to be relieved.  Most of the plans that existed were to some extent a source of difficulty for the Government. We had two or three different plans before us, conflicting plans, plans based on entirely different conceptions of what should be done.  We had one plan which was based on excavation, depending on the deepening and broadening of the channel.  We had another plan which depended on embankments. We had some plans providing for a considerable amount of work below Athy.  We had certain plans for other schemes which contemplated practically no work below Athy, and really the multitude of plans, and the conflicts that existed in the partially completed plans that we had, were a source of difficulty rather than of help, and it was because we had all these conflicting and incomplete proposals that we had to call in Professor <Col N="1075" /> Meyer Peter and get a scheme drawn up.  It was a very striking thing that, with all the discussions that have gone on, previous preparations had been of a very slipshod character in some respects. One thing was that there had been no flow measures of the river in the areas about which discussion had been going on.  Gauges had never been set up to show what the flow of the river actually was, and because the scheme is not strictly economic it is all the more necessary to be careful to have it done in the least costly way possible.  Since the Government came to a decision to go on no time has been lost, but we certainly could not pick out at random some of the papers in existence in connection with it and proceed to work on them without examination or elaboration.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say in connection with the scheme it has been decided to go on with now, whether any preliminary work could be done in the deepening and widening of the channels?  That is work that must obviously be done, no matter what the scheme may be.  The tributaries could be widened and sunk.  Work of that kind would not interfere with any general scheme for the River Barrow. If the work that I suggest were undertaken it would give employment to a considerable number of men.</P>

Of course, there might be certain shallow places that could be deepened, and work might be found in the way of pulling up trees and removing other obstructions.</P>

Supposing the charge is on two counties, I would like to know <Col N="1076" /> from the Minister, in the case of South Leix and South Offaly where there is a river that has to be drained at great expense to a large number of ratepayers in both areas, if these people, even though they get no benefit from the Barrow scheme, will be liable for the charges in connection with it, in addition to what they have to pay at present for drainage work.</P>

      <P>Some time ago the Minister for Justice made a speech, I think in the Leix area, in the course of which he stated that the Government would look to the local people for a fair contribution of the cost of the Barrow drainage.  I think everyone is in accord with that, and I do not think that the local people want to escape from paying a fair contribution.  The difficulty is to ascertain, what is a fair contribution.  I think the Minister would be well advised if he were to set up special machinery to make local inquiries both as to the area of land likely to be benefited, and the degree in which any particular area will be benefited. That is preliminary work that would need to be very carefully done. I think the Minister would be very illadvised in proceeding in a dictatorial way in sending down a demand to the local bodies for the contribution of a certain amount of money.  I think if he proceeds in that manner, it will certainly tend to defeat the object in view.</P>

They have been referred to; they have been almost invited by Deputy Thrift to give the amendment their support.  I agree with Deputy Thrift that it is not a very practical amendment from the point of view of legislation at the present time.  The Deputy said it was a matter of principle.  It seems to me as if we were ashamed of what we did last time and were trying now to get out of it.  I want to explain that if I leave this amendment to the House I am not a bit ashamed of what we did the last time.  I do not think there is any necessity for this amendment.  Personally, I would prefer to let the year 1935 legislate for the year 1936 and that we should not legislate for it now. Beyond the dislike that I have to legislating ten years ahead and, if I might so put it, pretending to be somewhat better than we are, I have no insuperable objection to the amendment.  If the Dáil desires to accept it, I shall not put any obstacles in its way, but, so far as most of us are concerned, it is like the man who plants the seedling of the oak.</P>

      <P>Deputies may remember that there was considerable discussion on this matter on the last occasion.  The view was put forward from the Benches that I am now looking at and by some of the Deputies that were then there, that some effort should be made to meet the agricultural needs of the country in this connection. Various suggestions were made, and I promised to consider them. I definitely stated that though I promised to consider them, I could not promise that that consideration would lead to acceptance of the suggestion put forward&mdash;that we should extend the period at both ends, so to speak, or that we should take power to provide different periods for different parts of the country.  I considered that matter very fully, and I came to the conclusion that it was impossible to meet, as I desired to meet, the views put forward by the various Deputies.  That was so, for a variety of reasons.  The too-great extension of the period would lead to difficulty in the enforcing of the Act by the enforcing authority.  From the school point of view, it would be objectionable <Col N="1083" /> also.  It did not seem to me that the alternative suggestion&mdash;to have different periods in different parts of the country&mdash;would work out well in practice.  After due consideration, I came to the conclusion that the real economic argument was for exemption at the beginning.  That is where the necessity comes in, especially in connection with the utilization of the fine weather in the spring to put down potatoes.  In considering that, it became apparent that the date actually mentioned in the Bill, however it might suit County Cavan, for which Deputy Baxter spoke, would not suit other portions of the country, and that an earlier date was advisable for other portions of the country, owing to the urgency of getting the potato crop in when favourable weather would occur.  That is the reason why I would like the Dáil to adopt the suggestion of the 17th March as the date on which the first of these periods shall begin.  That is as far as I can reasonably go to meet what I consider the very plausible and reasonable views put forward by the Deputies representing farming interests and other Deputies on the last occasion.</P>

I think the Minister has met the point very fairly in fixing the 17th of March as the first of these dates.  That would provide for the potato-planting period.</P>

First, the small farmer, whom we had particularly in mind, would be very little affected by that, and then, at the later period of the year, the evenings are long and there is not the same urgency that there would be about the harvest at the later portion of the season or about the setting of the potatoes at the other period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has been put down following a close study of the arguments used during the debate that took place when we moved to delete sub-section (3) and sub-section (4).  In effect, these clauses, which have been retained in the Bill, give power to keep children at home to do light agricultural work during certain periods of the year.  One Deputy after another who spoke in favour of the retention of the clauses referred to the usefulness of a young lad of 12 or 13 years of age in putting down potatoes or in helping to gather the crops.  I want to secure, by this amendment, that these clauses will apply only to the young lads of 12 or 13 years and that they will not affect the girls of that age&mdash;in other <Col N="1085" /> words, that young girls of 12 or 13 years will not be exempted from attendance in order to engage in light agricultural work.  I do not think there will be many Deputies who will advocate that young girls of 12 or 13 years should engage in light agricultural work.  I, therefore, feel certain that there will be no difficulty in accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot quite agree with Deputy O'Connell, and I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment. He says a young lad might be very useful.  A young lass might be quite as useful.  I am not going to attack this problem from the point of view that it contravenes the Constitution in regard to sex distinction.  I presume it does not.  I will leave that aside and attack it from another point of view.  Personally, I am not sure that it is not more desirable to have a girl of from 12 to 14 years engaged in light operations of this kind than to have her at school or even studying.  I think it is a more natural and a more healthy thing that at that period of her life she should be relieved from going to school. I certainly would prefer that girls at that age should get a little more manual work than that boys should, from the mere health point of view.  From the economic point of view, I do not think it would be fair that the small farmer who happens to be blessed with a number of daughters and who does not happen to be afflicted with any sons should be penalised as compared with his neighbour.  I hope Deputy O'Connell, when he considers the arguments I have advanced, will not find it necessary to press his amendment.</P>

      <P>They would not be so ingenious as to think of an argument of that kind.  I can fancy parents quoting that in every District Court all over the country when they are brought up for having their girls running about the roads instead of being at school. The Minister for Education, they will say, thinks they would be better off from a health point of view, and health is the chief necessity.  I hope he will tell us that he is not serious in putting forward that argument.  I would be sorry if I thought he were, but I do not believe that he is.  Of course, it can be said that a girl should be useful about the house at this time.  I personally would not like to contemplate the general keeping at home of young girls and the putting of them to work on a farm at that particular time of the year.  I do not think it is the right thing to do.  I think they would be better off at school.  I may point out that there is this advantage: Special attention might be given to the particular subject girls have to learn at school over and above what the boys learn. Girls have to do one extra subject, that is needlework.  If, during this particular time of the year, boys were at home &mdash;and the vast majority of our schools are mixed schools&mdash;special attention could be paid to needlework.  The Convention of Geneva says that it is only on the basis of vocational instruction that you could defend keeping them at home at all.  I think it is not proposed or suggested that our women when they grow up should be engaged in actual farming operations as a vocation. I do not think, therefore, it could be said that if they are engaged in putting down potatoes in the spring they are engaged in vocational instruction. I think the amendment is a reasonable one, and, in all the circumstances, the Minister ought to accept it.</P>

Personally I think there would be very grave objections to differentiating between boys and girls in the matter of light agricultural work of that kind.  Some of us have had opportunities in very poor parts of the country of seeing the conditions of persons on small holdings.  One thing that struck us very much is that the difference between a fair measure of comfort on a small holding and very poor and straitened circumstances depends upon the whole outlook of the woman on the holding.  If you have a woman of the house with an interest in the work of the holding, you have a comfortable home and a fairly comfortable living, whereas if the woman has not that interest you have neither comfort nor any kind of a fair living. I think it would be a great mistake to differentiate between boys and girls in the matter of engaging in agricultural work between 12 and 14, if you are going to have them engaging in it at all.  On the matter of needlework I think that the danger of making this differentiation would be increased if you are going to make it for the purpose of teaching the lady of the house needlework.  Training in needlework is very essential, but I think that ordinary and proper provision for it should be made in the ordinary course of the school year, without reference to the fact that girls should do it when the boys are putting down potatoes.</P>

      <P>There is just one point that occurred to me in connection with this section and possibly it might be useful for the House to consider it. It has been pointed out on several occasions by those who are in touch with juvenile employment and those who register at the Exchanges for employment as juveniles, that there is a very much larger percentage of illiterates amongst the girls than amongst the boys.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of that, but <Col N="1088" /> that is a fact.  That being so, it appears to me that it is essential that a protection in a Bill like this should be put in in favour of girls.  The section says that they are only to be exempted from attendance at school while engaged in light agricultural work.  What one is afraid of is that advantage will be taken of this section to keep these girls at home, and that instead of putting them at agricultural work which, as the Minister points out in certain circumstances, from a health point of view might be advantageous, it will possibly be found that the larger number of them will be employed at domestic work.  I think that is an aspect of the question that ought to be considered, and I think on the whole, when one comes to consider it, that possibly the solution put forward by Deputy O'Connell has a good deal to commend it.  It is very undesirable, I think, that parents should have the opportunity of making claims on the school time of children at the period when school time is of very great importance, and I would urge on the Minister that in view of the experience of those connected with juvenile employment all over the Saorstát&mdash;it is not confined to any particular area&mdash; that parents will try to keep the girls at home, because they are more useful at minding the younger children, and as I said, we must take steps to protect these girls against the inroads on the part of their parents.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will not give way on this amendment.  I do not see why discrimination should be made between boys and girls.  I do not believe that the statement as to the percentage of illiteracy being higher in the case of girls than in the case of boys applies to the areas occupied by small holders.  I believe it would be more applicable to towns and cities than to these places. Deputy O'Connell talked also about girls being employed at domestic work. I think that cannot possibly be the case because domestic work in the rural areas is very slight in comparison with agricultural work, and girls of that age are just as useful at agricultural work as boys are.  Apart from that, I think <Col N="1089" /> it should be very useful from the health point of view, if they are allowed to participate in hay-making work at that particular time of the year.  I believe it is very suitable and will be very useful for them.</P>

      <P>As regards the point raised by Deputy Good, it might be that in some of the towns there are more illiterates amongst girls than amongst boys, but I hope it is not suggested that by giving an extension that amounts to twenty days in the year, we are going to make an illiterate of a person that otherwise would not be an illiterate.  I suggest that the most obvious explanation of illiteracy is the fact that people do not attend school.  At least I hope that is the explanation.  I think the education of the girls is not lower than the education of boys.  On the whole it is rather the contrary; they reach a higher standard of proficiency than the boys in these matters.  The argument that was stressed on the last day and that I have already referred to on an earlier amendment was the necessity of getting in the potato crop.  That is the reason that I propose putting back the date from 1st April to 17th March, because the girls in that matter are quite as useful and as necessary as the boys.  I think that Deputy O'Connell can scarcely combat that point of view.  I am not quite sure exactly what Deputy O'Connell's picture of a small farmer's house in the country is.</P>

      <P>The suggestion that women are not engaged in agricultural work may be true of one particular portion of the country, but it certainly is not so all over the country; they take a pretty considerable share in the work.  The farmer's wife and the farmer's daughters play a very considerable part in the work, especially at these critical periods in the agricultural history of the year&mdash; the spring or the harvest.  On the whole, I am afraid that we must keep to what is in the Bill, in this particular matter.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 4, sub-sections (3) and (4), lines 35 and 42, to delete the words &ldquo;for his parent&rdquo; and substitute therefor in each case the words &ldquo;on or about his parents' farm or holding.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is one that I will press much more strongly on the Minister, because I think it is one that is very necessary.  It is proposed in this exemption clause that the reason for keeping the child at home should be that he is engaged in light agricultural work for his parent.  I am proposing to substitute &ldquo;for his parent&rdquo;&ldquo;on or about his parent's farm or holding.&rdquo; This amendment more clearly and definitely expresses what was in the mind of the framers of this clause.  I have gone to some trouble to examine somewhat similar legislation in other countries and I have never come across the phrase &ldquo;for his parent,&rdquo; while phrases somewhat like the one I propose are used in legislation in most of the Canadian provinces and in the United States, where they do give such exemptions.  There is no need to argue in favour of the amendment. The reasons for its acceptance seem to be self-evident.  &ldquo;For his parent&rdquo; is very indefinite, and in my view does not meet the object which the framers of the clause had in mind.  Neither does it fit in with the arguments used on the last occasion when it was carried.  The whole argument then was that the parent should have the help of his child at this particular time, but putting in &ldquo;for his parent&rdquo; may mean quite a different thing, something that neither the framers nor supporters of the clause had in mind.  This is a very reasonable amendment and I hope it will be accepted.</P>

      <P>It would be impossible to establish that there was employment. That is my whole point. The child might be kept from school and sent by his parent to work somewhere else, and there would be consideration in kind.  Some work might be done in return or a horse might be lent&mdash;there would be some consideration for the employment of the child. It would be impossible for anyone to establish satisfactorily that there was consideration given in that way or that there would be employment in such a case.  On the other hand, if the amendment is accepted, if the child is engaged somewhere else it will be known at once that he was not complying with the law, as he would not be engaged about his parent's farm.  It could be clearly established in that case that he was not complying with the law, whereas if you leave in &ldquo;for his parent,&rdquo; no matter where the child is engaged when away from school, you are not in a position to say that he was not in fact &ldquo;engaged in light agricultural work for his parent,&rdquo; because even if his parent sends him to work somewhere else he is engaged for his parent.</P>

It was not his intention to allow children to be sent out for remuneration or consideration of one sort or another.

In another connection I remember we had some other difficulty about the word &ldquo;holding.&rdquo;  It is exceedingly difficult, for instance, when a man lets land to another for eleven months to decide whose farm it is.  I know we had that difficulty in connection with the Drainage Bill, and I think we deliberately avoided the word &ldquo;holding.&rdquo; If we did not avoid it, I know it was a source of considerable difficulty as to how it should be interpreted.

      <P>That was my main contention, but a point has been raised by Deputy Conlan.  I had not considered whether there is a custom in the country such as he refers to. If there is a widespread custom of that type, I should like to have time to consider how far that should be recognised until this particular year&mdash;1936.  It is not an aspect of the case that I have considered.  My objection at the start undoubtedly was that I thought the words in the Bill were preferable to the words put forward by Deputy O'Connell, but now that another point has been raised by Deputy Conlan I should like to give it fuller consideration. I will confess that that also is in my mind as well as the other interpretation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>It was to guard against this very kind of thing that I put down the amendment.  There may be a custom of this kind in a few places, but it is the kind of custom that is responsible for the irregular attendance we have in the rural areas and it is a custom that, if recognised at all, would be open to very great abuse. Any child, whether he is required on his father's farm or not, could claim to be absent during those twenty days and plead this custom, and it would be very difficult for any District Justice to convict in a case like that.  The parent might say: &ldquo;I lent my boy to a neighbour to do some work.&rdquo;  It is these very things that the amendment was put down to guard against and I <Col N="1094" /> would urge the Minister not to give any consideration to that matter.  The plea originally made was that the small farmer would want the help of his children at certain periods of the year. That was the whole argument on which this claim was based, and that was the argument that was accepted by the Dáil, as Deputy D'Alton has rightly said. It was on that ground that this clause was retained.  As Deputy Conlan has shown, the words &ldquo;for his parent&rdquo; might be interpreted as meaning working for a neighbour.  We know that it would be impossible to establish employment in such a case, although it might be well known that there was a consideration given of one kind or another for the services of the child. That was the very reason that this amendment was put down, because it limits the employment of the child to the parent's farm.  I do not think there will be any difficulty about these words.  No claim can arise about land as under the Drainage Act.  All the Justice will have to say is whether the child was engaged on his father's holding or not.  If there was any doubt about the ownership of the particular field where he was working I am sure any sensible District Justice would not convict.  I do hope the Minister will see that this amendment really expresses more clearly the intention of those who argued in favour of the retention of this clause and supported it on the last occasion than the words in the Bill, which are open to a very wide interpretation indeed.</P>

      <P>In the particular agricultural industry that we are acquainted with in the Northern area, the flax industry, a special class of weather is required and children do the work.  It is work eminently suited to children, who would need to be available on any day that would be found suitable.  Usually people engaged on this work find that they require the assistance of more children than their own and they procure the assistance of the neighbour's children.  Similarly they would send their children to assist their neighbours.  Work in connection with the flax industry is very important work.  The interests of the agricultural community are served by having children engaged in the work and I do not think that for the matter of a day or two the interests of the children would be, to any great extent, affected.  When engaged on the flax industry the children are training their hands and feet, and they require to train their hands and feet just as much as their brains. I think there is too little attention given to the training of the hands and feet and there is rather too much being hammered into the children's heads.</P>

The question now is one of whether we are going to encourage the hiring-out of children, let the hiringout be for money or for kind.  I hope the House will agree that it is undesirable that parents should lend their children to do agricultural work, even in the districts Deputy McGoldrick speaks of, in defiance of the general purposes of the section as originally proposed. In the course of the discussion not one word was used in favour of this section except what implied that the work of the children was to be done on their parents' holding.  Every argument used was in favour of that proposition.  Now we find the idea germinating&mdash;and the <Col N="1096" /> Minister is giving some kind of encouragement to it&mdash;that the work should not be confined to the parents' holding, that the children should be lent about, transferred from one holding to another, and that the fullest advantage should be taken of the ten or twenty days' exemption.</P>
      <P>There was a reasonable possibility that the twenty days mentioned in the Bill would not be needed, that only two, three or four days would be utilised, and there was a maximum period of ten days in spring and ten in autumn allowed.  Now we are making it possible&mdash;even probable&mdash;that as between one farm and another the whole twenty days of abstention will be used because the children will be occupied in working for their parents and the friends of their parents.  I hope the Minister will see that the argument for the section was an argument in favour of children working only on their parents' land.  The object of the amendment is to make it quite clear that that purpose should be embodied in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The contributions to this discussion show it is the desire of the opponents of the Bill and of those who are anxious for child labour on the land that children should be given as much exemption as possible.

The discussion that took place in Committee on this Bill was on the basis that this work was for the parent.  Having heard the discussion, a number of Deputies were influenced to vote for it, feeling that there was a pretty considerable possibility that the whole of the ten days in the spring and the ten days in the autumn would not be used up.  If we are going to have the scope of the Bill widened to include people for whom the children can work, we are going to drift into a position in which the whole of the twenty days will be used up and the effect of that on the school work will be very great. If, from the 17th March to the 15th May, every child in the school, on varying days, is going to be absent for ten days, it will create a state of chaos for the teacher.  If the scope over which the child can be employed under this section is going to be widened from what was understood in the original discussion, you open the whole question again.</P>

      <P>It has been generally recognised, not only here but in the country, that this Bill was necessary because of the poor attendance at schools.  The House, in its wisdom, has decided that there are to be certain days in the spring and autumn on which a child may be absent for the purpose of working for its parents.  It must be understood generally that one of the causes of bad attendance at school has been this lending about of children from place to place.  It is the children we have to consider; we must look to their future, and surely it is not in their interests to allow such a loophole as is provided in this section in the Bill?  I hope the Minister will consider the amendment sympathetically.  We all have the interests of the children at heart, and I think it would be very unfair to let this section stand as it is.  I think it <Col N="1098" /> would be open to grave abuse.  It might be very much abused and the very thing we want to prevent&mdash;bad attendance in the schools&mdash;would be increased or, at least, would not be improved in the slightest degree.</P>

Deputy Conlan's point of view appears to be similar to the point of view stressed by Deputy McGoldrick.  There are certain crops which, unless you get them in quickly at certain periods of the year, will stand little chance of being saved and great damage will thereby be done. I understand it is the custom for neighbours to help one another in the particular way suggested&mdash;by allowing their children to work.  One man allows his children to work for his neighbour and the help is reciprocated.  I would like to give fuller consideration to this matter and view it in all its bearings.

      <P>On those conditions I am quite prepared to withdraw the amendment.  I hope the Minister will not place any undue weight <Col N="1099" /> on this lending-out system that he has heard of.  Crops may want to be saved at a certain time; but if all the crops have to be saved together where will be the advantage of transferring helpers? Deputy Conlan speaks of threshing. That is one of the things I never anticipated children would be engaged at.</P>

As regards the anxiety to get in a crop, I would be sorry to think it would depend almost entirely on the labours of the children.

As Deputy McGoldrick, who seems to have impressed the Minister, may not be here when this matter comes before us again, I would like to say that the conditions in Donegal regarding the employment of child labour are notorious. The Minister should not allow himself to be impressed easily by the statements <Col N="1100" /> made in regard to Donegal.  In many parts of Donegal children are hired out as early as the age of eight, and evidence was given that some were hired out even at a younger age.  They are hired out and remain away for six months from their homes at work, such as herding cattle, for the sake of £3.</P>

The people there have as great a love for education as those in any other county in Ireland, and probably have a great deal more than those in many cities and towns.

    <P>(5)  Of the members of a school attendance committee appointed under this section, each one of five members shall, so far as such persons are available, be either a manager or a patron of a national or other suitable school in the school attendance area, and one other member shall be a teacher in a national or other suitable school in the school attendance area, and, when the committee consists of eleven members, one other member shall be a member of the Juvenile Advisory Committee in the school attendance area.</P>

    <P>(8)  The Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, may by order prescribe the times and mode of appointment of members of school attendance committees by the councils of the said county boroughs and urban districts and by the Minister respectively, the time of commencement of the period of office of the members of such committees, the time and mode of filling casual vacancies in such committees and the period of office of persons appointed to fill such vacancies, and the times of meeting, quorum, conduct of business, and keeping of accounts of such committees.</P>

I suggested that at least one teacher should be appointed by the local authority, and he said: &ldquo;Why not by the Minister?&rdquo;  I have accepted that particular point of view.  This is a rather long and complicated amendment, and as we were changing as regards that particular point of view I thought it well to make other changes. As we know definitely, at least I hope we do, what school attendance committees are to continue in force, I thought it well to define that the normal number of a committee would be ten, and in order to provide for a member of the new body to which we are giving representation, namely, the Juvenile Advisory Committee, I have increased the number to eleven in those districts where there is such a Juvenile Advisory Committee.</P>

The number of these schools is very few.  I do not know that the people who conduct such schools will be particularly interested in this matter, and I do not think that there is any case for including such schools in this particular connection.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that this is a necessary amendment, and that having definitely given school attendance officers pensionable rights and having rightly done so, the local authority should have some say in the question of the appointment of school attendance officers.  I think that was put forward by the Minister himself when he said that the acceptance of Deputy Doyle's amendment was conditional upon the assumption that school attendance officers were to be appointed in the future on certain conditions as to age limits and qualifications. The amendment, so far as I understand it, requires that the approval of the local authority should be given to the appointment of school attendance officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The officers of school attendance committees are pensionable and the only change that this particular amendment proposes to make is that the school attendance committee can turn their secretary, who is an officer, into a school attendance officer, but both the officer and the school attendance officer are pensionable. A secretary, for instance, would be pensionable.  I think the school attendance officer and the secretary would be normal officers. Whether there is any necessity for preventing a school attendance committee transforming their secretary into a school attendance officer, or whether it <Col N="1108" /> is necessary to get the sanction of the local council or the Minister, is a matter for debate, and I would like to have the views of Deputies upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that it is desirable that the school attendance committee should be under some control by the council.  It is an organ of the local authority and up to the present the local authority has been strongly represented on it.  I think the amendment which we have just accepted, and rightly accepted, will rather reduce the representation of the local authority.  I think that the proceedings of the school attendance committee should be liable to be reviewed and approved by the local authority.  It only refers to a comparatively small number of cases in which the committees continue.  I think it is desirable that the link with the local authority should be close, and by giving this form of control which Deputy Good proposes the proceedings would be liable to their approval.  I would like the Minister to consider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment as it stands would give the committee power to appoint a person to a pensionable position.  It seems to me, if a person is to be appointed to a pensionable position, whether under a local authority or otherwise, that the authority of the local body, or the Minister, for such appointment is desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the proposition in the amendment, because I see that the committee is to consist of one half nominees of the local council and one half to be appointed by the Minister.  Officers of that committee should be, especially if they are to become a charge at all upon the local authority, sanctioned by the local authority, which is the elected body, and not by the appointed body.  I think that that is a reasonable claim to make on behalf of the elected local authority.</P>

      <P>I might point out that Section 11 provides that the school attendance committee may, subject to the approval of the council of the county borough or urban district, make general appointments.  We are only dealing with the case where the attendance committee may appoint one of its officers to be a school attendance officer, and in effect that is really another appointment.  I think to make it run with Section 11 that the Minister might put that in.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this is quite clear from its wording, I trust.  Where there is not a school attendance committee, as there is not, for instance, in the scheduled areas that we have in the Bill&mdash;the City of Limerick is one of them&mdash;there is no provision in the Bill to deal with the situation.  The Gárda Síochána are not in a position to take over the administration of the School Attendance Bill in that particular area. The alternative for that was to schedule it, and then the position would be that there would be a school attendance committee there.  If that did not work satisfactorily it could be dissolved and a supervisor appointed in its place.  It did seem absurd, as there was clear evidence that Limerick was not a place in which to establish a school attendance committee, to set up a committee there in order to dissolve it and to put a supervisor in its place. Consequently the amendment is introduced to meet that situation.</P>

      <P>In connection with some of the proposals that we have had under consideration in relation to this Bill it may be desirable, in certain circumstances, to have advisory committees set up.  This evening, for instance, we discussed the employment of child labour.  That is a matter, for <Col N="1117" /> instance, that might come before an Advisory Committee, especially in certain areas where a distinction may be finely drawn as to whether it is an agricultural or industrial area.  If it is the former, the section would operate, and if an industrial area the section would not operate.  That is a matter, I think, on which it would be well to consult local interests.  I am afraid that one of the weaknesses in this measure is that it possibly puts too much into the hands of the Minister, and too little on the particular areas. My experience of the working of the Technical Instruction Act was this: that one of the outstanding advantages of that Act over our Education Act, which applied to primary education, was that under it you had consultations with the areas concerned.  The Minister in that instance derived considerable assistance from the local people as to the various problems that arose from time to time.</P>

      <P>I think there is a good deal in this amendment by Deputy Good that is worthy of consideration. It might be a useful amendment to adopt, especially as there is to be no compulsion on the Minister to appoint advisory committees.  I take it that the intention of Deputy Good is that these advisory committees should be set up principally in regard to the powers conferred on the Minister under the new Section 23.</P>

      <P>That section gives power to the Minister to apply the Act in certain places and at certain times, and to a certain extent within the limit of fourteen to sixteen years of age.  In connection with that, I can conceive quite a number of things on which it might be well for the Minister to get the advice of local committees. There would, for instance, be such questions as the accommodation available, how best to make use of it, staff arrangements and so on.  I think if these advisory committees were set up that very useful work might be found for them.  They might serve, if I might put it so, as a kind of useful buffer for the Minister.  If they made recommendations it might be useful for the Minister <Col N="1118" /> to be able to fall back on them, rather than to be put in the position of bearing all the odium of doing a thing himself.  It might be well for the Minister to have local bodies to consult before putting into operation all the powers given to him under this new Section 23.</P>

      <P>I desire to support, very strongly, the amendment moved by Deputy Good.  If the amendment did nothing more than make local areas recognise their responsibilities in connection with education, it would, in my opinion, have served a very useful purpose.  In educational matters there is a big difference as to the systems that obtain here and on the other side of the water.  Here the Minister and his Department exercise a more or less bureaucratic control over education, whereas on the other side the local authorities, to the extent of very considerable contributions, take a great interest in their schools and in the educational problems of their district.  If Deputy Good's amendment did nothing more than create a local interest in education, then it would have done a very good work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from Deputy Hewat's reasons I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.  Either this Advisory Committee is for the purpose of this particular Bill, that is, securing the attendance of the children where the Bill operates, or it is for some other purpose.  Having listened to a number of speeches, I should say it may be for the purpose of helping the attendance of children at school, but it is much more likely to be for some other purpose outside the scope of this particular Bill.  If the amendment is meant to deal with school attendance, which is the purpose of this Bill, then you are up against the proposition that was discussed for a short time on the last occasion, of divided authority as between the Civic Guard and the School Advisory Committee. If you are to have an Advisory Committee under this Bill, its principal purpose, I take it, would be to enforce the Act and to give advice on that.  You would, therefore, have the Civic Guard as an enforcing <Col N="1119" /> authority on the one hand, and this advisory body, perhaps running counter to the actions of the Civic Guard, on the other hand.  I think that would make for maladministration of the Act, and therefore if the amendment is meant to achieve something that is within the scope of the Bill, I think it is objectionable from the point of view I have urged.  If it is meant to achieve something altogether outside the scope of the Bill, then I feel I must reject it.  As regards the point made about the exercise of the powers given to the Minister under the new Section 23, I think it would be less cumbersome and would lead to less trouble to get all the local information required indirectly, instead of directly through an Advisory Committee, seeing that the Minister himself will be the person to appoint this particular committee.  I am sorry I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that the powers given in the new Section 23 are brought into existence by reason of the extension of Section 2.  The difficulties that arose under Section 2 whereby we extended the school age from 14 to 16 were of such a character that certain powers had to be given to the Minister.  The Minister pointed out, and we all agreed, that for obvious reasons it would be inadvisable to put these powers into force immediately.  That, of course, would have happened if we had incorporated the amendment as originally proposed in the Bill.  When the matter was under consideration the question of school buildings was discussed, whether the schools were capable of extension and the number of scholars that they could accommodate. It occurred to me that the question of encouraging employment in a particular area by exemption, say, from attendance at schools of certain boys and girls who were in employment, and the arrangement, say, of continuation classes in the evening, were all matters that might engage the attention of local committees.  There is no reason, simply because you set up an Advisory Committee in one area, that you should <Col N="1120" /> set it up in every area.  I suggest to the Minister that he is more likely to achieve good results in the matter of education by co-operating with the local people.  He is acting apart from them altogether through his Department. There is nothing mandatory at all in this amendment.  It is only where it is thought desirable that advisory committees are to be set up.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that if these committees were set up they would be brought into conflict with the Civic Guard.  There would be no question of that at all, because the Civic Guard have certain duties to discharge and there would be no clashing between them and the local committees.  The amendment suggests, in connection with the extensions under Section 2, that before they can be put into full operation the local committees should be consulted. These are matters that cannot affect the Civic Guard.  If there was any danger of a clashing between the local advisory committees and the Civic Guard the Minister would have the power to say to the local committee that he was very much obliged to them for the assistance they had given, that he had the information he wanted, and that their duties were at an end. I think the Minister has taken a different view altogether of the functions of these advisory committees to that which I hold.  I do not see any possibility of a conflict between them and the Civic Guard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'CONNELL Mr. T. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of the Minister's argument was without any force in respect of this amendment and without any application to it.  Deputy Good has already disposed of that.  As I understand, the object of these advisory committees would not be to secure attendance at school.  You have the enforcing authority, as set out in the Bill, to do that.  It might be necessary to relate definitely the advisory committee to Section 23.  But I do say that such local inquiries as the Minister can make through his inspectors or officers will not meet the position fully, because it will not bring together the conflicting interests in a particular area.  The object of Section 23 is to bring the children between 14 years and 16 years into school and to <Col N="1121" /> give them a particular type of education. It may not, and I hope will not, be confined to the national school programme. There may be different types of schools in the locality.  You may have a technical school or an agricultural school, or it may be necessary to set up in some central area, where there are facilities, schools with higher &ldquo;tops.&rdquo;  It may be necessary to set up a school in a central area which will be entirely confined to children of these ages, and I foresee that all this will lead to conflicting interests.  If there were any way by which you could bring together these conflicting interests, it would be helpful.  If an inspector goes into an area to make inquiries, he may find that the authorities in charge of one school do not want this departure at all, because it is going to upset their particular arrangements.  The teachers of a particular area may not want it, because it is going to draw children over 14, who are attending their school, away to some other school.  They will object to it, and the inspector will be confronted with difficulties of all kinds. We know how difficult it is to make changes.  We all naturally want to go along as we have been going, because we do not know what danger there is in new arrangements or how it will affect our own case.  There will be all kinds of difficulties.</P>

    <P>I believe it would be extremely helpful to the Minister if he could set up, under this amendment, a committee which would give representation to all the interests that he thought ought to be represented&mdash;that would bring together all those interested in education in the area.  The value of such an arrangement would be that it would bring all those interested in education face to face in one room.  The Minister's representative could say: &ldquo;Here is a problem which we have to settle in your own area; could you give me any idea as to how it should be met?&rdquo; That would be the value of that arrangement, as against the sending in of an officer to make inquiries.  He <Col N="1122" /> may make inquiries from different people and get different views from practically everybody.  One man will have one objection and another man will have another objection.  It is only when all are brought together that you will arrive at the common denominator of the objections.  I think it would be possible to get a working arrangement in that way which you would not be able to get by the sending of an officer into an area to make inquiries.</P>

      <P>Many inquiries can be undoubtedly made by the Minister.  If there is any question as to seeking further information of the kind suggested by Deputies Good and O'Connell&mdash;to what extent and with what modifications Clause 23 might be made operative in a certain district&mdash;there is nothing to prevent the Minister appointing a Commission ad hoc.  But if you definitely state in the Act that there is to be an advisory committee, even with the saving clause &ldquo;for such purposes as the Minister may think necessary,&rdquo; you are undoubtedly setting up a body that will ultimately claim to be more than an advisory body.  Human nature being what it is, this advisory committee will not confine itself to the special purpose for which it is set up.  If it is found necessary to consult local opinion&mdash; not merely local opinion sectionally but local opinion collectively&mdash;there is nothing to prevent the Minister setting up a local commission ad hoc and asking them to investigate the matter. From that point of view, the amendment gives no more power to the Minister than he has already, and it has, from my point of view, very objectionable features.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 27:</P>
      <P>In page 11, section 25, sub-section (4), line 49, to delete all the words after the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;as compensation a sum equal to in the case of any particular officer one-sixth of the annual salary and emoluments of which he was in receipt on the first day of November, 1925, for each completed year of service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment, I submit, makes a very moderate demand on behalf of the officers.  It only proposes to give them bare justice.  As Deputies will notice, it provides for one-sixth of the annual salary and emoluments for each year of completed service.  The arguments in favour of it are perfectly obvious. I have in mind some officers who have given many years' service, and it is suggested in the section that they are to be disposed of with some amount, not exceeding in any case one year's salary.  That point should be emphasised. In my amendment it is proposed to give them one-sixth of one year's salary for each year's service.  I think that is a reasonable proposal and one that the Minister cannot advance any argument against.</P>

      <P>We put down the provision in the Bill because we were under the impression, taking similar officers, for instance, in Government employment who had non-pensionable positions, that, on the whole, it was a generous provision.  I have made inquiries as to the procedure and practice, for instance, in the case of a servant of the Government who had an office that did not carry a pension, and I was told that, roughly speaking, the average treatment when the office was abolished, was to give one week's salary for each year's service. Therefore, if a person had served, say, 30 years, which is, I think, the limit for any of the officers we are now considering, 30 weeks' salary&mdash;not one year's salary&mdash;would be the compensation given the officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will remember that we were dealing with another matter, the <Col N="1125" /> question of pensions for officers of School Attendance Committees, and that the argument I laid most stress on &mdash;I will not say it was the only argument I used&mdash;was the advantage, from the point of view of education, of having a pensionable officer.  This would save a tender-hearted Committee from the temptation of keeping on a man long beyond the usual period.  We would also remove the temptation from the individual school attendance officer to seek other employment, and to eke out the salary he was getting which, in itself, would not make provision for his old age.  There is another consideration that, I think, might be borne in mind, and that is, that in the particular case referred to we were dealing with a position in which the school attendance officers, practically, made it their sole source of revenue.  In the case of officers referred to by Deputy Hogan, I wonder if their sole source of revenue is derived from the salaries they get as school attendance officers.</P>

      <P>That is, simply, they have their ordinary means of livelihood, and, as a kind of side avocation, they attend to school attendance.  A paper was circulated some time ago about the accuracy of the returns given here.  For the accuracy of the returns I can accept no responsibility.  Probably, on the whole, they were correct.  They were supplied by the various School Attendance Committees.  Some are part-time and some are whole-time officers. For part-time officers the salary varies. Sometimes it is £6, and even lower. Sometimes it is as high as £52 per year. There are whole-time officers enjoying a salary of £35 yearly.  I wonder was it seriously contended that that would be the sole source of revenue of these particular people?  I think most of the arguments that apply in the case of compensation or superannuation for attendance officers that remain in the scheduled areas will not apply in this particular case.  As to what the actual cost would be, if you take the whole country, seeing the extent of it, perhaps it would not be very exorbitant. <Col N="1126" /> It might not appear very exorbitant, if you give them, say, one in every fifteen years.  Taking that as a basis, you can calculate it by multiplying any sum required by 2½ or 3.  For whole-time officers appointed under the Education Act, if you give them compensation of one year's salary for every fifteen years service, in a town like Carlow it would be £63; Drogheda, £116; Dundalk, £166; and Tralee, £203.  The total for whole-time officers of the urban areas would be £953 on that scale. In the rural areas it would be £2,118, making a total for whole-time officers of £3,000.  If you calculate for the part-time officers in the urban areas, giving one year's salary for every fifteen years' service, the figures would be £700, and in the rural areas £1,400. If you add these together, whole-time and part-time officers in urban and rural areas outside the scheduled districts, giving one year's salary for every fifteen years' service, the total would be about £5,000. I had hoped that Deputies would have expressed their views on this.  Deputy Hogan is the only Deputy who has spoken on the question so far.  I would like to hear the views of other Deputies.  I have given them certain facts from which perhaps they may be able to form a conclusion as to what, on the whole, is just.  As I said, we put down one year's salary in the Bill because, making comparison for their services, that seemed not altogether unreasonable.  In no case were we anxious to add to the burdens of the local authorities at this particular time.</P>

      <P>I think the amendment is reasonable, considering the duties those officers had to perform in the past.  I know officers in my own county to have given good service in the cause of education, and I think one-sixth of the yearly salary is not too much as compensation.  That would mean every school attendance officer having six years' service would get one year's salary on the abolition of his office.</P>

      <P>I should like to use some of the Minister's own arguments in support of my amendment.  He tells us we are not to assume these <Col N="1127" /> officers are whole-time officers and are entirely dependent on their salaries for their living.  That is exactly what a good many of them are.  The Minister makes a comparison between those officers with small salaries and other officers, but he does not tell us the salaries of the other officers to whom the same terms are given.  He made a comparison with officers in other departments who are not pensionable, and he says &ldquo;we propose to treat school attendance officers on the same basis.&rdquo; I will take the Minister's own figures. He stated fifty-two in one and six in another case.  Let us strike an average and say twenty-nine.  I suggest that is a fair comparison with the salaries the other people get?  He has made a comparison without any reference whatsoever to their salaries.  He submits five thousand pounds to be the cost.</P>

      <P>Although those officers are not whole-time officers, still a great many of them had given very long service, and I think in the case of some women who were attendance officers, the service in their case has been practically whole-time.  The country cannot afford to give pensions all round.  Still, when an office is taken compulsorily away, I think the people from whom these offices are taken should be treated as fairly as we can afford.  As the amount concerned is not very large, I suggest to the Minister he should consider giving one year for every ten years' service.  Some of them have served thirty years.  It is a sort of compromise <Col N="1128" /> between one year for every fifteen and one for every six, and would not make a very great difference.</P>

      <P>I expected some assistance from the House.  When local government matters are considered here, we get a great deal of assistance.  Up to the present I have got no view except that six times the salary ought to be granted.  Deputy Hogan says: &ldquo;What about a comparison of the salaries people, whom I mentioned, enjoyed.&rdquo;  They were whole-time officers.  The six pounds represents not a very considerable part of their means of livelihood.  In the case I referred to it represented a person's sole means of livelihood.  If the House is agreeable, I have no objection to saying one year in every twelve.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hogan is right in one point.  It does not follow that everyone whose position is abolished will get the maximum even as it stood.  The idea was that it would range, according to the number of years' service, from one years' salary to three months' salary.  If the Deputy would accept the one in twelve I should be quite ready to consider it. I will consider, between now and the Report Stage, whether it shall be one in ten or one in twelve.</P>

They are not losing their positions as the officers from the rural districts and the urban districts of the country are.

      <P>I could not support Deputy Hogan's amendment, because it seems to me too detailed.  My amendment is intended to give very much wider discretion to the Minister for Local Government and to the Minister for Education than they have in the Bill at present, by removing the limit of one year's salary.  I see no reason why we should tie the Minister down in this way. They should have regard to the circumstances of the case.  The Minister told us that there are some people who are doing this work for a nominal salary. I more or less inferred that it was a hobby with them and that they took the small amount to pay for shoe leather.  But there is no doubt but this fixed maximum would work unfairly now.  There are two cases in my own constituency.  In Balbriggan there is a whole-time officer who is secretary of the school attendance committee also. He, or, it may be, she has been twenty-four and a half years doing the job. The maximum amount that that officer could get is £55.  On the other hand, in South Dublin there is a secretary of a school attendance committee who also acts as a whole-time school attendance officer.  He has occupied the position four months, and yet that officer can get £100.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the Bill as it stands, and not on the improvements the Minister is borrowing from the Labour Party.  I am talking about the Bill as drafted and introduced. Under that Bill the officer who occupies the position for four months gets £100, and another officer who has occupied the position for 24½ <Col N="1130" /> years gets £55.  I do not say that is a thing that would happen.  I hope the Ministers would use their discretion to some extent, but it proves that cut and dried administration of this sort is not desirable.  It penalises the employees of one committee, that is to say in the case of a committee that has paid lower salaries and have kept the expenses down.  In the case of people who had their heart in the work and who were because of that satisfied to accept smaller salaries, the amount to be given would be definitely smaller than that given to persons employed by committees who were prepared to spend money lavishly.  My amendment simply removes the fixed limit of one year's salary.  It does not necessarily involve any extra demand on the ratepayers at all.  The pension would be fixed by consultation between the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Education.  But it does make it possible to take into consideration the local circumstances and the local differences that would make it in some cases desirable to give a slightly larger amount than this fixed one of one year's salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that I see a danger, or rather a difficulty, in this amendment as against the amendment suggested by Deputy Hogan.  I feel that it would be more satisfactory from the point of view certainly of the Minister, if there were a definite scale put into the Bill, because if you do not put in a scale you will have all kinds of arguments put up and all kinds of pressure used and all kinds of circumstances urged as to why a particular person in a particular case should get one sum, and a particular person in another case should get another sum.  I think it would be better for all concerned if it were possible, in accordance with the suggestion made by Deputy Hogan, to put a definite scale into the Bill, so that they would all know what they were entitled to normally.  Of course, there would be a discretion still left to the Minister, but normally that is what they would be entitled to.  I think it would be far better from the Minister's point of view, and possibly <Col N="1131" /> from the point of view, too, of Deputies who might be asked to make representation to the Minister.  That kind of thing has been sometimes done, but if there was, in the Bill to be passed now, a scale on which the Minister would be expected to act, this would be avoided.  That is what Deputy Hogan's amendment suggests.  I suggest to Deputy Cooper that if the Minister accepts the suggestion of Deputy Hogan, modified as he practically promised to modify it, it will be a better arrangement than as it stands at present or as it is in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">

      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy O'Connell that it would be very objectionable if there was not a scale.  The difference between Deputy Hogan's amendment and the amendment moved by Deputy Cooper, so far as that is concerned, is whether the scale would be fixed here, or fixed by the two Ministers in individual cases.  The Bill as it stands provides for a scale to be fixed.  Of course, one of the first things that would be considered would be the number of years' service.  If a scale were fixed I would suggest that the man who has 24½ years' service would not be in the same part of the scale as the man with four months' service.  That is quite obvious.  Assume that the section asks the Ministers to fix the scale, and then assume, if the Dáil can make such an assumption, that they had a minimum of commonsense, they would hardly put the man with four months' service on the same level as the man with 24½ years' service. Deputy O'Connell said there was danger, and I do not know whether he changed the word afterwards and said there was a possibility that the maximum would be one year's service.  I can understand a certain anxiety on the part of Deputy O'Connell to put in some higher maximum than one year, knowing well that the maximum put in will be actually the maximum that will operate.  If we fixed three years or two years maximum, the man with the longest service would practically get that amount of pension going out, and the others would be graded from him downwards.  I confess I cannot <Col N="1132" /> see any great virtues in this, except an immense amount of trouble that would be given to the Ministers and Deputies by the loose arrangement that seems to be suggested by Deputy Cooper's amendment, but that in reality is not suggested by Deputy Cooper's amendment.</P>

      <P>It is suggested and suggested definitely&mdash;an absolute principle. I am utterly opposed to all this trying to supply moral courage by putting restrictions in statutes.  Deputies and Ministers ought summon up their moral courage and turn down indefensible demands.  As it is we continually find that local authorities and Ministers and pensions boards are all hedging themselves in and saying: &ldquo;You have an excellent case but it does not come within the four corners of the Act; it does not come within the provisions laid down in the statute.&rdquo;  I think that is all wrong.  We ought to begin at the top in this case.  In this case it is only Deputies and Ministers who will be troubled.  We ought to face that trouble and to face the very disagreeable necessity occasionally of turning down our constituents, but the evil goes the whole way through.  In the Local Government Bill various provisions were put in because local authorities could not be trusted not to vote away the ratepayers' money in large sums.  They have got to face the responsibility and face the ratepayers. All these artificial safeguards are like the precautions with which a doctor surrounds a sick man, and we should be recovering the health of the body corporate sufficiently to be able to get over them.  All I have heard from Deputy O'Connell and the Minister convinces me all the more that I was right in putting down this amendment.  I framed that amendment not from the point of view of saving Ministers trouble, which I sometimes try to do, not from the point of view of saving my mail bag from being overloaded with letters, but from the point of view that we have got to face these things out and face this responsibility and not protect ourselves by inserting restrictive clauses in statutes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper has <Col N="1133" /> propounded a most extraordinary doctrine. We have been discussing supplementary estimates to-day.  Why? Because it was necessary, and Deputy Cooper should know, that there should be some restriction on the expenditure of Ministers, that their moral courage was not enough restriction, that there should be some legal and statutory restriction on their power to spend money.  I thought Deputy Cooper was one of the strongest exponents of that doctrine.  Now I gather one of the securities the people should have is the moral courage of Ministers, Ministers who are variable.  The moral courage of X to-day is of a higher grade than that of Y to-morrow or next year, and the allowances and the scales that are granted are going to vary according to the moral courage of Ministers.  I was doubtful until Deputy Cooper made his last statement as to whether there was not something in his case, but now I am convinced that he is on the wrong track entirely and that there must be some check on expenditure besides the moral courage of Deputies or Ministers.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete from the Schedule, the words &ldquo;the County Borough of Limerick&rdquo; and &ldquo;the County Borough of Waterford.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am moving to delete these areas from <Col N="1134" /> the Schedule in response to demands which I have got from both of these areas and which I consider to be representative demands, in the case of Limerick especially.  I understand&mdash;as a matter of fact I think the Minister said it himself a few minutes ago&mdash;that there is no school attendance committee operating in Limerick at the moment, effectively operating at any rate.  I have been informed on very good authority that the Juvenile Advisory Committee which exists in Limerick has passed a resolution asking that the area should be deleted from the Schedule and that the Gárda Síochána should be the enforcing authority in Limerick.  If that is the case I can see only one possible reason, which was indicated by the Minister, for the inclusion of Limerick in this Schedule.  That is that the Guards are not in a position to take up this duty. Candidly I cannot conceive that that would be the position.</P>
    <P>I do not think it will throw on the Gárda Síochána in Limerick such a very onerous duty that they would not be in a position to discharge it.  I would be surprised if that were the case, and I would require very strong evidence indeed to convince me that they are not in a position in Limerick to act as enforcing authority under this Bill.  As I say, that could be the only possible argument, so far as my information goes, especially in Limerick; and the same thing practically applies to Waterford, perhaps though not to the same extent, because I think there is a Committee functioning in a small way in Waterford.  My information is to the effect, however, that it is felt there that the Act will not be a success unless it is administered by the Gárda. I do hope, therefore, that the Minister, in view of the facts which have come to my notice and which possibly are correct, with regard to the position of the school attendance committees especially in Limerick, will explain to us why he has excluded Waterford and Limerick from the jurisdiction of the Gárda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I think I have on more than one occasion put forward what my position is in this matter &mdash;on the first occasion in answer to <Col N="1135" /> Deputy Morrissey.  Our idea was to have, without any reference, as I pointed out before, as to whether in any areas, committees were good committees, indifferent committees, or bad committees, the Act administered everywhere by the Gárda.  At first the Gárda thought they would not be able to undertake the administration of the Act anywhere, but then they consented to undertake the administration of the Act in most of the country.  They definitely excluded areas in which they could not at present undertake the administration of the Act&mdash;what I may call the Dublin, Waterford and Limerick areas.  I put it up again to them to give it their full consideration, and they gave it very full consideration and endeavoured to see whether they could not undertake the administration of the Act in these two places.  Again they were quite definite that they could not at present, at all events, undertake the administration of the Act there. That being so, there is no choice but to keep to the proposition in the Bill.  That was the reason why I could not table an amendment to exclude Limerick and Waterford, however much I might desire to exclude both of these cities. It was especially desirable in the case of Limerick, where there is no committee in existence, and where there is no prospect, as I know, of getting a good committee.  As the Dáil knows, I have already provided measures to deal with that case.  There will be no necessity to call a committee into existence there.  We will be able to deal with Limerick as we would with the scheduled areas where we have to abolish committees and appoint a supervisor. In Waterford the case is not so strong. There is one reason why we cannot exclude Waterford and Limerick from the schedule, but that is a sufficient reason so far as I am concerned why we cannot thrust that over on the Gárda at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I could not state it.  There is a strain on the Gárda, and it was <Col N="1136" /> definitely put up to them, and they decided it was outside their resources at the moment.</P>
      <P>They were very clear on the point. There was no hesitation.  They considered it again at my suggestion&mdash;carefully and sympathetically considered it&mdash; and made every effort to see if they could administer the Act in those two places.  Again the answer was that they could not.  The situation at present did not allow them to undertake the administration in those places.  If the Committee in Waterford does not administer the Act properly we have the same remedy that we have in the case of Limerick.  I suggest that Deputy O'Connell might be satisfied with that explanation.</P>
      <P>I am not by any means sorry that the Deputy moved this amendment, apart from the fact that I am unable to accept it, because whatever may be said about the possibility or the advisability of not having the Gárdaí administer the Act in Waterford or Limerick, there can be no excuse for extending the areas which are not to be administered by the Gárdaí as suggested in other amendments.  Our idea is, wherever the Gárdaí are willing to undertake it, to have this Act administered by them.  As I said already, there is no slur on any of the committees who are at present doing excellent work.  There is no suggestion that these committees are not hard-working, but for a variety of reasons, especially for the sake of uniformity, we should prefer to have the administration through the Gárdaí.  That is what we are aiming to achieve; that is what we have achieved in the country outside the scheduled areas.</P>

      <P>If the Minister takes up the position that he has put it definitely to the Gárdaí to take on the work and they say that they are not in a position to do it, it would be quite impossible to force the matter on them.  Though it might be done, it would be quite inadvisable to do it, because if they were forced to undertake it against their will, they would not have very much heart in their work.  But I must honestly express <Col N="1137" /> surprise that that is the state of affairs. I am quite prepared to accept it, but I am not very strongly convinced on the matter.  However, I do hope that the matter will not be lost sight of, and that in the near future it will be put up to them again whether it would not be possible for them to undertake the duties in those two areas especially. I suppose there is nothing to be done in these circumstances except to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish Deputies to realise that the Gárdaí at first were under the impression that they could not undertake the administration of the Act anywhere.  They have now gone very far to meet us, and I think that should be recognised&mdash; that we should bear in mind not so much what, for the moment, they are unable to do, but what they have undertaken to do willingly, because they saw the necessity of it, although they recognised the drain that it will be on their resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy ought to recognise that in densely populated areas the imposition of a duty such as this would necessitate the employment of a much larger number of men than are available at present. The demands on the Gárdaí are very considerable, even in the rural areas, and this does place a large additional burden on them.  I think it was explained here last year that one of the reasons for the delay in connection with the introduction of this Bill was this difficulty of having it administered. It is hardly necessary to point out that modern conditions have imposed a very considerable strain on the Gárdaí.  In the city of Dublin fifteen years ago there was one policeman on point duty; at present there are 150. To get men to do this extra work would mean either taking men away from the duties they are employed at at present, or increasing the numbers.  So that it is not that they are unwilling to take on the duty, but rather that it would be difficult to expect them to take it on in addition to the other duties in a densely populated area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">

      <P>I should like to say that I recognise the benefit it would <Col N="1138" /> be, so far as the enforcement of the Act is concerned, if the Gárdaí undertook to enforce it.  It is because I am thoroughly convinced of the beneficial effects of their administration of it in the country that I am so anxious to have those benefits extended to other areas.  I quite recognise the force of the case that has been made by the President and the Minister, but I should like to say that if the Gárdaí undertook the administration in densely populated areas I believe the effect would be even greater than in the rural areas.  For that reason I was wondering whether it was too late even now to put something into the Bill which would give a certain discretion to the Gárdaí, in those areas where the Act is not administered by them, to question any child found about the streets who is obviously of school-age with the object of finding out why he was not at school.  Anybody who goes about our cities encounters children who should undoubtedly be at school.  The school attendance officer cannot possibly deal with all of them in densely populated areas.  If it were felt that the Gárdaí had power to inquire why they were not at school it might have a very beneficial effect.  The Gárdaí could do very useful work in that way by reporting to the school attendance officer.  I throw out that suggestion, which may be worth consideration even now.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 11 to add to the Schedule the words &ldquo;Dalkey Urban District.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, it is necessary for me to make the conventional case that the School Attendance Committee in Dalkey is an efficient one and that it is the desire of the local authority that it should be continued.  School attendence in Dalkey last November varied from 84 to 88 per cent.  I asked the Minister for figures with regard to some other counties, and I find that in Wexford it was 70 per cent., and in Mayo and Cavan about 68 per cent. But I realise that the Minister stated there are many efficient School Attendance Committees all over the Saorstát, and that that in itself is not a sufficient reason.  The reason I move this <Col N="1139" /> amendment is that he has himself in the schedule exempted the urban districts of Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock which adjoin Dalkey and are absolutely similar in character to it.  I find it hard to believe that the Gárdaí cannot enforce the School Attendance Act in Dun Laoghaire, but that they can enforce it in Dalkey.  The townships are actually very closely connected educationally. A number of boys from Dalkey go to Dun Laoghaire every day to school and a number of girls from Dun Laoghaire go to school at the Convent in Dalkey.</P>
    <P>It seems to me very difficult to enforce the Act when one urban district is under one system of enforcement and the other is under another system. It is very difficult from the point of view of the Gárdaí themselves.  The headquarters of the Gárdaí are actually in Dun Laoghaire, and the Superintendent of the F Division in Dun Laoghaire will be enforcing with the Gárdaí one law in Dalkey and a different system altogether in Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock.  Officers will be liable to be transferred from time to time and you will have officers from Dun Laoghaire coming to Dalkey who know nothing of the enforcement of this Act and who will be asked suddenly to take it up.  Dalkey and Killiney will be the only parts of what is called the Metropolitan District in which the Gárdaí are called upon to enforce it and I do see great administrative difficulties from that point of view.</P>
    <P>Another argument I should like to put very briefly is that it is very possible that in future Dalkey will be amalgamated with Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock in a coast borough.  I do not want to forestall the report of the Greater Dublin Commission, but I know that a case has been made for that amalgamation and that actually a Private Bill has been deposited in the Private Bill Office to bring about that amalgamation.  Surely the Minister will admit that it will be anomalous if you have a borough with one system of school attendance in one end and a different system in the remaining two-thirds.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister to <Col N="1140" /> accept this amendment.  I have given up expecting Ministers ever to accept amendments, but I would ask the Minister if he will have a further conference with the Gárdaí on the subject with regard to the points I put forward as to enforcing from Dun Laoghaire a special system in Dalkey that is not in force in Dun Laoghaire. I think administratively there are serious difficulties in the way and I shall be glad if the Minister will examine them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always rather nervous about opposing Deputy Cooper's amendments, because in nine cases out of ten I find the arguments I use can only convince him all the more steadily of the rightness of his position. He will easily understand why I am a bit nervous about opposing him on this occasion.  Still, oppose him I must.  I explained my position very clearly: that where the Gárdaí were willing to take over the administration we were anxious they should take it over. They are willing to take it over in Killiney, Ballybrack and Dalkey and incidentally, I may remark, in various other places that an attempt is being made by other amendments to get included. For that reason, because it is the most satisfactory way of administering the Act, we see no reason for including any extra place in the schedule.  It seems to be unreasonable to include, say, Dalkey, Killiney, North Dublin and Clonmel if we do not include a place like Kilkenny.  It would be unreasonable to include Kilkenny if you do not include Galway.  It would be unreasonable to include various towns if we do not include some other places.  In many cases there is the efficiency of the school attendance committee to be urged, judged by the average attendance on the rolls, and there is also the desire of the local authority.  These, as Deputy Cooper mentioned, are the conventional reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper also urged that in the future Dalkey and Killiney may be amalgamated with a greater Dublin. Personally, my hope is that before any such thing occurs there will be an amalgamation also in the other direction: <Col N="1141" /> that the administration of the Act in districts convenient to Dalkey within the Metropolitan area will be taken over by the Gárdaí and I hope that amalgamation will take place before the possibly distant date that is contemplated by Deputy Cooper.  We realise there is nothing very anomalous in the fact that simply because you have one such big authority, there should be different authorities under the School Attendance Bill.  You have that to a certain extent in the city of Dublin.  At the present moment you have several distinct committees, each responsible for its own district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe, according to the Minister, there are not sufficient Gárdaí available for the work. That applies especially as regards Clonmel and Tipperary.  The Gárdaí <Col N="1143" /> in both places are very limited in number. In Clonmel the school attendance committee has charge of local services, including school dentistry, child welfare, etc.; all these things are controlled by the one committee.  The reports of all those boards come before this committee.  The school attendance in Clonmel has reached a 95 per cent. standard.  In Clonmel and Tipperary school attendance is good because the school attendance committees are interested in the work and there is no occasion for the Gárdaí.</P>
      <P>This Bill was brought in for the purpose of ensuring the attendance of children at school.  Where you have a school attendance committee such as in Clonmel, the schools are visited every school day.  There is no possibility of any child being absent.  If a child is absent, members of the committee go to its home and ascertain why it has not been sent to school.  You are now going to take this work out of the hands of Catholic and Protestant clergymen, important drapers, members of local authorities and fathers of families who are interested in this work.  They have done good work and they have brought up the school attendance from 50 per cent. to 95 per cent. of the full school roll.  I do not think it is good to bring in a civil power where it is not necessary.  You are now going to bring in the Gárdaí where they are not required.</P>
      <P>If the school attendance committees are not doing their duty, it should be open to the Minister to take immediate steps to have the Act administered as he may think fit.  Why take the work from those who do it usefully and voluntarily?  The members of those school attendance committees are usually connected with other activities and they are daily in contact with the schools and the homes of the people. I move the amendment and I hope it will be supported.  If the Minister wishes to place it in the same category as Dalkey, Killiney and Ballybrack, he will have to explain his reason for so doing.</P>

I submit that the members of that committee will have a wider field now.  The duty of getting the children into the school will be handed over to the Gárdaí, and the members of the committee will have a wider field in which to expend their very useful energies.  I am glad there is one place in Ireland where an interest of the kind the Deputy speaks of is taken in school life.</P>

While accepting the Deputy's statement that there is a Committee there which takes an interest in its work, I suggest that in looking after school buildings, child welfare, meals for necessitous children, medical inspection and finding employment for such children as have passed the school age, the Committee will be very fully employed and can well afford to leave this other work to the Gárda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I have not the slightest doubt that the tribute that has been paid by Deputy D'Alton to the Clonmel School Attendance Committee is well deserved.  I am not quite sure about his figures.  I do not say my figures are more correct, but there may be a slight divergence as to the actual percentages.  The figures for 1924 show that 84 per cent. of the children on the rolls attended in Clonmel Urban District. According to the Census of 1911 the number of children between the ages of five and fifteen was 1,745.  Of that number, 1,600 would be what I might term available children.  The number on the rolls is 1,043 and the average attendance was 84 per cent. <Col N="1145" /> There are other places.  The attendance in Deputy Cooper's Dalkey is 86.6; in Drogheda it is 86.5; Dundalk, 85; Fermoy, 89, and Wicklow, 85.5.  From the point of view of effectiveness under this Act, I think Deputy D'Alton will recognise that in regard to other places as good a case can be made out as for Clonmel.  It comes to this, that I could see no reason for taking on a place like Clonmel or Tipperary or Kilkenny.  I am sorry I cannot accept this particular amendment.</P>

That was rather a disturbed time, a time when everybody was a law unto himself.  The school <Col N="1146" /> attendance committee there have worked very hard and have done excellently by keeping the attendance as it is.  I would not support this amendment if I thought it would, in any way, retard the progress of school attendance, as I desire to have it at the highest point possible.  In the City of Kilkenny there is a population of 11,000, and in my opinion where there is such a large number of people the Gárda Síochána will have a difficult task to perform in regard to school attendance.  The local committee should be allowed to co-operate with them and the borough should be included in the Schedule.</P>

      <P>I feel impelled to move an amendment to insert Killarney and Tralee in the Schedule. The percentage there is 81 per cent. and the number on the roll between the ages of five and fifteen, according to the Census of 1911, is just 100 short of that in Galway.  As a Minister, I would oppose such an amendment, but as a Deputy for Kerry I would be inclined to put down an amendment in favour of the inclusion of Killarney and Tralee.  I will admit that there is very good work being done in Kilkenny by the local school attendance committee. The school-going population between the aged of 5 and 15 is 2,240, and the number on the roll is 2,027, which, in itself, is rather unique.  I pay that tribute to Kilkenny, but on general principles we must rule out Kilkenny. I do not think, moreover, that there is full unanimity even in Kilkenny itself as to whether this school attendance committee should be kept on.</P>

      <P>I looked upon this question, not as a representative of Kilkenny, but as a person responsible for doing what is fair and just to the whole country.  Having looked at Kilkenny, I approached the next largest borough, which is Galway, and I found that Galway is out.  There is this danger in urging a smaller place to be inserted and a larger place to be excluded, namely, that a very popular Deputy, if he were so inclined, might canvass and induce a large number of his friends to have his town included.  That would be bad law and would reduce the character of the Dáil.  As such, I am not satisfied that there is a case for the inclusion of Kilkenny.  I am going to supplement what the Minister has said. I have heard objections from people in Kilkenny to the inclusion of the borough.  I have also heard a case from Kilkenny to have it included, but, having considered all the circumstances, I am satisfied that I would not be justified, as a national representative in the Dáil, in putting in Kilkenny and keeping out Galway.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil learns with alarm and disapproval, from the communication of the President to an English newspaper, that secret negotiations with external Governments have been carried on of late, if not at his instance with his knowledge and consent, directed to cap the London Agreement with an economic treaty; and the Dáil condemns and forbids the commitment of this State to changes of its fiscal policy and surrender of its fiscal freedom by covenants entered into on its behalf by Ministers of the Executive Council without previous authorization and specific mandate from the representatives of the people.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion obviously consists of two parts.  The first part deals with facts, and the second with constitutional doctrine.  The facts are: the now notorious letter of the President to the &ldquo;Morning Post,&rdquo; the revelations arising out of it as made by the &ldquo;Morning Post,&rdquo; and the interview, or what purports to be an interview, with one of the daily papers.  The constitutional doctrine asserts certain principles which ought to regulate the conduct of affairs in a State such as this, whose ideal is to have responsible representative government.  As regards that portion of the resolution, the amendment of Deputy Johnson is practically identical in purpose and idea, and I should have no difficulty whatever in accepting that amendment, not in substitution for the entire motion which I move, but for the second portion of it.  I could not accept it for the entirety of the motion because the special value of the earlier part lies in this, that it gives the President an opportunity for making clear to the satisfaction of the nation what his real position in this matter is, if it differs from what it appears to be from a consideration of Press reports.  Whether the President will believe me or not, I take this opportunity of declaring that if he can make his position right, there <Col N="1150" /> is no member of the Dáil or of the public who will be better pleased than I.  I ask the Dáil to declare that it has learned of this transaction with alarm and disapproval, that is to say, that it shares the feelings of people outside this House.  The &ldquo;Derry Journal,&rdquo; for example, which implicates impressions and feelings so far north, in its issue of Monday, February 22nd, says:&mdash;&ldquo;Whatever action the Dáil may take on the now famous letter to the `Morning Post' may we assert that that document is condemned, resented and repudiated all over the country.&rdquo;  Now, I am not by any means the only person who was alarmed.  Never since the infamous Pigott letter appeared in the London &ldquo;Times&rdquo; was there any communication in a London newspaper which has excited so much interest and comment as the President's notorious letter.</P>
    <P>Both London newspapers, &ldquo;The Times&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Morning Post,&rdquo;&ldquo;The Times&rdquo; in that day and &ldquo;The Morning Post&rdquo; in our day, were the notorious enemies of Irish national claims, and they were the determined upholders of the policy that would frustrate the realisation of Ireland's hopes of self-government.  The one extraordinary point of difference, I may say in passing, lies in this, that whereas in those days no one accepted the letter signed with the name of Parnell as authentic&mdash;every genuine Nationalist regarded it as an audacious forgery&mdash; it shows how far the President's stock has fallen in the political market that no one on reading this letter declared: &ldquo;Some enemy has done this thing.&rdquo;  It was accepted as his.  The public marvelled at the egregious folly of the performance, but they never doubted for a moment that the performance was his. One body was alarmed&mdash;the term it used, was &ldquo;anxiety,&rdquo; but I take it that anxiety is a form of alarm&mdash;and a report of it was given both in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; and in the &ldquo;Irish Independent.&rdquo; I should say that the Irish Press, including the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; which is regarded in some circles, rightly or wrongly, as now the official organ of the Government, preserved an extraordinary silence from the moment of the <Col N="1151" /> publication of the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; letter, and the &ldquo;Morning Post's&rdquo; revelations thereon.  I take it that they found on reflection that the most friendly service they could do to the Party whose cause they espoused was to give to it the charity of silence.  But in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; at any rate room was found for this report of a meeting of the Federation of Irish Industries, of which Senator Sir Nugent Everard is president.  A meeting of that body was summoned to consider what is called &ldquo;The situation created by President Cosgrave's letter&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>

    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;19th February, 1926.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,&mdash;Your communication to the Editor of the `Morning Post,' published in that journal on the 15th inst., and the many Press comments on same, have been under consideration by my Executive.  I am directed to convey to you that a feeling of anxiety has developed amongst our members, who are taking advantage of the existing tariffs to extend their manufactures in the Free State, lest the inferences drawn by the `Morning Post' from your letter and interviews should indicate the intentions of the Government.  My Executive feels that, while the suggestion that our tariffs should be abandoned is unthinkable, a statement that nothing more should be read into your letter than what it actually contains would greatly help to allay the existing uneasiness, and, perhaps, prevent the stoppage of some industrial developments under consideration at the moment.&mdash;Mise le meas,</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;THOMAS S. LAWLER,</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;Organiser.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The following is the President's reply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the President to refer to your letter of to-day's date and to say that he has no hesitation in confirming your understanding that nothing more is to be read into his letter published in the `Morning Post' on the 15th <Col N="1152" /> instant than what that letter actually contains.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;Mise le meas,</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;P. BANIM.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; report is headed by a passage intended to allay anxiety and to re-assure those who are suffering from the existing uneasiness. In the spirit of the genuine optimist, the sentence is composed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;President Cosgrave makes it clear that unwarranted inferences have been drawn from his letter to the `Morning Post.&rdquo;'</P>
    <P>He makes it clear.  How, I wonder? What has he said?  The Secretary of the Irish Industries Federation, in a way that is childlike and bland, invites the President to say that nothing more should be read into his letter than it actually contained, and the President's reply is: &ldquo;You are quite right.  Do not read anything into my letter more than my letter contains.&rdquo; And that is declared to make it clear that certain revelations made by the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; in consequence of the President's letter are unwarranted.  It will be noted that what Irish Industries, Incorporated, referred to was &ldquo;that the inferences drawn by the `Morning Post' from your letter and interviews should indicate the intentions of the Government.&rdquo;  So that though we are warned not to read any more into the letter than the letter contains, nothing whatever is said with regard to the interviews, or the interpretation of the inferences that might reasonably be drawn from these.  That, to say the least of it, is not quite candid.  Remember that Burke on one occasion spoke of a man as &ldquo;determined to die in the last dyke of prevarication.&rdquo; The President is determined to die in the last dyke of evasion.</P>
    <P>What does the letter actually contain? No more than what is to be read into it.  How much is to be read out of it, if nothing is to be read into it?  I will read this egregious letter, a most extraordinary communication from a leading man in Irish political affairs, the President of the Executive Council, to an English newspaper whose reputation is known to every <Col N="1153" /> Deputy as the most vindictive opponent of all that this House, by its very existence, stands for and is symbolical of. Its opposition to Irish liberty was, and is, always characterised by malignity. It loaded with vituperation even the English statesmen of its own party who took the nobler course and determined to end the war with this country.  Even now, after the President has written this letter to it, having first betrayed him by giving a full and detailed account of all its transactions with him, it proceeds to exercise its malevolence in a later issue of the same week.</P>
    <P>To the Editor of the &ldquo;Morning Post.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;May I express my appreciation of the efforts made by the `Morning Post' to facilitate a more comprehensive agreement between this Government and those of Belfast and Westminster.  The work of your special correspondent in endeavouring to smooth away difficulties which still remain after the London Conference of December last has been of great advantage. But we value it all the more because it is a tangible evidence of English good-will towards us in this time when we are striving to promote the interests of our own people in conjunction with those of Northern Ireland and England.</P>
    <P>The sympathy and practical assistance of the `Morning Post' has, believe me, encouraged us in our efforts to reconcile the interests of the parties concerned.&mdash;Yours, etc.,</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;Liam T. MacCosgair,</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;President.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure, with regard to the last paragraph, as to the exact reference in the word &ldquo;us.&rdquo;  Is this the Royal &ldquo;we&rdquo; into which the President has slipped inadvertently, assuming the Royal Prerogative, because he is acting royally, committing his country without its prior knowledge and consent, or does &ldquo;us&rdquo; mean his colleagues in the Executive Council who, according to the Constitution, have joint responsibility with him?  At any rate, there is the letter, a letter expressing appreciation of efforts made to facilitate a more comprehensive <Col N="1154" /> agreement.  Naturally the national reader asks: &ldquo;A more comprehensive agreement than what?&rdquo;  Of course, the President will tell you what he meant, because I presume he knows what he meant.  The &ldquo;Morning Post,&rdquo; however, has told us in regard to what it understood it was receiving this compliment.  But, after all, I think it is a reasonable proposition that if two men conspire to promote the same end and one of them is silent as to what his purpose and his method have been and the other is willing to reveal it, after receiving compliments in public as regards his conduct in the affair, one may very well accept the account that he gives by way of revelation.</P>
    <P>Before I read the explanation which the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; is good enough to give us, I might stop to express my wonder why the President committed himself to the writing of such a letter to the editor of such a paper particularly.</P>
    <P>I happen to know that Mr. Joseph Devlin and Sir James Craig were asked by the same authority to give a letter of similar tenor, using the President's as a model, but they were too old birds to be caught with chaff, and were too wily and too wise in political matters to succumb to the blandishments of the &ldquo;Morning Post.&rdquo;  And only the President of the Dáil is left here in the pillory.  The President writes this letter.  What is it in effect?  At least 99 per cent. of the public believe that the account given by the special agent of the &ldquo;Morning Post,&rdquo; no matter how much the President may choose to deny his revelations, may be accepted as an accurate history.  That letter is nothing but a certificate to the special correspondent of the &ldquo;Morning Post.&rdquo;  Why did the President give this certificate, and why did he repent so soon after having given it?  Why was he conscious&mdash;conscious after this fevered waking up, as the poet says, always a day too late&mdash;when he came to reply to an Irish body, the Federation of Irish Industries, that this was a case that called for an evasive answer?  Why not have had the wisdom to provoke no necessity to have queries put that required evasive <Col N="1155" /> answers?  Was this a smoke-screen that the President was trying to spread to hide from the public how long ago these negotiations began and that they were a natural sequel and, indeed, a continuation of the infamous London Pact?  Was that the purpose of the letter, or was he subjected to some pressure which he could not or dare not resist?  Perhaps he will tell us which of these is the explanation.</P>
    <P>We have the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; account of the transaction, first from the special correspondent, and secondly from the Editor.  I marvel no less at the ability of the President to remain silent if he has read, as he must have read, the leading article of this paper&mdash;it appears in the issue in which his letter appears&mdash;than I marvel at his having written the letter at all.  It is too long to read the whole of this, and I would ask you, Sir, to believe that when I read extracts that they are not garbled.  In any case, if by inadvertence full justice is not done in the reading because it is a curtailed extract that I give, there will be ample room for it to be corrected and replied to.  I shall do my best to make the extracts fairly represent the tenor of the document.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the weaknesses of the Free State position,&rdquo; it is explained here, &ldquo;was that there was no platform whence Ministers&rdquo;&mdash;that means Irish Ministers&mdash;&ldquo;could speak to the British electorate.&rdquo;  That is following the position which had been created in December last.  &ldquo;The `Morning Post' at once adjusted that difficulty.&rdquo;  It provided a platform from which the Irish Ministers could do what was so necessary: address the British public. To get right with the British public was much more important of course than to get right with the Irish public &ldquo;The `Morning Post' at once adjusted that difficulty.  Statements explaining the official attitude of the Free State were published in these columns from the President of the Executive Council.  Mr. Cosgrave: the Vice-President. Mr. Kevin O'Higgins, and the Minister for External Affairs.  Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald.  At the same time the Free State Ministers appreciated <Col N="1156" /> the editorial attitude of the `Morning Post'&mdash;an attitude of frank recognition of all the difficulties involved and insistence on the fact that any settlement to be mutually advantageous and permanently satisfactory must be based on economic considerations rather than on mere political protestations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You will see later, from the leading article of the paper, how we poor fools, who believed in national ideals and who valued liberty before material considerations, are lectured and shown that after all these are vain things as compared with having a good market for your produce and a good financial credit to back you in your transactions. The flesh-pots of Egypt policy is now recommended insolently.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But when Mr. Baldwin met Sir James Craig and Mr. Cosgrave in conference in London early in December it was not possible to embrace in the settlement an agreement on all the points at issue between the North and South.&rdquo;  No, it was not, nor were all the terms of the settlement put into the document that purported to give the settlement.  It may be remembered that on the occasion of the debate on the great betrayal I asked the question: Are there any secret arrangements which will be divulged later on in instalments?  &ldquo;It was not possible to embrace in the settlement an agreement on all the points at issue between the North and South.  Primarily there were two questions which could be settled only later in a less tense atmosphere&mdash;(1) the <i>rapprochement</i> between the Ulster Government and the Northern Nationalists; and (2) the readjustment of the tariff arrangements between England, the Free State and the North.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These, I remark again in passing, are referred to in the leading article as the &ldquo;three countries.&rdquo;  Already the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; gloried in the fact that the ceded Six Counties will never again belong to Ireland.  Ireland is only a geographical expression, not a political expression, according to the doctrines of this paper which is thanked for its service to Ireland. &ldquo;Until the Nationalist communities just on the Northern side of the <Col N="1157" /> boundary had accepted the fact that, willy-nilly, they were now citizens of Ulster, with privileges and possibilities as such, it was practically impossible for Sir James Craig and Mr. Cosgrave to proceed further on the lines of the agreement initiated at the London conference.&rdquo;  It was not possible &ldquo;to proceed further on the lines of the agreement initiated at the London conference&rdquo; until the Ulster representatives had been pressed and bamboozled into going into the Belfast Parliament. It is explained here that Sir James Craig in the Reform Club and President Cosgrave in the Dáil both carried out their part of the compact by calling on the Ulster members to go into the Belfast Parliament.  I remember with what horror and indignation I heard the President's words here when he practically told my people, the Ulster people, to make the best of the situation: Now go into the Ulster Parliament and fight for yourselves&mdash;these people who have been supported by Secret Service money from the South to enable them to prolong their opposition to that very policy.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was at this stage,&rdquo; explains Mr. Bradstreet, the representative of the &ldquo;Morning Post,&rdquo;&ldquo;that an honest broker could usefully intervene.&rdquo;  Anyone familiar with the English language of, say, the comic dramatists of the Restoration period will have his memory awakened by the term &ldquo;honest broker,&rdquo; and will think of a coarser and cruder term.  &ldquo;Manifestly it is impossible yet to publish complete details.&rdquo; I take it that the President will publish more complete details. &ldquo;But it is permissible to say that the three Governments were ready to cap the London Agreement with an economic Treaty.&rdquo;  Now, sir, that is what I have invited the Dáil to express its alarm and disapproval of&mdash;the revelation of negotiations directed to cap the London Agreement with an economic Treaty.  I know the President will adopt his usual tactics, a lot of bluster and personal abuse, and that we shall have violent tirades against the Irregulars who weakened the Irish position so much that it was impossible for Irish Ministers to stand up against British Ministers any longer.  &ldquo;But it <Col N="1158" /> is permissible to say that the three Governments were ready to cap the London Agreement with an economic Treaty.&rdquo;  Has that ever been contradicted on our behalf by the chief of the Irish Government?  That, sir, by a sinister coincidence, is in the line immediately above the &ldquo;frame&rdquo; in which the President's letter of appreciation is inserted.  You may say it is dastardly on the part of this paper, but there is the fact that the statement was made that &ldquo;it is permissible to say that the three Governments were ready to cap the London Agreement with an economic Treaty,&rdquo; and that has not been contradicted.  I give the President the opportunity now to contradict it in this House and let it go to the Irish people that this is a malignant slander upon the President.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the President, if he proceeds to make these denials, will have to reckon with an Irish paper. Therefore, I am not leading him into any trap in asking him to contradict that without begging his advertence to another revelation.  The &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; sent its Political Correspondent&mdash;at any rate he went&mdash;to interview the Executive Council.  Very naturally the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; was alarmed.  Again, I am not the only person whose nerves were so jumpy and irregular as to be affected by a revelation of this magnitude.  Here is what the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; said in a leading article, following upon which its able Political Correspondent interviewed, or professes to have interviewed, members of the Government:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In recent years the Nationalists of Ireland have had no more bitter enemy in the ranks of the British Press than the `Morning Post.' When the Free State was fighting for its existence, that journal heaped abuse and vituperation upon the Government.  It comes, therefore, as a surprise to us to learn from yesterday's issue that the `Morning Post' and Mr. Cosgrave have been exchanging bouquets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I prefer to be the recipient of the President's bouquet than the recipient of the bouquet of the &ldquo;Morning Post,&rdquo; and I think you, a Chinn Chomhairle, and the House, will agree with me <Col N="1159" /> when I have given the details of the various flowers and perfumes that constitute it.  Here is what the Political Correspondent has to say.  He evidently saw the Minister for Finance.  I have always lauded the Minister for Finance for his truthfulness, and so long as he and I&mdash;may it be long!&mdash;are in this House, I shall continue to do so &mdash;that is, as long as he makes it possible:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The modification of the tariff barrier referred to by the `Morning Post,' I can state on Ministerial authority, refers to a possible reciprocal arrangement between this country and Great Britain and Northern Ireland relating to the exportation of motor cars and parts, and nothing else.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unless that is true and absolutely true, it is audacious in the last degree.  I have no hesitation in accepting it as true.  The correspondent makes the statement &ldquo;on Ministerial authority.&rdquo; At any rate, the statement has never been challenged by any Minister.  No letter, beginning &ldquo;A chara&rdquo; and ending &ldquo;Mise, le meas,&rdquo; has been written to say that there is no warrant or justification for the claim that the Political Correspondent of the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; has Ministerial authority for what he says.  He is as childlike and bland in his own way as the Secretary of the Federation of Irish Industries, because he says the modification of the tariff barrier &ldquo;refers to a possible reciprocal arrangement regarding the exportation and importation of motor cars and parts, and&mdash;<i>nothing else.</i>&rdquo;&ldquo;Nothing else&rdquo;!  When I read that. I recalled one of the farcical scenes in the &ldquo;Belle of New York,&rdquo; where a choleric and duel-fighting count goes round looking for the man who has provoked him, and to each man whom he inquiries from, he remarks, &ldquo;I merely wanted to kill him; <i>that is all.</i>&rdquo; There is exactly the same line of thought here.  It deals only with &ldquo;the exportation and importation of motor cars and parts&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;and nothing else!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It does not involve in any way the abolition of the Customs barrier between ourselves and the Six-County area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> The writer having noticed that this is somewhat inconsistent with his previous statement, hastens to add:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As that instrument is now generally understood.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is merely proposed to take down the barrier to such and such an extent, but it must not be regarded as an interference with the Customs barrier. Not at all!</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The position in this respect remains the same as when Mr. Blythe answered Mr. Sears on the subject on the 5th instant in the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Remark that my friend Deputy Sears also had some anxiety and uneasiness in these matters.  He asked the Minister for Finance about them, and the Minister for Finance told him the absolute truth&mdash;as the Minister for Finance understood the truth and within the measure of his information at the time.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister then said it was not the intention of the Government in any way to meet the wishes of those who called for the abolition of the Customs barrier.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But that was the 5th.  This issue of the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; is dated February 15th.  Although there is the fiction of collective responsibility in the Executive Council, I am prepared to believe that the Minister for Finance knew nothing at all about those interesting developments on February 5th.  In any case, whether he did or not, the answer he gave Deputy Sears is, so far as it goes, an absolutely truthful reply.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was, he said, obvious that no negotiations for the abolition of the Customs barrier could take place while the Northern Government had its present status.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, no negotiations that would be fruitful, that would issue in any binding results, need be carried out with a subordinate Parliament when manifestly it was with the Imperial Parliament they were to be carried out, and&mdash;as the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; revealed&mdash;they <i>were</i> carried out.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Accordingly the statement that such negotiations were taking place was entirely without foundation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> Had I made that statement, sir, we would have heard a great deal about metaphysics.</P>
    <P>Certain exchanges of views, however, appear to have taken place in connection with the motor duties question.</P>
    <P>There were no &ldquo;negotiations.&rdquo;  There were &ldquo;exchanges of views.&rdquo;  When do &ldquo;exchanges of views&rdquo; become &ldquo;negotiations&rdquo;?  And when are &ldquo;negotiations&rdquo; only &ldquo;exchanges of views&rdquo;?  It is very much like the question: &ldquo;At what hour of what night does a pup become a dog?  When precisely does a kid become a goat?&rdquo;  The distinction is very fine.  That is the <i>distinctio formalis cum fundamento in re</i>.  There were no &ldquo;negotiations.&rdquo; There were &ldquo;certain exchanges of views&rdquo; in connection with the motor duties question.</P>
    <P>A scheme has, however, taken shape, and, if accepted <i>in principle,</i> only requires to be worked out by experts of both Governments to see exactly how both sides will be affected.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If accepted <i>in principle</i>.&rdquo;  Whether that came from the Ministerial mind or whether it is a gratuitous addition on the part of the Political Correspondent, I am unable to decide.  However, you will see presently that the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; has something to say about that, too.  It would appear that items of the coming Budget manage to leak out, for we have a cross-caption in very big type, &ldquo;Luxury Taxes.&rdquo;  Here is a sop for the Minister for Finance, even if the President has been fooling&mdash;if I may use the word&mdash;or playing with concessions on tariff points.  &ldquo;What you lose in one matter, you can make up in another.  Take off the duties on incoming British cars and charge a luxury tax upon the cars that are in the Twenty-six Counties.&rdquo;  That is as much as to say, &ldquo;We will make the Irish pay.&rdquo;  I pointed out before that, so long as the duties are on the British cars, in the case of many of the bigger firms, a considerable proportion of the tax is allowed to the local agent here to enable him to face the competition of cheaper cars.  Therefore, a luxury tax if imposed will increase our taxation <Col N="1162" /> at home.  The &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; proceeds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>There is, I understand, a very good reason for stating that a motor car, if the import duty were removed, would be regarded as a luxury and would have imposed on it an annual tax of perhaps £3 or £5...  There are important forces outside the councils of the Government which hold that, as the Saorstát and Great Britain are so closely economically knit, they should work as closely together in economic affairs as the position of both can allow.</P>
    <P>That is an echo from the leading article of the &ldquo;Morning Post.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For this reason, it is urged a `most-favoured-nation' policy should exist between the two countries, which, it is held, would have considerable advantage for both.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a striking conclusion to arrive at.  That is the policy advocated in this English paper.  It is the policy of Mr. Amery, the Secretary for the Dominions.  I wonder is there any significance in the fact that, before the infamous London Pact was entered into, our President had the advantage of cruising in the yacht of Lord Beaverbrook, the chosen agent of Mr. Amery, for propagating his imperial-preference ideas.  Mr. Amery and Lord Beaverbrook happen to be from Canada&mdash;companions in arms, political. Most of us are aware of the campaign inaugurated by Mr. Amery and propagated on his behalf by Lord Beaverbrook.  And the settled policy of the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; has been to promote that fiscal policy throughout the Commonwealth of Nations, into which the Twenty-six County State has entered.  The President has commended the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; representative for facilitating a more comprehensive agreement.  The &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; representative says that that &ldquo;more comprehensive agreement&rdquo; was one more comprehensive than the agreement entered into and known as &ldquo;The London Agreement&rdquo; or &ldquo;The London Pact.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that on the adjournment I would call attention to the procedure of the Land Commission in fixing the &ldquo;Appointed Day&rdquo; in connection with estates that they proposed to acquire compulsorily. I did so with reluctance, because I do not want to weary the Dáil, but I did so because of the urgency of the matter. In one particular case, brought to my notice, a constituent of my own is the owner of certain lands in the County of Meath at Rathregan.  He is both a stockbreeder and a salesmaster, and he uses this land, which is within walking distance of Dublin cattle markets, for the purposes of his business. The Land Commission, some nine or ten months ago, served notice on him that they intended to acquire that land compulsorily.  He took steps, and I believe he took them with legal advice, to object to that procedure.  His objection was taken before the Land Commission, and met with a simple negative.  No reason was given&mdash;simply a negative.  He then appealed to Mr. Justice Wylie on the question of value, and succeeded in getting the amount somewhat increased.  He then put up two propositions to the Commissioners. He offered them other land rather more remote from Dublin, but I believe equal in regard to tillage, and more conveniently situated as regards access by road, and approximately of equal area. After that offer was refused, he asked that he might be allowed to surrender two-thirds of the 500 acres in this particular place and to retain one-third for the purposes of his business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not speaking of my own knowledge in regard to this land, but, I believe, Deputy Leonard, a much greater authority on the value of land and cattle, will bear me out when I say that these were reasonable offers.  They were simply dismissed.  No argument was advanced.  My constituent was simply told: &ldquo;We are going to take the land: <Col N="1164" /> we accept none of your alternative offers.&rdquo;  He tried, the, to reason with the Minister.  The real trouble in this particular case is that my constituent came to me too late; he went to Deputy Leonard first.  If he had come to me I would have told him the Minister was not amenable to argument, and that the last thing to do was to write the Minister a four-page letter arguing with him on a question of justice.  He did write to the Minister, and he has not had any reply, at least not up to 12 o'clock to-day.  All he got, after these offers and these attempts to meet the Minister and to meet the policy of the Land Act in trying to provide land for the relief of congestion, was that on Monday, of this week, his solicitor received a notice that the &ldquo;Appointed Day&rdquo; was Friday, that is to-morrow.</P>
    <P>I do suggest to the Minister and to the Dáil that a longer notice than that ought to have been given.  From the farming point of view and from every point of view there should be more than a week's notice.  It should be possible to give at least a month's notice. In this case my constituent has stock upon the land.  He has pedigree brood-mares that have been to expensive sires and that are about to foal.  He has ewes that are about to lamb.  Even if you could find other accommodation for these beasts it is not a very easy or safe matter to move them without four or five days' notice.  The Minister may say his Department has been reproached with administering the Land Act too slowly.  That may be so.  He may say that the policy of his Department, on the whole, is too conservative, and it is criticised for that.  That may be so, but it really amounts to saying that, as it was too conservative in the past it is now going in another direction&mdash;in other words, that the dog may be allowed his first bite.  That may be agreeable for the dog.</P>

      <P>If the Minister will tell us that it is not the intention of the Land Commission to enter in on the Appointed Day that would remove many of my objections.  One reason I brought this forward was to try to get an assurance from the Minister that he would postpone the Appointed Day and would give a guarantee that my constituent would not be dispossessed. When addressing the Minister I always feel as if I was addressing the opposing counsel, and I hope he will not dispossess my constituent without reasonable notice.  If he gives that undertaking he will go far to meet my case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEONARD</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Cooper.  This is one of the few things I know something about. If the Minister says it is not his intention to have the lands cleared for some time I, on behalf of the tenant, Mr. Wallis, would be quite satisfied with his assurance.  I have been over these lands.  In Rathregan, Co. Meath, there are 516 acres, and the price is £18,900, that is £36 10s. 6d. per acre.  The poor law valuation is £1 3s. per acre.  Mr. Wallis has offered to give to the Land Commission or the Estates Commissioners, the land at Drumlargan, which is almost as good as the land at Rathregan and contains 201 acres; and the land at Newtown which contains 264 acres.  The price of these two farms would be £15,000, which works out at less than £32 10s. per acre.  The Minister, or the Estates Commissioners, might say &ldquo;This is inferior land you are offering.&rdquo;  If you take the poor law valuation as more or less reliable the difference between the valuation of these three properties is less than 2/6 per acre.  I think Mr. Wallis is entitled to get from the Minister, or the Estates Commissioners, the reason why they have turned down his offer.  It looks badly that a man who is doing a big business in Dublin and who is a Protestant, and a member of the old English school, should be apparently penalised by us.  Unless the reasons are very grave I do not see why the Minister should not ask the Estates Commissioners to accept Mr. Wallis's offer of these two farms, which have nearly the same area as the one they selected.  If they say they cannot do without Rathregan <Col N="1166" /> they should at least allow him to retain the 120 acres he has asked for, or to re-purchase so that he could continue to rear his valuable brood stock there. I have a list of the horses he has bred.</P>

      <P>There are no uneconomic holders waiting for this land. The Minister and the Estates Commissioners have a certain amount of sense, and they know that land like this is not suitable for division into small holdings.  The proof is that on the outside of the ditch there are 400 acres that were bought some years ago, and they have been only lately divided, but the people who got the land are not working it because it is too good.  On the other side of the ditch, to the north west, there are another 400 acres, bought for the last three years, and not a single dividing fence has been put up. A client of mine has 200 or 300 acres taken over for grazing.</P>

      <P>I am sorry we have not the time to discuss this interesting case, for if we had we could probably discuss the general land purchase problem specifically.  Deputy Cooper says he always speaks as far as I am concerned as the opposing counsel.  I will try to <Col N="1167" /> be judicial on this occasion.  It would be a very serious thing to interfere with property worth £18,000 or £20,000 in a lighthearted way.  Issues have been raised that mean more financially than any five or six cases that might come before the Supreme Court.  That shows the position the Estates Commissioners are in.  They have to hear cases every day in connection with property, the value of which I would say would be at least ten times as great as the value of the property at issue before any tribunal in the land, not excepting the Supreme Court.  In this case we have got some of the facts, but there are other facts which should be stated in order to give a true picture of the position, and it is necessary also to make some corrections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These lands of Rathregan, as Deputy Leonard said, are amongst the best in Meath.  The Land Commission expressed to the owner their intention of acquiring these lands, and negotiations and proceedings are now going on for 17 months.  They commenced by notice to the owner that the lands were to be inspected.  He objected to the inspection. That objection was considered and overruled.  The lands were inspected finally in June, 1925.  That was nearly nine months after the negotiations commenced.  The intervening period between September and June, 1925, was taken up with negotiations as to whether the lands should be inspected, and also in connection with the price.  In June, 1925, an offer was made.  Before that, in May, when the Land Commission heard of the objection against acquisition or inspection, they published the usual provisional list, which is in common form, the effect of which is simply to give notice to everyone concerned that the Land Commission proposed to acquire certain lands and that any person who had any objection, including the owner, should lodge notice of the objection within the specified period, usually two months.  That notice was published in June, 1925, almost nine months after the negotiations started. Immediately afterwards an offer of £18,000 was made.  The owner objected, as he was entitled to do.  He <Col N="1168" /> objected first to acquisition and secondly to the price.  As has always been the case, it was agreed that in this case the objection to the price should be deferred until the objection to acquisition was heard.  The question of acquisition was tried before the Commissioners of the Court.  Counsel appeared on each side and argued at great length.  Having heard the whole case and the alternative, which Deputy Cooper and Deputy Leonard mentioned, the Commissioners decided that they would continue to acquire the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">

      <P>Did they follow the usual practice and give reasons for their decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. The usual practice is to give a decision. I think one of the greatest judges has stated that he was bound to be right in his decision, but bound to be wrong in reasons he gave for that decision. That does not arise now.  The reasons for acquisition are obvious.  That was overruled on the 20th October.  Remember that publication of the intention to acquire took place in June, and that the case did not come on for trial until October.  I may say there was no objection until after the time was fixed.  It was extended at Mr. Wallis's request, and in order to enable him to make objection.  In this case every device was used&mdash;legitimately used, as the owner was perfectly entitled to take advantage of the law&mdash;to delay the proceedings as much as possible. Not only that, but the Land Commission to a certain extent met the owner's convenience by extending the time for objection.  Notwithstanding the fact that the provisional list was published in June, the objection was not heard until October, counsel appearing on both sides, and the objection was overruled.  Mr. Wallis could have appealed to the Judicial Commissioner from the Commissioners but he did not do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating the law. He could have appealed if he wished. He did not do so.  In any event, accepting acquisition, that meant, simply, that on the 20th October he had definite notice and had accepted the position that these lands were to be acquired, and that there was only one point outstanding and that was with regard to the price.  That objection was listed for hearing on the 8th December. Immediately after the decision, which was given on his objection to acquisition, the objection to price was listed.  Mr. Wallis came in and asked that there should be an adjournment. He gave rather casual reasons for the adjournment, but the Commissioners met him again.  They were extremely anxious to get this land by the spring.  The objection was not heard, in fact, until the 20th of January, and on the 16th February they ruled.  That finished the negotiations which began the previous September twelve months.  He had ample notice since the 20th October, when the objection to acquisition had been ruled on, after long delays, that the lands were to be immediately acquired and the only objection outstanding&mdash;as to price&mdash;was ruled out.  That procedure was common form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The date of vesting is never published in the provisional list for the simple reason that it is not known.  It depends on how long the objection takes.  The common form in the Land Commission, so far as the provisional list is concerned, is to fix a time for the objection, and if they see a good reason they can extend it.  They then publish the &ldquo;Appointed Day&rdquo; immediately after the last objection has been disposed of.  The first objection always disposed of is the objection to acquisition. Once that is decided the case is closed so far as acquisition is concerned. It is an accepted fact that the Commissioners can obtain the land.  That was decided in this case on the 20th October <Col N="1170" /> and they are taking the land on the 20th of February as per usual procedure. It is wrong to give the impression that this action was suddenly taken. This was land that was to be taken. The acquisition had been decided upon, rightly or wrongly, on the 20th October.  There was no question outstanding but one, and no other objection could be made.  In fact, the time had been extended to enable him to make objections.  The only one question to be decided is the question of price.  He knew, and everyone knew, and it was their business to know, that the lands would vest immediately the objection was decided.</P>
    <P>That is so much for the procedure. Now with regard to the merits.  Deputy Cooper describes Mr. Wallis as a stock-breeder and a salesmaster who uses his land for the purposes of his business and Deputy Leonard mentioned that this was a high-class farm on which high-class stock animals had been bred and so forth and generally gave us the impression that this was a high-class farm used as a high-class farm should be used and here is the Land Commission butting in and destroying the man's business.  The facts are that Mr. Wallis has 1,222 acres of land.  We are leaving him 707 acres.  Of his total land he has set 717 acres and he is farming 505. Of that 717 he has set 309 belonging to Rathregan, and he is farming 206.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that racehorses, including some classic winners, were bred on that farm, but the present position is that Mr. Wallis owns the land.  Two-thirds of it is set at the moment and was set last year.  We propose to leave him 717 acres, which is 200 acres more than he is actually farming at present.  Why did the Land Commission take this and what were their reasons?  First, the remainder of his land is either purchased or tenanted land and it is much more difficult to buy purchased or tenanted land than to buy fee simple.  It costs more.  That is the reason.  I explained often the difficulties about buying tenanted land and also the difficulties about buying purchased land.  He is getting £18,900 for it, which is a moderate price enough for <Col N="1171" /> one of the best farms in Meath.  It is moderate even from the Land Commission's point of view.  What is it going to work out per acre?  It is going to work out at about thirty-two shillings a statute acre.  It is well worth it, but when tenant purchasers get into it it will be let from £5 to £7 per acre and they will think that rent is extraordinarily high.  Yet could you in fairness and in all the circumstances, give that man less?</P>
    <P>I am now arguing the other side of the case, but the complexities of land purchase are many.  It is all very well to generalise, but when you come down to particulars it is very difficult.  You have these legitimate claims on the one side and the legitimate claims of the people going into it on the other.  We took this land because other land was not suitable.  This land is, of course, far more suitable, because it is fee-simple land.  I may say there is another reason for urgency, and that is, that this land will not be divided, as Deputy Leonard said, into small holdings. People will be taken up from congested counties who had big farms of purchased land.  That is the way this farm will be used.  In fact, the position of the Land Commission, at the moment, is that they have acquired, compulsorily, land in Mayo and the congested districts for the purpose of dividing it among the congests, and they cannot get the congests in.  They have made agreements with people, a year ago, having taken all their land down there, that they will be able to find them other farms.  That promise is maturing now.  It is necessary there should be some finality.  I am asked for an undertaking that we will not disturb Mr. Wallis's stock.  If this man has ewes and lambs on that farm, he knew on the 20th September that the farm would be taken.</P>

      <P>Yes; he did not know the exact day, but he knew it would be taken after the price objection had been ruled out.  It would have been taken months ago except that on his own request the matter was adjourned over Christmas.  After all, he knew that the ewes and lambs were there.  I am surprised to know that there were valuable brood mares there.  So far as the Land Commission are concerned, they treated Mr. Wallis well as far as time was concerned.  They have given him all the leniency he wanted.  Even at the last moment, if he wants a certain amount of opportunity to dispose of his stock, provided there is a definite time-limit, there certainly will be allowed the ordinary short time that a man would be allowed to make the minor adjustments he would make. However, they must have the land this spring to dispose of it to people in order to get other people from the west into it.  I do not want to give any undertaking as to how long we will give Mr. Wallis.  He lengthened the thing out as long as he could, but that will not prejudice our view and he will be treated fairly by the Land Commission. If there are minor arrangements they will be made, but the Land Commission will not be put off by being told there are valuable ewes and lambs there, especially owing to the fact that three-quarters of the farm is set and that he has 1,222 acres.  He will have 717 acres left.  He has not been extra reasonable with us, but that has not prejudiced the position.  This case has been examined carefully.  He has not been treated unreasonably and he is not going to be treated unreasonably, but that does not mean that he is going to get away by saying that he has brood mares on the land.</P>
