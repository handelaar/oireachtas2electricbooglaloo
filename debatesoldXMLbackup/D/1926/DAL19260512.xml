      <P>asked the President whether he is aware that Samuel Maguire, a civil servant with twenty-six years' service, was dismissed on 30th December, 1924, at a moment's notice; that he has never been informed of the charges on which the dismissal order was based; that he has volunteered to submit himself to any investigation into his conduct and the manner in which he carried out his duties, and whether the case will be re-opened with a view to giving Mr. Maguire an opportunity of refuting any charges that may have been made against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Maguire was dismissed, with others, by order of the Executive Council, dated 29th December, 1924, because the Council had reason to believe that he was in close and active association with efforts which were at the time being made to suborn from their allegiance members of the Army and other State services with a view to renewing the attempt to subject the Government to pressure of an unconstitutional nature.  It is not proposed to re-open the cases of persons dismissed on that occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read it out again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. MURPHY Mr. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not necessary. I take it that his reply was that this man was dismissed in connection with the Army mutiny?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. MURPHY Mr. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the President <Col N="1382" /> say how that could be, when the Army mutiny took place in March, 1924, and he was not dismissed until the following December?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not in connection with the incidents of March, 1924.  It was understood generally, I think, that the incidents in connection with the episode of March, 1924, had then ceased.  From information which was available to the Executive Council on 29th December, 1924, it appeared that these activities had not ceased, and, in consequence, this action was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this man is anxious that an inquiry should be held, does the President not think the request that he should have a fair trial is a reasonable one in view of the fact that it only &ldquo;appeared&rdquo; to the Executive Council that he was engaged in this conspiracy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I might have amplified that answer by saying that it had appeared to the satisfaction of the Executive Council, and that this incident occurred long after the other matter referred to by Deputy Murphy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. MURPHY Mr. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the President aware that this man controverts the whole of the charges that were made against him, that he denies absolutely having done anything that was not in accordance with his duty as a public servant and as a citizen of the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the Executive Council was in possession of all the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. MURPHY Mr. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the Executive Council will not give him an opportunity of seeing the charges made against him or an opportunity of refuting them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is really involved in the last part of the answer that I gave: &ldquo;It is not proposed to re-open the cases of persons dismissed on that occasion.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. MURPHY Mr. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the President aware that in a case where a man was dismissed from the public service when the British Government were in control <Col N="1383" /> here the practice was always to supply him with a copy of the evidence against him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that I am aware of that, but I do know that on this occasion an opportunity was afforded to some officers who were in the Army in October, 1924, of submitting reasons why they should not be dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. MURPHY Mr. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the President is aware of the fact that if Mr. Maguire had been in the service of the State before the Treaty his dismissal could not have taken place except under Article X. of the Treaty.  In view of the fact that he was recalled to this country at the request of the late General Collins, which I understand was the position, does it not seem very hard that he should be dismissed in this very arbitrary fashion?  I may say that I would not defend the attitude of any man who would be found guilty of the charges that the President has mentioned, but I am interested in this because this man absolutely denies the whole charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just one or two points that I might mention in connection with this matter: I do not know whether this is strictly in answer to what the Deputy has said. The Executive Council had no reason to be dissatisfied with this officer's service in respect of anything except what I have mentioned.  It has come to my notice that some story has been circulated that other charges than that I have mentioned had been made against him.  There was no other charge.  As far as his conduct was concerned it was above reproach and he was an excellent officer except with regard to the matter of these unfortunate incidents that occurred in connection with certain demobilised officers and other officers in 1924.  I think it is due to Mr. Maguire to state that.  As regards the question put by the Deputy regarding Article X. Article X. does not enshrine officials covered by it with special protection against dismissal on a charge such as this.  If he were an officer who had all the advantages of Article X. it <Col N="1384" /> would nevertheless have been open to the Executive Council to take the action that they did take in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. MURPHY Mr. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the President consider that if a time comes when the Government is changed and a new Party takes possession of the reins of Government, it would be open to them to dismiss civil servants who would differ from them politically in the same fashion?  I suggest to the President that it opens up very dangerous possibilities in regard to the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that very few civil servants have been dismissed by the Executive Council, and certainly in no case where a dismissal has taken place has that course been adopted without the Executive Council having been perfectly satisfied that they would be remiss in their duty if they did not act in the fashion I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPrior" hpid="Mr. PRIOR Mr. PRIOR">
      <NameTxt>Mr. PRIOR</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interests of the civil servants of to-day, when another Government comes into power will it not have a precedent set by this for removing civil servants, for political activities or otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make this point perfectly clear, that the Executive Council in this matter did not concern itself with this question of political motives, that it was a question of subordinating the State. No matter what party is in power it must exercise its judgment in relation to these things, and I might say that if there was one duty more painful than another that the Executive Council had to perform, it was the action that they took in this case.  I think that in no circumstances could a man have had a fairer court to try the case or one more anxious to take into consideration the services that the Deputy has mentioned, or the fact that the late General Collins brought this man into the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER (for Mr. A. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that street taxis that have carriage fares fixed by the Dublin Police Authorities and sanctioned by His Honour Judge Dromgoole when considering the alterations to Hackney Car Regulations in 1924, will be at a serious disadvantage if the recent proposals to increase the motor-tax are applied to street taxis, which are at present on a taxi flat rate of £12 per annum, and, if, in view of the fact that they are controlled by special Police Regulations, he will see that street taxi owners on this agreed £12 rate will not be included in the proposals to increase motor taxation by horse-power rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN (replying)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that the street taxis referred to by the Deputy will be at a serious disadvantage as the result of the new proposals respecting motor taxation, inasmuch as it will be found that some of the taxi-owners will be taxed at £11 instead of the £12 formerly paid, and so far as particulars can at the moment be ascertained, the general run will be about £14 to £16. The maximum tax is £20, but it is considered that the higher rates will apply rather to the country than to the city, as, speaking generally, taxis employed in the city are of a smaller horse-power than hackney cars plying for hire in country towns.  I do not accordingly propose to make any alteration in the proposals respecting motor taxation such as is suggested by the Deputy in the second part of his question.</P>

      <P>The facts are as stated.  Orders have been made under the Petty Sessions Clerks (Ireland) Act, 1881, diverting into the District Court Clerks Fund all the proceeds of sale of dog licences up to the end of 1924, save such amounts as have already been distributed to local authorities; the 1925 collection&mdash;the final collection under the old law&mdash;will be similarly diverted.  The Acts under which the dog duty was formerly collected and distributed were repealed by the Finance Act, 1925&mdash;the repeal to date from 1st January, 1926.  The dog duty is now an Excise Duty, payable into the Exchequer; no part of it can be paid to any local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move for leave to introduce a Bill entitled &ldquo;An Act to confer on the Executive Council special powers for the protection of the community and ensuring the due supply and distribution of the essentials of life during national emergencies.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear from information which I have received this afternoon that the necessity for this measure is not so marked, but from information which is at our disposal in connection with supplies in some parts of the country, such powers as indicated may be immediately necessary.  Perhaps you will pardon me, sir, if I make something in the nature of a Second Reading speech at this stage, in view of the special circumstances of the case.  I would like to say that this measure is one which has its essence in its Title. There is a shortage in, at least, three places at present in the country.  The shortage in at least one of these cases has.  I think, been brought about by an idea that got abroad that it was necessary to get in stocks, and, as a consequence, stocks of certain essential commodities have been reduced.  It will be seen that merchants in those cases are <Col N="1390" /> placed in a position of much difficulty. A regular customer of one of these firms comes along and asks for a certain type of goods.  If the merchant demurs, he will be informed that no subsequent business will be transacted with him, that a change will take place, and that another merchant will be approached and that business will be lost. That is a case that has been put to us by one prominent merchant.</P>
    <P>It is in order to deal with the supply of essential commodities that we are introducing this measure.  It gives power to the Executive Council which is not there at present.  It enables the Executive Council to declare by proclamation a national emergency.  Parliament can be summoned, if not sitting, within three, and not more than five, days after the issue of such proclamation. Regulations can be made dealing with profiteering and hoarding.  Allegations were made towards the end of last week that some cases of profiteering had already occurred.  Hoarding is a problem with which it is much more difficult to deal.  It may be, and I hope it will be, unnecessary to exercise any of the powers which are asked for in this Bill, but they are powers which in special circumstances ought to be in the hands of the Executive Council&mdash;powers for the protection of the community and ensuring the due supply and distribution of the essentials of life during national emergencies.  Even if the information which we have just got is true, and I think there will be general agreement that that information is satisfactory, it is quite possible that the supply of coal may still be interrupted. The information as to the end of the general strike does not necessarily connote that the ordinary supplies of coal will be available, and in that case it will be essential that the Executive Council should have power and authority to take such steps as may be deemed advisable to insure that neither profiteering nor hoarding takes place.  I accordingly move that leave be given to introduce this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The President, in his opening statement, explained that what was thought to supply an occasion to the introduction of this Bill appears to have passed, but, he said, that <Col N="1391" /> in three places in the country there were difficulties owing, as I take it, to certain rivalries between merchants, and that it was necessary to make provision to meet those difficulties.  While I am not objecting to the general idea that for the protection of supply to the community, special provisions should be made, I feel that the occasion for introducing a Bill of this kind is not well timed in view of the circumstances.  I was hopeful that the President would say that he had reconsidered his intention of introducing this Bill now, in view of the change in the situation that has occurred within the last two or three hours.  It seems to me that if you are going to legislate for the purpose of meeting difficulties in two or three places in the country you cannot do so on the plea that a national emergency has arisen.  I would think, if there is necessity to give power to the Executive Council to prevent hoarding in one or two places in the country, from whatever cause, if that hoarding deprives people in a locality of the means of living, that methods other than these should be submitted to the Dáil.  That is to say, that the power should not be one of acting by proclamation in a case of national emergency, but should be a normal power of the Executive Council. This method of dealing with the difficulties which the President adduces as having arisen in two or three places, seems to be an entirely wrong one.  I feel that the very fact that we are asked to pass this Bill in a hurried way is much more likely to give occasion for panic in the country than if we said: &ldquo;Now that the difficulty that faced us is past, there is no need for us to take upon ourselves these special powers.&rdquo;  That would be more likely to ease the situation and, probably, save the position in the three places to which the President referred.  I do not intend to oppose the First Reading of this Bill, but I think we should have some further consideration of the plea of necessity before the matter is dealt with to-morrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In my statement I may have given rise to some misconception. This Bill is not introduced <Col N="1392" /> because of rivalry between two firms in a particular place, but because of the weakness of the merchant in declining to supply.  The business would not go to his rival there, but would leave the district altogether.  It is not a question of two merchants endeavouring to get rid of large stocks, but rather of one merchant not being in a position to meet the order.  His difficulty was that when refusal was indicated the answer was: &ldquo;We will go elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the provisions of Standing Orders 79, 86 and 88, as to the giving of notice for the taking of the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Stages of a Bill, be suspended to permit of the remaining Stages of the Protection of the Community (Special Powers) Bill, 1926, being taken to-morrow, 13th May, 1926.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I trust that nothing in the nature of panic will result as a consequence of the passing of this motion, or the presentation of it by us, but I am satisfied, from information which I have had this morning, that it is our duty to bring forward this measure for consideration to-morrow.</P>

If it is in order, surely it could be brought before the House to-morrow, when reasons for urgency <Col N="1393" /> could be presented.  We have only had intimation of this motion a few hours ago, and it seems to me that the responsibility for having a House to-morrow sufficiently large to enable provisions of this kind to be passed should be foreseen, and the whole question of urgency could then be discussed in the light of the information which we will have to-morrow.</P>
      <P>As things were, we were pretty much in the dark as to the necessity for a motion of this kind.  If the situation as it presents itself to-morrow, appears to justify the passing of a Bill of this kind through all its stages, I shall not oppose it; but I feel that the position to-morrow should be understood before we decide that all these stages should be taken on the same day.  I think we should not pass a motion of this kind in anticipation of a situation which might, in fact, not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash; To delete the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In submitting this amendment I am actuated by a desire to make the Unemployment Insurance Bill as suitable as possible for the purpose for which it was originally conceived.  At the present time, we know that there are many people paying unemployment insurance contributions who might be put into the category of permanent or semi-permanent employees.  Most of those people never hope to gain anything in the way of benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Act, and the inducement at present to pay is the provision which the Act makes for refunding the amount of the contributions paid by such persons, plus 2½ per cent. compound interest, but less the amount paid to them in benefits.  So long as that section of the Act remains, there is an inducement to people to contribute under the Act in the knowledge that ultimately their contributions will come back, but if the amending Bill is passed, and if this section of the Bill in particular is passed, it will mean that the provision which was made under the original Act for the refund of unemployment insurance contributions to persons reaching the age of 60 years will disappear, and instead compensation will only be payable to persons who reach the age of 50 years. That means that at 50 years of age a man will be entitled to what he has paid in, less what has been paid to him in benefits.  This particular form of compensation is only applicable to men who have reached the age of 50, and the claim for this compensation must be made, in normal circumstances, within 12 months.  It really means that a person who is less than 50 years of age will get no compensation <Col N="1398" /> whatever for contributions which he has paid in, and it means that people coming under the Unemployment Insurance Act or Acts in future will not have the inducement to pay contributions which is there already.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that it is wise, in the interests of unemployment insurance, that this particular provision should remain, because, at the present time, it encourages people to pay unemployment insurance contributions who, under a strange interpretation of the exemption provision, might get exemption or might be encouraged to evade payment of contributions.  So long as the provision under the Act entitling them to a refund of the contributions, less the amount paid in benefits, remains, these people are encouraged to contribute, and I say that it is well and good that they should be encouraged to contribute under the Act, because by people of this class contributing the solvency of the Fund will be preserved, and in times such as the present it is very necessary that as many people as possible who are not likely to be a frequent liability on the Fund should contribute to the Fund for the purpose of maintaining its solvency.</P>
    <P>There is one feature of this amendment that I would like to point out, and that is the fact that at the present time, after a period of three, four, or five years of industrial depression, when more men drew unemployment insurance than in any other period during which the Unemployment Insurance Act operated, men are asked to take now what stands to their credit, and in a great many cases it will mean that there is nothing to the credit of contributors, whereas if this section were introduced in circumstances free from the industrial depression which we have witnessed for the past few years, it would mean that men would have something to their credit.  But men are being now asked to accept compensation in a period of very pronounced industrial depression, and at a time following a period of pronounced industrial depression.  I think that the provision in the present Act entitling contributors to a refund of the amount of contributions paid by <Col N="1399" /> them, less the amount paid to them in benefits, is a good and suitable provision, and is calculated to maintain the solvency of the Unemployment Insurance Fund, and I suggest to the Minister that this is not the time to introduce an amending Bill with this particular feature in it.  I hope that he can see his way to delete this section, even if it is to be considered &mdash;although I do not think it is one we ought to consider at all&mdash;in other circumstances and at another time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton puts it to the House that this amendment is in order to make the Unemployment Insurance Act meet the purpose for which it was originally drafted.  His idea is that by people, whom he described as semi-permanent employees, contributing to the Unemployment Insurance Fund you had a solvent Fund, whereas if you deleted this section or refused to accept Deputy Norton's amendment you would have the position that the Fund would be rendered insolvent.  It is a peculiar thing that Deputy Norton and I are both aiming at the same point, but we are apparently going about it by different routes.  The whole idea of Section 2 of the Unemployment Insurance Bill, 1926, is really based upon that same point.  You may say it is, at any rate, the financial basis of the proposal in the Bill.  If Section 2 of the Bill be not passed and the provisions which it seeks to cut out are not taken out, the Fund will be depleted and will be continued to be depleted by very large sums of money in five or six years time, when the Unemployment Insurance code has reached some point of maturity. The refunds at the moment are, of course, small, but it is estimated that the keeping in of the provisions which Section 2 seeks to put out would involve the payment of about £50,000 in about five years time, and there would be a continous payment of not less than that sum afterwards.  The Deputy says that this will give people in semi-permanent employment an inducement to pay.  They really never had any inducement to pay.  There has been a necessity imposed upon them by law <Col N="1400" /> and we seek now to equalise matters. We are taking out provisions that would involve the Fund in certain big payments, and compensation to the contributors affected is being provided. That compensation will be on the present worth of unexhausted contributions.</P>
      <P>As regards the point that there has been an abnormal period of industrial depression and that people might be adversely affected in regard to the minimum number of contributions to their credit if they are asked to accept this now, that is not an effective argument. Whatever be the period of abnormal depression, it will at least have its effect on the minimum number of contributions to the credit of a person to the extent of the benefit drawn by him. The force of that argument is not very strong, because it will always have its bearing.  If the Deputy means that his whole aim is the deletion of this Section 2 because he wants to render the Fund more solvent, he can take it definitely that the best actuarial calculation is that the refusal to pass Section 2 of this Bill will mean eventually that the more or less non-permanent employees, people who are subject to fluctuations in the way of employment, will have to pay higher rates of unemployment insurance if the Fund is to be kept in a solvent way at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know whether the Minister's actuarial advice shows that it is not desirable to continue the idea of inducing people who are in semi-permanent employment to contribute to the Fund, and I would like to ask him, too, whether he does not consider the provision in the present Act whereby contributors are refunded the amount they contribute is an inducement to people who contribute in the knowledge that they are really saving money and not contributing for the purpose of paying benefit to somebody else.  Does the Minister not consider, in the case of a man who is in semi-permanent employment who says to himself: &ldquo;I am not likely to become a liability on this Fund, but I am not flittering away my contributions if I do not become a liability, <Col N="1401" /> because at the age of 60 years I will get back my contributions,&rdquo; that that is not an inducement to people to contribute under the Act rather than to evade the contributions under the Act? Auxiliary postmen have been pressing my union to get them exemption from liability to contribute, and the argument I have used against their claim is the fact that if they do not become a liability on the Fund they get back what they have contributed, plus 2½ per cent. compound interest.  That is an inducement to pay at the present time.  If that inducement is withdrawn there will be an increasing demand for exemption and an increasing inclination to evade the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister, too, that some consideration ought to be given to the case of a man who is not as frequently a liability on the Fund as the man who is very frequently a liability on it.  I think a man in semi-permanent employment should be given some consideration in the matter of a refund of his contributions.  If a particular contribution covers a particular frequency to become a liability, then some provision ought to be made for a man who is not a liability on the Fund so frequently. I think the present Act makes provision in that case by refunding the amount of contributions paid by a contributor less the amount paid to him in benefits. I think if that portion of the present Act is deleted it will mean that there will be an increasing demand for exemption and an increasing inclination to evade the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made reference to the necessity imposed by law.  Of course, we understand that it is an obligation on the part of employers to pay the contribution and deduct such sum, if they care to do so&mdash;and they have a right to do so&mdash;from the employed persons.  To go back to the initiation of this provision of the Unemployment Insurance Acts, it was admitted at the time that the purport of this particular provision was to make the scheme acceptable to persons who are in regular employment and whose expectation of unemployment was small.  I admit at <Col N="1402" /> once that there is a case made, a very strong case made, that the whole system of insurance should impose an obligation upon the constantly employed person to meet the case of the less constantly employed person; but as we are so often reminded from the Ministerial Benches, we have to face the everyday facts and, while it is true that the necessity is imposed by law that these contributions shall be made, we know, and the Minister knows better than anyone, that his Department has very frequently been called upon to take action in respect of those employers who have not contributed.</P>
      <P>The Minister, on more than one occasion, has pointed out that employees have, as one might say, conspired with the employers to evade their obligations under the Act, and in that way they made the Fund less solvent and, of course, made the position of the person who should have been an insured person a very unenviable one when he becomes unemployed.  One of the intentions of the Unemployment Insurance Acts was to provide for persons who became unemployed and who did not expect to become unemployed &mdash;to meet the needs of men who became unemployed unexpectedly.  As we said in the earlier stages, we have insisted that it was to the interests of men to see that their cards were stamped and that they were at least making provision for a time when they would be more likely to be unemployed&mdash;that is to say, when they became 60 years of age&mdash;even though their appearance of permanency satisfied them for the moment that the prospect of unemployment was small. Now we are removing that promise and expectation.  We are inviting that kind of petty conspiracy between a small employer and his workman not to stamp cards.  We are removing any inducement from the workman to see that his cards are stamped, if that workman happens to think that his permanency is assured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, there is the Minister's statement that the Fund will be made more solvent by this provision&mdash;by the abolition of these benefits&mdash;and that in five years' time&mdash;after the expiry of <Col N="1403" /> five years&mdash;there will be a continual annual claim to the extent of £50,000 upon the Fund.  In view of the fact that men have been contributing within the last few years in the expectation that at the end of the period, when they become 60 years of age, they will have this promise fulfilled, if we are going to wipe out that promise now it is unjust to those who have been so contributing.  Actuarially the Minister can make a case, I have no doubt. He might say the promises of the original actuaries have not been fulfilled; that the scheme is not sound on its present basis, in view of the change in the industrial and economic position; that the call due to unemployment is greater than it was expected to have been.  I think, neverthless, the retention of this scheme is desirable on many grounds, but I think, above all, that the elimination of this provision, when everything seems to be conspiring against the workman and against the social provisions that were made some years ago in another Parliament, is advisable.</P>
    <P>It is unwise in every way that we should attempt to embody this provision in a mere administrative measure, a Bill to alter the machinery of insurance. It is unwise that we should go out of our way in such a Bill to abolish one of the important provisions of the original scheme.  I think it is a most undesirable proceeding, and I hope the Minister will be persuaded not to proceed with it.  The Bill could be made quite a sound and complete Bill in the way of a revision of administrative provisions without this Section 2.  If there are to be any further changes to be made in the whole scheme of unemployment insurance in regard to benefits, contributions and the like, it would be on such a measure and not on a machinery Bill of this kind that the question should be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could get Deputies to realise that what is being dealt with in this whole matter is an insurance scheme, and that that insurance scheme has to be made sound and solvent in some way or another. We are accused here that a certain <Col N="1404" /> promise made to certain people at the introduction of this code is now being taken away and no consideration is given them.  If that be not taken away the alternative is an increased contribution. If that is called a conspiracy against the working classes&mdash;to wipe out a particular provision which, if left in, will necessitate sooner or later the taking of increased contributions from them under the Unemployment Insurance Acts&mdash;then it may be so described. I would call it rather a conspiracy in favour of the working classes generally. The Fund has to be made and kept solvent.  It is not merely the abnormal period of industrial depression we have gone through which has rendered the actuaries' calculations unsound; it has been the big extension made in the classes to whom the insurance codes applied in 1920, with some assistance from the abnormal period of depression we have gone through.  That is why the actuarial calculations are now discovered to be unsound.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton talked of the semi-permanent classes, and he asked that some special provision should be made for them.  You are now dealing with insurance and with the fund that has to be built up by contributions.  If you are going to exempt what are, for insurance purposes, called good lives&mdash; the people in more or less permanent occupation&mdash;and if you have a bigger number of excepted classes, then all the heavier will be the contributions on the bad lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make an explanation in regard to that matter. I did not suggest that at all.  I suggested that the provision in the Unemployment Insurance Acts whereby a contributor had a claim to a refund in certain circumstances, should be maintained with the object of continuing to induce permanent and semi-permanent people to contribute.  I do not want them excepted at all, but if you remove the present provision the inclination will be to look for exemptions and evade the payment of contributions under the Acts.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is back to the point of inducement and Deputy Johnson has answered him by <Col N="1405" /> talking of the conspiracy so frequently referred to in this House as between employer and employee to evade the Act.  The Deputy talks of holding out an inducement to people whose occupation is more or less permanent in character.  What inducement is there? There is no inducement.  There is a necessity imposed by law.  Deputy Norton disavowed any intention of saying that the necessity should not be imposed by law, but it is one point to which, logically, he may be driven.  If you have to say: &ldquo;Very well, take those people out; there is provision made for special classes by reason of exceptions,&rdquo; it means that if you are excepting the good lives you are going to have a heavier fine put on the bad lives, if you are to have an insurance scheme built up.  We are not going to have any special provision made for the people whose employment is more or less permanent in character.  It is not going to be any inducement to these people.  As between inducement and the necessity put on them by law, I would always stand on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy means there is not full compliance, that is recognised, but it is not going to be got over by refusing to pass Section 2. We are having what Deputy Johnson refers to as numerous cases of conspiracy between these people.  The inducement has not operated.  The necessity by law is there.  If we get full compliance we will get a better fund; but even full compliance will not make up everything.  If the section which Section 2 seeks to amend is left standing, and if you do not put the necessity of law upon those people, there will be very little compliance. There will be compliance on the part of the people who recognise from the point of view of insurance that their lives are bad lives, and their occupations are by no means permanent in character.  If, then, there is to be any <Col N="1406" /> claim for a bigger number of excepted classes, the contributions from those people will have to be very heavily increased.</P>
      <P>It will be noted that this section was included in an amending Act passed by the Labour Government when in power in England.  Deputy Johnson, when more or less explaining that, pointed out it was introduced at the same time that there were some increases in benefits to other classes.  Apparently, Deputy Johnson would not mind breaking a promise to certain people if further promises were given to other people. We are not proposing to do that because we consider the situation here is entirely different from that on the other side, and we consider the difference makes it more than ever necessary and desirable that we should get this very heavy burden on the fund in four or five years' time removed at the moment while we compensate those people in accordance with the presentday value of their unexhausted contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this discussion has cleared up the position pretty well.  The grounds on which Deputy Norton has asked for the removal of this section are not, in my opinion, quite sound, even from the Labour point of view.  We should have to assume, in the first instance, that the Government are taking action to deprive people of something they are entitled to.  That does not seem, on the face of it, to be correct.  I wonder when these Acts were being originally drafted, was there any contemplation of a state of affairs in which a fund like this would be called upon to repay the contributions made to it by the fortunate contributors who did not need the assistance of the fund by reason of unemployment?  I think the original framers of the Act never contemplated a position of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it could have been generally recognised.  Even to-day the people have not grasped the working of the Acts in their entirety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> They act automatically and think very little about the machinery.  I was tremendously surprised myself, in connection with a concern for which I have some responsibility, when told that if an application were made to relieve the men of contributions to the unemployment fund, it could be carried through, on the grounds that these men were not likely to be unemployed.  That is comparatively recently, and they actually got relieved.  I should like to say here, particularly to the Labour Deputies, that I think that is utterly unsound. People who are in permanent employment and who, to that extent, are fortunate, are not to be asked to contribute one farthing towards people who are every day in fear of unemployment. That seems to me to be unsound administration. If legislation of this kind is to be put in force, it should be based on the principle that those who are fortunate should contribute towards those who are less fortunate and the fund, as a whole, should be on a sound basis of contribution.  In the case of Health Insurance, there are some societies that call for very little assistance from the fund, and there has been a general claim going round that those fortunate societies should get greater benefits out of the fund than others. The lines of administration in these matters should be based on sound business principles.  If the society is to be saddled with all the bad and none of the good, and if the fortunate man is to get back all his contributions, it does not strike me as reasonable.  I think the Government is very wise to make this provision for the benefit of the fund, and I think that the Party in this House which should be the last to oppose it is the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister had brought forward a Bill containing this provision and another provision on the lines of Deputy Hewat's proposition, one could have understood that it was a revision of the scheme as a whole, contemplating changes in the actuarial position.  I personally am of the view of Deputy Hewat, that these exemptions are not calculated to serve the worker or the fund, but I would remind Deputy Hewat&mdash;or inform him, if he <Col N="1408" /> has not learned it before&mdash;that the purpose of that exemption was to induce employers to give regular employment&mdash;to induce employers who are accustomed to turning off men, to keep them on regularly and to satisfy the Minister for Labour, as he was then&mdash; now the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;that their permanence was pretty well assured and that, therefore, they were not going to be a charge on the funds.  The scheme was definitely on the ground that here was an inducement to employers to give permanence of employment to their workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They may have been too generous in their estimate of the natural characteristics of the genus employer.  However, they considered that, as ordinary beings, they would be responsive to a financial inducement. Apparently they made a mistake. I am sorry the Minister feels it necessary to maintain his position in respect of this fund.  He may be able to make a case for actuarial soundness, but I think it is a great misfortune that he should be introducing a principle of this kind in the Bill, practically telling the people who have been looking forward to a lump sum coming to them at 60 years of age that they need no longer count upon that and that they have got to make some other kind of provision, not so easily paid up as in this case.  I think it will have the effect of tempting many more people to try to evade, by conspiracy with their employers, responsibility under the Unemployment Insurance Act.</P>

I do not know what class of regulation might be made under this as regards the insurance year; I mean to say there are possibilities within that that seem to me to require that the regulations should be laid on the Table.  If it is intended merely to shift the date of the beginning of the insurance year from July to another date to facilitate the changing of books, there is nothing in it.  But there may be other regulations, regulations affecting the insurance year, much more important than that, and I think that we ought to have some opportunity of discussing those regulations before they become permanent.</P>

      <P>When an amending Bill has been brought in and read a second time amendments in Committee can only be moved if they are amendments which are relevant to something which the Bill, as read a <Col N="1412" /> second time, contains.  This Bill is a different case, because the different sections relate to different things.  But unless the amendment is proved to relate to something in the Bill it cannot be moved.  Otherwise the result would be that when any amending Bill was introduced amendments to any part of the principal Act would be in order.  I think that that is not a proper procedure. Amendments 3 and 4 serve as a good example.  In the case of amendment 3 the Minister, under Section 7, proposes to deal with the case of teachers, and Deputy O'Connell proposes to make an addition.  In the case of Section 8 the Minister proposes that no contributions shall be paid or be payable for any person who was in military service after a particular date. Deputy Corish proposes to modify that with regard to a particular class of persons in military service.  These are examples of relevant amendments.  But amendment 2 deals with a matter in the principal Act of which no mention is made in the amending Bill, so that amendment 2 is out of order.</P>

      <P>In line 50 at the end of the section after the word &ldquo;school&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;or employment as a junior assistant mistress or workmistress in an ordinary national school or as a recognised lay assistant in a convent or monastery national school.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to have uniform action applied to the whole teaching profession so far as unemployment insurance is concerned.  It seems to be plain that the original intention of the framers was to exempt all teachers, but from the way in which <Col N="1413" /> the original Bill was worded these particular classes of teachers were deemed to be exempt.  The difficulty has arisen because of the fact that although the manager is technically the employer of the teacher, it is the State, or the Department, which pays the salaries, and much trouble was experienced at the beginning with regard to these particular classes of teachers, because the manager refused to pay the contributions, and I think that they were right in that, inasmuch as they were not the employers in the regular and proper sense of the word.  Then some arrangement was made by the Department of Education whereby they refunded to the manager the amount of the contributions which he paid.  As the position now stands, I believe that for all practical purposes they are exempt. The Act only applies, I think, to junior assistant mistresses with less than three years' service.  I do not know whether it applies to the convent school teacher and the teacher of the monastery national school, because they would be ruled out in a great many instances by the upper limit of salary.  I think it will be found that it would be more convenient for all concerned, for the Department itself, and certainly for these individuals, if they are exempted, and I therefore propose that these words be added.  If the words are not in the proper form I am sure the Minister could arrange them if he is prepared to accept the general principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This, of course, deals with the matter that Deputy Hewat referred to, the question of excepting employments, and inasmuch as it is excepting anybody I presume that we will have objections from both Deputy Hewat and Deputy Johnson.  But this section was brought in because, as I pointed out on Second Reading, a state of unfair competition was really being set up, inasmuch as certain teachers were exempt more or less by reason of their status, and certain other teachers were being insured, and it was felt that that was going to press hardly in the search for employment on those who were subject to the insurance code.  As regards the people whom Deputy O'Connell's amendment seeks to include, the class of junior <Col N="1414" /> assistant mistresses, they have been excepted by a regulation of some date in 1923, and those who are called work mistresses&mdash;there are about ten, I think, at the moment&mdash;the grade is described as being redundant and vacancies are not being filled, so that it is quite logical to exempt these.</P>
      <P>In that connection I put it to Deputy O'Connell that there is another class, spoken of as industrial teachers, of whom there are only about fourteen in the Free State, and it would be desirable to exclude these.  The recognised lay-assistant in a convent or monastery national school is a bigger class from the point of view of numbers.  There will be between 600 and 700 of these, but whatever difference there is may soon be abolished, and if these people are put on a pensionable basis they would come within the ordinary category of recognised pensionable National teachers, who are definitely excepted.  To a certain extent this is forestalling what is likely to be done in another connection.  I am suggesting, if he will agree with this, that I would admit the classes that he refers to, and would add to them what are called the industrial teachers, and I will bring up an amendment on the Report Stage to do this.</P>

      <Col N="1415" /> I really do not think that there ought to be any necessity for any member of this side of the House to move an amendment to protect the interests of people who have done their best in order to secure the stability of the State.  What I am asking for in this amendment is not very much.  As I pointed out on Second Reading, there are a great many men who were members of the National Army who had been insured under the Unemployment Insurance Act from the date of its commencement in 1912 for a period of six or seven years and who had not been unemployed during that period. Now, under the regulations which prevail, unless they have twelve stamps within the twelve months previous to which they became unemployed or demobilised out of the Army, they lose the credit for these six or seven years' stamps which might be standing to their credit.  I do think that the Minister should accept this amendment.  It will not embrace very many men.  I only ask it to be applied to men who were engaged in an insurable occupation prior to enlistment.  I do not ask the Minister to say that all National Army men become entitled to unemployment benefit.  I think the Minister on Second Reading was rather favourably impressed by the arguments which were then used by me, and I would ask him to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I must at once explain what Deputy Corish has said. I did not express myself as being inclined to accept either his argument or the amendments that he suggested he was likely to found on them.  I said that a case could be made that there was a hardship.  Similarly a case could be made with regard to hardship on every person who was in the Army except those who came from agricultural employment.  Any person who had come from what was an insurable occupation into the Army is in the same position as that which Deputy Corish seeks to remove from certain people.  If you were to put Deputy Corish's arguments to their logical conclusion it would mean that it is only those who receive preferential pay, who had served the State or had <Col N="1416" /> done anything for the State should be considered.  That clearly is not his own opinion but it is the argument he wants to use for this.  Otherwise why does he take out these two or three classes of people and put them in a superior position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That, of course, gets down to individual cases with which we cannot deal.  I do put it to the Deputy that if there is any hardship involved it is a hardship that falls upon everybody except those who came from non-insurable occupations.  Take a person who came from the occupation of agricultural labourer.  There is no hardship with regard to him, but in regard to every other class there is some hardship.  There was certain provision made to meet an emergency. Certain people were about to be thrown on the labour market at a particular time when employment was scarce.  In order to meet that emergency by that very large number being thrown on the labour market at that particular time, a certain section was introduced into the Act.  That emergency, in so far as it was an emergency created by these circumstances, is past.  We are now asked to extend what was a provision to meet a very limited type of emergency, for a number of people known to the Deputy, and apply that for an unlimited time.  In regard to this matter of exemptions are you going to make certain provisions with regard to certain people on the grounds of individual hardship, a hardship which is recognised? The hardship aimed at was met by the provision in the Bill, and it is not proposed to extend that further. If this amendment were framed in a comprehensive way, it would simply come to the point of making it appear that Army service was an insurable occupation, and to that also we cannot agree.  There is no reason to make any discrimination as between a tradesman <Col N="1417" /> or mechanic who had received proficiency pay and a clerk, to mention one class employed in the Army of soldiers serving in a particular capacity. So that in so far as it is based upon the claims of individuals it cannot be accepted at all.  If it goes further and says that Army occupation shall become an insurable occupation then it cannot be accepted either because it is too far-reaching.</P>

      <P>I did not intend at this point to put forward the plea that Army service was an insurable occupation, but I do think that the Minister ought to reconsider his position in this matter.  After all, these men were brought into the Army when the country was confronted with revolution so to speak, and I think that they ought to get special consideration.</P>
      <P>If the Minister could see his way to bring in some amendment on next stage which would meet the purpose I should be prepared to withdraw it.  After all, I know of a great many cases of hardship where you have six or seven years' contributions by men who went into the Army and now have lost the credit of the actual number of contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether that was a slip on the Deputy's part or not.  The situation is that if a person lapses by not having a stamp in a particular year then there is the entrance fee which admits him to the insurable class of twelve stamps to his credit.  A person must show that he has not gone out of an insurable occupation.  He must serve in an insurable occupation for a certain period. What is the hardship in the case of people who have gone into the Army? If it were said that we had taken people from insurable occupations at a time when there was considerable employment <Col N="1418" /> and got them into the Army there would be a very good case for the whole class of people in insurable occupations being dealt with.  The Deputy admitted that was not so and that people got employment in the Army who would never get it outside.  What I cannot follow the Deputy in is this: This amendment, I suggest, is an amendment to a very limited section in this Bill, i.e., Section 8, and must be very limited in its application.  He goes further and limits it in regard to Army men. tradesmen and mechanics who receive proficiency pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for this is that personally I should like to see every man, who was in an insurable occupation prior to enlistment, able to draw benefit.  It was in consequence of arguments of the Minister in answer to mine that I tried to get this in.  It was in consequence of that that I put in this stipulation that a man should be in receipt of proficiency pay to show that he was a tradesman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to get at what the Deputy is asking me to consider.  It is a matter of trying to get some idea agreed between us.  As far as I gather, his intention is that in regard to certain people here who were in insurable occupations before going into the Army that we should waive the provision with regard to the twelve stamps.  The Deputy stated previously that they had lost.  They have not lost their benefit.  They have been temporarily suspended.  What is in dispute is the date at which a person is to be allowed to draw.  The Deputy wants to allow them to draw here and now, although they have not fulfilled the requirements of the Act. The classes to which the Deputy wants that to apply are people who were in insurable occupations prior to joining the Army, or would he make any limitation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an idea, from the answer the Minister gave on Second Reading, that I could not get that, and then I thought I could get these people whom I described here as tradesmen and mechanics.  I thought that at least the Minister would agree <Col N="1419" /> to extend it to these people.  That is my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is without adverting to the circumstances in which these men came into the Army. There is this difference: if people were not in an occupation prior to joining the Army, getting occupation in the Army for them means that something has been done.  If they left an occupation in which they were engaged when the call came, then there is a stronger case for such persons.  You have a difference fairly comprehensive in this way, and it is a matter to have it considered whether or not the provision you should have is one stamp in every year or the entrance fee and whether that should be waived for all the people in insurable occupations who went into the Army.</P>
      <P>I do not think you can discuss this in cases of individual hardship.  You are hitting again at the roots of the whole insurance code.  The fund is badly in debt to the extent of one and a half millions, and if those provisions are not agreed to there is going to be a bigger drain on the funds with less contributions flowing in.  The net result will be further depletion of the fund and the drawing near of the day when all that abnormal contribution will have to be further increased.  I urge the House not to decide lightly on that, and I ask the Labour Deputies to look forward and see whether it will be a popular thing to have the basis of the code destroyed simply for the sake of a number of people for whom certain provision has already been made and whose transit back to civil life has been eased to some extent.</P>

Undoubtedly there are cases of hardship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to go into close detail as to my reasons for moving that this Bill be read a second time.  Deputies are generally familiar with the circumstances which originally led to the introduction of legislation interfering between the contractual relations of landlord and tenant.  During the war the ordinary activities for providing houses, and production generally, were diverted towards making munitions, and, consequently, large numbers of people were brought into towns.  In towns the accommodation existing previous to their introduction was limited, and in many towns in Ireland the accommodation would have been much more limited but for the class of house which became vacant owing to the change which took place in social conditions generally.  During the war the provision of houses was practically stopped. House building may be said to have <Col N="1421" /> stopped in 1914 or 1915, and no real contribution was made in that direction until about the year 1920 or 1921. At that time the cost of providing houses was prohibitive.  Unless to people who were more than ordinary well off, the construction of houses at that period, and to some extent since, was out of the question.  I would like to stress that particular aspect of the question, namely, that the provision of houses at fairly moderate prices is, perhaps, more important than the regulation of the relations between landlord and tenant.  It will be within the recollection of the Dáil that very considerable subsidies have been voted by this House towards the provision of new houses.</P>
      <P>The sum which was first given amounted to £1,000,000, and since then sums have been voted to the extent of £600,000.  The total number of houses that have since been built is in the neighbourhood of 10,000, but it must be remembered that for four or five years practically nothing was done, and that the houses that have been provided since would only compensate for the numbers that went out of commission during the last twelve years.  A considerable number of houses was constructed under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Fund, and I expect that a considerable number still remains to be constructed by means of that agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Dáil passed the Local Government Act, and in that measure there was a provision which entitled houses constructed since the year 1920 to a considerable remission in rates.  I mention that to show that the real problem is a shortage of houses.  To some extent that shortage is contributed to by the fact that people whose business it was to build houses have been affected very considerably by the Rent Restrictions Act.  They have been affected by these restrictions, and they have not concerned themselves with what was formerly their main sphere of activity&mdash;namely, the construction of houses.  An Act was passed in 1920.  That was the first Act dealing with this matter and its course was three years.  In June, 1922, we introduced a Bill here further limiting the control of increases of rent and mortgage <Col N="1422" /> interest for a period of three years.  The fact that these Acts had a three years' life intimated that the subject would be reconsidered at the end of three years in each case.  The Bill with which we are now dealing marks a little more strongly the fact that control must ultimately cease.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that Section 4 prescribes that up to June, 1927, houses whose valuation is not greater than £52 within the Dublin Metropolitan area, or £35 elsewhere, will be controlled; up to June, 1928, the corresponding figures will be £40 and £30, and up to June, 1929, £30 and £26. The average tenant, so far as this Bill is concerned, learns that control, at any rate, will exist up to 1929, because by far the largest number of people occupy houses of a valuation from £26 to £30.  Those occupying houses at higher valuations would not so severely feel an increase of rent which might be occasioned by not continuing the previous Acts in respect of them.  The 10 per cent., which was the added or standard rent, is increased in this Bill to 20 per cent.  This is a measure which must, I think, be considered in relation to the general problem, and that problem is the shortage of houses. That is the only solution, and, if and when that solution be found, there is bound to arise in connection with its discovery what is called an economic house.</P>
    <P>The present cost of providing a house is probably 200 per cent. in excess of what it was pre-war.  In other words, a house which cost £200 pre-war costs now, approximately, £600, and that is the real trouble in connection with this matter.  It will be at once apparent that people who now require houses are faced with the problem of making up the difference between the pre-war cost and the present cost.  The State, as I have said, has come in to shoulder portion of that burden, and the local authorities, in most cases, also share a portion of it.  I presume that before the provision in the Local Government Act of last year expires, the Minister for Local Government will consider some remission in respect of houses built after the year 1926 or 1927, or after whatever date is fixed in the Bill. <Col N="1423" /> I am, I think, on fairly safe ground when I say that the remission cannot be continued at the same percentage as it is in the Act of 1920.  The increase in the bonus from 10 to 20 per cent., although it may mean a few pounds in a particular case, is, I think, a just increase.  If there is one particular service in the community more than another which has suffered by reason of the war it is the service for the provision of houses.  Practically every other commodity has increased in price very much round the cost of living figure, but in this case the increase amounted to only 10 per cent. or possibly 12½ per cent. on the pre-war income.  It will be seen, therefore, that a person having an income from that particular source must have been very severely hit by reason of the limitation of the increase in that case.  Sections 4 and 5 of the Bill, read in conjunction with Section 2, which says that the Principal Act, that is the Act of 1923, shall continue until the 24th June, 1926, represent the backbone of this Bill. Section 6 deals with the point covered by a decision in the well-known case of Smith v. Christie, and Section 7 deals with the matter covered in another case, that of Kerr v. Bride.  In the case of Smith v. Christie, which was decided in 1922, it was held that where a landlord and tenant agreed as to the rent to be charged&mdash;we will assume that the rent agreed on was in conformity with the Act&mdash;the increased rent was not valid unless notice of the increase was served by the landlord on the tenant. That was a technicality, and I presume that Parliament when it was passing the Act of 1923, had not in mind that a technicality of that sort should operate to the advantage of one party to the bargain or to the disadvantage of the other.  Now, although Section 6 validates the increase made in such circumstances, though no effective statutory notice had been served, it has no retroactive effect in those cases where amounts were recovered by the landlord.  The other case which was decided by the House of Lords occasioned very considerable confusion because the lower courts had decided that notice to quit was not necessary.  That <Col N="1424" /> was a case in which it was decided that before any increase could be granted notice to quit should be served, and much the same sort of thing occurred there.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1923 was believed to have covered these points, that is where tenants had paid rents of a permissive amount nothing in the Act of 1923 gave them the right to recover on the technical ground that originally no notice to quit was served.  Doubts had been raised, and it is thought well to remove them.  Section 7 makes it clear that people cannot avail of a technicality to achieve what most people would regard as unfair and unreasonable, and again in this case a time limit is placed to prevent retroactive effects. Briefly the Bill provides for a continuance of the 1923 Act for three years only as regards houses whose valuations do not exceed £30 in the metropolitan area, and £26 elsewhere.  Larger houses will be controlled for a shorter period, some for two years and some for one year.  Premises with a valuation exceeding £52 in Dublin, or £35 elsewhere, will be outside the scope of the Bill altogether.  The other point in the Bill is that the bonus, which was originally 10 per cent., is now increased to 20 per cent.  I think it will be admitted that a real attempt has been made to deal with this question apart from any leanings towards one side or the other.  The original leanings were certainly against the landlord.  The necessities of the time demanded that it should be so, but we must assume that within the next few years the provision of houses will render the situation less difficult to solve in 1929 when the legislature will have to consider this matter again. I accordingly move.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot advise the rejection of the Second Reading of this Bill inasmuch as its main purpose is to continue beyond June of this year the Rent Restrictions Act.  Therefore, one will have to support the principle of the Bill as indicated, but the restrictive provisions cannot command the same assent.  Taking the last sentence of the President's speech, I understand that where the obligation arises, as far as the Bill goes, the Oireachtas will <Col N="1425" /> have to take into consideration in 1929 the situation afresh, because the Bill contemplates perfect free trade in house building and in the extortion of rents after 1929.  Except for the evils that would arise from the operations of this Bill there is no obligation upon the Oireachtas to consider the situation at that time, but I think the evils which will certainly arise between now and 1929 will necessitate the Dáil, in that year, legislating to continue the restrictions for a much longer time unless something which one cannot foresee takes place, and that is a very great increase in the number of houses that will be built in the three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have from the President some information as to the change in the situation regarding the supply of and demand for houses.  For instance, if we had knowledge of the number of houses that are to let, or for sale, and the number of houses that are unoccupied under these various valuations, we would then know how we could justify the modifications of the present law.  The Bill might be described, I think, as making certain an increase in the cost of living level. As to one class of houses, there is to be freedom to extort what rents can be obtained after June, 1927.  A valuation of £52 makes sure that it will only affect the wealthier tenants in the city, and the less wealthy in the country; that is to say, that £52 valuation bars out what might be called the wage-earning section of the community, but in the environs of Dublin city, and in Dublin city, there is a very considerable number of people who are living in houses beyond their means, or who are straining their means to pay the rents of these houses because they could not obtain cheaper houses.  If the pressure continues even they will be penalised severely under this Bill after 1927.  So far as I have been able to observe, there are not many houses being built at present to meet that particular kind of demand&mdash; a demand for houses of £52 valuation&mdash; but as we come into 1928 and 1929, unless we can make sure that there will be a very rapid increase in the number of houses available, we will find ourselves <Col N="1426" /> in the position we found ourselves in at the end of the war, when there was a demand for houses which could not be supplied.</P>
    <P>As will be generally admitted, if you have an insistent demand for a commodity which is not available, the price for that which is available rapidly rises, and people under the stress of family necessity, economic needs of a domestic kind, family requirements, or a sense of decency, will strain economic resources to pay a rent much above what they can rightly afford out of their income.  We are going to have that particular strain put on the population, particularly on those who live in houses under £30 valuation after 1929.  Unless we can be assured that the supply of houses will somewhat approximate to the demand, the likelihood is that after this Bill becomes operative you will have rack rents in vogue, and people obliged to pay a much bigger proportion of their present income in rentals to house owners. The general discontent which will ensue can only be met by a general increase in wages and incomes, so we contemplate as a direct result of this Bill the certainty of a demand for increased incomes to meet the requirements of landlords and house owners.  I think that before any modification of the Rent Restrictions Act is made you should be quite satisfied that there will be a sufficient supply of houses.  I would say, notwithstanding the provisions of this proposed Act, that when we come to 1929 it is almost as certain as anything we can contemplate in politics that there will be a necessity for a further continuance of this Rent Restrictions Act.  No Parliament will allow, if I understand the situation, the position to be continued or created that existed some time ago, when because of the insistent demand for houses and the shortage of supply people were obliged to pay rapidly increasing rents due to competition.</P>
    <P>I know that house owners have some cause for grievance and complaint, but the remedy that is sought to be applied is going to injure a very much larger number of people than those who will be remedied by the provisions of the Bill.  Apart from the future, and the <Col N="1427" /> assured increase in the cost of living that will come upon the mass of the people in 1929, we have the immediate addition to the cost of living of the citizens of those towns who are living in houses under £30 valuation, and even people who live in houses under £52 valuation&mdash;an immediate increase in the cost of living of 10 per cent. on the standard rents.  I hope that is recognised.</P>
    <P>There has been a general decline in the rates, and that decline in the rates will, more or less, compensate for the increase of rent that we are now asked to put upon people.  If that is the contention, then I think we have to insert in this Bill a provision which will impose an obligation under a penalty upon these house-owners that they shall certainly give to the tenants any benefit due to a reduction in rates.  It is a fact, though it may be the fault of the tenants in not making application to the courts, that the decrease in rates has not been passed on to the tenants.</P>
    <P>I suppose in the majority of cases that would be true, and we have the right, I think, to insert in the Bill a provision which would make it penal for the landlords to continue to draw the sums they have been drawing, if there has been a decrease in rates; that is to say, that the tenant shall get the benefit of any decrease in rates that takes place in any of the towns.  The effect of the Bill is to add to the cost of living of all tenants of houses under £52 valuation, and it contemplates a much bigger increase in the cost of living as regards the great mass of the people after 1929, the only possible offset being that we shall have ensured a supply of houses sufficient to meet the demand which is still very insistent throughout the city.  As I said, I cannot oppose the Second Reading, but I think many of the provisions of the Bill will have to be rigorously opposed during the committee stage.</P>

When the Rent Restrictions Act was put into operation I do not <Col N="1428" /> think any of us would contend that a necessity did not exist for a Bill of its kind under the exceptional conditions then prevailing.  As a piece of legislation, while giving relief to a vast number of people, it has produced a very grave sense of injustice and its operation has inflicted very great injustice on many people.  In so far as this Bill seeks to remedy these grievances, I think it ought to meet with universal support.</P>
      <P>Like other legislation well meant and well intended, it has created a feeling of profiteering amongst the very class of people it was intended to protect. It has thrown back, if it has not altogether destroyed, any incentive to house building as an investment.  In that way it has created the very situation that Deputy Johnson deplores, in which no man with any sense is going to build houses and let them to tenants. It has established in its operation a principle of absolute confiscation; a man loses all control, whether he would exercise it rightly or wrongly, over his own property.</P>
      <P>The Act has created a state of affairs that has not been good for the building trade or the housing problem, nor yet has it been good for the morals of the people.  I need not detail the very serious grievances of people, nor need I refer to the injuries inflicted on those who have house property as an investment. While there are a great many exceptions, a tremendous number of people have thrived on the position created, both technically and generally, by reason of the provisions of the Act now coming to a close.  In so far as the new Bill proposes to deal with that position, I think it is only doing justice to a limited extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson raises the question of housing accommodation generally and he says the available accommodation is insufficient for the needs of the people. That is a big question and it presents a very big problem.  I venture to suggest that that problem would be nearer solution if the Act which is now being extended under this Bill had been dealt with at an earlier stage.  The Ministry here are following the example of the Ministry on the other side of the water; there is, in fact, a general effort to deal <Col N="1429" /> with the housing situation.  The question of subsidy is raised, and the whole community are called upon to provide a subsidy for new houses under a certain valuation.  I think that in substance is wrong, although one cannot imagine that the shortage of houses could be relieved in any other way, under the circumstances existing.  You could not possibly expect people who had experience of owning house property to enter enthusiastically into any scheme of house building.</P>
    <P>The Act has undermined the security one would like to feel in connection with investments, and under it were singled out the owners of house property for isolated treatment.  I would like to say that I consider the Bill we are now presented with as tardy legislation. It is in the right direction and, unlike Deputy Johnson, I wish to visualise that in the year 1929, in surveying the general situation at that time, the need for this sort of legislation would have passed; at all events, I hope it will be recognised in the interval that it is desirable the need should have passed and that also the building of houses must be put on an economic basis so that the industry can be carried on as in the past when a man would build a house as an economic proposition and at an economic price.</P>
    <P>The question Deputy Johnson raised in regard to the cost of living cannot be dealt with by doing, as he says, justice to one part of the community at the expense of injustice&mdash;grave injustice&mdash;to another part of the community. I do not so much deplore the position created in connection with the actual question of rent.  All over the place you have the state of affairs existing where a man would have less grievance if he were restricted in the amount of rent but had reasonable control over his own property.  He has not had that, and that goes to the foundation of the great grievance in this whole matter.  A man's property passes out of his possession, and he has no more control over it to-day than if he never owned it.  How can you expect any person to look on an investment of that kind as a reasonable investment? How can you expect a man to enter with any confidence into building <Col N="1430" /> operations when legislation on that basis lasts?  I say it is impossible.  A man would want to be a philanthropist to expend money in that direction.</P>
    <P>In the past, some time before the war and before this sort of legislation was introduced, the provision of houses formed an attractive proposition to a great many people.  It was considered a sound proposition to put your money into brick and mortar.  You had a definite property there and that form of investment was more attractive to many people; they preferred investing their money that way than by putting it into stocks and shares and other investments. To-day all that is wiped away.</P>
    <P>The Dáil will do more good in the direction of solving the housing problem by reinstituting confidence in building investments.  I am afraid it can be done only very gradually.  It will take some time before the evil effects of the Rent Restrictions Act are forgotten by the people.  Deputy Johnson says this will raise the cost of living. We have to face that in the same way as we have to face the rise in the cost of bread, butter and flour.  Do not allow that idea to be imported into the considerations of this Bill or else you will be following a false line.</P>
    <P>When we come to consider this Bill in Committee, possibly there will be amendments submitted.  Deputy Johnson will have amendments safeguarding his interests.  I hope, for the sake of many people who have suffered so much injustice under the Rent Restrictions Act that an effort will be made to extend further the relief given in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Hewat's hope, and I go further in that hope, not merely that an effort will be made to put down amendments, but that an effort will be made by Deputy Hewat himself to put down amendments, because I have almost as many amendments on my hands as I can adequately attend to.  I want to deal with this matter somewhat more closely and specifically than Deputy Hewat has done.  Deputy Johnson laid down the thesis that this Bill was imperfect because it did not secure that the tenant should get the benefit of any reduction <Col N="1431" /> in the rates.  If that is a general proposition, working both ways, I am disposed to agree with Deputy Johnson that the tenants should not only get the benefit of a reduction in the rates, but that they should also pay a proportion towards any increase in the rates.  In other words, that the rates should be charged upon the tenants and not the landlords.  That, I think, is a sound proposition, because it would lead to an increase in civic spirit.</P>
      <P>At present far too many people, whose rates are included in their rent, take no trouble with, and do not even vote at municipal elections, and take no interest in the administration of their city or their township.  The result is unnecessary extravagance.  If, then, the proposition is as I have outlined, I agree.  If on the other hand he puts it that the tenants should get the benefit of every reduction, and the landlord should shoulder every increase, I think that is hardly a fair suggestion.  A good portion of the present-day tenants were tenants when the rates were very much lower than they are now.  Did they ever suggest that they should pay a portion of the increase? I doubt it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I turn to Deputy Johnson's point about the increase in the cost of living.  He knows the result of the previous rent restriction measure has been that everything else has increased in cost, except rent, broadly speaking. I have the last figures available to us &mdash;the contrast between July, 1924 and 1925.  In that period bacon went up 14½ per cent., bread went up 15.7 per cent., boots went up 10.4 per cent. That was before, and not as a consequence of, the tariff that was put on boots.  Rent went up .2 per cent. Looking through the cost of living figures as a whole you find the movements of rent upward or downwards are so small as to be represented by a decimal point only compared with the movements in other matters.  The landlord is not immune from the cost of living; he has to live like other people; he does not live on air; he has to feed and clothe himself, and he has to pay labour not for building, because speculative building has ceased, but for repairs; <Col N="1432" /> he has to have a certain number of men as a rent-collecting staff.  They demand a great deal more in salary now than they did in 1914.</P>
    <P>Is the proposition that Deputy Johnson put this: That everybody else &mdash;the bacon merchant, the bootmaker, the baker and the labourer&mdash;are entitled to charge far more for their services than in previous years, and that only the man who invests his savings in building houses must accept the same rent now as in former years? If the cost of living has gone up make it go up fairly for everybody.  I accept that principle with regard to labour.  I do not see why you should single out one class, not mainly a class of big capitalists, but a class very often of men who are, perhaps, members of trades unions, because in pre-war days the mechanic who had effected savings, the man in a superior position, the engine driver, and so on&mdash;invested these savings in house property.  You take that class and say the cost of living may go up, the profiteer may profiteer, the labourer may demand increased wages, and the clerk an increased salary, but because a man owns a house and lets it the cost of living for him must never be increased.  I do not observe the justice of that.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact I am one of those fools, holding a number of houses, who has not increased the rent since 1914, except in the case of a barrack for the Gárda, and I increased that first of all on the R.I.C.</P>
    <P>Turning from Deputy Johnson to the Bill, I accept the principle of gradual decontrol.  Where you are dealing with a matter of grave importance that affects the daily lives of the individuals, I think you should proceed gradually.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the President on what basis the figures in Section 4 of this Bill are fixed.  Is there any scientific ground-work for definitely taking the amount of £52 in Dublin Metropolitan area and £35 elsewhere as the standard rent or valuation?  Whichever is the higher the owner will be hit on. If it is a low valuation, and a higher standard rent, the landlord will be kept to the standard rent and vice-versa. I do not see the justice of the discrimination between the farthest <Col N="1433" /> parts of the Dublin Metropolitan area, such as Killiney, and other urban districts like Cork, Waterford, and Limerick. It seems to me there may be some justification for including Cork, Waterford and Limerick or restricting the section to the more immediate districts within a half-hour's journey of the centre of the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of Dublin Metropolitan area, Dublin city has been revalued within the last twelve years, so that the valuation there is fairly certain.  In the case of the suburban districts round Cork, and so on, the general valuation must be taken into account before that re-valua-tion. In the case of the suburban areas round about Dublin, houses have been, in the main, valued within the last forty or fifty years, and the valuation appears of an up-to-date character.  The valuation can then be taken as probably the best index of a standard to go on.  It is not the standard rent, it is the annual valuation, and I think that is the safest method we could have adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>How does that apply to Waterford, where the revaluation is now in progress?  I am open to correction, but I understand that Waterford is being re-valued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot challenge the President.  If he is not sure I cannot be sure.  I now come to a point on which I want to lay emphasis.  The one great omission in this Bill is that it fails to deal with the case of subtenants. The previous Rent Restriction Act created a privileged class of what I might call head tenants.  Once they acquired a tenancy it was a legal tenancy under the Rent Restrictions Act, but not a legal tenancy such as a tenancy under the Irish Land Acts, but once they acquired that tenancy it was permitted to them to sub-let at a very much higher rent than the legal rent. I heard of a case, in the suburbs of Dublin, in which the legal rent of a house with six or seven rooms was £1 per week, yet two of these rooms were sub-let at 18/- per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> For the remaining four or five rooms a rent of only 2/- per week is paid. There is no doubt whatever that there is a substantial grievance on the part of the landlord when he sees a tenant who, without his consent, acquired certain rights under these Acts, taking advantage of the position that was established in order to profiteer, which, I think, is not too strong a word.  He takes advantage of the shortage of houses to sub-let a portion of his premises at a rent out of all proportion to the rent he himself is paying.  I do not think that is fair, and I do not think it is just.  I admit it is not easy to deal with.  Since I got the Bill, I have been trying to draft an amendment or a new section and, not having the advantage of the help the Government has in the shape of draftsmanship, I have not, so far, succeeded.  If there is sufficient period allowed between Second Reading and Committee Stage, I may be able to get my amendment formulated.  My present intention tends towards a section which will exempt from this Bill any house in respect of which sub-letting has been carried on.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to look into this matter before Committee Stage, because it is a substantial injustice. The President admitted that in the past the scales were weighted against the landlord.  The landlord&mdash;particularly in town districts&mdash;of this class of property, bringing in less than £1 per week, is not generally a big man.  He is a man probably who would prefer to put his savings in bricks and mortar where he could see them than to put them into a gold mine at the ends of the earth.  Probably he was wise in the latter end.  But almost certainly he is repenting of his wisdom.  I do urge the President not to overlook, when we are dealing with this matter at a later stage, the last point I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure would not require to be introduced if we could provide houses now at what is called an &ldquo;economic rent.&rdquo;  If it were possible to get houses produced at an economic rent, there would be no necessity whatever for this measure. That is the real trouble.  Between the two people concerned, or any number <Col N="1435" /> of people concerned in the production of those houses, there is a certain amount of blackmailing going on on the State.  The State has got to pay a subsidy, and then the subsidy leaves the tenant in approximately this position, that he has got to pay twice the price he paid pre-war for a house.  That is certainly an unhealthy position, and it is a position that no amount of condemnation of this measure, or of its demerits, is going to get us away from. The real problem is to produce more houses.  If those houses were produced at an economic rent, there would be no necessity for this measure or any other measure to bolster up a peculiar situation such as we have.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson concerned himself, first of all, with the increased cost of living in respect of houses exceeding £52 valuation.  Out of approximately 2,586 houses in one suburb of Dublin, 41 houses have a valuation exceeding £52.  In another suburb, where there are 7,559 houses, there are 239 houses with a valuation exceeding £52.  Of two urban districts in the country, which I have taken, in one case, out of 1,156 houses, the number whose valuation exceeds £35 is 10; in the other case, out of 1,950 houses, 30 houses have a valuation exceeding £35.  That shows that the number of houses exceeding £52 valuation is not considerable in two urban districts in the country, and in two of the most important suburban districts around Dublin.</P>

      <P>Would the President give us the figures regarding houses between £30 and £40 valuation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In the lot numbering 2,586, which I gave a moment ago, the number of houses exceeding £30 in valuation but not exceeding £40, is 176; the number exceeding £40 but not exceeding £52, is 49.  As regards the lot of 7,559 houses the number of houses not exceeding £30 in valuation is 5,804; exceeding £30 but not exceeding £40, 1,098; exceeding £40 but not exceeding £52, 418.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the case made for the cost of living, I have not got the figures regarding suburban districts, but I will take the city of Dublin as a case in <Col N="1436" /> point.  In the year 1924-25, the rates in the city of Dublin were 19/2 in the £; in 1925-26 the rates were 17/2 in the £, and for the present year the rates are 16/-.  I take the year 1924-25 because that was the year after the passing of the 1923 Act.  If I were to take the previous year, 1923-24, I would have a much better case.  I am taking it now that there has been a reduction in the three years of 3/2 in the £. Take a house with a poor law valuation of £15.  The rates in respect of that house in 1924-25 were £14 7s. 6d.  The rates in 1926-27 were £12.  The difference is £2 7s. 6d.  It is calculated that the 10 per cent. increase in standard rent would be £3 0s. 10d.  The actual increase in the case of that particular house would be 3d. per week and 4d. at the end of the year.  I do not think that will add very considerably to the cost of living and I think it is fair.  A person, even with the Government subsidy, the subsidy from the municipality and the remission of rates which he gets under last year's Act, would still be in a relatively worse position than the person in that house with the addition of 13/-.  It is only fair that that should be taken into consideration.  I will take the particular case of a house with a valuation of £33.  In 1914 the rent was £60.  The rates amounted to £18 17s. 5¼d.  The standard rent is £41 2s. 6d.  For 1926-27 the rates are £26 8s., the total repairs increase, £4 2s. 3d, and the 10 per cent. increase, £4 2s. 3d.  The rent for 1926-27 is £75 15s. 0d.  The landlord only got £41 2s. 6d. in 1914, and this year, granting he got the allowance for the repairs and the ten per cent. increase, he gets £45 2s. 3d.</P>
    <P>The case mentioned by Deputy Cooper is a case very difficult to cover. It is a case of profiteering.  I do not know if it would be possible for any landlord to have profiteered to the extent that certain tenants have profiteered in these cases&mdash;that is, in cases that were brought to my notice. There is the other case, where a tenant is in possession and approaches the landlord with a view to a sale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the President recognise that the fact that there is such a demand as allows profiteering <Col N="1437" /> to take place shows the danger of any remission of these restrictions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In a case of that sort you have to consider that the remission of these restrictions, if it results as I have stated, is not an expensive remission on the person in occupation.  We have to consider other people who have no houses, who are trying to get them, and what the incidence in the cost of living is in respect of them.  I should like to know if he has taken that into account. The real position is that the unfortunate people who have no houses are being blackmailed owing to the cost of building houses now.  It is no advantage to anyone that the cost is so high.  It is high, but it has gone down during the last three or four years.  A house that cost approximately £750 in 1922 can be built in Dublin now for a little less than £600.  That is a considerable reduction, But there is room for more.  That is not a question to be settled here.  It is not a question to be settled by abuse from one side to the other.  It requires help from everyone. In the Press recently I observed that we have been charged with not solving the housing problem.  I should like to know if the person who wrote that has anything in his mind that would solve it.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that would be worse.  It is not a question that can be solved by any particular Party.  It is no Party question.  I was about to refer to another case besides that mentioned by Deputy Cooper, where a tenant is in possession of a house with a valuation of £33.  The standard rent is £41.  The tenant approaches the landlord and asks him if he will sell.  The tenant may be going to leave.  The landlord knows he is in receipt of £45 yearly, standard rent. The tenant can certainly get a good bargain from the landlord, and, having done so, can put up the house for <Col N="1438" /> sale and make £100 or £200.  That is not fair.  Landlords have complained very bitterly of that particular practice. I have heard of one case recently from a man in the building line where a house was bought by the tenant for £600.</P>

    <P>The section as it stands would make it impossible for any claim for compensation to succeed after the 23rd July, 1931.  May I say, with your permission, sir, that I hope it will be possible to save a good deal of discussion arising out of these amendments as a result of a number of conferences which I understand took place between the different parties and the Minister, especially the conferences that have taken place since the Second Reading was passed.  I can assure the Dáil that, so far as I am concerned, I do not propose to weary the House because I appreciate the consideration that has been extended to us from all parts of the House when the measure was being discussed on Second Reading. I am only hoping that, as a result of the discussions that have taken place between the Minister and the different parties who met him since the Second Reading was passed, that it will be possible to save a good deal of discussion on the Committee Stage.  Personally I cannot contemplate the company <Col N="1441" /> keeping, as they have, at the present time, a large number of a redundant staff on their premises or pay sheets until the 23rd July, 1931, but I can imagine that it would be a good policy on their part to do so, assuming that certain wording was allowed to remain in the Bill.  In the ordinary course of events one would hope that if the company wanted to complete its organisation in order to carry on its ordinary business such as a railway company in normal times, that it would be the duty of the company, or its chief officers on the board of directors, to reorganise the concern, get rid of the redundant staff and provide plenty of useful work for every person at present in their employment. That is certainly what happened in the case of the British railways, and in the case of the British Acts no such time limit was laid down, or no time limit was sought to be laid down in the British Act so far as this matter was concerned.  The Minister is, but the House may not be, aware of the fact that railwaymen up to the present&mdash; and the position will remain so if this Bill passes in its present form&mdash;were exempted from unemployment insurance by agreement between the then British Government and the British and the Irish railways on the understanding given by the companies them-serves to the British Government at the time that they were more or less permanent employees.  Supposing that the Bill passes as it stands, and that the company decides to hold over all these redundant employees that we know are knocking about until after the 31st July, 1931, the position will be that the men will be dispensed with without any compensation, although their redundancy might arise as the result of amalgamation, and they will not get compensation from the railway company as was intended by the original Act, and will certainly not be entitled to unemployment insurance benefit although they had an understanding with the British Government that they were in the nature of permanent employees. I think the Minister should take these things into consideration.</P>
    <P>There is also, as the Minister knows, a proposal in the Bill that a superannuation <Col N="1442" /> scheme should have been produced on 1st January of the present year by the company.  The Minister gave an extension of six months, so one may assume in the ordinary course of events, that unless the Minister gives a further extension a superannuation scheme will have to be brought forward by the Great Southern Railways in the course of the next two months.  If the position taken up by him in this Bill be allowed to remain, how can the railway company or anybody else bring forward a scheme that will be actuarially sound if they do not know how many employees will be in the company and how many are likely to be brought under the superannuation fund?  The Minister, in the course of the debate on the original Act, and I think also in the course of a speech on the Second Reading debate of this Bill, justified some of his proposals by references to the British Railways Act of 1921.  I suggest to him that he might in this case take up the line taken up in the British Act and leave out any date such as he tries to fix in this amending Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister, and I think the Dáil is entitled to hear from him, what reasons were put forward by the railway company's representatives to him when they met in support of an amendment of this kind.  I personally have not heard the reasons, and I would like to hear from the Minister if he proposes to insist upon the clause as it stood originally.  Perhaps if the Minister could produce any arguments in support of the amendment, one might be inclined to consider them, though in what the Minister has said up to the present I cannot find any good reason for this proposal.  So far as I am concerned I have heard no reason at all as to why a date should be laid down in this amending Bill, as no date was laid down in the British Act which the Minister referred to so often in the debates on the original Act, and also on the Second Reading of the present Bill.</P>

      <P>The railway management, the railway directorate, and all the rest are outside this.  It is a question of the Dáil and its attitude towards railway users and a question of an economical railway system.  It appears to me, and I think it ought to appear to the House, that a seven-year period is sound in itself, for this simple reason: The basis of the whole Third Schedule was that where a man was rendered redundant by reason of amalgamation or absorption he should be compensated.  I ask the Dáil if they think what can be described as the upset caused in railway conditions by the amalgamation scheme is or is not going to settle itself within a period&mdash; I do not say of seven years&mdash;of three years.  If there is going to be a reasonable case that a man was dismissed, his services were dispensed with or any change made in his tenure by reason of amalgamation or absorption, it ought to show itself within a three-year period, and we allow seven years.  If there seems to be any desire on the railway <Col N="1444" /> company's part to keep a man on whom they might have otherwise to render redundant, because of the amalgamation scheme, and pay him full pay for three, four, or five years redundant, useless service, so that they might then escape the compensation that was payable, the contention I put to the House is a very simple matter: Does it seem to the House that in a three-year period the effect of amalgamation will have shown itself in so far as rendering railway servants redundant?  Is it possible that outside the three-year period anything arising from the amalgamation scheme will occur which will, three years after the date of amalgamation, cause a man to be rendered redundant by anything that has happened after that scheme?  Three or four years seems to be a likely period.  Then I say that a seven-year limitation is a secure one. You must have some finality about the thing.  There must be some period within which what will prove to be an untenable case can be brought.  People ought not to be put to the expense&mdash; either the railway company or the unions concerned&mdash;of bringing cases. I hold, and I put it to the Dáil, that they ought to hold with me that the reason, if the reason be amalgamation, must have made itself clear within a three-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Superannuation Fund and the question of exception from the Unemployment Insurance Act, in so far as that has any bearing on this amendment&mdash;and I am not quite clear as to what bearing it has&mdash;I would like to put my point of view this way.  Deputy Davin says the Superannuation Fund must be brought forward by the Amalgamated Company for discussion with the trades unions before the 1st of July of this year.  He asked how can there be any scheme which will be actuarially sound if people do not know what is to be the number of permanent railway employees.  I agree with him that that must be known and the scheme must be based upon their knowledge of what number of railway servants will be permanent. If we were to accept that logically I would have to adduce the argument I have made already, that three years is a sufficient time within which this amalgamation would show <Col N="1445" /> itself as affecting people's employmer to a one year period.  I agree with Deputy Davin that the permanent staff of the railway company must be fairly clear before that superannuation scheme can be made.  However, it has to be remembered that that superannuation scheme has only an obligation upon the railway company to this limited extent, that it has to be brought forward for discussion.  There has to be agreement about the thing, and I have very little hopes that a superannuation fund, when brought forward by the 1st July of this year, will be immediately acceptable.  I imagine that there will be months of discussion before any superannuation scheme, if there be one at all, will be finally agreed on.  As regards the Unemployment Insurance Fund, I hold that outside the three years' upset that may have been caused by railway amalgamation it has little to do with the case. Prior to there having been any question of amalgamation or absorption, on the demand both of the railway companies and the railway employees railway work was excepted from the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Act on the ground that the occupation was permanent in character.  Whatever character of permanency railway occupation had at the time of and prior to amalgamation it still has after amalgamation.  The people who would be upset by reason simply of amalgamation would be rendered redundant within a three years' period.  As far as they are concerned, they would be out and would have compensation.  But so far as the people who remained on are concerned, their occupation will be on whatever permanent character railway employment was prior to the amalgamation scheme.  I do not know what the unemployment matter has to do with this particular amendment.  I think the amendment stands on a very simple basis, the question of people having to make up their minds that within a certain period the effects of amalgamation will have shown themselves as far as rendering people redundant is concerned.  If it is correct that three years is a likely period within which that will have taken effect, I say a seven years' period is a fairly good extension <Col N="1446" /> of the three years' period within which to look for finality on this question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister has missed the point of the case against the seven years' limitation. Let us take it as established that three years is a reasonable limit of time within which the redundancy will have proved itself.  That is exactly the case. But redundancy having shown itself with respect to particular bodies of men, the railways company balances the cost&mdash;&ldquo;Shall we dismiss these men because they are redundant, or shall we wait until the expiry of seven years? It will be cheaper for us,&rdquo; they will say, &ldquo;to keep this man on, though he is redundant, for another four years and then dismiss him, notwithstanding that his dismissal is through redundancy, at the end of the seven years, and then we will have no charge in respect of him.&rdquo;  It is certain that redundancy will have proved itself within three years, but if you have no limitation it would be the duty of the company to give effect to the redundancy. But if there is a limitation of period they may say: &ldquo;We had better keep these men on for another three years.  We will then have no obligations with regard to them.&rdquo;  The very fact that there is no period in the present Act obviates any risk, I think, that at the end of seven years any case will be brought before the arbitrator. But put in a limitation of seven years and the cost to the company will be very much less at the end of the seven years and no benefit will be drawn by the dismissed servant.  By putting in this limitation there will be a direct temptation to the company to weigh up the financial consequences of keeping a man on, or dismissing him and paying him compensation.  I think that that is the serious part of this to the railway servants&mdash;and the point about unemployment insurance arises here&mdash; that if this limitation is inserted, if the railways company take advantage of their new position and keep a man on for the seven years rather than declare him redundant within that time, and that the man is then dismissed, he will have neither compensation nor unemployment <Col N="1447" /> insurance.  But the unemployment question is a comparatively small one, although it is important to the individual if he is dismissed without anything at the end of the seven years.</P>
      <P>Surely there is no need for putting in a seven years limitation, inasmuch as all the redundancy will have been proved before that time, and there will be no temptation to the railway company to keep a man on longer.  I am taking it as in the normal working of things that redundancy would be proved within three or four years. There may be cases&mdash;I cannot imagine them&mdash;where it may be shown that the redundancy will not have occurred within the seven years.  In such a case the arbitrator will declare whether any compensation is due, and, if there is, will fix the compensation.  But I think we ought not to leave it open to the railways company to weigh up the relative merits of dismissing the man in a case of redundancy and paying him compensation, or holding him in hand until the expiry of this time and then saying: &ldquo;We will dismiss him without any charge upon the funds.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably the other side of the argument, that you have the definite agreement that redundancy will have proved itself within three years, and taking this at the very furthest point to which Deputy Johnson can drive it, you have almost an invitation given to the company to weigh up the advantages and to decide whether it is worth while to keep on people who are definitely rendered redundant by the amalgamation scheme and pay them salaries for so many years.  There is this temptation at the moment: A person is rendered redundant, and they will say: &ldquo;We will not let that redundancy appear.  We will keep that man on, and at the end of the seven years we will abolish the position.&rdquo;  Then that man will have to go before the arbitrator and prove that the abolition of that position was due to amalgamation or absorption.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister maintaining the position that he is throwing <Col N="1448" /> the responsibility of proving redundancy on to the railway servant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I withdraw that.  I am, of course, amending the Bill.  The proof must in every case be upon the railway company.  The railways company seven years after would have to show that the abolition of a particular person's post was not due to amalgamation or absorption.  I say that the mere lapse of time is a very strong point in your favour.  I say that if the railways company is to be credited with all these calculations, balances and farsighted views with regard to how far it would be wise to pay a certain person's salary, as opposed to giving him compensation, they have that more or less before them at the moment.  I do not credit them with anything of the sort.  I think that with the old Act, if there had been any sort of cordiality, any sort of proper working of it, they could have got along all right, if there had been the same sort of attitude taken up as on the other side, where there were very few cases taken to the arbitrator.  But when people became aware that there were certain loopholes in the section, they simply wanted to drive everyone they could through and it had to be amended.  So far, if there is to be any balancing of motive to give the Deputy's view of what is to happen in the future, that balance of motive is not to be put down to the credit or discredit of the railways company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>By reason of this clause the Minister is giving an inducement, and I think a natural inducement, to the general manager of the railways company to hold over until the date mentioned in the Bill, or after it, the dismissal or removal of a certain number of men who are to-day walking idle about Kingsbridge and other headquarter depots.  I am acquainted with a number of these men, and I know for a positive fact&mdash;and the Minister can, I am certain, confirm it if he makes inquiries&mdash;that there are quite a number of redundant officials walking to-day about Kingsbridge, and as far as we can gather, the company is keeping them there in anticipation of the passing of this Bill in its present form, <Col N="1449" /> when it will be impossible for any of them to make a case for redundancy. As the Minister has put up the argument that he believes the redundant officials will all have disappeared in the course of three years, may I say that the redundancy in the case of the operation of the British Act has not yet quite cleared itself up, and a colleague who worked for the same company as I do was only declared redundant from the beginning of the present year.  I know of another case where it is likely that another official of the same company may be compensated as being redundant as a result of the abolition of his position, which apparently will take place shortly.  The Minister should make inquiries as to whether reorganisation that resulted from the passing of the British Act is yet complete.  I think if he makes inquiries as to whether it affects other British railways, the L.M.S., the L.N.E. and the Southern, he will find that many redundant officials are walking about and the companies are keeping them walking about in the hope that they will be in a position to put them into jobs similar to what they held previously and give a return to the companies for the money they have been drawing.  I know an official who is walking about to-day at Kingsbridge with a salary of £350 a year.  He is 35 years of age.  Under the original Act he would, if he went before the arbitrators, be entitled with additional service, to a pension of £175 a year.  If this clause passes I consider it would be good policy for the company to pay him £350 a year for the next five years, or £1,750 altogether, and at the end of the five years there would be no obligation at all on the company to pay compensation, if this is stereotyped as in the amending Bill. He would merely get what he would be entitled to out of the Superannuation Fund.  That is one case.  Take that as a case in point.  They would pay that man £175 a year if he was rendered redundant to-day until he reached the age of 61 years.  That would be the average life of the railway people who go out on pension.  That is the figure that has been supplied to me.  Now that would cost the railway company, if it got rid <Col N="1450" /> of him, £175 a year until he reached 60 years of age, and that sum would be considerably more than his salary for the next five years, up to 31st July, 1931.  That is a case in point, and I put the case to the Minister that if the position arising out of the amalgamation of the British railways has not been completely cleared up yet, and if there are, as the Minister will find, if he makes inquiries, many men actually walking about to-day with no definite position in the service of the great British combines, I think that is an argument to show that the Minister's anticipation with regard to the clearing up of redundancy in the next three years would not be justified.  I can give the Minister the name of an individual in the London Midland and Scottish Company who was cleared out under the terms of the British Act on 1st January this year on this side of the water.  If the company were anxious to reorganise the administration since the date of the coming into operation of the Railways Act, 1924, I seriously suggest that they could have removed many men who were redundant, but the fact that they have not done so and the fact that there are large numbers of people walking about without any particular work to do, must be due to some reason or other and the Minister can draw his own conclusion as to what is the reason.  I am speaking of facts.  If the Minister persists in insisting upon the date being stereotyped, I dare say that no argument of any kind can induce him to change his attitude.  I hoped that as a result of what he has heard, and I believe this was discussed with him, that he would be disposed to give and take in this particular matter.</P>

      <P>So far from being the same thing, there was a further definite point to weigh down in my favour in Section 4.  In Section 2 there was hardly any discussion and <Col N="1451" /> in Section 4 it was simply mentioned. There was not very much talk about it. If it is a question of getting back to the British Act we should wipe out Section 2 altogether.  The people referred to in Section 2 are not dealt with in the British Act at all, so that if there is any question of basing ourselves on the British Act the argument should lead to the complete abolition of Section 2.  Deputy Davin has referred to the British Railway Act. That is one of those comparisons that can be made casually.  I do not think it is a comparison that will help him. Will the Deputy give me a rough case of the number of railway servants and companies amalgamated under the Act of 1921?  It would be somewhere near three-quarters of a million.</P>

Assuming that this is desirable, I would urge <Col N="1452" /> that it is desirable that a period should be fixed to cover the time where it would be impossible for the railways company practically to weigh up the merits of keeping a man on and paying him his wages, as against dismissing him at once and paying him superannuation. A longer period, of course, would give finality, as the Minister has pointed out, but it would lessen the temptation to practically nothing if it was made long enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point of lessening the temptation I wonder if the Deputy would face up to this? Take the position as it is at the moment, omitting the seven years.  Let there be no time limit put upon this thing at all.  Now credit the railways company with all this desire to make the calculations and simply do Shylock as far as possible on its servants.  They decide if they dismiss a certain number of men at the moment it will be clearly seen that redundancy is the cause; they decide that they will not abolish the offices of certain people, that they will keep them on for, say, six, seven or eight years and then take their chance before the arbitrator of making the point that obviously as this has occurred so long after the event which gives rise to a claim for compensation it is a prima facie case that amalgamation was not the cause.  You have that at any rate in the circumstances to-day. There is the additional point the Deputy may urge of having the railway companies in such a way that they are going to do the Shylock.  By fixing seven years you give them a better basis for calculation, but I say they have almost the same basis at the moment. They may say that we have a very strong case to prove our contention that it is not amalgamation which is the cause of those men becoming redundant.</P>

Supposing he had four years' service he would only be entitled to four-sixths of a gratuity, that is two-thirds of a year's pay.  Is it <Col N="1453" /> possible that a railway company would keep a man four years in full pay when they could get rid of him for two-thirds of the year's salary?  Is that the case? I think the railway company would be very foolish to act the Shylock.  The case made by Deputy Johnson is impossible.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (1) to delete from and including the word &lsquo;on,&rsquo; line 30, to the word &lsquo;cause,&rsquo; line 38, and substitute the words &lsquo;on account of or by reason of the amalgamation or absorption of companies effected by or under the Principal Act.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion the words in the Bill which my amendment proposes to delete are of too narrow a character and unduly limit the terms upon which compensation will be allowed.  The use of the terms, &ldquo;amalgamation and absorption,&rdquo; as qualified by the words &ldquo;and not caused by decrease of traffic, reduction of renewal or maintenance work, introduction of improved methods or other economic cause,&rdquo; might enable reductions of staffs and dismissals from employment to be effected which really arose out of the amalgamation and absorption but for which no compensation would be available. It would be better not to narrow the terms of reference which may be placed before the arbitrator and to give a reasonable amount of discretion to him in dealing with cases which are on the border-line of these two categories, <Col N="1455" /> the dispensation of services through amalgamation and the dispensation of services for economic causes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is aimed at eliminating certain words, and these words have, I think, been described as being so narrow that they unduly limit the provisions with regard to compensation.  I would like the House to look at the words which are regarded as being so narrow that they unduly limit the employee's chance of compensation.  The real words aimed at, I believe, are those that occur from line 33 down to line 38: &ldquo;caused or contributed to by decrease of traffic, reduction of renewal or maintenance work, introduction of improved methods of working (other than methods which would not have been feasible for the amalgamating or absorbed company by which the officer or servant was formerly employed), or other economic cause.&rdquo;  What the House has to consider is this: should compensation be paid to a man rendered redundant by reason of the decrease of traffic?  That never was the intention under the whole of the Third Schedule of the Act of 1924.  Further, should a man be compensated if rendered redundant by the reduction of renewal or maintenance work?  That is a right which companies had prior to amalgamation; it is a right which they should have; it is a right which was not disturbed by the previous Act, and it is a right which we should leave undisturbed.  Is it seriously intended that people should be compensated if they are discharged by reason of the introduction of improved methods of working which render their services redundant?  Finally, is it considered right to compensate persons who have been removed by reason of economic causes?  These are the four things set out.  There have been cases heard by the arbitrator under the 1924 Act in which every one of these points has been brought in, and which operated to rule men out from compensation. We simply enumerate three of those, and then refer to economic causes.  Is there anything unjust or unduly pressing on railwaymen to have certain <Col N="1456" /> things enumerated, and if these things are proved certain compensation should not be payable?  I would like to have a case made here by somebody that where any single one of these four reasons occur to cause redundancy, such redundant officer should be compensated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty that the Minister is placing the House in, the difficulty he is in himself, and the difficulty he is placing the arbitrator in, and, more particularly, the damage he is doing to the men at present, or who have been, employed by the company lie here: He is making it impossible for the statement of the company, that a man has not been dismissed because of a redundancy, to be disproved.  If this paragraph and the identical paragraph in Section 4 are passed, then there is no possibility of ensuring that men are to be compensated, because it will always be possible for the company to say that the dismissal was on account of other economic causes; that it was on account of improved methods of working or on account of a reduction of renewals or maintenance work or some re-arrangement of traffic, or a decrease of traffic.  This proposition is practically a repeal of the provision of the original Act which ensured that men who were to be dismissed as a consequence of the working out of the Railways Act would get compensation. I think, notwithstanding the Minister's statement, it will be found that it would be impossible to ascertain the exact cause of a man's dismissal.  If a company likes to say that there are economic causes, and if a man is dismissed from a depot or a station on the grounds of a reduction of traffic, the alternative in the hands of the company is that that man should be transferred to another station or depot.  But the other station or depot is already being reduced because of amalgamation.  Now, if the man's dismissal is due to a reduction of traffic, are we to say whether the man's dismissal is due to a reduction of traffic or to amalgamation, and if both causes are at work what is the position of the man?  The company can easily say that the man is redundant because of <Col N="1457" /> a reduction of traffic.  I maintain the position that I have maintained all the time, that the right for compensation and the equitable claim for compensation lies in this: that owing to the operations of the Act men are found redundant, and that there is a claim and a just claim.  They are there for so many years, and there has been not merely a fair expectation but almost a certainty of continuous and permanent employment.  If the company comes along under the new proposal and says that this, that or the other man is being dispensed with because of a reduction of traffic, or because of a reduction of expenditure on renewals or on the maintenance of the permanent way, and so on, then he has no claim, the whole purpose of Schedule 3 to the existing Act goes by the board, and we are throwing over the case of the men.</P>
      <P>The claim that the principal Act embodied and conceded that every man dismissed from causes other than misconduct or incapacity was entitled to compensation was, I think, a reasonable and fair one.  It is not a claim that the present staff shall be stereotyped and made permanent, but it is a claim that there shall be no further recruiting.  It is a claim that, I think, the public has a right to recognise on the principles enunciated by the Minister himself, that a public benefit should not be bought at the price of a private wrong.  I realise that in the amendment of Deputy Doyle the whole question is raised as to the change in the basis of compensation that is to be paid to railwaymen.  The Minister proposes to hand over the whole discretion to the company, and to leave the whole matter as one of grace and not of right.  If the company desires, in the future, to plead that there are other causes besides redundancy then the company will not be bound to pay anything. That is the case that the Minister has put forward, and it is a case that, I think, the House should resist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as we are advised by legal men who have a working knowledge of the British Act, if this section, with the various reasons stereotyped in the Bill, is <Col N="1458" /> allowed to remain, it would be absolutely impossible for a trade union or individual going before the arbitrator to prove a case for redundancy.  I am surprised that the Minister, who is himself a legal man, is not prepared to leave this question to the discretion of the arbitrator, a K.C., with a certain number of years practice and with a standing at the Bar.  I think the arbitrator, as is the case under the British Act, should be allowed to make up his own mind and to take all the circumstances into consideration.  In taking up his present attitude the Minister, I suggest, is inconsistent, because in paragraph (d) of Section 4 there are these words: &ldquo;In fixing the nature and amount of compensation all the circumstances of the case shall be taken into consideration.&rdquo;  There the arbitrator is given a discretion to use his own judgment.  The Minister, in giving the arbitrator discretion there, is, I think, doing quite right.  I fail to see, however, why the Minister should stereotype all these reasons in the particular section of the Bill that we are dealing with.  For instance, if the amalgamated company want to prove that a man's redundancy did not arise solely and directly from amalgamation, they could introduce some new method of working, a thing which is so often done, to defeat a man's claim before the arbitrator, provided the Bill is allowed to stand as it is at present.  I cannot contemplate the case of any individual going before the arbitrator, tied hand and foot as he is under this section by the Minister, and getting a decision in his favour on the claim that he was seeking compensation as a result of redundancy. The whole case that I am making to the House is that the Minister should leave some discretion to the arbitrator who, as I have stated, is a man of standing in the legal profession. That, I think, is the least we might expect from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me assume for the moment that the Minister himself is in the position of an arbitrator and that a case is put up to him that a man's dismissal is due to 75 per cent. decrease of traffic and 25 per cent. amalgamation, what attitude, I ask him, would he take up in a case like that and what compensation <Col N="1459" /> would he allow to the individual?  If the Minister insists on the retention of this section, worded as it is at present, then he can take it from me that he may as well admit to the House that he is confiscating, wilfully and knowingly, the rights of the railwaymen, rights which they secured when the original schedule was passed.  That is the sum and substance of the case that we put up from this side of the House.  I think that the Minister should accept suitable wording which would enable the arbitrator who is to be appointed by the Chief Justice and who cannot be assumed to be on our side&mdash; who will not be on our side&mdash;to decide cases coming before him on their merits.  I think we have reason for assuming that it was because of the insertion of words of this kind that the arbitrator resigned.  I can tell the Minister, because I know, that the arbitrator has resigned, and I am not surprised that any legal man would refuse to undertake a job of deciding as to whether an individual was redundant or not when he is put in the peculiar position that the Minister places him in by insisting on words of this kind being inserted.</P>
    <P>There is too much of the dictatorial kind of legislation introduced by Ministers into this House.  Judges and others&mdash;the arbitrator is a judge to a certain extent&mdash;acting in the courts of justice are very often put in the position, by reason of laws passed through this House, that when a case comes before them for hearing they have only to read out section so and so of a certain Act, and that decides the case.  An individual working on the Shannon scheme at 32/- a week, if able to read could do the same thing.  If that is all that is required there is no necessity for the high salaries that are being paid and that is one means that might, perhaps, be selected for effecting economy. I ask the Minister seriously to reconsider this whole matter.  While we may agree that Deputy Doyle's amendment is a slight improvement, and only a slight improvement, on the original wording of the section as it stands, it is still entirely unacceptable to the railwaymen. If it is passed by the House <Col N="1460" /> it will be accepted by us as a deliberate confiscation of the rights that the railwaymen secured under the original schedule to the 1924 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to associate myself with the plea made by Deputy Davin that judges should be paid less than a trade union wage.  I would like a little information from the Minister. There were certain railway directors who became redundant under the amalgamation of the railways.  That redundancy might be held to be due to a reduction of traffic or to the fact that the traffic that was being carried could not maintain the number of directors that it had maintained in the past. Could the Minister tell us if these directors received any terms of compensation, and if so, can he give a reason why similar terms of compensation, as is contemplated in Deputy Doyle's amendment, should not be given to the workers on the railways? If the directors received compensation, it is not unfair to say that the worker should also receive compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the last speaker, Deputy Doyle's amendment has no relation whatever to the scale of compensation.  There is no scale of compensation laid down in any part of this amendment.  I am not an arbitrator or a court of law to decide as to whether the pensions paid to certain people fall within a certain Act, or have been properly granted.  There are other methods of testing that.  I do not want now to be judging this matter, and I do not want to lay down my position on the points put up by Deputy Davin and by Deputy Johnson. We have had the phrase reiterated that this is confiscation.  It is confiscation in this sense, and I hope it will be understood to be confiscation in this sense, that it is going to prevent any claims such as that brought forward by Deputy Johnson being allowed, a bald definite claim that the number of railway servants must be stereotyped, and that the amalgamated company is not going to have the rights that the unassociated elements of that company had prior to amalgamation.  It has been said here that we are repealing the Principal Act, in so far as we are <Col N="1461" /> refusing to accept that idea, that the number of railway servants were to be stereotyped.  I say definitely I am out to repeal any Act which was supposed to have set that up as a standard. When I mentioned that as the standard on the Second Reading Deputy Davin disclaimed it, and said no one put forward such a claim.</P>

      <P>We never put it forward in the case of the British amalgamation, and how did it work out there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>But Deputy Johnson put it forward in this House, and the Deputy repeated it several times with regard to stereotyping the number of officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I say there is no need to stereotype the number of officials, but that if we get rid of them we should compensate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the same thing as stereotyping them, at least to this extent: if you reduce the number of servants in the employment of the different railway companies at the date of amalgamation compensation must be paid in every such case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows men have been dismissed since the amalgamation and before amalgamation while only a few of their cases have been taken before the arbitrator and claims made for compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Then Deputy Davin had better address his arguments to Deputy Johnson.  Deputy Johnson has now made the claim that you should stereotype the number of employees as at the date of amalgamation, and if you reduce it to anything below that number those who have been dispensed with would be entitled to claim compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I must state my position clearly.  It is that in any <Col N="1462" /> reduction of staffs due to the operations of this Act the men dispensed with should be compensated, and if that involves stereotyping, then stereotype. If you are going to dispense with servants because of the operation of the Act, and because of the operation of the fixing of rates, then there is a liability upon the railway companies to compensate the men who were dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is getting away from the point I have mentioned. At any rate, I think the Deputy not merely stated that the number should be stereotyped, but he repeated it in an interjection.  I am not now arguing this point put up by the Deputy.  Let it be understood that there never was any intention so to stereotype the number of railway servants that any reduction in their number should lead to a claim for compensation.  That may or may not be accepted by Deputy Johnson or by Deputy Davin, but that is the clear-cut position.  I take it that that never was mentioned, and it never entered the minds of the people who framed the original Act that that was the position, that you should stereotype the number and if you lessened that number there was a claim for compensation against the railway company. Let me move on to Deputy Johnson's latest assertion that if redundancy is due to the operation of the Act, if men are dismissed&mdash;I am quoting from certain points I took down, but I do not suggest he put the argument so bluntly &mdash;because of the operations of the Act the men who were dismissed should get compensation.  The aim of the Act was to ensure the more efficient and economical working of the railway system. If by the introduction of improved methods you secure a more efficient working of the railway system and people become redundant, the Deputy claims you should compensate them, and if because of the working of the Railway Act someone has been rendered redundant a claim for compensation follows.  That never was intended. There was no question of taking a decrease of traffic, a reduction of renewals or maintenance work, or the introduction of improved methods, as <Col N="1463" /> giving rise to a claim for compensation if redundancy occurred through these causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Not by you, perhaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for the House to decide what was their intention, or what is now their intention with regard to the future.  Are they going to say the railway company should not have the right any company had prior to amalgamation that these men could, following upon the introduction of improved methods, be dismissed without a claim for compensation? That is the position that the House is asked by my amendment to take up.  The things are explicitly stated and by Deputy Doyle's amendment they are not even ruled out.</P>
      <P>I can quite understand Deputy Davin's statement of Deputy Doyle's amendment&mdash;that it is only a slight improvement.  What he should certainly advance to is that yon should have a claim for compensation wherever a man becomes redundant and is dismissed, no matter what it is due to.  I should apologise there; it was not Deputy Davin's point but Deputy Johnson's. Then there is a further fallacy in Deputy Johnson's argument.  Deputy Davin has made the distinction he generally does when he speaks of me in relation to a certain profession.  He always says quite suddenly that I am a member of the legal profession; he never refers to me as a lawyer.  Apparently the arbitrator will be spoken of in that way too.  The arbitrator will be also a member of the legal profession. He will be, apparently, the same type of member of the legal profession as I am in Deputy Davin's eyes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson's point is: &ldquo;It is always possible for the company to say...&rdquo;  It is possible for them to say a great many things.  What is to be looked to in this Bill is what can the company prove to the satisfaction of the arbitrator, who, as well as being a member of the legal profession, will be, we hope, a lawyer. The proof is the important thing.  It is <Col N="1464" /> not a fact that the benefit is really with the company and always against the men.  The fact of the matter is that by throwing all onus of proof on the railway company the residue in the case is in favour of the men.  You start with the onus of proof thrown on the railway company.  That means that until the railway company establishes its case the men have the benefit.  That is the position set up and we set out certain things which, to my mind, are implicit in what was in the British Act. We set them up explicity.  What has to be considered is: does anybody allege any of these explicit things we set out here is an injustice to the men if proved against them and results in no compensation being payable to them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>A member of the legal profession would have to decide that.  There again the benefit is really with the men.  If the company does not prove that a servant has become unnecessary in consequence of a change of administration, due directly to amalgamation or absorption of companies, and not caused by a decrease of traffic or a reduction of renewal or maintenance work and so on, the fifty-fifty case would go to the man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Or for economic causes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly&mdash;or for economic causes.  I can meet Deputy Johnson's points quite clearly on those matters, with the definite point of view of the Railways Act of 1924 showing that a man should be compensated if he were removed from service by reason of some economic cause and not by absorption or amalgamation&mdash;redundancy due to the operation of the principal Act.  I do not know how far that is going to drag us.  I take the simple point that I referred to on the last day, that in the first year of amalgamation there has been a decrease of fifteen million ton miles in the matter of traffic.  I wonder is that due to the operation of the Railways Act?  If it is not, it is due to a decrease of traffic. <Col N="1465" /> It is asserted the railway company should compensate men rendered redundant and for whom they have no use because they have fifteen million ton miles less traffic than they had when they employed the men previously? Is it expected there should be compensation payable because of that decrease of traffic?</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin says we have put the arbitrator in a peculiar position, and we are more or less insulting his intelligence because we give him certain rules for his guidance.  Is Deputy Davin going to hold that in regard to all legislation which embodies necessary details, or should legislation passed in this House, in order to avoid hurting the feelings of judges, embrace just a series of general principles?  Is it necessary that we should point out we could have gone into details but we feared it might put the judges or arbitrators in an awkward position, and it might be considered they would not understand what was meant?  According to the Deputy's idea, we are not to put it explicity to the arbitrator that one reason is a decrease of traffic; we should rather put it in some vague way and point out to the arbitrator that, all the relevant circumstances being taken into consideration, we did not desire to insult him by setting them out in detail or by having the suspicion that he might not be able to understand our intentions.  I suppose Deputy Davin means that it would be an insult to the arbitrator to tell him that if dismissal is due to a decrease of traffic, then there is to be no compensation.  I think we will take the risk of offending whatever arbitrator is appointed and we will give him explicit directions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where Deputy Davin got hold of it, but I think I already announced to the secretary of a particular trades union that there was a vacancy.  Deputy Davin came to deal with sub-section (d).  After a case for compensation has been proved, when you come to determine the amount of compensation you take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, which is a very <Col N="1466" /> different thing from saying that the proving of the case for compensation does take all the circumstances into consideration.  I say we are quite right in being explicit as to what this House means and we should say definitely that dismissal due to a decrease of traffic is not a reason for compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If the company find it is not necessary to do as much renewal or maintenance work as it previously did, and if it finds that prior to amalgamation it could have dismissed men without any cause of complaint, and if it now finds there is a necessity for a reduction of renewal or maintenance work but that they cannot dismiss a man without being mulcted in compensation, what is the position?  Let us have the case made on each of these items.  As regards the introduction of improved methods of work, there have been several cases decided, I believe, if you take into consideration not the Saorstát but the situation in England.</P>
      <P>With regard to economic causes, is it the wish of the House that if a man is dismissed from the service of the railway company because of the operation of some economic causes proved by the railway company to have been the cause and reason for the dismissal, there should be compensation paid when the dismissal comes about?  That is quite explicit.  The other thing is very vague; it sets up the old condition. Being explicit in this section, we simply give the new amalgamated company all the rights other companies had prior to amalgamation.  I refer to the rights they had and that were given to them, enabling them to adjust their situation to economic necessities and to whatever were the classes of railway transport at a particular time.</P>

      <P>I quite realise that there is a fundamental difference between the Minister and me on this matter.  The Minister wants to put into legislation what is assumed by him to be the general will, that any change in industrial methods or processes may be made, and quite rightly made, at the expense of the workmen who are being displaced.  I take a directly opposite view.  I take the view that to encourage improvement in methods of working, of administrative machinery and the ordinary organisation of industry, and to improve these methods and to encourage workmen of all kinds to assist in that improvement, we should not face them with the proposition that as soon as these improvements have taken place they will be thrown aside without compensation.  We set up machinery by the Railways Act.  We said: &ldquo;Amalgamate your companies. Improve your methods generally.&rdquo;  Advance your scheme of organisation, and in the doing of it, if you have to dismiss and dispense with workmen, they shall not be the sufferers but shall be compensated on the score of your improvements.&rdquo;  That is the position I frankly take up.  If yon are going, by legislation, to compel railway companies to produce more efficient transport machinery you ought not to do that at the expense of the workingmen, and if you are going to dismiss workers by reason of the improvement in the transportation machinery, these workmen must receive compensation. That is my position quite frankly.  The Minister says: &ldquo;No; you can improve the machinery, get rid of the men employed hitherto, and you can leave them aside with no compensation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a fundamental difference between our relative positions.  I am trying to ensure to the best of my ability the retention of the principle embodied in the 1924 Act which was that if in the working out of this improved scheme of transportation men are to be dismissed and dispensed with, the company can make their economies but the men are not to suffer.  You must compensate them for their loss.  You will not be paying them as much in compensation as in wages and, therefore, you will be economising, but your economies <Col N="1468" /> shall not be at the expense of the workmen to the degree contemplated by the Minister now.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to forget in his whole argument that the original Act secures to the company a standard revenue, and you compensate your workmen who are found redundant. But now we are told the workmen may be dismissed without compensation if the company can persuade the arbitrator that economic causes or improvements in methods of working, or reduction of the expenditure on renewals were the real reason why these men should be dismissed.  But the railways company are still to be entitled to charge the public sufficient rates on goods to maintain their standard revenue.</P>
    <P>Now, I have not ever, so far as I know&mdash;certainly not deliberately&mdash;suggested that reduction due to a decline in traffic would entitle a man to compensation. I have not contended that at all.  When we come to deal with a question of that kind we have got to put the man's claim upon the community, not upon the railway company. But those other factors which may definitely and clearly come from the operations of the Act&mdash;economies due to amalgamation, economies that the company have taken in hand, because of the decline in revenue owing to the reduction of rates, the refusal to do certain maintenance work, to do certain renewal work, because they say their revenue has declined because of the reduction of rates&mdash;all these are directly due to the operation of the Act, and my contention is that compensation is clearly due to the men under these heads.  But if the House takes the view of the Minister then it is another invitation to the workmen in this industry, as in every other industry, to refuse to assist in the better organisation of industry, because the direct consequence of the Minister's advocacy is that they will be thrown out of work and consequently they should impede &mdash;it is blind but it is natural and inevitable&mdash;these improvements in organisation because the immediate effect is to penalise the men on whom the economy is to be founded.  I say that your whole scheme is one that invites <Col N="1469" /> workmen in all sections of the community to impede improvements in organisation because the cost of these improvements is, in the first case, going to be borne by the workmen themselves.  That is the proposition that the Minister invites the Committee to concede.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel compelled for the sake of accuracy to put both the Minister and the Committee right, and to put on record the fact that the claim has never been made by the railwaymen or their representatives for the stereotyping of a certain number of permanent employees.  The Minister knows quite well that the working of a station or a depot must depend upon the employment of a minimum number of employees, and an increase in the minimum number will depend upon the extent to which the traffic increases or decreases.  There cannot be, in the working of any depot, a fixed maximum.  For that purpose the railway companies, Irish and British, have always employed a certain number of temporary employees.  Take the case of the Irish railways when the eight-hour day, about which we heard so much both inside and outside the House, came into operation.  Undoubtedly, the Irish railway companies, now the Great Southern, had to employ an additional number of men to those normally employed previous to the coming into operation of the eight-hour day.  A huge number of men they took into their service at that particular time were never permanently appointed.  Would the Minister believe that since the passing of the Railways Act of 1924, or rather its coming into operation, about 2,000 employees of the Great Southern Railways Company have been dismissed from the service?  Will he tell the Committee how many cases have been brought before the arbitrator by these individuals for compensation? I cannot quote correctly the number, but I would be surprised if more than a hundred cases were put before the arbitrator for compensation. The Minister should give us the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister in July or August last how many employees were in the employment of the <Col N="1470" /> Great Southern Company on the coming into operation of the Act, and how many of those were now in the employment of the company, and how many were working short time.  He gave the figures then.  I asked him later for similar figures, and he said they were not in his possession.  He probably thought I was going to make use of that, if I had got it, for the official records of the House in a debate of this kind.  If the Minister has made any inquiries into the working of the Great Southern railways, as I think it was his business to do before bringing in this Bill, he should have the figures at his fingers' ends, and could refute my figures by quoting the correct ones. Can he give the number of men employed on the Great Southern railways on the 1st January, 1925, and the number employed on 1st January, 1926?  If he does it will be quite clear to him that 2,000 men, and probably more, have been dismissed.  Will the Minister, at the same time, give us the number of cases that went before the arbitrator?  They may have been, and probably were, dismissed as a result of the decrease of traffic.  Cases were never brought before the arbitrator on behalf of temporary employees&mdash;and, presumably, the majority of these were temporary&mdash;for compensation under the Act.  These are the facts as I know them.  Let the Minister quote the figures and the House will know who is right and who is wrong.  I am supervising a number of men working at a certain depot.  The number normally would run to close on 100 employees, but of these there are only 56 permanent employees.  The numbers increase and decrease.  At any rate the number will not fall below 56.  An increase or decrease will be effected by the traffic passing in and out of the depot.  Can the Minister contradict that?</P>

      <P>It does not matter to me what the Minister thought Deputy Johnson said.  I do not think Deputy Johnson went as far as the Minister assumes, and I think it is right to put it on the records of the House so that the Minister can, if he has an opportunity, refute it.  Take Kingsbridge goods depot.  I am sorry to have to detain the House, but I think an explanation is necessary.  In the summer time, when traffic would be normal, there would be, say, 1,000 men employed, while in winter or at the present time, when traffic is not actually normal, there might be only 750 employed there.  When traffic would increase or decrease the company would have to re-employ or dispense with hands.  The new hands will be temporarily employed and the company can dispense with them any time they think right.  The union cannot put forward on behalf of these men any claim for compensation before the arbitrator. I am putting these facts on record for the information of the Minister and he can make any case he likes to refute them, if he still persists in saying that we stand for the permanent employment of all who were employed in pre-amalgamation days. That is not so and never was so.  As far as I know, that case is not likely to be put forward at any time.  I did not catch whether the Minister, when he stood up to reply, accepted an amendment moved by Deputy Doyle.</P>

      <P>Certainly, it is no exaggeration to say that we look upon the elimination of these provisions as depriving railwaymen who may be redundant in the future of any compensation whatsoever.  Redundancy, if I understand it correctly, means the permanent abolition of a post now or previously held by a certain individual and as a consequence the person concerned would be entitled to the benefit of the Act passed by the Oireachtas. I heard Deputy Gorey saying a few moments ago &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; to what the Minister said, that wrongs only now appearing to the Minister should be righted.  That is quite true, but after all I put it to Deputy Gorey that it is a reflection on himself and his colleagues that they did not detect the wrongs when the Bill was going through the Dáil.</P>

Is it to be left to the discretion of the arbitrator&mdash;I put the strongest case, from my own point of view, first&mdash;in a case where redundancy is proved to have been due to decrease of traffic, whether that man should get compensation or not?  Should the arbitrator have a discretion in a clearlyproved case of redundancy, due to decrease of traffic, as to whether he should award compensation or not?</P>

      <P>Let us take the facts.  The Railway Tribunal insisted on certain reductions in rates.  I wonder if the Deputy knows&mdash;and if he does know, can he state the reason for the occurrence&mdash;that the railway company has, in many cases, reduced rates beyond the reduction the Railway Tribunal imposed upon them?  That was done owing to the necessity of keeping traffic from leaving them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I understand the point made by the Deputy, it is a reply to Deputy Johnson's argument.  I put it definitely to Deputy Johnson that the railway company has, in many cases, reduced rates beyond what the Railway Tribunal imposed on them; that they did that to keep traffic on the rail-road which would otherwise have gone to the roads and that it cannot be alleged that reduction of rates has been the cause of their giving up maintenance works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1475" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>They do allege it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy takes one side of the railway company's argument and fails to have regard to the second side, he can of course make an allegation like that. But the railway company directors at their meeting said that the economy effected had balanced any reduced receipts, through reduced rates, and that in so far as there were any further reduced receipts beyond that, it was due to decrease in traffic&mdash;and that, although the railway company had reduced their rates below what the Tribunal imposed upon them in order to keep traffic on their system.  Deputy Johnson argues that because there was imposed on the railway company a certain reduction of rates that that led to reduced receipts and to reduced maintenance work.  He takes no account of the reduced traffic.  I could equally ignore the reduction of the rates and say it was entirely due to reduced traffic, which the reduction of rates failed to keep on the railway system, that there had to be any reduction of maintenance or renewal work.  I could say that equally well with Deputy Johnson ignoring, as he does in case of the railways company, the other side of the argument.  But both matters enter into it.  The reduction of traffic is a thing that cannot be blinked at.  There is a very serious reduction of traffic.  If that traffic had gone off the railway system prior to amalgamation there would undoubtedly have been a reduction of maintenance and renewal work.  There would have been men dismissed, and these men would have had no claim for compensation. We sought to put the amalgamated companies vis-á-vis, in those circumstances, as they would have been prior to amalgamation.  That is the simple case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to the second point.  Are you going to say that where a case is clearly proved to have resulted from the reduction of renewal or maintenance work compensation should be paid?  The railway company is not going to give up what it considers the ordinary amount of renewal or maintenance work.  There has to be a certain amount of renewal and maintenance <Col N="1476" /> work carried out year by year. They are not going to have their whole system affected injuriously in years to come for the sake of getting rid of a certain number of men.  If the case is clearly proved that there has been a dismissal and that the dismissal is due to that particular item&mdash;reduction of renewal or maintenance work&mdash;I hold, and I ask the House to hold with me, that there is no reason for compensation. There is a proviso&mdash;&ldquo;Other than methods which would not have been feasible for the amalgamating or absorbed company by which the officer or servant was formerly employed or other economic cause.&rdquo;  That is the simple position the House has to vote on.  Do they think that where a man's dismissal was caused by economic cause he ought to get compensation?</P>
    <P>I am not going to enter on Deputy Johnson's theoretic argument as to whether or not improvement should be effected at the sacrifice of employees. I simply say we had a particular system in operation before amalgamation. We set out to carry that forward with regard to the amalgamated company. We said that anything due to amalgamation or absorption causing redundancy should have the effect of bringing compensation, but that outside that &mdash;redundancy or absorption causing redundancy&mdash;there should be no compensation; that the united companies should have no further obligations in respect of compensation than the unamalgamated elements had prior to amalgamation.  I am glad the Deputy made the point I should have made, that proprietors' dividends do not enter into this matter.  This is a question between the railway user and the railway employee.  Is the railway user to pay increased rates for the compensation of people dismissed under the operation of economic causes, or is he not?</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton has asked me again with regard to this &ldquo;fifty-fifty&rdquo; case. I am not going to take any further steps with regard to this fifty-fifty case than are shown here.  The railway company has imposed on it the onus of proving and establishing to the satisfaction of the arbitrator that the redundancy&mdash;if I may put in a comprehensive <Col N="1477" /> word&mdash;is due directly to the amalgamation and absorption of the companies, and is not caused by decrease of traffic.  If there were a &ldquo;fifty-fifty&rdquo; case, and if I might presume to be in the position of arbitrator for the time being, I should say that the company had not proved its case. But I cannot say what the arbitrator will say in the matter.  That is one of the things we must leave to the discretion of the arbitrator.</P>

      <P>Obviously, if sufficient money is not spent on renewal or maintenance work it is going to show in some disaster on the line.  They cannot afford to neglect the maintenance of the system, and leave the line running as if the repairs were going on in the ordinary way.  They are in the hands of the proprietors.  They have to justify the absence of the percentage of money ordinarily set aside for repairs and maintenance.  As a matter of fact, as far as I can remember from the latest accounts, there was an abnormal percentage of their receipts given to maintenance and repair work, not merely abnormal for this country, but abnormal in relation to railway work in England.</P>

      <P>I have figures. One of the points actually examined was as to how far they were spending too much money on renewal and maintenance work, and I think they will find some difficulty, if the proprietors like to look into the matter, in proving that they have not been spending too much money on this work or else they will have to give an explanation about it. There is a possible explanation that it is due to the fact that there was not sufficient attention paid to this work for a number of years past, and that they are now making up arrears in that respect.  The railway company is in the position that this is a thing that cannot be trifled with.  They have either to spend enough money on renewals or repairs or allow the line to get into disrepair. They are not going to carry on long until some decisive and startling disaster occurs.  I am not able to answer here as to how the management are carrying out their duties to the shareholders and to the railway users.  As I say, it is a thing that should be left to the arbitrator, to decide that a dismissal some time in the future is clearly proved to have been due to a reduction of maintenance work.  If so, there is no reason for compensation.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to get the Minister's interpretation of the fifty-fifty case.  My reading of the section is that the man has got to show that his services have been dispensed with on account of their having become unnecessary in consequence of changes of administration, due directly to the amalgamation and absorption of companies.  Putting a layman's interpretation on that.  I think that the onus is imposed on the man of showing that the dismissal is brought about directly by or is directly due to amalgamation. <Col N="1480" /> I would like the Minister to indicate where or because of what form of words that onus of proof is not on the man.  I would like him, if he cannot answer me off-hand, to consult the Parliamentary draftsman to see if it is clear, and if not that he would make it more clear than it appears to me.</P>

      <P>The Minister talks about a very large sum of money spent on maintenance work last year.  I had some figures here some time ago&mdash;I have not got them now&mdash;that would throw some light on the statement the Minister refers to.  One thing that would make it very difficult to follow the statement from the point of view the Minister talks of, is that with regard to the expenditure of any Department previous to amalgamation, there were no comparative figures.  I imagine that it would be very hard for the Minister, acting on the information that he could get from that statement, to come to a definite conclusion.  I realise now the folly of pursuing this thing if the Minister does not give any indication of what he is prepared to do or whether he is prepared to give any accommodation in this matter.  I want to find out from him whether he is prepared now or at a later stage of this Bill&mdash;certainly before the Bill leaves the Dáil&mdash; to furnish the House with a statement showing the number of employees on 1st January, 1925, and the latest available figures.  He can get the figures for the last pay day.  They are always available at Kingsbridge.  He can also get the number of cases submitted to the arbitrator before he resigned, so that the House will be in a position to judge the number dismissed for any cause whatsoever and the number of cases brought before the arbitrator.  I think if the Minister furnished the House with that information&mdash;which he can get if he has not already got it&mdash; he will put the House in a position to judge what the effect of the original Act was on the revenue of the company.</P>

      <P>I have stated that Deputy Johnson has advanced from the point of view which you so decisively rejected on the Second Reading.  I then said that I was going to put it to the House that they should not stand for that whether it is alleged or not.  I have still my rights to put it to the House that they should not stand for that contention.  Irrespective of whether that is put forward or not I would like to see the Official Report, just to find how near Deputy Johnson went.  I am not alleging that he went to the full point, but I would like to find how close he went.  Anybody who will read the debates on the Second Reading will see that Deputy Norton advanced an argument which by implication&mdash;I do not say it was explicitly stated&mdash;led to that.  I have seen no indication that the Dáil requires this information, but I can ask the railway company to furnish it.  I do not think I could enforce a demand that they should give me any information, and I do not think that it would be of any value to the Dáil at the moment.</P>

      <P>I can only put it this way.  It seems to me that the ordinary progress will be that the railway employee will allege dismissal. That is a thing that is easily proved. He will claim that his dismissal is due to changes of administration due directly and solely to the amalgamation and absorption of companies affected by the 1924 Act.  Immediately arises the question: is it caused by anything else?  There is a definite, direct onus thrown on the railway company of proving that it is caused by these other things.  I should say that the next step would be that the arbitrator would call on the railway company to prove that the dismissal was due to those things that are mentioned.</P>

The Deputy now wants to add in that they must show that the dismissal was due to amalgamation and absorption. If you leave it as it is, it is obvious that the man claims that and the company must then show that it is caused by these other things.  As we amended this second section, things which the railway company would naturally be in a position to prove should be proved by them.  I should say that if they fail to prove that, the claim stands.  I cannot go beyond stating my belief.</P>

      <P>The Minister has already agreed to delete the word &ldquo;solely,&rdquo; but I think he might have gone still further and included &ldquo;directly.&rdquo;  Qualifying words of this kind very often lead to a great many difficulties, and I think that the Minister would be well advised to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on this, except that I think the use of the word &ldquo;directly&rdquo; is necessary in order to obviate claims that might be pressed, where a claim could conceivably be made that in some way or other the dismissal was due to amalgamation.  I am speaking now definitely and clearly in the interests of the railway users.  I do not see why the railway users should be called on to pay higher freights because the amalgamated company had to compensate men whose dismissal was due to some reason other than directly to amalgamation and absorption.  The thing to be compensated for is dismissal due directly to amalgamation, and I do not see that railway users should be penalised through the payment of compensation to men who can claim, in some way or other, in some indirect fashion, in some far-fetched fashion, that their dismissal was due to amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see frequent possibilities of men putting up claims that their dismissal is due indirectly to amalgamation.  It may be contended by the company that it is not due directly to amalgamation, or the company may so arrange things that it shall not be directly due to amalgamation.  But if the man can show that it is indirectly due to amalgamation he will have no compensation, and again we are put in the position we were in before, that the man has got to show.  I contend that under the section as it stands a man will have to show that his dismissal was due directly to amalgamation, and I am as confident as I am of anything that the company, if it desires, will be able to bring about the position that it was only indirectly due to amalgamation, and then there will be no compensation whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position that the Minister is putting us into will be something like this: If a man succeeds in showing that his dismissal is due directly, but not absolutely, to amalgamation, and the company says that the dismissal is due to a reduction of traffic, each will be partly right.  Then the man will not get his compensation because the company will be able to show that the reduction of traffic is a factor.  I cannot understand the position that the Minister is taking up, if he wants to deal fairly with the railwaymen.  He is placing a weapon in the hands of the company that will be capable of being used very effectively to deprive the men of any compensation whatever, and those who vote for the Minister's position in any <Col N="1487" /> of these proposals are simply telling the railwaymen that they have gone back upon their promises of 1924 and are insisting that the company shall be in a position to dismiss men at their pleasure, without regard to any question of compensation, because under the Minister's proposals the company will be able to say that there were other causes, and the man will have to prove that his dismissal is directly due to amalgamation.  I support the amendment because at any rate it is one obstacle in the way of the company taking advantage of the position in which the Minister wants to place them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support this amendment, because I believe there is very little use in the Minister moving the elimination of the words &ldquo;and solely&rdquo; if he does not be consistent, and also move the deletion of the word &ldquo;directly.&rdquo;  I presume that the Minister is aware that in the ordinary course of the conditions of employment railwaymen are obliged to go to whatever depot or office they are required to work at.  In other words, their conditions of service mean that they have to go wherever they are sent and whenever they are sent, and to carry out any orders given to them.  For instance, if the company wanted to take advantage, as I am sure they will, of the wording of the amendment they can remove a man from Kingsbridge to Ballincollig, or Ballinamuck, or Timbuctoo, or the Cork goods office in the case of a goods clerk, knowing that in that case they could prove a decrease of traffic in Cork, and automatically on those grounds dismiss that clerk without compensation.  I believe that that will go on wholesale, and the Minister is absolutely playing into the hands of the officials of the company to enable them to do this; and I can assure him that the officials are quite capable of doing it, and will take all possible advantage of the Bill to bring about dismissals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the Cork goods offices, where the staff is wholly engaged in the manipulation of goods traffic.  On the other hand, as Deputy Cooper knows, there may be a case made for that man's removal, even in the case of the Cork passenger department, because of the decrease in traffic owing to the number of Corkmen coming up to Government Buildings and getting permanent positions, so that there would be no necessity for their continuing to travel up and down the line.  I put it to the Minister seriously that there is a big loophole in the amending Bill which will give the company the right to bring about removals in the personnel of the staffs and to prove to the satisfaction of the arbitrator, under the wording of the amending Bill, that a man can be dismissed owing to a decrease in traffic, whereas if he were left in his original position he would not become redundant and could not be dismissed. In that way they can bring about wholesale removals and can penalise people, and that very clearly can be done by leaving this word &ldquo;directly&rdquo; in the amending Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, we have an amending Bill.  I have a grave fear that exactly the same state of things that is said to operate from the original Act may be brought into operation as against the men by this amending Bill.  I think it is very often the case that in trying to put one thing right in legislation you make something else wrong.  I am inclined to agree that in connection with the wording of this clause a state of affairs may be found to exist in a very short time which this House does not now contemplate, and that an injustice may be done to the <Col N="1489" /> men who were supposed to be provided with compensation under the original Act.  I am not in any way supporting the original Act, nor, as the House is perfectly well aware, did I support it in any of its phases originally.  In this very question of compensation for the men it seemed to me at the time to go beyond what could fairly be claimed as against the amalgamated company. But in its wisdom the House passed that deliberately, and my fear is that in this Bill the Minister may go further than he intends in jeopardising the position of some railwaymen.  How far that would operate it is impossible at this stage to say, but obviously the things that can occur under the amending Bill are not things that the House would willingly lend itself to.  There is the danger of that.  On the other hand, the Minister will say that that is not intended, and the railway directors and management will also say that. But when you come to a close analysis of what will happen to a man when he goes before the arbitrator, you have already seen that cases have been brought before the arbitrator in which he was compelled to give decisions which raised criticism here.  Exactly the same thing may and probably will arise in connection with this Bill if the spirit of contention which has been fostered in connection with the whole railway system is to continue.  I ventured, on the Second Reading of this Bill, to support the suggestion that this whole question is one that ought in the first instance to have been dealt with by regulations, regulations which would be based on an agreement as between the railway company and the men, with the recognition on the one side that the Act intended a certain thing, and recognition on the other side that the Act did not intend a certain thing.  That agreement should have been come to. I am deadly afraid that the amending Bill as at present worded will raise further contention, which it is not to the interests of the country, or of the railwaymen, or even of the company itself, to have continued.</P>

      <P>A number of individuals have been called to headquarters here since the amalgamation <Col N="1490" /> came into operation, deliberately, I say, from Cork and elsewhere.  They are working mostly at Westland Row and Kingsbridge.  They were brought up here in some cases owing to the lack of work locally.  They are on temporary work in connection with the standard charges on railways, and it will be completed shortly.  These men are redundant, so far as they know at present.  What will happen if this Bill goes through, with this clause as it stands, is that they will be sent back to the depot from which they were brought where there is a decrease of traffic, and on these grounds they will be refused compensation to which otherwise they would be entitled.  Does the Minister deny that that cannot occur?  It will occur.  If the managers wish to save expense they can do that, and it will pay them to promote a clerk to a position in a station where there is decrease of traffic, so that they can then bring the case before the arbitrator and dismiss him on the ground of decrease of traffic.  If these wholesale removals start, as one may assume they will if the company is out to save money, I can promise the Minister that such a situation will not pass by without industrial action being taken.  I am not the kind of person to make threats.  I have, in fact, no authority to make threats, but I tell the Minister if this thing starts no one knows where it will end.  I agree with Deputy Hewat that there is an inducement to the company to start these wholesale removals, and that men who refuse to go can be dismissed for refusing to carry out instructions.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin opened by saying that having taken out the word &ldquo;solely,&rdquo; I should take out <Col N="1491" /> the word &ldquo;directly.&rdquo;  There is a big difference.  If people had to prove that their dismissal was due solely to amalgamation, you rule out Deputy Norton's fifty-fifty case and you also rule out the one per cent. case.  If a man showed that 99 per cent. of his dismissal was contributed to by amalgamation or absorption and that one per cent. was due to other causes, and further, if the words &ldquo;contributed to&rdquo; were taken out and the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; left in, he could get no compensation.  There is, as I say, a great deal of difference in showing that dismissal was due &ldquo;solely&rdquo; to amalgamation and that it was due &ldquo;directly.&rdquo;  The two things do not hang together.  It is not logical to take away the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; and leave in the word &ldquo;directly.&rdquo;  I have to appeal to the commonsense of the House as to whether that is fair.  I do not want to have any unfairness.  I could not understand from Deputy Hewat whether this is to be included in his whole lamentation, and whether this was one of the points in which he thinks that unfairness and hardship may occur to the employee.  I think that Deputy Hewat was simply making a general statement with regard to the whole Bill and that he took this amendment to advocate his case.</P>

      <P>We will come to that later.  Deputy Johnson says that this is another demonstration to railwaymen that something which they regard as a bar to their dismissal has been removed.  It is a bar to their dismissal that I never intended should be there. You could counter it by the remark that you were showing to the railway user that another means of heaping charges on his shoulders has been removed. It is for the House to make up its mind, between the railway user and the railway employees, whether keeping in the word &ldquo;directly&rdquo; is going to impose a hardship on them.  If there is a feeling that it is going to operate unduly on the employees the thing can be considered.  I say that it is right that if something other than amalgamation is directly the cause of dismissal there should not be compensation.  With regard to Deputy Davin's statement, I gather that these are the circumstances which he puts to me.  There is a clerk, apparently, operating at a place where it cannot be shown that there is a decrease in traffic.  That clerk is removed.</P>

Surely not by taking out the word &ldquo;directly.&rdquo;  It has to be met in some other way.  When Deputy Davin convinces the House that that is an ordinary sort of thing to occur under amalgamation, he may have grounds for bringing in an amendment to some other section, but it is not going to be done by the removal of the word &ldquo;directly.&rdquo;  If the amendment is put as it is, namely, to delete the words &ldquo;directly&rdquo; and &ldquo;solely,&rdquo; and if it be defeated, it may not be possible to take out the words &ldquo;and solely.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>What does the Minister understand to be the force of this word &ldquo;directly&rdquo;?  Would he compare <Col N="1494" /> the words &ldquo;due to&rdquo; and &ldquo;directly&rdquo;?  Some Deputies discuss and argue this as if &ldquo;directly&rdquo; meant &ldquo;wholly.&rdquo;  It does not seem to me that the word has much real force.  The most that can be put into it is that amalgamation is the real cause of dismissal. I think it would read as strongly if it were to read &ldquo;due to&rdquo; amalgamation apart from &ldquo;solely.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to make a point somewhat similar to that of Deputy Thrift.  I would ask the House to consider this position.  The Minister has agreed to delete the words which are really of value in the draft original, to presume the end that was sought for in the beginning, that is, the words &ldquo;solely to&rdquo; or &ldquo;contributed to.&rdquo; With these words deleted, what is the value from the Minister's point of view of the word &ldquo;directly&rdquo; and these other words &ldquo;and not caused by the decrease of traffic, etc&rdquo;?  I suggest to the Minister that all that he has claimed as desirable can be effected by letting this section and Section 4 read like this:&mdash;&ldquo;whether before or after the passing of this Act on account of his services having become unnecessary in consequence of changes of administration due to amalgamation and absorption of the company affected by or under the Principal Act.&rdquo;  Once the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; or the words &ldquo;or contributed to&rdquo; are taken away, the value of these other phrases are of no effect in securing the ends sought for by the Minister.  If you leave them in, however, there is a direct handicap placed upon the applicant for compensation.  In the first instance, it is for him to prove to the arbitrator that his dismissal is caused by something different from amalgamation and absorption, that is to say, not merely due to amalgamation and absorption, but in a special way due to them.  That is the only value of the word &ldquo;directly.&rdquo;  There is a certain onus on the applicant to show that there is direct connection, and opportunity is given to the company to show that the dismissal is only indirectly caused.  If the company can do that and can show that there is an indirect cause but not a direct cause, then there is no compensation due.  Further, these <Col N="1495" /> other words are difficulties placed in the way of the applicant as between the arbitrator and the company which the Minister, by inference, admits is not intended, because these words &ldquo;contributed to&rdquo; are deleted.  I submit that the end he is now seeking, having deleted these weighty words, can be sought by leaving the section to read, &ldquo;due directly to amalgamation.&rdquo;</P>

I would like the Minister to point out what he means to gain by the use of this word &ldquo;directly.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is that balance of which Deputy Johnson spoke.  If you keep in the words &ldquo;and solely&rdquo; and &ldquo;contributed to&rdquo; there is a certain thing achieved.  If we drop out the words &ldquo;and solely&rdquo; and not the words &ldquo;contributed to&rdquo; you have <Col N="1496" /> not avoided what was aimed at when both were in.  The House has voted that the words &ldquo;caused by, etc.,&rdquo; should be kept in.  I say that the balance to that on the other side is &ldquo;due directly to amalgamation.&rdquo;  The words &ldquo;and solely&rdquo; are balanced by the words &ldquo;contributed to,&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;directly&rdquo; is balanced by the words &ldquo;caused by&rdquo; these various things. We have voted against an amendment to delete those things, and I hold that the complementary vote is that the word &ldquo;directly&rdquo; should be kept in. Deputy Thrift puts in a difficult point. He asks what is the meaning of the word &ldquo;directly.&rdquo;  I can only put it to him in the opposite way.  Would he envisage the section if it were put in this way: &ldquo;Due directly to, or indirectly to,&rdquo; or &ldquo;due in any way to&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there should be something more in the phrase than if &ldquo;due directly to or indirectly to.&rdquo;  Supposing we left out &ldquo;directly to&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;due indirectly to,&rdquo; and then went on to say, &ldquo;and not caused by these things.&rdquo;  I say that there is tremendous force in the insertion of the word &ldquo;indirectly.&rdquo;  I cannot, as I say, explain the word &ldquo;directly.&rdquo; All I can do is to call attention to the opposite side of it.  Is it the intention of the House if amalgamation in any form be an indirect cause of a man's dismissal that then there should be compensation payable?  If that be the case, then there is a case for striking out the word &ldquo;directly.&rdquo;  I do not see a tremendous amount of value in the word &ldquo;directly,&rdquo; but I think it is a balance to the section that we have already voted upon and that it should he retained.  I think if we have voted that these words should be put out. and that you then have the phrase &ldquo;due directly to&rdquo; or &ldquo;solely to,&rdquo; weakened by the dropping of the word &ldquo;solely,&rdquo; and further weakened by the dropping of the word &ldquo;directly,&rdquo; you would have taken away pretty well all the rights to protection of the railway user.  If there is amalgamation and a man is dismissed, you would be more or less assuming that the latter was the cause of the former, and you would <Col N="1497" /> give him compensation.  There is very much winding about this particular word.  I think there is a certain value in it, but I do not think there is any of the terrors that Deputy Johnson sees in it, certainly nothing calling for any such phrase as heading for disaster or introducing industrial action or things of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>What we have been told is that this is heading for disaster.  It is by no means heading for disaster, but it is heading definitely and clearly for a fair position as between the railway user and the railway employee.  There is no intention of prejudicing the railway employee in any way further than what could have happened to him prior to amalgamation. There is an attempt being made to give compensation where amalgamation is shown to be the cause of a man's dismissal.  I would like Deputy Thrift to try to bring his point down to this one case, and give an indication as to whether, for instance, he thinks that the introduction of the word &ldquo;directly&rdquo; is going to impose a hardship on the railway employee.  I would like to hear the Deputy's argument on that.  He will probably answer that he does not understand the value of the word &ldquo;directly.&rdquo;</P>

I cite the case of a porter at Hazelhatch with 10 years' service shifted to Dublin on promotion, and promotion only in the sense that he would get the wage of the industrial area in Dublin as against the wage of the rural area.  He has to go or the company can do the other thing with him if he refuses his promotion, or alleged promotion.  There is a decrease of the passenger traffic at the Kings-bridge&mdash;&mdash;</P>
