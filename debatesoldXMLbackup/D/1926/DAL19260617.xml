      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state why drainage schemes in Tyrellspass and Rochfortbridge districts, Westmeath, adopted by the Westmeath County Council more than three months ago, have not been started by the Board of Works; and if he will give instructions to have this necessary work carried out immediately and so relieve the distress prevailing in those districts amongst the unemployed.</P>

      <P>A petition for the formation of a drainage district in the neighbourhood of Tyrellspass and Rochfortbridge, Co. Westmeath, under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, has been received by the Commissioners of Public Works.  An inspection by one of their engineers will be made when staff is available.

Coy., 2nd Battalion, Athlone Brigade, and that he also took part in Cornafulla ambush; that he joined the National Army on March 3rd, 1922, was wounded outside Athlone on July 24th, 1922, and was discharged unfit for service on November 27th, 1923; and whether in view of this he will have this case reinvestigated with a view to granting him a pension under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924.</P>

I am not aware of his services in the Volunteers prior to his joining the National Army on the 2nd March, 1922, but I am aware that he <Col N="1243" /> was demobilised from the latter force &ldquo;medically unfit&rdquo; on the 27th November, 1923.  He has now submitted particulars of service purporting to be additional evidence in support of his claim to a certificate.

A suggestion was made to the Committee by the legal adviser to the Harbour Board to have an amendment inserted which would give the Harbour Commissioners <Col N="1250" /> discretion to pay the present Secretary, who is 84 years of age, a pension.  The Committee thought it was not a matter for them, and I understand that the legal adviser is in consultation with the Limerick Deputies with a view to bringing the matter forward.

No substantial amendment could be proposed after the Report Stage.  If to-morrow a further amendment were proposed it would, according to Standing Orders for Private Bills, have to be sent back to the Committee if the Chair thought the amendment was one of substance.

      <P>Not now.  That is a question which could have arisen in the first instance.  When a Joint Committee is being asked for, a motion is made to the effect &ldquo;That it is expedient that a Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas, &amp;c., &amp;c., should be set up.&rdquo;  When that motion has been adopted a message is sent to the Seanad asking for their concurrence, and when the concurrence of the Seanad has been obtained a formal motion such as is now before the Dáil is made to set up the Committee and to select the members who are to represent the Dáil on the Joint Committee.  Obviously only one opportunity therefore arises to discuss the matter of setting up the Committee. The Deputy's point is one which could have arisen before but which cannot be raised now.</P>

      <P>Is it open to discuss the question as to why we should depart from Standing Order 115c? That says, in effect, that the Dáil shall appoint representatives on such Joint Committee.  The President proposes to leave power to appoint to the Committee of Selection.  While it is desirable that the Committee of Selection should recommend these representatives to the Dáil, the Dáil should have an opportunity of discussing, and actually appointing, its own representatives.  In a small Committee like this of only three it is inevitable that some Party will be unrepresented.  It ought to be possible for that Party to make a protest, and it should be for the Dáil as a whole, and not for the Committee of Selection, to decide who are the three best representatives for this important work.  The disqualification of any class of citizen from membership of the Oireachtas is very serious and very important, and I hold that on this matter we should stick to the established procedure in the Standing Order.  Let the Selection Committee make recommendations to us by all <Col N="1254" /> means, but let the Dáil have the last word in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Dáil must have the last word in all matters of this kind.  The Committee of Selection can only nominate members to serve on the Committee.  Normally, their report is adopted without question, but at least in one case within my recollection exception has been taken to a nomination made by the Committee of Selection.  The procedure adopted then was to refer the matter back to the Committee of Selection.  In this case and in every other case of a similar kind, the Committee of Selection must report to the Dáil and the Dáil can deal with the report as it pleases.  The last word is with the Dáil in all cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) (Amendment) Bill. The provisions of this amending Bill have to be looked at in relation to the principal Act, when it will be seen that in reality there are only two changes proposed and those are with regard to the amounts that may be guaranteed. Originally £1,000,000 was set aside as a possible fund to be called on for the giving of guarantees.  That was divided as between the two main sections of the Act.  Three-quarters of a million might be guaranteed under one section and one-quarter of a million under the other.  The second provision has not been called on, to any extent, and it is accordingly proposed to have the principal Act amended so as to re-allocate that original million, making, now, provision for £900,000 under Section 1 and £100,000 under Section 2.  The only reason for that is what I have remarked, that applications to no great extent have come in under Section 2. It is proposed, therefore, to have the main amount of money allocated to the first section of the 1924 Act.  Outside that the Bill merely carries the existing Act on for a further year.  It is only recently that a decision was come to with regard to the continuance of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About last Christmas this matter arose, in a peculiar way, for decision. At that time I felt that while the results of the Act had been disappointing, the number of applications received had shown, definitely, a necessity for some provision of this sort; but it appeared to me that whatever facilities were required were likely to be met in another way.  Considering the slacking off in the applications which had just occurred about that time, I had pretty well come to the conclusion not to ask the Dáil to extend this Act any further.  It may seem that I was coming to that conclusion <Col N="1257" /> very much earlier than was required by the point of time at which the present Act would expire, but the matter came for decision in this way. There was a company being started &mdash;the Industrial Trust Company.  Two of the members of the Advisory Committee, under the Trade Loans Act, were to be associated with that, and I was faced with the difficulty, there and then, of finding a new Advisory Committee, even for the running out period of the 1925 Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  The point had been raised even before that when one of the members of the Committee, Mr. Dowdall, in May, 1925, decided that his own business commitments were so large and the drain upon his time required by attention to the Committee's work was so great, that he would have to resign from the Advisory Committee.  When he proffered his resignation in May, 1925, I pressed him very strongly to continue as a member of the Committee, until such time as I could discover somebody who was willing to take his place, and to that he agreed.  In December last year Mr. Dowdall, for some different reasons, raised the question of his resignation again and did, in fact, send in his resignation.  The other two members of the Committee, Mr. Smith-Gordon and Mr. Telford, the Chairman, were also very anxious at that period to retire.  They put the point to me in this way: that if they continued to act as members of the Advisory Committee under the Trade Loans Act and were, also, associated, as they were going to be, in the new year, with the new company, it might put me in an invidious position afterwards if there was any criticism made of their continuing to act in this dual capacity.  That led, at any rate, to a consideration of the continuance of this or any similar Act.</P>
    <P>I reviewed the circumstances at that time and made up my mind, as I say, that there was no necessity to have the Act continued for another year.  Having my mind fairly clear on that point I approached Mr. Telford and Mr. Smith-Gordon, and put it to them that inasmuch as fresh applications did not seem to be coming in, in any great number, and seeing that already they were seized of the facts of the applications which had come before them and that <Col N="1258" /> the setting up of the new Committee would necessitate delay and would mean the holding up of applications in process of being considered, and seeing that it had been determined not to continue the Act beyond July this year&mdash; on these grounds I asked them to reconsider the decision they had pressed upon me on several occasions with regard to their resignation.  It was with a certain amount of reluctance that the two gentlemen agreed to act on the Committee.  The position at the moment is that I am without an Advisory Committee.  The Advisory Committee has broken up.  Both Mr. Telford and Mr. Smith-Gordon have resigned, and the fact that they did not resign or were not allowed to resign last December, when they pressed they should be allowed to do so, was entirely due to me.  My action is explainable for the reason I have given.</P>
    <P>I insist at some length on this, because a discussion in the Seanad yesterday, and in the Dáil on an earlier occasion, if nothing else, must have revealed to Deputies that these two gentlemen have been criticised for continuing to act on the Advisory Committee while being associated with the Industrial Development Company.  If there is blame attached to anybody for that it must attach to me alone.  I insisted that they should stay on, and was barely able to convince them by the reasons that I put forward that they should remain on. No matter what discussions we may have afterwards with regard to this Bill or to certain incidents, or one transaction that has been unfairly criticised arising out of the operations of the Act, I would ask the Dáil to be quite clear about the position that these two gentlemen occupied.  These positions have been very onerous and the work has been very responsible.  They have given a tremendous amount of their time to the investigation of the applications that came before them. They have neglected their own business in order to give their attention and experience to the working of this Act.  I feel that I should here make that statement with regard to them and I ask the Dáil to agree with me that some recogtion is due to the members of that Committee for the very onerous and responsible <Col N="1259" /> work which they undertook without fee or reward in helping a Department of State to carry out an Act which was brought forward in the best interests of the State and with the object of getting the conditions of unemployment bettered.</P>
    <P>I am at the moment without an Advisory Committee, and as a result of the abuse that has been poured around certain people recently, I even hesitate to approach anybody with regard to acting on this Advisory Committee for the future until I see what action the Dáil may take this day with regard to the Bill or, apart from the Bill altogether, until I discover if this House is sufficiently aware of the services rendered by these two gentlemen and is willing to award them some recognition of their services.  If that is done, then I can, with a certain amount of hope, approach other men of capacity and experience and ask them to act in the same position, if this Bill, renewing the expiring Act, be passed.  There has been one transaction under this Bill very definitely criticised, and so far as I know there has been no word of criticism of the Advisory Committee nor, as I had to point out yesterday, so far as I know, has there been any criticism of the National Land Bank as a bank, for any part it may have had in the particular transaction to which I refer. But there has been criticism of the transaction; and on that particular transaction, inasmuch as it is relevant to the continuance of this Act.  I wish to make certain references.  The first criticism is contained in the Appropriation Accounts for the year 1924-25, in paragraph 91, where the Auditor-General refers, under the head of Vote 65&mdash;National Land Bank, Limited&mdash;to a certain transaction.  It was in connection with the loan granted to Alesbury's, of Edenderry, and certain remarks were made with regard to that transaction, finishing with this: &ldquo;In view of the limitations for guarantees of loans imposed by Section 1 of the Act, I did not consider that the guarantee in this case came within its terms, and I have deemed it necessary to call attention to it in my report.&rdquo; The Public Accounts Committee have <Col N="1260" /> discussed the same transaction and they have issued an interim report dealing with it.  Unfortunately I do not think that the interim report can properly be discussed in the absence of the evidence.  There has not been produced the evidence on which this interim report is based, and I have hopes that at some time before the Dáil rises we shall have an opportunity of seeing the evidence on which this interim report is based so that we may come to a conclusion as to whether and in fact to what extent the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee should be accepted.  There are, as far as I am concerned at the moment, three recommendations which have touched on this Bill or the continuance of the expiring Act, and they are given in paragraphs 14, 18 and 19 in the interim report.  Paragraph 19 refers to the difficulty about defining what is &ldquo;a capital undertaking,&rdquo; and the last three lines of the report state that &ldquo;the Committee has been led to the conclusion that the expression &lsquo;a capital undertaking&rsquo; used in the section ought to be more clearly defined than it is in Section 8 of the Act.&rdquo;  As I say, I have not the evidence upon which that report of that Committee was based.  But an official of my Department attended for the purpose of giving evidence, and I did inquire from him as to what facts had been put before the Committee.</P>
    <P>I gathered that a representative of the Auditor-General's Department, in giving evidence before the Committee, asserted that pretty well nearly every economist had a different interpretation of what &ldquo;a capital undertaking&rdquo; meant. And apparently the Auditor-General's Department has some interpretation of its own upon which this conclusion set out in paragraph 91 of the Appropriation Accounts is based.  Now we have that statement that pretty nearly every economist has an interpretation of his own, and we are asked for the purpose of this Act to define better what a capital undertaking means.  I have no dislike for a better definition, but I hope that the Committee's report does not mean that I am to bring forward a better definition.  If there is any definition <Col N="1261" /> brought forward at the Committee Stage, or if there is a variety of definitions, we can have them considered and have the best one chosen and put into the Bill.  With that I leave paragraph 19.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 18 of the Public Accounts Committee's interim report states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Committee considers that the creation of a liability in front of a State guarantee is not desirable and should not be repeated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear as to what is the effect of the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee presented in this report, laid on the Table of this House and afterwards discussed. Is it that next year if some guarantee when given is seen to have involved the creation of a State guarantee which is postponed for some prior liability, I am to be held up to criticism and told: &ldquo;Well, the Public Accounts Committee called your attention to that last year and it should not have been done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that is to be the effect of the recommendation I think we should have it more clearly before us.  If there is anybody here who thinks the recommendation should be adopted, then further amendment of the Bill should be moved so as to make it quite rigid that where a guarantee is requested in circumstances where there is a liability in front of a State guarantee, that loan should not be guaranteed.  I would like to warn the House that if that is put in the effects of the Act are going to be very seriously limited.</P>
    <P>I may say that is the practice of the Advisory Committee.  That is what they aim at.  I do not know, as regards cases in which guarantees have been given, that there has been more than one other in addition to the Alesbury case in which there was a liability which was prior to the State guarantee. I believe there is one other case which is under consideration in which that might turn out to be so.  That is definitely the aim, object and practice of the Advisory Committee, and the two Departments are in accord with that. I ask the House to hesitate before they put that into the Bill as a rigid rule.  I should say the case other than the Alesbury case in which that rule was not <Col N="1262" /> adhered to is one of the best guarantees that has been given, and the State's secondary liability by way of guarantee is quite well protected even though there be this other liability in front of it.</P>
    <P>In so far as this report of the Public Accounts Committee is to be taken as being a recommendation, a very definite recommendation, that something is not desirable and should not be repeated, I agree it is not desirable, and I agree it is not the practice.  In every case in which it has been found possible we have always tried to get the State as the first charge; but it is not always possible, and, if other applications are to be ruled out because that is not possible, then the effect of that paragraph on the working of the Act is going to be rather serious.</P>

      <P>I have stated the number of cases in which actual guarantees were given to date.  There are only two cases in which it could be found that that rule had not been adhered to, Alesbury's being one and there being one other case.  But if I take the number of applications which come in and in which we are faced definitely with this proposal that we are asked to guarantee money to a concern where there is already some liability, and if we are asked to refuse applications simply for that reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is brought down to that, then the Alesbury case is the only one that would come in.  The other case is outside that.  On the other hand, I want to put it to the House in this fashion: even now, with the creation of a liability in front of a State guarantee, is there to be any advertence to the amount of the new liability that is created prior to the State guarantee? Is it to be that if there are any <Col N="1263" /> brought in, then the application should not be granted, or are we going to have a sum fixed beyond which one may not proceed with the application?  Those are points that will arise again on Committee Stage, but unless there be an amendment brought in of a certain type and inserted in the Bill I would like to give notice that I do not consider myself bound merely by this recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee in the carrying out of the Act next year.</P>
      <P>The third point is in paragraph 14 of the Report:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Committee considers that as this question directly affected the Exchequer, the submission of the case to the Attorney-General ought to have been made through the Department of Finance in order that that Department, as the central financial authority, might be fully informed on the matter and given an opportunity of making any observations thereon.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What that means in relation to the Alesbury case I do not know, unless it be this: that the Minister for Industry and Commerce put to the Attorney-General for his opinion a statement of a case and secured the Attorney-General's ruling in his favour; but if the Minister for Finance had put a statement of the case to the Attorney-General, the Attorney-General's opinion would have been adverse.  If that is what it means, it indicates that I put a statement of the case to the Attorney-General which was not fair. I would like some member of the Public Accounts Committee to state later whether that is the meaning to be taken from that paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must get back to the Auditor-General's report, and certain other remarks that have been made following on it.  The Auditor-General simply states: &ldquo;I did not consider that the guarantee in this case came within its terms and I have deemed it necessary to call attention to it in my report.&rdquo; The Auditor-General can report in any way he pleases; there can be no quarrelling with that.  But coming here later after the Auditor-General's report I feel I have a right to add in <Col N="1264" /> certain other facts which were not adverted to in the Auditor-General's report, and to which public attention was not called in a similar way or with the same publicity as was given by this particular paragraph in the Appropriation Accounts for the year 1924-25.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in the Auditor-General's report that the Attorney-General's opinion was obtained on the only matter that it was thought fit to refer to the Attorney-General, and the only matter which the Auditor-General thought fit to criticise&mdash;that was on the legal point.  Personally, I feel there would be a full presentation of the facts if the Auditor-General's report had stated: &ldquo;Although the Department concerned fortified itself with the opinion of the Attorney-General, I still do not consider that the guarantee came within its terms and I have deemed it necessary to call attention to it in my report.&rdquo;  I think the public has not got a fair presentation of the case until that addition is made to what the Auditor-General has reported.</P>
    <P>I am informed again that an official of the Auditor-General's Department, in giving evidence before the Public Accounts Committee, made two statements: one was that the only files which the Auditor-General had a right to call for were the files of the Accounting Officer, that the Accounting Officer was the Secretary to the Department of Finance, and then I am told&mdash;I can be corrected in this&mdash;that this statement was made, that &ldquo;on the files submitted to me I did not see the reference of the case to the Attorney-General or a copy of the Attorney-General's opinion.&rdquo;  If that was not on the files submitted to the Auditor-General there is a serious lapse from the files of the Department of Finance and I cannot believe that that was not on the file, because on a particular date, having received the Attorney-General's opinion, I forwarded to the Department of Finance a letter which covered the statement of the case as made to the Attorney-General, having below it a copy of the Attorney-General's opinion.  That was dispatched to the Department of Finance on 22nd January, 1925, and that covering letter of mine, plus the attachment&mdash;the statement of the case to the <Col N="1265" /> Attorney-General and the Attorney-General's opinion&mdash;must necessarily have been on the Department of Finance's files.  Whether it was or not can be determined later.  However, as I say, the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Department was responsible, I believe, in the evidence before the Public Accounts Committee, for the statement that the files submitted from the Department of Finance did not contain the reference of the case to the Attorney-General or the Attorney-General's opinion.</P>
    <P>I may say in passing that notwithstanding the Auditor-General's comment as given in paragraph 91 of this report, the present Attorney-General is still of the opinion that the case did clearly come within the terms of the Act, and he agreed with his predecessor, who signed to that effect in 1925. The official of the Auditor-General's Department is reported to me as having said further that for the Auditor-General to have made any remark with regard to the Attorney-General's opinion would, in fact, have meant this, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General was sheltering behind the Attorney-General. That seems to me to be quite a misunderstanding of the point that was expressed by my own departmental officials in giving evidence before the Public Accounts Committee.  There the point was made that a full presentation of the case required simply a statement that the Attorney-General's opinion had been sought and agreed that the case came within the Act.  There was no question of sheltering behind the Attorney-General in the sense of saying &ldquo;That ends it as far as we are concerned.&rdquo; The Auditor-General could have gone on to remark: &ldquo;notwithstanding this, I am still of opinion,&rdquo; and I repeat again that the public have not got a fair presentation of the facts as long as the fact of the reference to the Attorney-General and his opinion as a favourable one is not given.</P>
    <P>However, on that we get paragraph 14, which states that the Committee is of opinion that the submission of the case should have been made through the Department of Finance. First of all, the question, I do not think, directly concerned the Exchequer &mdash;indirectly it did.  If anything that <Col N="1266" /> concerns the Exchequer is to be put up through the Department of Finance, then it means the scrapping of Government departments, leaving one super-department and only one single department in the State.  If matters that are directly connected with the Exchequer are in every case, no matter what the special point be&mdash;legal point or otherwise&mdash;to be put up through the Department of Finance, and they are to be the Department to deal with it, then the Departments of State can be definitely coalesced into one.</P>
    <P>What was the question referred to the Attorney-General?  It was not a question as to the amount of money that should be given&mdash;the amount of money that the assets of the firm seemed to guarantee&mdash;nothing of that sort.  That was a matter that arose later and was considered in the departments, and all the views of the departments were in agreement about it.  The single point that arose was a legal opinion: did something come within the terms of the Act, and it arose on Section 1 of the Act of 1924.  Section 1 states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after consultation with an advisory committee nominated by him in conjunction with the Minister for Finance for the purpose of this section, is satisfied that the proceeds of any loan proposed to be raised ... are to be applied towards or in connection with the carrying out of any capital undertaking....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the point that is questioned.  It is: &ldquo;If the Minister for Industry and Commerce ... is satisfied.&rdquo;  Yet I am told by the Public Accounts Committee that the reference of that legal point for my satisfaction to the Attorney-General should have been made by the Department of Finance.  I wonder had the Public Accounts Committee the terms of the Act before them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after consultation with an Advisory Committee ... is satisfied that the proceeds of any loan proposed to be raised ... are to be applied towards, or in connection with the carrying out of any capital undertaking ... the Minister for Industry and Commerce may guarantee in such manner and form and on such terms and conditions as he shall think proper subject to the limitations hereinafter imposed and subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance, the repayment of the principal of such loan....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When it comes to the guaranteeing it is subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance, but as to the question are the proceeds of any loan going to be applied towards the carrying out of any capital undertaking, I am the only person to be satisfied, according to the Act, and not being satisfied myself I consult the only legal opinion open to me and I get a statement that this is within the terms of the Act, and the present Attorney-General agrees with that view.  It was Deputy Cooper, I think, who, in the Public Accounts Committee, raised the point, had the Auditor-General's department any legal officer attached to it, and I think the answer was &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>No answer was given.  Deputy Johnson ruled that it was not a matter for the Public Accounts Committee to discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather understood that Deputy Johnson, in reply, said that if he had not legal opinion he could always get it, and I took the implication to be that there was agreement in the Public Accounts Committee on what, I think, is a well-known fact, that there is no legal officer attached to the Auditor-General's department. It is a loan made under Section 1 of that Act that is in question. The only point that is questioned is: was it within the terms of the Act or not?  I, as the person to be satisfied, took the opinion of the Attorney-General, and the Attorney-General said <Col N="1268" /> he had no doubt about it.  The Public Accounts Committee now recommend that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As this question directly affected the Exchequer the submission of the case to the Attorney-General ought to have been made through the Department of Finance in order that that Department, as the central financial authority, might be fully informed on the matter and given an opportunity of making any observations thereon.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact the Department of Finance afterwards got the reference of the case to the Attorney-General and his opinion, and they had then their chance of making any observations.  If they considered that the presentation of the case to the Attorney-General was not fair there was plenty of time.  The guarantee had not been given.  There had been no expression of my willingness to give a guarantee at that period, because we then had to discuss and get our minds clear on the further responsibilities that were on us beyond the legal point.  That is to say, as a business proposition.  The Public Accounts Committee have a certain reference to that also.  Again I say, they will have to make up their minds is this Act going to be carried on with the present machinery or is some other machinery going to be suggested.  The machinery, so far as a business proposition is concerned, is that it is first investigated by the Advisory Committee.  If they pass it it comes to me.  I make certain investigations and inform myself in various ways and pass judgment upon it, and if it passes the Advisory Committee and passes me it goes on to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>He looks at it.  He may turn it down completely, or he may say that the loan may be guaranteed subject to certain conditions and with certain limitations and all the rest put upon it. This, as a business proposition, passed the Advisory Committee, passed my Department and the Department of Finance.  If it was not a business proposition which should have passed, then some other machinery has to be got for avoiding that type of proposition passing in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two things at issue in this. <Col N="1269" /> There is a legal question, and on that I make no complaint about anyone passing any judgment he likes as long as he makes a full presentation of the case and states the Attorney-General's opinion was taken.  As far as the legal opinion is concerned the Department took every step they could have taken to clear up the position.  Anyone can come after that and say: &ldquo;I do not care what steps were taken.  I do not care anything about the Attorney-General's opinion.  I am still of opinion it is not within the terms of the Act.&rdquo; that can be said and there can be no complaint.  But when this report, as it does by implication, refers to the whole matter as a business proposition, that is then the issue: was it a sound business proposition to have guaranteed? The machinery for getting that is very cumbersome.  I suppose there is hardly a Deputy who has not some time complained to me of the delay that occurs through the complete investigation of these cases.  The machinery is there, and the Advisory Committee appointed in a certain way, making the preliminary investigation generally, if you take the run of the cases, have to send the application back three or four times to get the case put up and full information supplied on which the Committee can form its judgment. That is presented to me and afterwards to the Minister for Finance.  Only after it has got over all these obstacles does intimation with regard to guarantee issue.</P>
    <P>The report of the Public Accounts Committee therefore raises three very serious points with regard to this.  As to the minor point of definition of &ldquo;capital undertaking,&rdquo; if that can be given and put up in a way to satisfy the House, and I might be allowed to say of any definition proposed how I think it is going to affect the working of the Act, I do not mind then what definition we get, and there may be an agreed definition if we can get one. The second point is, what is referred to in Section 18.  I would ask, if that is considered to be a sound recommendation, that it should be brought in as an amendment in some section of the Bill, so that we can know where we are with regard to it.  There is a third <Col N="1270" /> point with which I entirely disagree, and I again announce publicly that I will not, unless it be accepted by a vote of this House, accept what is stated in paragraph 14 as a guidance to me in the future, with regard to this case or with regard to Government business generally.  If it is put forward here relevant to this Bill in a particular form and accepted as an amendment, then I am bound to accept it, but simply because it appears in this report I do not intend to accept it.  If the Public Accounts Committee consider and can get this House to agree that propositions are being passed which are not good business propositions, then the whole machinery of the Act is called into question and it is for the Committee again to decide what better machinery they can evolve and how the object of this Act can be achieved; that is, the guaranteeing of money to industries likely to create employment, and combine that with the safeguarding of the public purse. That is the object of the Act: that money should be given in a certain way and, at the same time, certain precautions taken to see that the money is not wasted.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this report of the Public Accounts Committee and I have very definitely stated the basis on which I am discussing it.  Information is conveyed to me; it may be incorrectly reported, as I cannot say that an official's memory is so good as to bring back in every detail what has been suggested at the Committee.  If some of my references are wrong they can be corrected.  I have to discuss this on the evidence before me, on what came to me from my Departmental sources.  That information may be accurate or inaccurate in detail, but it can be corrected.  But I hope an opportunity will be given to discuss the report of the Public Accounts Committee with the evidence on which it was based apart from this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in very great difficulty because the Minister's statement raises quite a number of questions of the utmost importance. We are asked to give a Second Reading to a proposal to extend the Trade <Col N="1271" /> Loans (Guarantee) Act of 1924 and the amending Act, and we are asked, inferentially, to discuss a paragraph in the Comptroller and Auditor-General's report in the Appropriation Accounts of 1924-25.  We are also to discuss the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, his relations to the House, the Minister's relations to the House as against the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and the part played by the Public Accounts Committee in legislative and financial procedure. That constitutes rather a big order to be taken with little preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Were the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor-General called into question at all by the Minister?  I do not think they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so, but not in so many words.  I think the Minister criticised the action of the Comptroller and Auditor-General here, and yesterday in the Seanad, to some extent.  I think he has done that without a clear understanding of the constitutional position that that officer holds.  Let me say, first, with regard to the position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, that while not technically, as you ruled some days ago, a civil servant, he is a public servant, and in that way he is not in a position to answer for himself in this House or in public. Consequently I think it may be said to devolve on the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee to speak for him in a matter that affects his duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having given some thought to this question for a year or two, and having taken account of the position of that officer as created and as it has developed in England, and in view of the fact&mdash;this is very important&mdash;that we deliberately took over the procedure and practice of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and his Department from the British procedure and practice, I say that the position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General ought to be very carefully safeguarded by the House, and his judgments, if they are to be called judgments, or his reports, and the method of arriving at these reports, while capable of discussion and capable of being answered and argued <Col N="1272" /> about by the appropriate Departments, ought to be considered very much in the way that a judgment of a court is considered.  That is to say, that the form of a judgment of a judge would not be discussable in this House, and the form in which the Comptroller and Auditor-General presents his report to the Dáil, as he is required to do by law and by the character of his office, should not be subjected to criticism in this House.  I am now speaking of the form.  The practice in the matter is easily ascertained.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General is required to examine the Appropriation Accounts.  His position is that of a check on behalf of the Dáil, over the Ministry and the Departments in respect of State finances, and I think it is very important that we should leave that officer the freest possible discretion in regard to the manner in which he makes his report upon these finances.  Particularly I think that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should not be subject to criticism by a Minister (especially if, as in this case, he is the Minister of a Department who is being criticised) in the Seanad, when it was suggested that the Comptroller and Auditor-General had failed to fulfil his duty&mdash;that is to say, that he had made a report which is not a full statement of the facts. The Minister's statement, as quoted, is: &ldquo;He might be disposed to quarrel with the report of the Auditor-General, but would simply make the comments that it would be better if the Auditor-General, in making reports, would state the full facts.  There was nothing to prevent the Auditor-General from writing in that the Attorney-General had ruled in a certain way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the suggestion that the full facts had not been stated is very like a statement that a judgment of a Judge of the Supreme Court was couched in faulty language or that the judge had not summed up correctly and accurately. It may be said that that is placing the Auditor-General in a position which is above criticism, but I do not hesitate to place the Auditor-General in a position equivalent to that of a judge in regard to criticism in this House.  The Auditor-General reports to the House, and, following practice, the <Col N="1273" /> House, for the better carrying out of its functions as the supreme financial authority over State funds, refers that report for examination and elucidation to a committee of the House, the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Committee of Public Accounts would not, I think, presume to criticise the Auditor-General as to the language that he uses, or even the sins of omission or of commission which it might think the Auditor-General was responsible for.  The Committee would recognise that the terms under which that officer was appointed are such as to place him in a peculiarly independent position, and it is very necessary that he should be recognised as being in that position.</P>
    <P>The procedure in regard to the Auditor-General's report is, as it is known by those who have followed the subject, that the Committee of Public Accounts makes a report to the House, but so far as to its being authoritative in the sense of having the effect of law, that is, of course, out of the question.  It is taken as a guide, if it is accepted by the Departments. The recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts are subject to comment by the Department of Finance. If the Department of Finance dissents from any recommendations, it states the grounds of its dissent, and finally, if there can be no agreement, the matter is left for the decision of the House. In practice, between the discussions of the Committee of Public Accounts and the comments of the Department of Finance, a general understanding of procedure in regard to expenditure is arrived at.  But if the Minister, notwithstanding anything that has been said by the Committee of Public Accounts, is going to follow a certain course, the report of this Committee can have no authoritative effect upon the Minister's action, which would be done in view of the House and in face of the fact that the Committee has reported to the House in a certain direction. So far as that goes, the Minister can still consider himself merely responsible to the House for his transactions as a member of the Executive Council. I think, too, that there is some error in the view that the Minister seems to have adopted in regard to the position of the Attorney-General.  The Minister is <Col N="1274" /> quoted as having said in the Seanad yesterday: &ldquo;There was nothing to prevent the Auditor-General from writing in that the Attorney-General had ruled in a certain way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will assume that the Minister did not really mean that an opinion of the Attorney-General was in any sense a ruling.  Certainly the view of the Committee of Public Accounts, if I understand it, would be that an opinion of the Attorney-General, or any other opinion on a legal matter, would not and should not bind the Comptroller and Auditor-General in making a report upon any matter affecting finance, because the position is that if the Minister in this case or, in the case of the ordinary accounts, the accounting officer of the Department, could spend money in a particular direction, even with the sanction of the Department of Finance on the authority of the Attorney-General's opinion, we might as well dismiss any thought of having an auditor, and the control of the House over finance might be very largely nullified. The Act setting up this Audit Department sets it forth that &ldquo;the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall certify and report upon the same&rdquo;&mdash; that is, the Appropriation Accounts&mdash;&ldquo;with reference to the Acts of Parliament under the authority of which such issues may have been directed.&rdquo;  Further: &ldquo;Every Appropriation Account shall be examined by the Comptroller and Auditor-General on behalf of the Dáil, and in the examination of such accounts the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall ascertain whether the money expended has been applied to the purpose or purposes for which such grant was intended to provide.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further: &ldquo;In all reports as aforesaid, he shall call attention to every case in which it may appear to him&rdquo;&mdash; there is no question of legal opinion in the matter having to be sought, or not even any suggestion that it might be desirable in certain cases that he should seek legal opinion&mdash;&ldquo;that a grant was for any other reason&rdquo;&mdash;that is after mentioning certain reasons&mdash;&ldquo;not properly chargeable against the grant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Lest there might be any misunderstanding, I want to make it clear that there is no suggestion in the Auditor-General's report that any sum was not <Col N="1275" /> properly chargeable against the grant. Touching this aspect of the case&mdash;the position of the Auditor-General and the legality of any kind of expenditure and his position in regard to legal advice, outside his own office or outside such advice as he himself may seek&mdash;there is a reference in the records of the proceedings of the Public Accounts Committee in Great Britain to the action of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Public Accounts Committee of 1909 had before them a case where the legal interpretation placed by the Law Officers of the Crown upon the Old Age Pensions Act, 1908, that the allowance of a pension by the Pension Authority, made the payment in respect thereof a proper charge against the Vote so long as the allowance remained operative, appeared to them to set aside the statutory duty of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of investigating, on behalf of Parliament, the confirmity of a payment with the intentions of Parliament in making the grant.  The course adopted by the Treasury&rdquo;&mdash; equivalent to our Department of Finance&mdash;&ldquo;and the amendments embodied in the Old Age Pensions Act, 1911, under which questions may be raised at any time as to the qualifications of pensioners, admit of points raised by the Comptroller and Auditor-General being referred back by pension officers to the Pension Committee, and if, necessary, to the Central Pension Authority.  Most of the objections noticed by the Committee have thus been removed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The point there is that the Treasury took the view that the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee had no standing, in fact one might say no right, to complain or to draw attention to expenditure in connection with the Old Age Pensions Act, when the authority had been granted by statute to the Old Age Pensions Committee to do certain things, and the law officers of the Crown confirmed that view.  The Treasury took that view for a time, but after discussion, they came to an understanding, which was that the Comptroller and Auditor-General <Col N="1276" /> had, in fact, the authority which he claimed, that no subsequent Act did override or could override in the circumstances the Act appointing the Comptroller and Auditor-General&mdash;that is, the Exchequer and Audits Acts.  So that I am saying that, notwithstanding any legal opinion, the Auditor-General is bound to follow his audit irrespective, if he wishes, of that legal opinion, even though that legal opinion is communicated to him.  As a matter of practice I understand both in England and here the Comptroller and Auditor-General may at any time seek the advice of the Attorney-General or any other law officer.  But I would maintain that it is not by any means incumbent upon the Auditor-General to make mention of that fact in his report; and while he may do so as frequently as he wishes, my own view is that it is better for him to stand upon his own judgment in the matter and to make no reference to the opinion of any legal advisers.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a matter of finance.  We are dealing with State finances and the effect of any action of a Department upon the State finances. The Minister has made a great point of the fact that he sought and obtained the opinion of the Attorney-General upon the question of whether the proposed guarantee came within the scope of the Act.  He sought the advice before he came to a decision whether this guarantee should be given.  Section 1 of the Act is the section which has any importance in this matter. The reference to the Attorney-General &mdash;I think the Minister has stated here&mdash;had regard to the question of whether the proposed loan was to be applied towards or in connection with the carrying out of a capital undertaking calculated to promote employment and was not to be used as working capital.</P>
    <P>I think that is a fair summary of the submission to the Attorney-General. The opinion of the Attorney-General was that the proposed loan came within the scope of the Act.  The view of the Public Accounts Committee, which confirms the view of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, is that whatever may be the law&mdash; whether or not the proposed loan came <Col N="1277" /> within the letter of the section&mdash;the financial implications of the section were not before the Attorney-General, and that to implement the section it was necessary for the Minister to have regard to the financial implications. Whether or not that was so is a matter for the Minister.  It was certainly a matter for the Comptroller and Auditor-General to take account of, and it also was certainly a matter for the Minister for Finance. The Public Accounts Committee has the view that in connection with a purely financial question&mdash;the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, it will be remembered, was certified as a Money Bill&mdash;primarily affecting finances and having necessarily an influence upon the national finances, the Minister for Finance ought to be placed in a position to put any aspects affecting finance before the Attorney-General when a submission is being made for a legal opinion.  The Act is an enabling Act, and on the face of Section 1 it is clear, if not to the lawyer, to the Deputy, that there is intended to be checks upon financial obligations that the State enters into.  It is not merely a question of whether you can bring into the letter of the section a certain proposal, whether it will by any means conform to the section from the purely legal point of view, but whether the terms of the section, speaking broadly, including financial surroundings, implications and obligations, are also being recognised and acknowledged in taking action under the section.  I think it is appropriate at this time to refer to that financial intention of the section which, as I say, ought to be taken into account in giving advice to the Minister as to whether a case comes within the scope of the Act as well as within the purely legal literal meaning of it.</P>

I take it that the Advisory Committee's function is to advise the Minister as to the business possibilities, the integrity of the firm and the reliability of the business prospects.  But we have involved in this question the larger question of the national economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister speaks of £20,000.  I will assume it is 20,000 pence, and I say that the implications of this section are that the State liabilities are to be protected from the financial point of view, first by the limitation of a condition that the loan shall be applied in connection with the carrying out of a capital undertaking and that it shall be calculated to promote employment.  A capital undertaking is defined as an undertaking involving capital expenditure.  I think the Minister has more or less made it clear that there is no general understanding of what that phrase means.  He has suggested, curiously enough, that it is for the Committee of Public Accounts to formulate a definition.  I may say for his information that the Committee of Public Accounts was only dealing with the facts of an event which occurred in the year 1924-25 in relation to the law which had been enacted prior to that date.  It was not dealing with the formulation of a new statute except to suggest that the existing statute had obviously raised questions of interpretation, and that before any other financial obligation was entered upon there should be a clearer understanding of what was meant by the section.  The carrying out of a capital undertaking is one of the conditions, but there was also another condition, which was that the proceeds of a loan were not intended <Col N="1279" /> to be used as working capital. Obviously, or shall I say presumably, these conditions were intended to have financial value to the State.  They were intended to ensure that there would be security, that the general financial interests would be safeguarded, and that the risks of the guarantee being called upon would be brought to a minimum. Surely the implications of the section would require that in any case submitted to the Attorney-General on a matter of interpretation the Finance Department's view of the case should be presented at the same time as merely a trade department's view so as to get a considered view from the Attorney-General, having all the facts before him.</P>
      <P>There is a good deal of criticism here and there as to whether we have followed an example wisely when we decided that the Minister for Finance should have a centralised control over departmental expenditure and obligations entered upon by a department.  I know that for a considerable time there has been criticism in this respect, but, rightly or wrongly, it is the system that we have adopted, and the more I see of the working of affairs the less eager I would be to depart from that centralised control.  It may be that in time, with longer experience and a clearer view of the requirements, it might be possible to depart from this rigid centralised control.  I do not think the time has come by any means yet, but having adopted that system I believe, and the Committee agrees, that in matters which affect the Exchequer, and which are obviously of financial import, where a case is being submitted to the Attorney-General for his opinion opportunity at least should be given for that centralised Finance Department to present its aspect of the case at the same time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as my information goes, the case was presented to the Attorney-General not through the Department of Finance&mdash;not having asked the Minister for Finance to add any <Col N="1280" /> considerations he might wish to put forward&mdash;but directly by the Minister's own Department.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>By all means; there was nothing to prevent him.  I think I am right in saying that the case was presented without the observations of the Minister for Finance, or without submitting the case to the Minister for Finance for any additional observations before going to the Attorney-General. That is a matter of departmental practice. The Committee merely makes this recommendation, that in such a case where finances are involved, it would be well and desirable, if not necessary, that the Department of Finance should add any observations they required to make on the case as presented before the Attorney-General is asked to give his opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister invited the House, at least I interpreted his reference to be an invitation to the House, to express a view, if it had a view to express, in regard to the services rendered by the gentlemen who sat on the Advisory Committee.  I do not know to what extent Deputies are familiar with the work of the Advisory Committee, and my knowledge is not extensive, but so far as I have been able to see, and possibly my opportunities have been greater than those of many Deputies, the activities of this Committee have been great and the services rendered by the members of the Committee have been valuable.  I agree with the Minister that the Dáil has a right to be thankful, and the Minister is to be congratulated on having had at his service men of the character, quality and integrity of those who have served on that Committee, and when he informs the House that their service has been given purely out of regard for public interests and without reward, I think it is more highly commendable than though it had been highly paid.  I am quite certain that the Minister is right in his view regarding the Committee of Public Accounts, and I think I am justified in saying with regard to the statement of the Comptroller and Auditor-General that it is not the action of the Advisory Committee, or the action of the bank, which is criticised.  Responsibility <Col N="1281" /> in the matter is that of the Minister. It is a curious misreading of the situation, whether of the Auditor-General's report or of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts, which suggests there is any criticism of the action of the bank.  I think the bank has been particularly careful in this matter.  Certainly it is by no means correct to suggest that there is any adverse criticism of the bank or of the Advisory Committee in either of the reports.</P>
    <P>Now I think I had better come to the Bill, unless a further opportunity is to be provided.  The Bill has the intention of prolonging the activities under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act of 1924, the section in question being the section authorising guarantees in respect of loans for the carrying out of capital undertakings, the other section, regarding the grants and loans with a view to reducing prices of commodities in common consumption, being more or less out of the question.  Section 1 lays it down that &ldquo;the loans are to be applied towards or in connection with the carrying out of any capital undertaking or in connection with the purchase of articles manufactured or produced in Saorstát Eireann required for the purposes of any such undertaking, and that the application of the loan in the manner proposed is calculated to promote employment in Saorstát Éireann.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce may guarantee in such manner and form and on such terms and conditions as he shall think proper subject to the limitations hereinafter imposed and subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance the repayment of the principal of such loan and the payment of the interest thereon or the repayment of such principal or the payment of such interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a further sub-section which I have quoted already:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No guarantee should be given under this section in respect of a loan the proceeds or any part of the proceeds of which are intended to be used as working capital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion on this Bill it was pointed out that sub-section (4) was introduced as something peculiar to our conditions.  That <Col N="1282" /> is to say, while the first part of the section was taken bodily from the British Act, no such provision regarding working capital was contained in that Act although we were asked to insert it.  There was an amendment brought forward by Deputy Heffernan that sub-section (4) should be deleted and in the course of the discussion on that sub-section it was made clear that not even the Minister had a clear view of what was to be deemed to be working capital notwithstanding that he insisted that the provision should be inserted in the Bill.  I take the view that the intention of the section, including sub-section (4), is to ensure that the purposes of the loans which would be fully guaranteed are to create wealth in one form or another, to create productive undertakings or to create materials which are to be used for productive undertakings, and that the money raised by loan under this section shall not be used for working capital.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary that we should understand, in view of the development of the case under discussion, what is intended by this condition as to a capital undertaking.  The Minister says, quoting the evidence given before the Public Accounts Committee, that it appears from reference to economists that there are 20 or 30 varying interpretations. If that is so, who is to interpret what is meant by a capital undertaking?  Is it satisfactory to come to the Dáil with a Bill which has so many definitions capable of being applied according to the person who is interpreting it, or is it desired that nothing should be done under this section until somebody has gone to the Supreme Court for a decision?  That is obviously undesirable, and I take the view, reading Section 1, supported as it is by sub-section (4), that obviously the intention of the section is to apply the proceeds of any such loan to creative operations.  Up to now I have been dealing with the matter from the point of view of the Act as it stands. I am very doubtful as to whether it is desirable to continue these limitations or whether the purposes would not be served better if those limitations were removed to some degree.  I am aware <Col N="1283" /> of the very strongly-held opinion that to remove these limitations even from the strict interpretation that has been placed upon them may lead to less security, a greater charge upon the Exchequer and greater risks that the guarantees will be called up.  Never-the less if the Minister, with the knowledge which Departmental officials can bring to his aid, with the experience of the needs of the case, comes forward on his responsibility and says it is desirable that money should be granted for works or for the lending of money for working capital, I should be slow to oppose, notwithstanding that I realise they are added risks in such a course.  I believe it may be necessary for the State to come along and say: &ldquo;Here are undertakings which in the conditions we see looming have a chance of succeeding if they are supplied with capital, but the capital cannot be raised except at exorbitant rates by the ordinary procedure. Nevertheless to promote employment it is necessary to keep these in being.&rdquo; I am prepared to support the Minister if he comes forward on his responsibility with some proposal of that kind.</P>
    <P>The conditions the Minister obviously desires to be in a position to create are not clearly allowable under Section 1 of the Act which it is now sought to extend.  I think the Act at present limits the Minister beyond his desires, beyond what he thinks is necessary, and that he realises there ought to be opportunities given to promote employment by the safeguarding of industries which cannot, without that, hold good.  I think he limited himself by that Act in a way which he found too tight and that he ought, if he is prepared to come to the House and say it is necessary, he ought to come to the House and say, &ldquo;Remove these limitations.&rdquo;  If he does so within the amounts mentioned in the Bill, I am prepared to support that view.  I nevertheless feel that merely to carry on the Bill in its present form, if you are asked to guarantee loans which are not for productive undertakings but which are entered on for the purpose of raising working capital, you are stretching <Col N="1284" /> this section beyond what is a reasonable interpretation of the section in all its connotations.  It is because I felt that that I asked the Minister a few days ago not to press for the Second Reading of the Bill until the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts had been before him. One of those recommendations is, that if that Act is to be carried on in its present form then the limitations ought to be made clear, also the intentions of the Minister and his desires with regard to operations under the Act ought to be made clear; but if, on the other hand, he comes and says that those limitations with that interpretation are too tight, then let him say, &ldquo;Remove some of the limitations and give us greater liberty.&rdquo;  If he does that, knowing all the circumstances surrounding the industrial conditions, the requirements of the case, the effects of the tariffs, and so on if he comes and says, &ldquo;I should have greater liberty in the matter,&rdquo; I shall not oppose that liberty.</P>

      <P>I need not cover all the ground of the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because on the general question Deputy Johnson, as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, has dealt with the position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the functions of that Committee, but, as an individual member of the Committee, I would like to add a few words to supplement what Deputy Johnson has said.  The Minister complained that he was at a disadvantage because he and other Deputies had not got before them the evidence on which this report was based.  It is quite true that it was open to the Committee not to make any report on the matter until their final report, and to have the final report and the minutes of evidence issued simultaneously, as is usually done.  The Committee thought, however, and I think they were right, that this was a case in which an interim report should be issued, for more than one reason. I will give one.  The issue of the interim report has made clear, at the earliest possible date, the fact that the <Col N="1285" /> opinion of the Attorney-General had been sought in the matter.</P>
      <P>If the Committee had not issued such a report there would have been no way open to them to bring that fact forward.  I think that the omission by the Auditor-General of that fact was accidental.  The Minister knows with regard to this particular trade loan that there have been all sorts of rumours and all sorts of statements in the Press, culminating in yesterday's debate in the Seanad.  I think that the publication of the interim report tended to clear the air, and tended to exempt from blame certain institutions and organisations which did not deserve blame.  The Minister, in the Seanad yesterday, used paragraph 15 of the Committee's report with great effect, and that justified us in issuing the interim report without the minutes of evidence.  I think it has helped to make the true nature of these transactions clear.  Nobody on the Committee, I think, took the view that it was a corrupt or dishonest transaction, or a transaction of which anybody had any reason to be ashamed.  The bank had no reason to be ashamed, the firm concerned had no reason to be ashamed, the Advisory Committee had no reason to be ashamed, and the Ministry have no reason to be ashamed of anything more than mistaken methods of procedure.  That is the utmost.  This report says that the procedure of the Ministers was not completely consistent with the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is paragraph 14?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, amongst others.  I am dealing with the three paragraphs mentioned by the Minister. The Minister told us that he was dealing with this matter as the result of the recollection of an officer of his Department who appeared before the Committee, and that it might be accurate or inaccurate. I have not the report here at the moment, but so far as my memory serves, it is substantially accurate.  I think there are one or two points of detail on which my recollection differs, but it is, perhaps, likely that I am wrong.  It is not inaccurate, but it is very incomplete.  The Committee <Col N="1286" /> took evidence on this matter on two separate occasions.  They discussed the matter on two other occasions, and went through a large number of documents, and only on one of those occasions was any representative of the Department present, so that the Minister does not know all that took place.</P>
      <P>I am not sure how far it is right for me to refer to the evidence given, as, for the moment, it is regarded as confidential, but I think I am at liberty to describe the effect made on my mind.  I went to the Committee, when the matter first arose, rather disposed to think that the Comptroller and Auditor-General was making a mountain out of a mole-hill.  I was, however, converted from that opinion and made to realise that this was a proper matter for the Committee to take up and report upon by the evidence of the Accounting Officer of the Department of Finance.  That was the factor that influenced me most strongly in inducing me to deal with this report.  I will deal now with the paragraph to which the Minister took exception&mdash;paragraph 14.  I do not think that there is any dispute over paragraphs 1 to 13.  Paragraph 14 deals with the submission of the matter to the Attorney-General.  I do not suggest that anything the Minister for Industry and Commerce did was wrong, but I am suggesting that the words, &ldquo;with the sanction of the Minister for Finance,&rdquo; unless they are merely formal, impose serious responsibility on that Minister, and that that Minister should, in exercise of his duty, before giving sanction, have done more to ascertain the legal aspect than he did.  He knew that the previous application for a loan to a similar firm had been rejected on the ground that it was not legal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He had, on the other hand, before him a doubt expressed by some of his subordinates as to the legality of this particular loan and, in view of these facts, I think he ought to have put the question up to the Attorney-General again.  Without suggesting any impropriety, people in different departments approach questions from different points of view.  There is the Industry and Commerce point of view, mainly <Col N="1287" /> concerned with giving employment and carrying on business, and there is the Finance point of view, mainly concerned with the security of the State's finances.  I think the financial point of view in this case got too little consideration and that the Industry and Commerce point of view got possibly too much consideration.  That is the reason why I personally assent to paragraph 14.</P>
    <P>Now, we come to paragraph 18, and the Minister says that he cannot accept that paragraph unless the Dáil compels him to do so.  The Dáil has, at the moment, no means of compelling him. I hope when the report of the Committee of Public Accounts comes to be discussed that, if the question as to whether it is to be approved or disapproved is put, it will be voted on with the Whips off because the reports of the Committee of Public Accounts are never voted on on Party lines. Members of the Minister's own Party were anxious to have this section inserted.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister for Finance, but it is very unfortunate that he did not hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The <Col N="1288" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce said that unless the Dáil definitely compelled him he was not going to regard paragraph 18 of this report as binding on him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not exactly my statement.  I said that if this recommendation were considered by the Dáil to be one which should be embodied in the Bill, then an amendment should be brought forward and I should have to be coerced into accepting it.  In using the word &ldquo;coerced,&rdquo; I am quite prepared to leave any amendment on that point to an open vote of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I misunderstood the Minister.  He expressed his point of view twice and on the last occasion he was rather terse.  I think it is not unreasonable that if two claims have been created in respect of a single business the State's claim should be the first claim.  We should be more scrupulous in dealing with the State's money than with our own private money.  If, as I believe to be the case here, the assets are sufficient to meet both claims, then you are doing no injustice to the private individual by asking him to take the second claim.  That, I think, was the view of the members of the Committee without exception.  It is certainly my view.  If two liens or mortgages are being created simultaneously, the claim of the State should come before the claim of the private individual or the bank or whatever other institution is concerned.</P>
      <P>The only other matter is with regard to paragraph 19.  Deputy Johnson has dealt with the fact that the Committee of Public Accounts is not the body to give these definitions.  That is clearly a matter for the Dáil or for the Minister. Let the Minister collect his 19 or 90 or whatever number of economic definitions there are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said anything about these definitions.  I quoted an official of the Department of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall say then that &ldquo;it is assumed&rdquo; that there are 19 or 90 definitions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, and I <Col N="1289" /> urge that it is for the Minister, after some research on the part of his staff, to find a satisfactory definition.  All the Committee say is that there should be a clearer definition than there is at present.  That is obviously a matter which is no more within the functions of the Committee than the other suggestion of the Minister that the Committee should suggest machinery for dealing with the Trade Loans Guarantees.  That is not the function of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister referred to the Committee.  I should like to point out that the claims on the time of the members of the Committee of Public Accounts are so heavy that members have hardly time to think in their individual capacity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Committee devoted so much of their time to that report that they had no time in which to offer suggestions as to the machinery for Trades Loans.  The conscientiousness of the Committee is great.  Any document that comes before them is very carefully studied and restudied in order to achieve the happiest wording.  I have only to regret that the Minister has withdrawn the approval &mdash;perhaps I should say the qualified approval&mdash;with which he regarded this matter in the Seanad yesterday.  It is, I suppose, like the historic egg&mdash;parts of it are excellent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I am not out of order in referring to the Bill, I should like to support Deputy Johnson's remarks regarding the limitation upon working capital. Up to the present these two Acts have not fulfilled the purpose we had in view when they were passed.  They have not led to any widespread revival of industry in the Saorstát.  They have kept two old-established concerns from going out of business.  They have enabled a number of creameries to make useful extension of their work, and a considerable capital sum has been devoted to other useful purposes. But the result of the passage of these <Col N="1290" /> two Acts has not been the revival of manufacturing industry which would give steady and regular employment.  I cannot help thinking that the limitation on borrowing for the purpose of working capital is one of the reasons why this desirable effect has not been achieved.  At any rate, I think the experiment might be made.  If the Minister can get another Advisory Committee as satisfactory as the last, it will, I think, be fairly well qualified to decide on what is sound and what is unsound.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat what Deputy Johnson said regarding our gratitude to the members of the Advisory Committee who filled an onerous and unpleasant office in a manner that entitles them to the thanks of the whole country.  I sometimes regret that it is not the custom of the Government to bring into the Dáil a motion that so-and-so, by his services on an Advisory Committee or on some other body, merits the thanks of the Dáil.  We have no Honours List and no means of recognising merit on the part of citizens, and I have a feeling that something of that kind might well be desirable. Amongst those who would have first claim if that custom were introduced, would be the members of this Advisory Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisMcCullough" hpid="Mr. McCULLOUGH Mr. McCULLOUGH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCULLOUGH</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I was not in the House when Deputy Johnson was speaking on this matter.  Looking at this report as a whole, there were only three points in which I was definitely interested.  The first is the paragraph suggesting that the case submitted to the Attorney-General for his opinion or a case of a similar kind to be submitted for his opinion, in future, should be submitted through Finance. On first examination of the draft of this report I took some exception to that, because I felt that the Dáil, having put the burden of carrying out the terms of this Act upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce that Minister was, in that sense, acting for the Department of Finance in any action he might take, such as submitting a case to the Attorney-General for the expression of his opinion upon the legal points arising out of it.  I feared, as a matter of fact, that considerable delay might occur if, instead of having <Col N="1291" /> the case submitted directly by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, it had been referred to the Department of Finance first, and then through them to the Attorney-General.</P>
      <P>In these matters I think urgency is a big item and that any unnecessary delays that might arise between the time when the application is made and the time when the certificate is issued are not good for a going industry, and might be injurious to the concern applying for the guarantee.  But, in course of further discussion, and in view of certain matters brought before the attention of the Public Accounts Committee in connection with this case under review, I felt that, without causing any undue delay, and perhaps to the advantage of a proper finding on the matter, this paragraph could be inserted.  I only gave it provisional assent on the understanding that such a transmission of a case to the Department of Finance for final submission to the Attorney-General would not be a cause of delay in dealing with a case that might come before the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now in regard to the nature of this transaction, there were certain views expressed with which I did not find myself in agreement.  I can see no possible objection whatever to the nature of this transaction.  Where this Act can be most helpful to industry is where a well-established industry, finding itself coming to a dead end&mdash;where owing to circumstances prevailing in this country during the past years, an industry that was thriving in the past finds itself in difficulties&mdash;is enabled by a re-formation or any other method that might be approved and that might be legally proper, to take advantage of this Trade Loans Act and get the guarantee necessary to enable it to get business going strongly again.  I took the view that this was a perfectly proper transaction, divorcing one's mind from the fact that the transaction was one where a certain set of individuals, finding that the application they made might be untenable, found a way out by going into voluntary liquidation and forming a new company.  It was, in fact, an entirely new company quite <Col N="1292" /> apart from the personnel of the directorate. Consequently, no exception, to my mind, could be taken to the transaction on that basis.  As far as I am personally concerned, and as far as my voice carried at the Committee, it met with my approval so long as the transaction was properly carried out and was legally acceptable by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of security, I feel strongly with other Deputies who have spoken.  I am not concerned with the particular nature of this transaction, but I am concerned that public moneys supplied by the taxpayer should not have any other claim created to take precedence of them by way of guarantee.  The Trade Loans Act was devised specifically for the purpose of aiding industry, and advantage should not be taken of that Act by any concern to raise money from other quarters, and give to those other quarters precedence in the amount of security offered.  I think that is a fair proposition.  I do not know that any objection could be taken to it.  I know certain objections to it were made, and a certain class of prior charges were suggested that could not be properly set aside to enable State moneys to have precedence.  But I must confess, and I gave some consideration to this matter, that I saw no particular kind of security submitted or suggested that, to my mind, at all events, would have a sufficiently strong claim to justify its taking precedence of State moneys.  I hope that the Minister will look upon the view expressed in this memorandum or interim report as a wise safeguard for public money, and as an expression of opinion from a body acting for this House on the examination of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>In the particular case under review I had this consideration: that an advance obtained from a financial institution was only made possible by a guarantee of the State and that, consequently, it did not seem to be quite proper or right that such an advance should take precedence of the thing that made it possible; that is in the particular case.  But in general, although I am prepared to admit that there may be cases where you could <Col N="1293" /> not, perhaps, properly ask for first claim to be given to the State guarantee, I would say that&mdash;I express this opinion very strongly&mdash;no other classes of claims existing&mdash;certainly no claims to be created&mdash;should be permitted to take precedence of the State moneys in the guarantees given for the advances made.</P>

      <P>I feel, as one with some knowledge of the history of the firm concerned with this application, that if I were called upon to give a vote in connection with the Second Reading of this Bill moved by the Minister I could not, in any circumstances, give a vote which would mean casting a reflection upon the action of the Minister in guaranteeing a loan to this particular firm. Since I became a member of this House, and a representative of the constituency where this particular firm has its headquarters, I have been fairly closely associated with the work of the firm. Perhaps the Minister knows that I actually, on the first occasion, introduced the directors of this firm to one of his officials before formal application for the loan.  On that occasion the directors were accompanied by two of the largest ratepayers in the district of Edenderry.  I had access, with one other labour representative, to practically all the books and documents of this particular firm, and one thing I want to say definitely here is this: that I am perfectly satisfied that, starting with the official of the Department of Industry and Commerce, up to the President himself, all the inquiries it was possible to make covering a period of four months were made into the merits of this application.  It is difficult, I know, for any member of this House, other than a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, to discuss this matter in an intelligent way, because, as the Minister rightly pointed out, we have before us the report of the Public Accounts Committee but not the evidence upon which it is based.  I am sorry that Deputy P.J. Egan is not here in the House, because he had a good deal to do with the whole matter of this application, especially in the remaining stages of the inquiry.</P>

      <P>May I make an explanation <Col N="1294" /> here?  The Minister has referred to the absence of evidence.  Of course, the oral evidence will be printed in the ordinary course, but it is one of the powers given to the Committee of Public Accounts to send for persons, papers and records.  The report of the Committee is based not only on what is oral evidence, but also upon papers and records, which, of course, cannot be printed.  I want to remove a misapprehension on that score, and explain that it is within the power, if they exercise it, of the Public Accounts Committee to send for papers.  These papers will not be printed in the records of evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware at what stage of the inquiries the Minister for Industry and Commerce submitted his recommendation and report to the Attorney-General.  If I am wrong, let me be corrected before this debate closes&mdash;but I am aware that the Minister for Finance went into this matter and eventually it went to the President, and the President, in consultation with the other Ministers and principal advisers, with the consent of the Committee, agreed to guarantee this loan. I am sorry, however, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce in moving his motion made it a sort of condition that we should accept everything he said as a condition of the passing of the Second Reading motion.  As far as I can gather, the Minister laid down certain conditions before he would agree that the Act should continue to operate.  I am in agreement with the Committee's recommendation in regard to paragraph 18, and while what has happened could not have been prevented, I think it would have been only quite right to amend the Act if it is necessary to do so in order to conform to the conditions laid down in paragraph 18 of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I believe, however, though I am not a financier by any means, that the loan that has been guaranteed by the Government, as well as the prior liability for the other party involved, are both properly secured, and I am very glad to be able to say here that the nominee of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, <Col N="1295" /> Senator Douglas, who has been attacked in connection with this and other matters, has a very big share of responsibility, be it said to his credit, for having laid and made secure the foundations for the working of this firm in the future.  I am satisfied that this firm is going on and is progressive now, and that there is no doubt whatever of the possibility of the firm making good the amount guaranteed by the Government.  I am glad, moreover, that an opportunity was afforded to Senator Douglas in the Senate yesterday to make the convincing statement he made.  I think this will add to the prestige of this particular firm with which he is associated as well as to the prestige of the National Land Bank which was indirectly attacked by reason of the attack on himself and other directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has justified himself.  As referred to here in paragraph 15, I am certain, too, that &ldquo;the Department, after making its own inquiries, was assured that employment would be promoted to a noteworthy degree by the granting of the loan, and were satisfied that the assets of the company were a good security for a second mortgage.&rdquo;  Anybody who knows the conditions in Edenderry knows that if this firm ceased to exist &mdash;and it was closed down for a considerable period previous to the guaranteeing of the loan&mdash;the town of Edenderry would disappear and with it the four hundred or five hundred people who were depending upon this old Irish industry for a living.  I personally support the motion for a Second Reading of this measure, and for the extension of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  As I said in the beginning, I would not under any circumstances, knowing the history of the whole application, no matter what the consequences to me were personally, give a vote which would be tantamount to a vote of censure upon the action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to this matter.  The Minister when making his speech stated that no applications had been made under Section <Col N="1296" /> 2 of the original Act.  Can the Minister say to what extent applications were made and to what extent amounts were guaranteed under that particular section?  I fully realise that discussion at this particular stage in the absence of the verbatim report, would be difficult to carry on, and especially by Deputies who have not had the experience of membership of the Public Accounts Committee, and that is a remarkable educational experience.  I would like the Minister to answer my question with regard to the amount guaranteed up to the present under Section 2 of the Act, and, if he has the figures to indicate how many applications are outstanding at the present moment under Sections 1 and 2 of the original Act.</P>

      <P>This matter has been thrashed out sufficiently long, but I want to apply myself for a moment to paragraph 18 of the recommendations of the Committee.  The Minister takes serious objection to this recommendation, or at least says that its effect will seriously injure or retard the operations of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  I think he used these words.</P>

      <P>Yes, it is a nationalised industry if you like.  We passed the law and the Minister has power to advance money to any industry, and I want to make the case why the recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee ought to be followed out by the Minister in charge.  He could advance more money, but where he is the sole creditor, the man who holds the concern in his hands, he can keep that particular industry going.  Nobody else can press it as long as he keeps it in that position and holds first charge.  I hold that in that case the State is in a better position than being in the position of a second mortgage holder with another man pressing.  That is a real business proposition, and that is one of the reasons why the recommendation is there.  I believe that the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act should be prolonged. The matter has been well thrashed out, and the Dáil is well educated now on the implications of the whole business. The Deputies will know the situation better in future when they are discussing these loans and their implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have rather a feeling, at least I had a feeling, as I listened to Deputy Johnson making points against arguments that I did not use, that I must have misled Deputies with regard to the report of the Auditor-General.  Deputy Johnson referred to cases and English precedents where the Auditor-General there thought fit to report contrary to the legal advice given.  I think that is a general statement of what he referred to.  I have never made any objection, <Col N="1298" /> and I certainly disclaim any intention of making any objection to the Auditor-General reporting in any way, having any legal opinion before him.  I did not intend to criticise the functions of the Auditor-General or how far he was acting up to what were supposed to be the traditions of that office, or any comment that he thought fit to make as Auditor-General.  But I do say this, that if the Auditor-General issues a certain report, and if there are matters left out that I think should be added to it by way of supplement, then I will add them.  Deputy Cooper agrees with me in that, and says that if it had not been for the publication of this report that the public would not know that the Attorney-General's opinion had been got and he apparently thinks that it is desirable that it should be known to the public.  I think it desirable that should be known, and I am surely at liberty to say that without being more or less accused of having criticised the Auditor-General for anything he did.</P>
      <P>There was a report issued and a certain statement made.  There is no objection to that statement being there, but I insist that for the public education I should make an addition to it, and that addition is the fact that the Attorney-General's opinion was taken on this matter and, as far as my Departmental responsibility was concerned on the purely legal side, I took the last possible step I could take to get direction and guidance on this point.  Neither did I argue.  I went into a certain amount of detail to show I was opposed to the point of view that the Auditor-General ought to be bound by the opinion of the Attorney-General. I said that I had heard an official of the Auditor-General's Department had made the remark that if they were to put down the Attorney-General's opinion it might seem as if they were hiding behind him and refusing to do their own work.  That was never asked of them, nor do I ask it of them now.  I do think, however, that a full presentation of the case might have included a statement that the Department had sought for and obtained the opinion of the Attorney-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper says he thinks the omission was accidental.  If I am correctly <Col N="1299" /> informed as to the evidence of an official of the Auditor-General's Department, he did not see on the files submitted to him the reference to the Attorney-General or the opinion of the Attorney-General.  When the Deputy says the omission was accidental, I take it to mean&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>

I think it is clear also that the files which were available and which were in the hands of the Comptroller and Auditor-General were the Department of Finance files.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about the Public Accounts Committee; I am talking about the evidence given before it by an official of the Auditor-General's Department, who made the statement Deputy Johnson has read out.  There is the file that was before the Auditor-General; there is the statement of the case as presented to the Attorney-General, and there is the Attorney-General's opinion.  We will get the evidence in due course, but I am anxious to know how the official of the Auditor-General's Department was able to make such a statement having had that file before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to this Report which Deputy Cooper says I used with a certain amount of effect in the Seanad yesterday.  I did use it, and I think I used it rightly, and I am prepared to use it again and to quote in extenso paragraph 15 in the same circumstances. I am still in doubt as to the net effect of this Report.  Deputy Johnson says of it in a general phrase that the Auditor-General's comments are confirmed by the Report of the Public Accounts Committee, and Deputy Cooper says that the only thing really criticised is wrong procedure&mdash;<Col N="1301" /> those were the words he used&mdash;on the part of Ministers.  On that point I asked him did he refer to paragraph 14, and he said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  According to Deputy Cooper, the only point on which there was criticism, as far as the transaction was concerned, was paragraph 14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  I said I included paragraph 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point, according to the Deputy, on which there was criticism was that there was wrong procedure on the part of Ministers.  The only paragraph I find referring to wrong procedure is paragraph 14.  Deputy Johnson says the Public Accounts Committee confirmed the remarks of the Auditor-General, and Deputy Cooper says the only thing criticised is wrong procedure on the part of Ministers.  The Auditor-General's Report says: &ldquo;I did not consider that the guarantee in this case came within its terms.&rdquo;  Paragraph 16 begins by stating:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Committee does not propose to express any views on the question as to whether or not a guarantee can be brought technically within the scope of the Act...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rather took it that paragraph 16 avoids any decision on the point raised by the Auditor-General, and paragraph 14 is dealing with a matter about which the Auditor-General made no comment whatever.  I do not know if the Auditor-General's officials gave any evidence before the Public Accounts Committee in which they adverted specially to this point, that the opinion should have been asked for through the channel of the Department of Finance instead of through my own Department. If not, I cannot see how this can be taken as confirming the Auditor-General's Report when they refer to different things.  Deputy Johnson said the Minister for Finance&mdash;and I queried him on this&mdash;should be enabled to secure the Attorney-General's opinion on this and on any other point. I asked him was he prevented?  Had he not his opportunity when my presentation of the statement of the case to the Attorney-General, with the Attorney-General's opinion on it, came <Col N="1302" /> back to me and was referred by me to the Minister for Finance?  He surely had then his opportunity, if he thought there was anything wrong, if he thought that the case had been coloured in its presentation, if he thought there was any omission from it which should have been put in.  Instead of that, the Minister for Finance accepted that and the guarantee was given.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson also argued that there is more in this submission to the Attorney-General merely than the legal point&mdash;that you have to get the view of the financial authority on the matter under Section 1, because we have to consider the financial implications of it on the general State economy.  I ask the Dáil to consider that in its relation to this case.  If it was a matter of a two-million loan I could imagine the Minister for Finance certainly having to have his opinion taken on whether the State could afford to raise that money at the moment.  But take a loan of something of the sort under discussion here, that is within the amount of money set out in the Act as ordained by the Dáil to be guaranteed in any one year&mdash;well within the million mark, well within the three-quarter million set out in Section 1, and on a point where I am, by the Act, made definitely the arbiter as to whether or not the proceeds are going to carry out a capital undertaking.  Am I supposed to ask the Minister for Finance to make his observations on that from the point of view of how it affects the financial economy of the State?  If that was intended it should have been put into the Act.  It is not in the Act.  It is an Act that I have to interpret; it is an Act that I have to proceed along the lines of, and I take the only course open to me to find out whether or not my procedure was correct.</P>
    <P>From what Deputy Johnson has said in answer to Deputy Davin, I gather the implication is that really the evidence on which this report was based was not going to be very much good, because we must remember the report is based upon evidence that is oral, evidence taken down, plus documents and papers &mdash;that the evidence is not going to be very satisfactory.  It will have a great deal of satisfaction for me in the light of the remark made by Deputy Cooper <Col N="1303" /> that he went into this Committee feeling that the Auditor-General had been making a mountain out of a molehill, but was convinced by the evidence, I think, given by the principal officer of the Department of Finance, that this was a serious case.  I should like to see all this evidence and before the Dáil adjourns, any time we may get a discussion, I am going to see if there is not some way in which we can get made available for Deputies, even in the roughest form, the evidence relevant to this whole Alesbury case, so that the Dáil may have that evidence, at any rate, in its hands when it comes to discuss, as it may have to discuss, the interim report of the Public Accounts Committee.  I think that can be arranged very easily, and even if we take it with the very definite and clear limitation put by Deputy Johnson, that you do not get a full understanding without examination of the papers and documents, there will be, at any rate, something more to go upon than merely the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the way the Minister is likely to leave this is more likely to cause misunderstanding than anything else that can happen.  If the matter is left as the Minister has put it, following my intervention, it may well appear that I am suggesting that there are all kinds of secret, confidential documents that cannot see the light, and if they do see the light, that extraordinary things would be revealed. That is by no means the case, I venture to say that the summary of the case which appeared in this report is a fair and accurate summary. Although I have avoided saying it, I think the situation now demands me to say that the Department of Finance was averse to granting this loan on grounds which were detailed and which led in the first instance to the refusal of the loan; that further consideration was given to the case, as I suggest, without knowledge of the fact, particularly from the point of view of employment, and as a matter of public policy it was decided that it was right and proper, in view of the decision of the Attorney-General that it was within the scope of the Act, to grant <Col N="1304" /> the loan.  That statement I do not think would prejudice anyone unfairly.  But, having made that statement, I do not think there is anything more in the file beyond what is summarised in this report of the Public Accounts Committee. I thought it necessary to say that for fear the inference that might be drawn from the Minister's last comment would suggest all kinds of secret and unpublishable facts.  That is not true at all.</P>

I think it shows a point of view on the part of the Committee when they talk of &ldquo;brought technically within the scope of the Act.&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;formal&rdquo; in one part and &ldquo;technical&rdquo; in another I certainly would not&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin said that I laid down conditions about the passing of this.  I did not.  I said that if an amendment be brought forward to give some definition of what is required in paragraph 19, that it should be looked at and considered in the light of the other facts I have put before the Dáil.  I said that if there is an amendment brought forward to bring in paragraph 18 and to make it some way operative in the Bill that I am prepared not merely to have it looked at, but to let the Dáil have a free vote on it.</P>

      <P>Decidedly I did not go so far as to say a free vote.  I said definitely I would not accept this recommendation simply because it appeared in the Interim Report of the Public Accounts Committee unless it were made a term of the Bill.  If paragraph 14 is going to be insisted upon, and if there is going to be evidence that the majority of this House thinks that paragraph 14 ought to be a guiding rule for Government Departments for the future, either under this or any other Bill, as to how work will be done, I simply hold that it will make Government work impossible, and I am not prepared to work with that condition. I want to be quite distinct about that.</P>

      <P>It goes beyond the Bill.  It means that I am not prepared to work any Act or to carry out <Col N="1306" /> any administrative business if paragraph 14 be insisted upon as a condition. As to this question of working capital, to which Deputy Johnson has referred, and to a possible amendment on these lines, I do not think I will be able to get the Minister for Finance to agree to taking out sub-section (4), and I think there would be very great danger in it.  The Deputy has referred to risk.  It means that one would have no fixed assets on which to charge the moneys put up if sub-section (4) was removed.  We have put it to the Banking Commission that they should consider the question of long-term credits for industrial purposes, and we hope we will get certain suggestions and recommendations from them which will meet the need that would otherwise be met by the abolition of sub-section (4) of this Principal Act.  I do not think it would be wise to move towards the summary abolition of that at the moment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the cases, the latest returns show that under Section 2, the section that Deputy Davin queried, there have been 13 applications considered by the Advisory Committee and three have been recommended.  The sums of money involved in these three total about £3,500.  Under Section 1, 81 cases have been considered by the Advisory Committee and 27 have been recommended.  Coming to the applications received under Section 2, the section to which Deputy Davin referred, 35 applications have been received, and under Section 1, 38.  The pending cases at the moment are only three under Section 1.  I have not the tots of the sums of money involved, but when I last quoted these about three weeks ago I said that if all the cases in the various stages of getting towards guarantee were all looked upon as guaranteed there would be a sum of over £600,000 involved.</P>

If you take the first three lots the total amount involved would be over £600,000.  That is to say where recommendations have been sent up and passed by my Department.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding to the next business, I wish to raise a matter that I think is of some importance. The Minister for Finance, immediately before the adjournment, made a statement&mdash;I am not sure whether it was a considered statement or not&mdash;to the effect that the discussion that has taken place during the afternoon showed the inadvisability&mdash;I think that is a milder word than he used, and I forget the exact word&mdash;of the Committee of Public Accounts sending Interim Reports to the House.  I do not know what meaning to attach to that, but if it is a statement on behalf of the Ministry and it has the assent of the House, of course the position of the Committee of Public Accounts is made rather difficult.  If the Committee had been in normal working, had mastered its work, and if it followed the practice of the British Committee, the Committee would be publishing several reports in the course of the year.  As soon as three or four accounts had been examined and passed, reports would be sent in.  These would all be Interim Reports.  In the matter in question there was a Bill before the House and it was the duty of the Committee to examine a report of the Auditor-General on a matter which affected the House's discussion of that Bill, and consequently it seemed to the Committee essential that the House should be put in possession of certain information arising out of the Auditor-General's Report which would, as the Committee thought, assist the Dáil in the proper consideration of the Bill in question.  Now apparently, in the view of the Minister for Finance, the production of an Interim Report is inadvisable. If that view is generally accepted it is a distinct condemnation of the action of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

I simply pointed the moral that I did not think the actual discussion of the Bill was helped by that Interim Report, and also I did not think that it tended to produce the proper atmosphere for the discussion of reports of the Public Accounts Committee.  If we were to have reports coming before the Dáil more or less in the atmosphere in which it came before it, it would not add to the efficiency or the efficacy of the work of the Public Accounts Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 55, to delete the words &ldquo;ten shillings&rdquo; and to substitute the words &ldquo;seven shillings and sixpence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was very considerate when he accepted a suggestion from some Deputies and reduced the amount originally in the Financial Resolutions from twenty shillings to ten shillings.  Still, I think the ten shillings is a rather large amount to charge the majority of drivers who are solely dependent upon that occupation as a means of livelihood.  I admit that no qualifications whatever are required for any person taking out a motor-driver's licence.  He simply writes to the secretary of the county council, gets a form back, fills it in, and returns <Col N="1310" /> it with the money.  I put this amendment down not really as much for the purpose of having the amount reduced as to try to get something inserted in the Bill at a later stage making it necessary for drivers to have some qualifications, so that every Tom, Dick and Harry cannot get a licence, and that somebody should certify that a man is capable of handling a car before he gets a licence, particularly drivers of hackney motor cars, who have the lives of the citizens in their hands.  A great many motor accidents have occurred, and if it would be possible to have something inserted in the Bill to prevent people obtaining licences unless they have practical experience of the driving and management of a motor, it would be a very good thing.  It is a well-known fact that a man may be blind, deaf, dumb or lame, but if he applies for a licence it is forwarded to him, and the secretary of the county council has no power to refuse it.  I would like to have something inserted in the Bill which would safeguard the lives of people against men who are not capable of driving cars, particularly men who have no experience, who may buy a car or obtain a driver's job on a Friday and take the car out on the following Sunday.  If the Minister wants to look to the interests of the people generally he should see that the people who pay the ten shillings have some qualifications.  Owing to the number of accidents due to unqualified drivers I think it is absolutely essential that something should be done to safeguard the public.  There is also the fact that men who have learned to drive properly and who are solely dependent on driving should have some protection against people who are not dependent on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with a great deal of what Deputy Lyons has said.  I think it would be well worth the Minister's while to consider this question of the capacity of people to drive properly.  It certainly has not been considered in the issuing of licences hitherto.  On the widest roads we often see men and women driving by and managing their motors in a way that shows they know nothing <Col N="1311" /> about them, that they understand nothing about the management of them except to go at a headlong and dangerous pace.  That is all they seem to think about.  Even on the road which runs from Dublin to Naas and which is wide enough for anything, accidents have occurred constantly through abominable and indifferent driving. That shows that the drivers know nothing about the work.  They are careless and reckless and there certainly should be some test of driving before any man or woman is allowed to drive.  It should be seen that they have sufficient capacity before the licence is issued because in a great many cases these people are a positive danger not only to themselves but to everybody with whom they come in contact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I do not think that the matters that have been raised arise properly on the Finance Bill.  The Finance Bill is, broadly speaking, a Bill for the imposition of taxation and if the conditions under which people may be permitted to drive motor cars, are to be regulated by law it would be necessary that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health or the Minister for Justice should take the matter into consideration and devise regulations proper to meet the case. But the introduction of a code governing the driving and control of motor cars into a Finance Bill would not be proper.  With regard to the amendment, to which I think Deputy Lyons scarcely referred, I would only say that originally we had proposed a licence duty of £1.  In compliance with the wishes of many Deputies we agreed to reduce the amount to 10/-. I think it was felt in the House at the time that that was a fair compromise to meet the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the point the Minister has made, that we cannot or ought not discuss the qualifications for driving under the section, but one has to take note of the fact that a change is being made in reference to the issue of licences.  That is to say that hitherto a fee of 5/- has <Col N="1312" /> been charged for the taking out of a licence to drive a car but now an excise duty of 10/- is to be charged. If that excise duty were being argued for because conditions and tests were to be applied, one might understand the value of the argument for the change, but as it is I can see no reason whatever why any change in the fee should be made at all.  The Minister, of course, says that originally he proposed a fee of £1.  That was so utterly indefensible that he came down to 10/-.  Deputy Lyons proposes to reduce it to 7/6 and I will support that, but whether it is carried or defeated I shall oppose the change from 5/- to anything higher than 5/-.</P>
      <P>I think that the fee of 5/-, bearing in mind that it is merely a registration fee, is ample.  I would like the Minister to give us some figures as to the actual cost of registration: whether the cost of issuing these licences and the cost involved in regard to registration is not made up by the 5/- fee.  If he can say that it costs 5/- on the average per licence to pay the expenses of registration, then I will admit that he has a case.  But in the absence of such a case I think the fee should be the minimum required to cover the actual expenses, and I believe that the 5/- does even more than that&mdash;that it does cover more than the cost of registration. Therefore, I think there is no case whatever for any increase in the fee for registration.  As to altering the registration fee to an excise duty, we have not had any case made for that whatever. Quite apart from the question of the amount of the fee, there has been no case made for altering it to an excise duty.  In those circumstances, I think the proposal is not justified and should be opposed.  In the meantime, I will support the amendment of Deputy Lyons to reduce the registration fee by stages to the lowest possible figure.  If we succeed in taking the first half-crown off, then we will try to get the other half-crown off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has maintained that the Finance Bill is not the Bill under which regulations could be made as far as motor drivers are concerned. The section states that the fee of 10/- shall be payable on the taking <Col N="1313" /> out of a licence to drive a motor car on and after the 22nd April, 1926, and that this fee shall be payable by &ldquo;every person.&rdquo;  I want to call attention to the phrase &ldquo;every person.&rdquo;  This licence fee is to be payable by &ldquo;every person.&rdquo;  It does not matter whether he has any qualifications or not.  It is to these words, &ldquo;every person&rdquo; that I take objection.  The fee for a driver's licence is being increased by 100 per cent., from 5/- to 10/-.  I think the people who make their livelihood from the occupation of motor-driving ought to be given some safeguard, and I think that &ldquo;every person,&rdquo; whether he has qualifications or not should not be able to get a licence.  I agree with Deputy Johnson that a fee of 5/- was quite sufficient.  It probably more than covered the cost of registration.  I wonder if the Minister is in a position to give us the total amount that he received in the year 1925-26 for motor licences at 5/-.  I would also like to know from him if he is prepared to insert in this section a provision to prevent people, undesirables, from being able to take out licences?  Take, for instance, a large trader in a small or a big town.  He employs a shop-assistant. This man is shop-boy and yardman, and if his employer happens to get a motor van he is engaged two days later driving it about.  There may be in that town a man who has served two years in learning the business of motor-driving.  He may have a wife and family to support, and because &ldquo;every person&rdquo; can take out a licence he is not able to get work to support those depending on him.  As long as that is allowed the lives of the citizens in that town are at the mercy of such people as this shop assistant.  Without any qualifications whatever he is allowed to take out a motor-car and drive it about.  I have known cases where men were out all night on the road and the man who had the licence to drive was not able to repair even a puncture.  I understood when this duty became an excise duty, that something would be done providing that a person applying for a licence should have some qualifications.  The Minister says that this is not a Bill for dealing with that. I would like to know whether at this <Col N="1314" /> stage he will give some guarantee that legislation will be introduced to deal with the matter?</P>

If a section cannot be added to this Bill that would safeguard lives and property by seeing that the men who take out licences are capable of driving I think that the Minister should give a guarantee that something will be done.  He has not done that, and I ask the House to support the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has truly said that this Bill is for the purpose of raising revenue.  I suppose that is the real object in increasing the amount to be paid for permission to drive a motor car from 5/- to 10/-.  I hope the Minister will not say that if he reduced the amount for the licence to 5/- he would have to tax food commodities.  I think it is only due to the House that we should be informed as to how much revenue the Minister thinks he will derive from this increase, and if that is the reason why this registration fee has been changed into an excise duty how much would the Exchequer gain by it.  It is perfectly true that it would be out of order to propose that this excise duty should be payable on certain conditions attached to the permit to drive.  If the Minister, by raising the fee from 5/- to 10/- means to do so as a deterrent to people who are not sufficiently qualified to drive, I think that it might be done in another way, and if his object is, as presumably it is, to raise revenue, I think he might have informed the House how much he expects to raise.</P>

    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Sections 20 and 21 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 22.</P>
    <P>(1)  There shall be charged, levied, and paid on and by every bookmaker who makes, lays, or otherwise enters into any bets on or after the 1st day of November, 1926, an excise duty (in this Act referred to as the duty on bets) of five per cent. of the amount of every bet entered into by him on or after the said 1st day of November, 1926.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purpose of this section the amount of a bet shall be the sum of money which by the terms of the bet the bookmaker will be entitled to receive, retain, or take credit for if the event the subject of the bet is determined in his favour.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever it is proved to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that a bet in respect of which the duty imposed by this section is chargeable has become void for any reason other than the mutual consent of the parties thereto or that the amount of a bet in respect of which the said duty is chargeable has not been and is not likely to be collected by the bookmaker, the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to such conditions as they may think fit to impose, either (as the case may require) repay the duty paid or remit the duty chargeable in respect of such bet.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every person who fails or neglects to pay any sum payable by and lawfully demanded from him in respect of the duty imposed by this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to an excise penalty of five hundred pounds.</P>

      <P>The next amendment is in my name, but before proposing it I would like to ask the Minister if any negotiations are pending, or are being considered, in connection with any alternative suggestion made by bookmakers for the payment of a higher licence duty in lieu of a tax on betting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is replying to that question perhaps he will also say whether any negotiations are in course of discussion, affecting this tax and the various taxes connected with betting, with the British Government, and whether any concessions that may be made to bookmakers here will depend whether concessions are made to bookmakers in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No negotiations are in progress, and no negotiations have taken place with the bookmakers with a view to substituting a higher licence duty for a tax on betting.  I think I have said definitely from the beginning that while I was willing to listen to any representation, and hear the facts about turnover, if they were submitted to me, I was not prepared to depart from the principle of a tax on betting. In the last few days I have, for the <Col N="1319" /> first time, got a reasonable amount of information in regard to turnover and the business done on racecourses.  The definite answer to what Deputy Shaw has asked is that I have not given anybody the idea that we would abandon the tax on betting for a higher licence duty on bookmakers.  With regard to Deputy Johnson's question no negotiations have taken place with the British Government.  No negotiations have taken place between this Government and the British Government with regard to betting duties or the various duties connected with betting, and concessions that may be made here will be made as a result of information and representations supplied by the people here and will not depend on what happens in Great Britain.  When we were considering the imposition of the Betting Tax we had before us the evidence that was submitted to the Select Committee which sat on the other side, and we used the information collected by that Committee in considering the matter.  No doubt the British Government used the same information that was embodied in the same Blue Book, but there has been absolutely no communication of any sort with the British Government in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (1) to insert after the word &lsquo;bets,&rsquo; line 30, the words &lsquo;(with the exception hereinafter mentioned),&rsquo; and to insert before sub-section (2) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Bets entered into on any racecourse in Saorstát Eireann in respect of any horse running thereat shall be exempted from duty prescribed by sub-section (1) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment which I am proposing was put in by me after the Second Reading of the Finance Bill and was put in because it was apparent that the Minister was determined to insist on the principle of a 5 per cent. tax on all stakes invested.  As I and the persons I speak for were aware that such tax would seriously injure a great industry I was reluctantly compelled to oppose the measure as introduced. <Col N="1320" /> In the interval certain conversations have taken place between the Minister, myself and Senator Parkinson, and the following alternative proposals have been submitted for the Minister's consideration.  These are in connection with racecourse betting only:&mdash;(1) That at meetings where the totalisator or pari-mutuel is operated a five per cent. tax be charged&mdash;50 per cent. of the net receipts to be refunded to the race company for the purpose of increasing the stakes to be run for. (2) The proposed tax of five per cent. on all bets made with bookmakers on racecourses to be reduced to 2½ per cent. and half of the net revenue to be likewise refunded towards the increase of stakes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the stipulation that half the money collected at racecourses must be given back for the improvement of stakes, that is a matter on which I cannot yield.  I understand there are a certain limited number of persons who consider there should have been no question of compromise, and those are persons who obtain their living out of racing, and in the making of those remarks I do not allude to bookmakers generally, their alternative being to let the Government impose the five per cent. tax and then take steps to bring racing to an end.  Those are not the persons whose interests I represent here. I represent the owners, trainers, breeders and the general public.  The dissatisfied persons seem entirely to overlook the fact that it is the owners and breeders who provide them with their means of livelihood and that only for the owners there could be no racing. Those same owners and breeders have millions of pounds invested in the racing and breeding industry and they, I think it will be unanimously admitted, get the least out of it; they are the persons responsible for the money circulated which gives employment to countless thousands.  Therefore, my claim for half the money extracted by the tax is legitimate.  Increased stakes can then be given at the smaller meetings.  Better class horses will be attracted to them and, thereby, larger attendances.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I wish to quote <Col N="1321" /> the announcement just made on behalf of the English Jockey Club on the subject, by Lord Lonsdale, who is a multi-millionaire and does not bet, so that his statement is, at least, unbiassed:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Stewards of the Jockey Club consider it is their duty to call your attention to the fact that, in their opinion, the provisions in their present form in the Finance Bill for creating the betting duty will have a very disastrous effect on racing, and, consequently, upon the breeding of the thoroughbred in this country.</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the Stewards, the betting duty in its present form will injuriously affect the attendance on racecourses which would entail the amount that is received by the executive, thus entailing a reduction in the value of the prizes, with, as we have stated before, a disastrous effect upon the breeding of the thoroughbred.</P>
    <P>That the business of the breeding of thoroughbreds is a very important one to this country, and a great asset will, we think, be admitted and for this reason anything that would be detrimental to it should, in our opinion, be avoided.</P>
    <P>The Stewards feel that, as the body who control racing in this country, they would be failing in their duty, particularly to the executives of racecourses, to the owners and to the breeders of bloodstock, if they did not enter a serious protest against the tax in its present form.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I again regret that the acting stewards of the Irish Turf Club, as the custodians of the Irish racing interests, have, so far, made no public statement as to their opinions on this important subject.</P>
    <P>The next matter I have to deal with is starting price betting.  I am well aware that the same arguments cannot be put forward in connection with starting price betting as with betting at racecourses.  My remarks, therefore, will be as to the effect of a 5 per cent. tax, as regards the revenue to be obtained and the effect of the opening of betting shops.  The new legislation <Col N="1322" /> will have the effect of a substantial reduction in heavy betting, and a vast increase in small betting.  Let there be no misunderstanding whatever about this.  Legalised betting shops will be established all over the city and country and those betting shops will display price lists and every other device to attract persons to bet.  Innumerable people who were not in the habit of betting before will be attracted and drop in to have their shilling or half-crown on.  I predict that within 12 months you will have the people and the churches calling for the repealing of this Act.  The imposition of a 5 per cent. tax on starting price betting will so much reduce the turn-over as to produce a much smaller revenue than a 2½ per cent. tax would bring in.  And Mr. Churchill has now discovered his colossal mistake as to the probable yield, and is preparing to reduce substantially the original tax as mentioned in his Budget statement.  Now, for instance, it will practically extinguish place betting, which would be about 40 per cent. of the amount of the sums invested, the reason being that backers receiving only one-fourth the odds to their money will invest only the money to win.  And as heretofore the money invested for a place was an insurance for the sum invested to win, naturally the money invested to win will now be reduced.</P>
    <P>I purpose giving a few figures and I am going to take as a basis £10 each way in order to show the effect of the tax in connection with place betting. Ten pounds each way invested on a horse starting at 6 to 4 on would yield, for a place, £1 13s. 4d.  The tax on the possibility of winning £1 13s. 4d. would be 10/-.  Ten pounds each way on a horse starting &ldquo;evens&rdquo; would yield a gross amount of £2 10s. 0d. for the place bet, and the tax on that possibility would be 10/-.  Ten pounds each way at 6 to 4 against would yield £3 15s. 0d. and the tax would be 10/-, or a total of £1 for the win and place.  Ten pounds each way at 2 to 1 would yield £5 for the place bet and the tax would be 10/-. There was a horse running in the Derby&mdash;Colorado&mdash;which started at 13 to 8 against, and I would like to know <Col N="1323" /> what amount of place money would be invested on him.  I could give a hundred other examples but I think I have given sufficient to convince the Minister and Deputies that a 5 per cent. tax will cut the amount at least in two and, therefore, that a two and a half per cent. tax would bring in a larger sum than a five per cent. tax.  I suggest to the Minister that if it is money he is after he should reduce the tax to two and a half per cent. and increase the licence duty on bookmakers substantially. By so doing, he will be reducing considerably the number of betting shops, he will have people of better financial status running them and he will prevent the public from being exploited by undesirable people coming from England and elsewhere. Those people for a £20 licence could start business and by laying liberal odds on big handicaps such as the Grand National, the Derby, the Cesarewitch or Cambridgeshire, could obtain a large sum of money from the public, and when the result was known and when the public who backed the winner came to draw their money, they would find it was a case of &ldquo;also ran &mdash;the bookmaker.&rdquo;  I am not asking for a decision on that matter to-night. I throw out the suggestion to the Minister that between now and the Report Stage he should consider the advisability of reducing the tax on starting-price betting.  I formally propose the amendment standing in my name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will sympathetically consider the suggestion put forward by Deputy Shaw.  Very few people know more about the subject than the Deputy who is both a breeder and owner of racehorses. This tax is a complete leap in the dark both here and in England. We do not know how it will result. Mr. Churchill has discovered that his estimate in one respect has been altogether wrong.  I do not suppose that our Minister can be any more certain as to his estimate.  Everybody hopes that revenue will be derived from this tax and revenue will be derived&mdash; probably more than is expected&mdash;if the right system be adopted.  But if the <Col N="1324" /> wrong system is adopted, there will be no return.  The county which I have the honour to represent is the chief racing, breeding and training centre. Everybody I have met there is in favour of controlling this matter, just as liquor traffic is controlled.  I was going to quote the words of Frank Webber and say that almost from the Minister down to the Clerk of the Crown everybody indulges in betting but the Ministers might be offended at that.  But from the greatest in the land down to the humble lady who sings &ldquo;Mary Ann&rdquo; on the racecourses, there is a certain amount of betting done.</P>
      <P>The practice of betting has enormously increased.  There is hardly a household in my county which has not a bet on every race that is run.  It stands to reason, therefore, that betting should be under control.  The question then is fined down to finding the right system.  When I say &ldquo;right system,&rdquo; I mean a system which will not interfere with the great industry of breeding and training which employs thousands of men.  This five per cent. tax would have that effect.  Deputy Shaw has made suggestions which I hope the Minister will consider.  He has suggested a two and a half per cent. tax, half to go towards increasing the stakes.  The stakes in this country are extremely small.  In France they are never under £300.  Here they go down to £50 and, perhaps, lower.  It stands to reason that it is not out of the stakes that racing is supported.  If it were not for betting, there would not be much racing except for the few rich people who could afford it.  Our great industry of breeding depends altogether on racing, especially since motors are doing away with heavy traffic horses.  We have to depend on the bloodstock and if it were not for racing what good would they be? Racing depends on the support the public give it and the public attend as a rule to bet.  Some people may go in order to meet their friends or to be amongst the crowd but if the people who attend to bet were to remain away the attendance would be very seriously decreased and the contribution to the amusement tax would be considerably diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> The people in my county are all for a high tax on houses where betting is carried on in addition to the licence on bookmakers.  Such a tax would drive out of existence the small houses that under the pretence of doing something else are used solely for betting.  They pretend to carry on some other trifling business which means nothing; their real business is betting under no restrictions whatever and these would be done away with if the proper tax was put upon them.  In England it is even worse.  I lived near a big town in England for some time; streams of men came in there from adjoining railway works.  In their way used to lie numbers of touts offering odds, and the amount of money lost, often by very questionable means, was simply enormous.  Mr. Churchill has come to see that evil.  I think here in this country if we had a heavy tax on licensed premises, and had them not under the rose but open, there would be much more coming to the revenue than at present.  I hope that the Minister will take what Deputy Shaw has said into consideration.  He has given the considered opinion of men engaged in racing in this country who know all about the business.  They are anxious that these places should be under proper control.  I hope the Minister will not adopt the attitude of the Medes and Persians, particularly as this is new.  We do not know how it may work out, at least I do not see how the Minister can know more than anybody else.  Those actually engaged in this industry say it will not last or thrive unless this tax of 5 per cent. is reduced. Some want it abolished but I think the industry might go on for some time if the tax was reduced to half and if half the amount fixed went back in increased stakes.  I do hope that in this matter the Minister will adopt the motto, <i>festina lente,</i> and I think it will pay him to do it.</P>
    <P>I hope that bodies interested in racing that have not yet approached the Minister on this subject will do so. The Turf Club has not done so.  I am an honorary member of the Turf Club, in regard to my position as ranger of the Curragh.  I have the privilege of attending certain meetings through the office I hold.  I happen to know <Col N="1326" /> that there was a meeting, a considerable time ago, to consider this matter, but nothing came of it.  I hope the Turf Club, as the premier racing body in Ireland, will give their opinion upon this question.  If they do, the Minister will then have come to see that the suggestions put forward by Deputy Shaw ought to be considered sympathetically, not only for the good of the country but also with a view to bringing in a tax such as we all want to see realised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister for Finance say whether this betting tax, if insisted upon will apply in cases of bets made with regard to candidates at the general election or at by-elections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if made with a bookmaker.  As I said already I got two or three days ago for the first time certain figures from representatives of the bookmakers.  It is fair to say that when the bookmakers did give figures they seemed to me to be figures that had been carefully and fairly prepared and that are as reliable as could be looked for.  Certainly, now that they have submitted figures, I have no complaint to make of the information given me.  I have at last got as good information direct from the representatives of a large number of bookmakers as I could expect.  With the actual figures, supplied by certain bookmakers, were careful estimates in regard to other bookmakers and estimates in regard to races at various places for which we had not figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not been able to study the returns supplied to me as fully as I would wish but it does certainly appear from them that the turnover is bigger than we had estimated.  I could see, at once, as a result of the study I have been able to give to these figures, that we could agree to reduce this tax on betting on the racecourses to 2½ per cent.  It would follow from that that we could agree, if five per cent. was taken from the stakes of the totalisator, that half of the net profits on the working of the totalisator could go to the courses for the increase of stakes.  So far I can go with Deputy Shaw.  But I would like to consider the matter further before I would say that of the 2½ per cent. taken on the <Col N="1327" /> courses we could give half to the racing executives for the increase of stakes.  It may be that we could do that and still have something like the revenue that we set out to look for. I am anxious, as I have said to the House, not to injure in any serious way the carrying on of races in this country. I have, now at any rate, got figures which enable a better study of the whole subject to be carried on than was possible heretofore.  But for the fact that the bookmakers have realised that the tax was going on and that if they want any concessions they had got to meet us fairly, and put the facts forward to us that were within their knowledge, it would not have been possible to go on with this proposal on any basis better than careful guess work.</P>
    <P>So far as starting price betting is concerned I am not so much impressed by the arguments that Deputy Shaw put forward and I have not got the information with regard to it that I now have with regard to betting on racecourses because, although I was supplied with estimates calculated in certain ways that seemed to be reasonably sound and though I was supplied with estimates that were helpful they were not estimates that necessarily carried conviction in the same way as the figures I had in regard to betting on racecourses.</P>
    <P>Again there is definitely the fact that so far as starting price betting is concerned, it is of no benefit to racing here; if it were discouraged to some extent or to a considerable extent no damage would be done to anybody.  I am not sure that making it a 2½ per cent. tax rather than a 5 per cent. tax would lead to any multiplication of betting houses or to any increase in the number of people betting.  <i>Prima facie</i> I would say that the effect would be the opposite.  I certainly have not yet heard any arguments that would carry much weight with me in favour of reducing the tax on people who do a starting price business to 2½ per cent., except one argument, that there is a certain administrative simplicity and administrative ease in having one rate. I see that.  But that is not a convincing reason in its favour.  In reply to <Col N="1328" /> the suggestions that Deputy Shaw put forward what I say is this, that I have now information that enables me to say without sacrificing the prospect of getting the revenue which I mentioned to the Dáil when first proposing the tax of something between £150,000 and £200,000&mdash;without sacrificing that prospect&mdash;I can agree to a reduction of tax on betting on race-courses to 2½ per cent. with the corollary that if the amount taken by the totalisator is 5 per cent. a proportion of that should go to the racecourse, because we would have to pay the racecourse executives on some basis for permission to run the totalisator.  The further question of whether a portion of the proceeds of the betting duty proper collected on race-courses would be given for stakes is one that would require more consideration than I have yet been able to give it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one suggestion I would like to put, while the Minister is thinking of possible alteration in the rate of tax upon starting price betting.  He has fixed in his mind a certain figure which he would like to obtain from this tax.  I would like him to bear in mind that if he fears now he will get more than he budgeted for, he might make a reduction in the tax on hackney-cars.  If he wants to deprive himself of a certain revenue that he had originally anticipated he would have, he might consider seriously whether it would not be better to get it out of starting price betting and so remit it from the duty on the hackney motor cars.</P>

      <P>No.  In one paragraph of this resolution they say that they have considered the matter from every point of view and they could come to no other conclusion than that the proposed tax on betting would, in a comparatively short time, bring horse-racing in the Saorstát to an end, and be the means of closing the establishments in which they are employed, and thus deprive them of their means of livelihood.  This resolution is signed by M. Smith, Secretary of the I.T.W.U. in Newbridge.  This is a resolution coming from the workers and appealing to the Deputies here to put an end once and for all to this proposed 5 per cent. tax on betting.  I never was interested in horses, but on Saturday last I visited one of these betting saloons in Dublin and found over fifty people present, some putting on a shilling, some a sixpence each way, some 2/6, and I saw one gentleman putting on £20.</P>

      <P>I hold that a tax of 5 per cent. on betting at racecourses will prevent a lot of people from going to such places.  The bookmaker has to pay a licence and the backer has to pay 5 per cent.  I really think that if the Minister would accept the amendment put down by Deputy Shaw that would meet the situation.  But I do not think that a full 5 per cent., with 2½ per cent. given to the State, would meet the situation.  I appeal to the Deputies to give serious consideration to this amendment, and to consider the appeal of the workers that you have here.  These men are making their living by racehorses, and they will be deprived of their means of livelihood if this tax is put into operation.  I will certainly support any amendment to delete completely the 5 per cent. tax on racecourse betting, but I will agree to a 2½ per cent. tax, provided half of it goes to the racecourse and half to the State.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has been reasonable in this matter.  He has not gone one bit too far.  All the arguments I have heard about this matter affecting the breeders is, I think, pure nonsense.  As far as my information goes, the great majority of breeders in Ireland are also owners of male stock, and they breed for their own benefit. Seldom have I noticed that a man who bred an animal and raced it for a considerable number of years, and who did not win some very important race, ever succeeded in disposing of that animal to any of the big people who are concerned with this industry.  The interests of the breeders are not at all at stake.  The people really affected by this matter are those who look forward to making a profit out of racing in this country, and who are directors of racecourse committees.  They are the people who desire to get a monopoly of the wealth that accrues from racing. I congratulate the Minister upon the attitude he has taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy stated that breeders are owners of sires.  That is not a fact in regard to racehorses. <Col N="1331" /> Practically all the large studs in the country are owned by persons who do not race the horses.  They race them, perhaps, once or twice or three times in order to sell them; but as regards keeping them racing for years, that is not so.  Any horse that shows form in Ireland can command practically whatever price is asked.  I saw yesterday where a horse that was hawked round Dublin for £85 and could not be sold won the Ascot Stakes of £2,000. Speaking of yesterday again, another horse that was bought at the Horse Show sales won a large race in England. Any horse that shows form in Ireland can be disposed of almost at once.  Breeders race horses a few times, and if they show any form they are sold.</P>

The Minister, however, has promised to consider the matter further, and I am agreeable to repeat the amendment I have here on the Report Stage, when I hope he will be able to meet me.

      <P>Amendment 27 is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to insert after the word &ldquo;bets,&rdquo; line 30, the words &ldquo;(with the exception hereinafter mentioned),&rdquo; and to insert before sub-section (2) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Bets entered into at any coursing meeting in Saorstát Eireann in respect of any greyhound competing thereat shall be exempted from the duty prescribed by sub-section (1) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the economic value of coursing I would like to say that anything that creates business and trade has an economic value, and the following statistics will prove the amount of money put in circulation from coursing:&mdash;250 coursing meetings mean an expenditure of at least from <Col N="1334" /> £200 to £300 at each meeting, circulating anything up to £150,000.  £2,000 is spent on printing alone in connection with the stud book and papers.  Preservation of game for the supply of hares gives employment.  Almost every club employs a gamekeeper for this purpose.  The majority of greyhound owners are very small farmers and labourers and they are all quite unable to bear further taxation.  Since the setting up of the separate Irish Stud Book, and the creation of Irish lines of blood, a rapidly increasing market for Irish greyhounds has been created in England and America which bids fair in a short time considerably to augment our exports.  Last year about 200 greyhounds were exported to the United States, value for at least £5,000.  The dogs exported have been very successful and are proving a fine advertisement for Irish breeding. English purchases realised some thousands last year.  Full particulars as to the prospects of this industry can be given.  This industry is only in its infancy, a separate stud book from the English book being published for the first time three years ago.  Coursing, therefore, needs encouragement and a tax would be disastrous.</P>
    <P>The position of coursing is entirely different from racing.  The average number of courses run in a day would be about 45, whereas only 6 races are run in a day. There are only two dogs in every course.  So that a tax on coursing would withdraw the money in circulation in a very limited time.  The amusement tax has already had a serious effect on coursing, and any further tax would be fatal.  Coursing is the most popular and inexpensive form of winter sport we have in this country.  It takes the place that hurling, football and athletics occupy in the summer months.  In fact, it may be looked upon as the only relaxation which country people have in the way of a winter sport, and, if it so happens that any further burden or restriction is put upon it, considerable resentment will be aroused all over the Free State. The sport, as I have pointed out, is as old as history.  It is, by every test that can be applied, a national sport and a national asset.  It has strong claims to <Col N="1335" /> put forward as deserving special consideration rather than a continuance of the existing burdens and an imposition of new ones.  Coursing is carried on entirely as a sport, and not one single club exists for the purpose of profit. As the Minister has said that he is prepared to consider this matter when some other Deputies have spoken, I am quite willing to withdraw the amendment and leave the matter in his hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to support the amendment.  Coursing can in no way be put on a par with racing.  Racing may be said to be a business more or less.  Race meetings are run more or less as a paying proposition.  Coursing on the other hand is not a paying proposition. It is purely and simply a sport and, as Deputy Shaw has said, the only sport that the plain people of the country can indulge in at little expense&mdash;in fact the only sport that is available for them in the winter time. It is the poor man's sport.  So acute is the position becoming in connection with coursing that a good many executives find it impossible to carry on and pay the amusements tax.  As a matter of fact, a good many clubs are seriously contemplating either giving up coursing or refusing to pay the amusements tax.  Deputy Davin, or perhaps the Minister for Justice could tell us the position of clubs in Maryborough and places like that where a good deal of money has been invested in connection with coursing and healthy amusement is provided for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic position to-day is different from what it was in 1919, 1920, 1921, or 1922&mdash;the money is not in the country now.  In the course of this year or next year, even without this betting tax, I think coursing clubs will find themselves in the position of having to come together and appeal to the Minister for Finance to exempt coursing meetings from the amusements tax.  I do not believe it can be paid, apart altogether from this betting tax.  As I have said, coursing and racing cannot be put on a par.  When a racecourse is laid out it requires very little attention or upkeep.  With coursing it is different; you have either to <Col N="1336" /> have your open club or your park and you have got to pay keepers to preserve the lands the whole year round. So intense is the love for this sport that some people undertake voluntarily to preserve the lands and even make enemies of their neighbours in doing so.  They do that because they want to have some amusement in the country.  The love of sport is bred in the people and neither taxes nor governments can drive it out of them. A good deal of money has been invested in greyhounds, although nothing like the amount invested in horses.  The sales do not realise the amount of money that horse sales realise, but the sum involved amounts to some thousands of pounds in the year.  That money coming to the people who bred the greyhounds means as much to them, and perhaps a lot more, as the thousands paid for some of our yearlings to those interested in racing.  A poor man will invest in a brood bitch and sell the saplings either in London or in Dublin or by private treaty.  I can show from the records of the sales in the stud books where litters realised £300, £400 and £500.  That is a big thing for some of our poor people.  For the last seven or eight years there have been regular transactions in connection with the sale of greyhounds between this country and England.  American sportsmen are also turning their attention to this country.  Deputy Shaw could possibly give the total number of dogs that have gone to America from here.  This year more than half a dozen American sportsmen have come over here to see greyhounds run and have taken away numbers of them.  I myself have sold six to one man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Deputy Gorey tell us what is his view as to the effect of the betting tax upon this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. Betting at race meetings and at coursing meetings cannot be compared.  At coursing meetings two dogs compete in each course.  To win a sixteen-dog stake a dog has to win four courses; to win a thirty-two dog stake, five courses; <Col N="1337" /> and to win a cup at one of our big meetings, with 64 dogs entered, a dog would have to win six courses.  On racecourses odds of seven to one, eight to one, or ten to one are often laid, but where you have two dogs running, and one of them is of any use, especially if it belongs to a certain owner, you are asked to lay three to one, four to one, and sometimes five to one on; three to one would be an average bet.</P>
      <P>How does the Minister propose to enforce this betting tax in connection with coursing?  How long would it take to get to the end of the small amount of money in circulation in coursing here?  It is so small that the larger bookmaker does not go to coursing meetings.  We have perhaps a dozen large bookmakers in Ireland, and not one of these, perhaps, attends coursing meetings.  There is not enough money there for them&mdash;at least, they do not go.  Perhaps some bookmakers would not think I am complimenting them by saying that none of the big men go to coursing meetings.  I hope I am not insulting anybody who attends coursing meetings by what I am saying, but really there is very little money in it, and no big bookmakers, perhaps with one exception, attend.  I am trying not to offend the Kerrymen in what I am saying, and they will understand what I am talking about.  I tell the Minister that the imposition of this tax would do away with coursing altogether.  If he does not intend to put an end to coursing altogether, he should withdraw the proposal. I think he will be asked very soon to exempt coursing meetings from the amusement tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How are our coursing clubs financed? By a small collection of a small gate at which 1/- or more is charged for admission, in addition to the amusement tax.  I am not quite sure if that is right, but I think it is about the average charge made to those going into the coursing field.  I cannot tell the exact amount charged by my own club.  Clubs are kept going by the people of each district, for three or four miles around, sending in their subscriptions, preserving the land, and trying to keep game in the country.  There is no profit made on the running of these <Col N="1338" /> clubs.  There is a dead loss to those concerned, but they are satisfied to bear that loss, as it is the only amusement in the district.  I think if the matter is fully considered it will be agreed that further taxation will result in killing the only sport there is in rural districts.  The people there are not living in the vicinity of theatres and other amusements that people in the cities and towns have access to. Coursing is the only amusement they have, and in order to keep it going they are prepared to subscribe a little money to these clubs.</P>
    <P>Take the coursing club with which I am connected.  When a piece of land became available we raised money in the bank on the security of a half-dozen men and bought it out.  The land consisted of two fields surrounded by fences, and beech trees were growing on it.  A lot of labour was necessary to make it suitable for coursing purposes. The work involved did not cost one penny, as the farmers came and brought 50 or 60 men to clear the place.  Not one of those who came and did that work was the owner of a greyhound, and very few of them ever make a bet.  Having regard to all the other charges that coursing clubs have to meet, and remembering the small amount of money that is at their disposal, if a further tax is put on it will mean that there will be no coursing.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that anyone who stands up at a coursing meeting to make bets should be specially taxed.  A tax to clear out a most despicable class of individual, an undesirable type, that attends coursing meetings, who gives unusual odds, pockets the money of his dupes, and who, before the flag is raised, makes for the gate, will be welcomed.  The patrons of coursing in Ireland are not men of wealth nor men of leisure, despite what may be said about the patrons of English coursing.  The people who support coursing in Ireland are those who by Statute were prevented in the past from keeping greyhounds.  These days are gone, and farmers and some other people now keep greyhounds.  Some people may say, perhaps, that it is a scandal to be feeding these dogs.  I always heard it <Col N="1339" /> said that the man that could not be kind to a child or to a greyhound was no good.  I also heard it said that both a dog and a child are very good judges of human nature.  There is no means of supplementing the funds of Irish coursing clubs except from the pockets of the people who keep dogs and the little money taken at the gate.</P>
    <P>It would surprise people who think that a fortune can be derived from coursing to know the actual facts. After dividing a sixteen dog stake the winner gets £10, but the owner had to pay an entry fee of 50/-.  The man whose dog was knocked out on the first course never sees his 50/- again, but he is perfectly satisfied because he got a run for his money.  As a rule, anyone who runs a dog has a bet on a course, but if a tax is going to be put on every bet&mdash;I do not want to issue a threat&mdash; I think the Minister had better realise what he is up against.  It has been said that coursing is of no benefit to the community.  I say that coursing must exist for the same reason that racing must exist.  To prove the value of blood in horses you must have racing, and to prove the value of the blood line in greyhounds you must have coursing.  It is a mistake to imagine that a good many people have not invested big sums in the breeding of greyhounds with a view to a foreign trade. That trade is not only beginning to come to this country, but is developing. The trade has come and the demand is there, more especially since the war when a good many of the English kennels were destroyed.  Englishmen are over here buying dogs showing any promise, giving £300 and £400 for any decent dog, and these dogs are owned by small people in the country.  It should also be remembered that the Government draws a considerable amount of money from dog licences, to which the greyhound contributes his portion.  Perhaps the Minister will be doing considerable harm in some other direction, the direction I point out, if he insists on killing coursing, as I maintain his proposals will, in effect, do.  It may be said that I am very much an interested party in this. Frankly, I am an interested party, but <Col N="1340" /> I, for one, before this tax was ever thought of, had almost made up my mind to sell whatever greyhounds I had and get out of coursing, because it is anything but a paying proposition. I will not state the wages I pay and what my coursing bill comes to in the year.  During the war, when food was scarce, it would have been a crime to tell it.  It would not be a crime now, as we have plenty of food, but there was a time when I took special care that it would not be known what I paid for the support of greyhounds.  I ask the Minister, in all seriousness, not from the personal point of view at all, but from the point of view of facing hard facts, to make up his mind to abandon this proposition altogether. There is no other course.  We do not want 2½ per cent. back for the benefit of the stakes.  We will look after them ourselves if the Minister withdraws the whole proposition as far as coursing is concerned.  That is the only alternative to this proposal that I can suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was speaking on the Second Reading of this Bill I asked him if he could give us an approximate estimate of the revenue that would be derived from this tax as applied to coursing.  He then said that he was not in a position to give any figures, and I wonder has he made any efforts to obtain definite figures in the meantime.  I support the plea put forward by Deputy Gorey.  I think on Second Reading the Minister said that coursing was not of any economic importance so far as the State is concerned. I believe that if this tax is applied to coursing it will cause a considerable amount of administrative trouble to the Department of Finance, without securing any benefit worth talking of, for the labour of endeavouring to collect the few pounds that may be obtained if the Minister insists on the proposal in its original form.  It is quite true that in the Leix-Offaly constituency a few coursing meetings are held during the year, but I suggest to the Minister that this is nothing more or less than an innocent form of amusement indulged in by the rural population on a few days in the year. I would venture, also, to suggest to him <Col N="1341" /> that the tax, if it could be recovered on the bets that are exchanged at a few cock fights, would far exceed what could be obtained from all the coursing matches in Ireland in a year.  More money is exchanged on cock fights than on all the coursing matches held in the country during a year.</P>

I suppose that nobody could put the case better than Deputy Gorey.  I will say this, from what I know of Deputy Gorey, that he, and the small number of people like him, have spent a considerable amount of money on and put a considerable amount of capital into this business.  I say this to the credit of Deputy Gorey, although we disagree on some occasions and agree to differ on other occasions, that he pays a respectable wage to whatever men he has looking after his greyhounds, and they are the best greyhounds in Ireland. Deputy Gorey did make a mistake in saying that very few people who went to a coursing meeting actually engaged in betting.</P>

The tax that would be recovered would be very little and would not be worth the trouble that the officials would be put to in collecting it.  I have been to more race meetings than to coursing matches.  There are many people who attend race meetings as well as coursing matches who never put on a bet.</P>

Looking at it purely from the departmental point of view, I think that the Minister is making a mistake if he insists on passing this proposal in its original form.  I think that it would go a good way towards killing coursing, that is, if the amount of money invested in the betting side of coursing is of any considerable size.  There are very few people like Deputy Gorey who put money into the business, and I think they should be allowed to continue to support an industry that affords a form of innocent amusement to the rural population on a few occasions during the year.  There are very few forms of amusement, innocent or otherwise, in rural Ireland to-day, and that is causing the rush of the rising generation into the towns.  The Minister is a bit of a sport, I am sure, and I would advise him, in consultation with the Minister for Justice, to concentrate upon endeavouring to get revenue from the bets on cock fights, instead of foolishly pursuing the policy laid down in the Bill, and I appeal to him to accept the amendment.</P>

I want to ask the Minister a question.  I do not know whether he has ever heard of a form of amusement known as terrier coursing.  I want to know if the tax is to be enforced at these meetings.  I am aware that the promoters of these affairs have not the support, financial or otherwise, of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, but at the same time they carry them on and they are more or less popular.  I can say this, that if the tax is enforced at some of these meetings one levy will be sufficient to snuff a meeting out.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 30 and 33, to delete the words &ldquo;1st day, November, 1926,&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;appointed day,&rdquo; and to add at the end of the section a new sub-section, as follows&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of this section the appointed day shall be such day not before the 1st day of November, 1926, as may be fixed by the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strange as it may appear, the object of this amendment is to facilitate the Minister for Finance and not to tie his hands in regard to the actual date of the coming into operation of the present proposals.  I am fortified in my object by the speech which the Minister himself has made.  He stated earlier in the discussion that he has got a reasonable account from certain quarters of the amount of turnover which will be subject to this proposed tax.  I think the words he used were that he had at last got the information <Col N="1345" /> and he went on further to say that he has not been able to study the returns as fully as he would wish.  My proposal is not that the Minister should not bring in these proposals at the date he mentioned but that we should not pass this section now rendering it necessary for this proposed tax to come in at that date.  If my amendment be accepted it will mean that the Minister shall have power still to put this proposal into operation on the 1st November but that he need not necessarily do so and that, if up to that time he has not sufficiently satisfied himself as to the returns that he will get, he may on any date after 1st November&mdash; or if he so desires drop the matter altogether&mdash;put these proposals into operation.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister's own statement largely supports my view, and though he has up to this made certain concessions in regard to the amount of the tax which he proposed to impose, he has in no way yielded on the question of the basis upon which that tax is to be imposed. When this proposed percentage tax&mdash;I think that is what it is known as now&mdash;was proposed, the Minister did not seem to be very certain of his ground, but now he has informed the House that he is in a somewhat better position, though he would still like some further time to consider the returns that have been made to him.  On the Second Reading I opposed his tax.  I opposed it on most of the grounds that have since been offered to the House from other quarters.  I opposed it, and I do still, on the ground of principle, namely, that there is no such thing as a percentage tax&mdash;certainly not a tax on turnover, as distinct from a tax upon profit&mdash;in operation in this country.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to tax a person's profits; it is another thing to tax his turnover.  The Minister has had representations made to him from many quarters&mdash;certainly they have appeared, at any rate, in the public Press &mdash;both from the trainers and employees, the race-going public, and even from, as the House was reminded to-night, the farmers.  These various classes connected with what is known as racing generally, have all protested, not against the amount of the tax, but against a percentage tax at all.  An <Col N="1346" /> alternative proposal has been put up to the Minister.  It has been suggested to him that by means of an easy and cheap manner, he will be certain of receiving at least £80,000, and probably £100,000. I understand that the bookmakers have suggested to him&mdash;and I think these proposals were in his hands within the last few days&mdash;that at least 400 and probably 500 bookmakers in this country would be prepared to pay £200 per annum as a licence, and that licence would be easy of collection.</P>
    <P>The administrative costs would be practically nothing and the Minister would be certain of receiving at least £80,000 or perhaps £100,000.  I do not know whether the Minister is yet satisfied that he will receive from the 2½ per cent. or the original 5 per cent. the amount that he has budgeted for, but here is a proposal under which he is certain to receive a net sum that will cost nothing to collect and which he could be absolutely certain of for the coming year.  I suggest, in view of the altered attitude of mind of the Minister himself in regard to the amount of the percentage he is going to charge, and in view of the fact that my amendment will not mean abandoning his own proposal in its entirety, that it should be accepted for the reason that it will give him time and opportunity to consult those interested.  He does not seem to have had the fullest opportunity of doing that up to this, but this would enable him to do so between now and the 1st November, the date that he proposes to put this measure, if he so chooses, into operation. I do not think there is anything extravagant in my amendment, and I do not see how, in any way, it could injure the collection of this proposed tax. It is not a suggestion to delete the section or to remove the tax in any shape or form, though I think that by the 1st November the Minister would be prepared to concede to my proposal that the tax, as originally intended, would not be practicable, and that it would be better to drop it altogether.  As we have heard from so many quarters, the tax will be a great danger, not only to the racing community, but to the great horse-breeding industry in the country.  We have had speeches from <Col N="1347" /> those who are thoroughly acquainted with the ins and outs of this industry. What they have said is perfectly true, that horse-breeding, especially in the case of thoroughbreds, could not exist without racing; racing, almost of a certainty, could not exist without betting, and betting, probably, could never exist if this tax were insisted upon.  It might interest the House if I were to give some figures showing the amount that would have to be paid by those engaged in bookmaking.</P>

      <P>I allowed the Deputy to go rather far on that line already.

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling and will content myself by saying that the Minister himself has given me the greatest argument in favour of my amendment.  The amendment in no way endangers the Minister's object or prevents his proposal in its entirety being brought into operation on the 1st November.  It does not prevent him doing that, but merely gives him the option, when that date arrives, to put his proposal into operation, or not to do so.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, would it not be better that he should be facilitated in this way: that his hands should not be tied, and that if between now and 1st November, he is able, as he said himself, to study the returns more fully, he would still be <Col N="1348" /> in a position to put this section, when the Bill passes finally through the House, into operation on that date.  I think that is a proposal which can hardly be refused.  It in no way interferes with the operation of the tax, and it leaves the Minister a free hand.</P>

The Deputy did, of course, show his hand too clearly in making a case against the section.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind the possibility that if this amendment were carried there would be a raging, tearing propaganda through the country while the House was not sitting with the object, shall I say, of intimidating the Minister to override the decisions of the Oireachtas.  The Deputy himself has confessed that his real purpose in this amendment is to make it possible for the Minister, if he became convinced after the Act had become law that it was not desirable to cause discomfort to the people affected, to postpone or abandon the proposition altogether.  That, of course, is a mere method of destroying the powers of the House and of handing them over to the Government.  I hope that the Minister will not, by any means, even think of acceding to this proposal.</P>

      <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Johnson.  I think it would be entirely improper for the House to leave the power of imposing or not imposing taxation in the hands of the Minister.  I think the House itself must decide whether certain taxation proposals put before it shall be accepted or rejected.  I do not think it should accept them and then leave it in the power of the Minister to make its decision inoperative.  There are many things as regards which it may be proper the Minister should have the power to fix &ldquo;an appointed day&rdquo; so that a certain provision would come into operation, but I think that taxation is not one of the matters in which such a choice should be left to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, if there is a general agreement by the House I submit to it, but it is the first opportunity I had of hearing it.  With regard to this section as a whole, I desire it to be understood that I am opposed to the tax in its entirety, and I am opposed to it first because it is a new departure in taxation which has not, to my mind, been properly investigated. Of course, the fact that it is a new tax is not against it, but the fact that it was rushed into the House without any proper inquiry, as has been evidenced by the debates and the most recent speeches upon the subject, calls for a proper inquiry or investigation before it is imposed.  A similar tax was proposed at Westminster almost at the same time, and though a report may have been made and issued in a Blue Book, which may have been studied both there and here, yet it does strike one as a singular coincidence that almost at one and the same moment the same tax is proposed in the two places.  The tax as proposed at Westminster has already been modified, and the tax as proposed here is now about to be modified.  Not only was the tax the same, but it was the same in principle, if not in detail.  In regard to betting upon courses, the modifications also seem to have taken the same direction. It will be a tax upon various classes, if not on the whole of the community. As has been stated here, there are very few in this country who do not one way or another indulge in betting. I am not suggesting that betting of itself is a necessity.  I am not suggesting that betting is not even in many cases a luxury&mdash;in some cases it certainly is not&mdash;but the fact remains that betting in itself promotes, assists, and encourages a great industry for which this country has long been famed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without betting it would be impossible, according to those who know best, to continue the horse-breeding industry, certainly the thoroughbred industry, and along with that you have <Col N="1351" /> all sorts and conditions of people who are dependent for their livelihood upon betting and upon horse racing.  You have racecourses throughout the country.  When the Minister spoke the other day of small meetings, and referred to them as places where only old stagers ran, and where nothing but crocks were to be seen, I wonder did he ever visit places like Clonmel, Thurles or elsewhere and see horses such as Jerry M. or Amberwave, or horses such as ran the other day at Thurles which were worth at least £8,000.  The small race-meetings are the feeding ground for the larger race meetings, and very often they are the immediate feeding ground for export to England.  Just as the Shannon which we talked so much about to-day would not be able to proceed towards the sea without the small rivers which supply it, it would be practically impossible to get the farmers in this country to breed horses suitable for racing either in Dublin or England if they had not the opportunity at their doors of running them at small race meetings.  It is proposed to put this tax on all sorts of race meetings, and it is similarly proposed that there should be a totalisator.  We have heard it said to-night that the Minister is willing to forego a certain amount of the percentage tax on the totalisator for the improvement of stakes.  He is not yet certain whether he can forego the same percentage of the bets made with bookmakers.  I confess I fail to see the difference, but it is certainly refreshing to know that the Minister has been sufficiently convinced that the whole of his proposals were not sound, and that there was a great deal in the representations which have been made to him up to the present.</P>
    <P>The tax, as a whole, will certainly hit all sorts, kinds and classes of people, including trainers, breeders, bookmakers, caterers on the racecourse, and even shopkeepers, including people who supply dresses and clothes for people going to races throughout the country.  Take, for instance, a racecourse like Tramore.  In 1905, owing to a disease which, I think, is called epizootic lymphangitis&mdash;I do not suggest that the Minister <Col N="1352" /> is suffering from that now&mdash;the races had to be abandoned there during that year, and the town of Tramore lost more than it was able to gain for many years subsequently.</P>

      <P>The matter which I have given notice to raise on the adjournment concerns the estate on a property formerly owned by Miss Butler, at Drumullan, Fenloe.  My grumble against the Land Commission is mainly because of the inequitable distribution of the estate.  That is what I base my representations to the Land Commission on.  I will just give one or two details as to why I concluded that the estate was inequitably divided.  My information is to the effect that an old lady of 71 years of age, having at the moment 20 acres set, got another holding of about 20 acres.  The argument put up to me was to the effect that she had a nephew.  It occurred to me to inquire where the nephew was or if the Land Commission supplied nephews as well as land, because if she had a nephew it was strange that he would not work the 20 acres, but waited until he had 40 acres to work. There is another case of a man with 50 acres who got 40 acres additional.</P>

This man got 90 acres.  I raised the matter sufficiently early with the Land Commission to give them an opportunity of dealing with it.  I know that the Land Commission has to decide who is and who is not to get land.  I do not dispute that that is their function, but I do grumble that so far back as November, 1923, I brought the matter to the attention of the Commission.  That is with regard to the division of the lands and I had communications on the 9th December, 1925, the 1st March, 1926, and 1st April, 1926.  In the last paragraph of the last letter the Commissioners say that when the Inspector, who is to make inquiries reports to them they will write to me again.  It was an Inspector named Thompson who made the original scheme of distribution, and when the case to which I refer was brought to my notice I objected to the scheme and asked to have a senior Inspector sent down to review the scheme made by Mr. Thompson.  The Land Commission promised that such an Inspector would be sent, but as a matter of fact no such Inspector was sent.  Mr. Thompson in fact was sent to review his own scheme.  I do not consider that a proper way to do business.  The Inspector who prepared the scheme went about among the people using threats.  He told them that if they did not accept the land they would get none of it if there was a re-distribution.  The point I want to emphasise is that the majority of the people who have got the division of this land are prepared to accept the re-distribution in order to allow everybody to be satisfied.  It is a matter of some concern and what is generally believed there is that it is the sole survivor of the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation there who is responsible for the distribution of this land.  Although the peace of the district is important, I think that justice for these men is much more important, <Col N="1354" /> and so far as I am concerned I am prepared to consider that justice for these men is more important than the peace of the district, and the peace of the district is in danger if some re-consideration of the matter is not given. Re-consideration and re-examination of the matter will, I think, provide the Minister with sufficient information so that the matter can be amicably settled.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Deputy did not take an earlier occasion <Col N="1355" /> [Minister for Lands and Agriculture.] to raise that question in the Dáil when we would have an opportunity of examining it and of seeing who did and who did not get the land.  That is the only way of deciding those questions. There are, at least, at present five parties in the House, and if land were divided you would have complaints from each of the five that the other people got the land.  That is my experience, and it is inevitable, however you may look on it.  There is only one way to settle this matter and that is, wherever a Deputy finds a case where a ranch is divided, and where influence is used in the division, I invite that Deputy to raise the matter here in the Dáil, and it will in that way help me to face the critics of the Land Commission here.</P>
      <P>I have been faced with general statements, both on the Estimates and on Land Bills, such as Deputy Everett made here now.  I am powerless.  I know the intense interest that is taken in the division of land. I come from the country and I know there are always to be found there a large number of people who are disappointed. When people with good claims are left out, there are bound to be wild statements.  The Land Commission is not getting fair play, because I have seldom personally investigated a case in which I did not find there was nothing in the complaints made.  I invite Deputy Everett to raise that matter.  He stated that only members of a certain organisation would get land.  There is nothing like circumstantial evidence.  I suppose he will agree with me that people belonging to the Labour Party, or to the Farmers' Party, will say the same, but circumstantial evidence is the thing, and when I say circumstantial evidence I mean an examination of the person who got the land and of the person who claimed, but who did not get, the land. I invite that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take this case.  This estate consists of 264 statute acres, that is 200 Irish acres; that is to say, it would be for nine or ten people.  You would put nine or ten holdings on it. I suppose there were, at least, thirty applicants for nine possible holdings in <Col N="1356" /> Clare, where people know what they want and where they occasionally go short ways about getting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister himself is not far from Clare, so he should not throw stones.  Does he mean nine original holdings, or does he mean nine like that of the man who had forty acres and then got another fifty?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is a case of an estate of 200 Irish acres.  That would give nine or ten holdings at the outside. You can take it for granted that on a farm like that there is a considerable tail of bad land.  It was purchased in 1923 for a reasonable price.  Possession was taken on 26th March last and the allottees were put in on the following day.  The lands were divided as follows:&mdash;A holding comprising 51a. Or. 12p. was given to Mrs. Bridget Murphy (widow), whose husband had been evicted in 1880 from his holding on the lands of Shandangan; 27a. 3r. 12p. were given to the former herd, while the remainder of the lands, containing 185a. 1r. 39p., provided enlargements for seven small holders, none of whose poor law valuation exceeded £10.  Is that a fair division? There was one holding made for an evicted tenant.  There was a holding given to the herd, and the rest of the estate was divided amongst seven small holders, none of whose valuation was over £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come to the specific case the Deputy mentioned.  There are only 21 acres undivided.  That land was offered to a man called O'Brien who refused it.  Miss Butler, who is 70 years of age, got 25 acres, the valuation of which was £1 1s. 6d.  She already holds about 18 acres.  Seeing that the poor law valuation of that was £9 15s. 0d., she has now a holding of £19, which is a fair economic one.  She practically adjoins the Butler estate and she has only a life interest in her holding.  Therefore, there must have been a deed of some kind by which, after her death, the land is to go to John Tierney, a member of the family of six sons and six daughters.  The inspector went to that estate and found <Col N="1357" /> the old woman living on an uneconomic holding.  On making further inquiries, he found that she had only a life interest and that after her death the holding was to become the holding of John Tierney, a nephew.  No inspector doing his duty would do otherwise than give her sufficient land so as to make her holding economic.  That is what he did.  The Land Commission must look at it partly from the point of view of the tenant in possession and also from the point of view that there was an uneconomic holding held by an unmarried woman and that after her death some other person is going to come into that either by purchase or some other way, and there will be left an uneconomic holding there.  Their duty is not so much to consider the question when dealing with congests. They have to give that a certain weight.  There would be cases where they would refuse for personal reasons to go even into an uneconomic holding. This matter was clinched in this way, when it was found that the tenant, Miss Butler, had a life interest only and that one John Tierney living close by who belongs to the family was the remainder man in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that it is good policy to hold up the distribution of that land until that old lady dies, in a district where there are other people prepared to work it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the considerations, rightly or wrongly, which the inspector took into account.  In two or three years, John Tierney, who is now a boy of eighteen, will be in a position to work the land, together with this 25 acres which is to go into this holding, which was uneconomic and which actually adjoins the estate.  I can imagine the Deputy making a very good case in regard to another estate in respect of a similar young man.  I make no defence for what was done in this case.  It is what any sensible inspector would have done in the circumstances&mdash;to give a holding to the herd and to give the rest of the land, with the possible exception of one holding&mdash;I am not quite clear on that from the file before me&mdash;to the congests <Col N="1358" /> adjoining under £10 valuation. Who were the men looking for it? Eight or ten landless men.  I stated here that we would do our very best in the Land Commission to see that the maximum number of congests and the minimum number of landless men would be dealt with.  I think I indicated that it would be extremely difficult to do that without the good-will and active co-operation of every party. I indicated that it would be a difficult operation.  It will be.</P>
      <P>A question has arisen about the Pollock estate in my own county and I have been invited, on behalf of the landless men, to attend a meeting there to protest against the bringing in of congests. That is going to start all over the country unless we set our jaws quite firmly against it and make the country understand that we are dealing with congests first.  That is not a popular thing for me to say.  It is not a popular thing for the Land Commission to do.  It would be easier for the Land Commission to go into a district, divide an estate, make friends with the people there, including, if you like, a few super-landless men and dispose of the land in that way.  There would be far less questions raised if that were done. But that would not be fair and it would not be sound policy.  We shall have to try and stand up to any odium that we may incur by reason of taking in congests instead of landless men to estates which are being divided.  That is, undoubtedly, the sound policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may assert that practically all these people would be willing to see the lands re-divided.  Fancy 185 acres of poorish land divided between six or seven congests under £10 valuation !  I suppose they would get about 20 acres each, if they got so much. I am told they would be willing to see the inspector come down and re-distribute the lands.  In fact, they are burning with anxiety to give some of it up, although, I venture to say, the average holding would not be more than £16 or £18 valuation.  I am asked to have an Inspector sent down.  It is said that Mr. Thompson, one inspector, has been on the lands, but that no other Inspector visited them.  I have on the file a <Col N="1359" /> report not only from Mr. Thompson, but also from the Senior Inspector for Clare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare) Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)">

      <P>Here is the file.  On it I have the names of every applicant, with particulars of their conditions. That is common cause.  I have the names of all the people, and I have a report from the Senior Inspector. Whether he went on the lands or not, there is no question as to the facts or as to his ability to make up his mind on the problem on the information he could get from Mr. Thompson.  I do not know whether he went on the lands or not, but whether he did or not, I see no reason for altering Mr. Thompson's distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy very naively suggested that they are all itching to give this land up.  I venture to say they are not so anxious as all that.  I think there have been some shots fired in connection with this estate.  There has been very considerable confusion and there has been intimidation of these particular allottees, and I can imagine Mr. O'Brien, who refused his allotment&mdash;he was a congest, I believe&mdash;saying that Mr. Thompson had said to him: &ldquo;Well, refuse it, and you will not get a second chance.&rdquo;  Honestly, if I were in Mr. Thompson's place, I would say the same thing.  Put yourself in Mr. Thompson's place.  He went down there to do the right thing, obviously against the wishes of the landless men. He found a considerable amount of intimidation. No doubt, there has been gross intimidation.  It came to firing shots and interfering with fences and so on.  He tried to distribute the lands rightly amongst the congests.  He found, I am sure, some of the congests a bit nervous.  I can see the whole picture down there.  He said: &ldquo;You are entitled to a certain amount of land. You can refuse it if you like, but if you refuse it you will not get a second chance.&rdquo;  That is what I would say myself.  I am sure that that is what happened.  Why should I ask another Inspector to go down there?  These <Col N="1360" /> people have been in possession of the land for a couple of months.  They are being blackguarded and intimidated to some extent.  They hold possession, and they are entitled to hold possession. Why should I re-open the whole thing again?  I do not want even to give the impression that we will re-open it.  We are going to stand over this scheme.  The Land Commission is not going to be intimidated into giving land to people who are not entitled to it by methods which, I am sure, the Deputy does not know very much about.</P>
    <P>What would happen if I sent an Inspector down there?  The fat would be in the fire again.  They would say we were changing our minds.  We are not changing our minds.  These people are entitled to the land, and they should get it.  The Land Commission would be badly advised and would be setting a bad precedent for the distribution of further lands in Clare if they yielded on this question.  I really could not agree to that course.  Let the Deputy show me a single case in which a person got land who should not have got it. He mentioned the case of Mrs. Butler. I think there were good reasons in that case.  There is room for honest differences of opinion in regard to Mrs. Butler's case, but I genuinely agree with the inspector's point of view.</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated that he is going to cater for the congests before the landless men and that the Senior Inspector is capable of making up his mind on the question.  How can the Senior Inspector distinguish if he does not go on the lands, make investigations and interview the people concerned?  Does the Minister say that the other eight or nine men are all landless men?  If that is so, where did this Inspector, who made the report, get the information if he did not go on the lands?  That brings you back to the point that Inspectors from the Land Commission very often get their information not from the people generally in a district but from some particular person or persons in a district.  They go for their information to these persons, and, in this particular instance, that is the case. The Minister said that it would be <Col N="1361" /> weakness on the part of the Commission to go back on their decision.  The Commission had full information as to what they were about to do long before they sanctioned the scheme.</P>

      <P>They did it in the light of that.  I have the file before me with the names of the people who applied.  Mr. Thompson got the names. It is easy to get the names because they all apply.  He states their circumstances. I will make a few quotations from the file as samples and to show how full the information that we have got is.</P>
      <P>John O'Grady&mdash;ex-soldier National Army, age 29, married, two children; stock: one cow, two calves, four yearlings; holds house and three acres as sub-tenant on a farm recently acquired by a man named O'Connell, of which no particulars of tenure were available.</P>

    <P>I have a long list of these applicants, with every detail in connection with every applicant.  When an applicant applies, the Inspector goes to him and finds out his circumstances.  One thing an Inspector can be sure of is that everybody who has the slightest claim to land will apply.  To start with, he has got all the names.  He can go round then and find out personally the circumstances of each person.  That is what is always done.</P>
