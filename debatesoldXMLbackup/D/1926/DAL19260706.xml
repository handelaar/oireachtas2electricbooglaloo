      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether any revised form of lease for signature by the occupiers of houses on the Marino Estate of the Dublin Corporation has been submitted to him for approval by the Dublin City Borough Commissioners; whether he has yet signified his approval thereof; and whether he has been, or will require to be, satisfied before giving approval that the occupiers of the houses have been consulted in respect of any matters in which the new lease may depart from the terms of the original lease or the published statement upon the basis of which applications were made for the houses by the present occupiers, and in respect of any matters, such as repairs and maintenance of joint water and drainage services, ornamental grounds, insurance against expensive external repairs, etc., which it may be necessary or desirable to provide for either in the lease or by supplementary agreement.</P>

      <P>I am answering the Deputy's two questions on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisional agreements entered into by the tenants of houses provided <Col N="2112" /> by the City Commissioners under the Housing of the Working Classes Act at Marino terminated on the 31st of March last.  Leases, the terms of which were approved of by me, were entered into with the tenants from the 1st of April last and the covenants therein are alike to those in the provisional agreements, save that provision has been made for the collection weekly instead of half-yearly of the purchase money and other charges (interest, rates, etc.).  This alteration was made at my request, as I was not satisfied that the leases used in previous schemes safeguarded the Commissioners sufficiently against loss through non-payment by the purchasers of their annuities. There has been no other departure from the published statements upon which the houses were offered for sale.  The water and drainage services and ornamental grounds are, so far as I am aware, to be maintained by the Commissioners.  The repair clause in the lease is that usually contained in such instruments and merely requires the purchasers to maintain the premises in proper sanitary condition and repair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that in the original arrangement the lease was drawn up so that the houses should be let and not purchased; that the consequence of the change in the terms of the lease is that there is a common water supply, common scavenging and sanitary arrangements and, yet, an individual ownership; and that the general proposals of the new agreement have not been submitted to the tenants or purchasers? Further, will the Minister agree to advise the Dublin Corporation, or the Commissioners, to enter into consultation before the purchasers are asked to sign this new agreement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is not on the lines stated by the Deputy.  So far as I am aware, the only change in the lease is that instead of having to pay half-yearly the arrangement is to pay weekly, which is a better arrangement from the tenants' point of view. As, however, there seems to be some difference of opinion on the matter I shall make further inquiries.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that John Ennis, Cloncurry, Enfield, Co. Kildare, who was employed by Lord Cloncurry on the grazing farm of Ballinakill (Cloncurry Estate), for the last ten years, is unemployed since the 26th January, 1926, the date on which the Land Commission took over possession of the farm, and whether he will ask the Commissioners to consider this man's claim for a parcel of land to enable him to provide for his family, as there is no other employment available in the neighbourhood.</P>

      <P>The lands of Ballynanty, comprising 430a. 3r. 27p., on the estate of Wilmott Smith, have been included in a provisional list of lands which, if not excluded in consequence of a valid objection, would be vested in the Land Commission on the appointed day.  The owner objected to the acquisition of the lands, and this objection was heard by the Commissioners and disallowed by them.  On appeal by the owner to the Judicial Commissioner, the decision of the Land Commission was upheld.  The price of the lands, in default of agreement, was then fixed by the Land Commission. The owner has appealed on the question of price and the appeal was heard by the Judicial Commissioner, who has reserved judgment.  A scheme for the division of the lands cannot be settled until the price has been fixed.</P>

      <P>With regard to the remaining amendments on the Order Paper, it may be well that I should deal with points of order arising on them before resuming the Committee Stage.  Amendment 3 goes pretty far, but I am prepared to allow it.  On the decision on it, however, will depend Amendment 6.  Amendments 4 and 5 are outside the scope of the Bill. Amendments 7 to 11 are in order. Amendment 12 falls if 10 is accepted, and 13 is consequent on Amendment 10.  Amendments 14 and 15 are in order.  Amendment 16 depends on Amendment 14.  Amendment 17 may be moved.  Amendments 18, 19, 20 and 21 are, I think, intended to carry out certain alterations if Amendment 3, to insert a new section, were carried. Amendments 22, 23 and 24, dealing with the insertion of the word &ldquo;proposal&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;application,&rdquo; are dependent on Amendment 14.  Amendment 25 depends on Amendment 7.  Amendment 26, for a preamble, proposes to introduce into the Bill a principle which was not in the Bill as passed on Second Reading, namely, that &ldquo;it is expedient to extend the protection of home industries by means of import duties,&rdquo; and is, therefore, out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the section and substitute a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Whenever it appears to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that it is expedient to secure full examination of any proposal for encouraging industrial development in Saorstát Eireann by the imposition, alteration or removal of a customs duty on the importation of goods of a particular class or description the said Minister may, if he so thinks fit, refer such proposals to the Commission for examination and report.</P>
      <P>(2) The Commission shall examine every proposal referred to it under the section by the Minister and shall report to the said Minister on the several aspects specified in the Schedule to this Act of such proposal or such of those aspects as are applicable thereto.</P>
      <P>(3) When examining any proposal referred to it as aforesaid the Commission shall hear any person who desires so to be heard and who in the opinion of the Commission is substantially representative of persons, trades or interests (including any association or body of consumers) who would or might reasonably be expected to be affected by the decision of the Minister in respect to the subject of inquiry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greater part of this proposed new section is already embodied in the section in the Bill, with certain alterations. The proposal is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce may be brought into the question as to expediency. He, as the Minister who would necessarily be in touch with the condition of trade and industry, would be the Minister who normally and in the mind of the average man would be expected to deal with the examination of proposals for encouraging industrial development.  I do not know whether any Deputy thinks that the question of <Col N="2119" /> industrial development, the starting of industries, or the creation of new opportunities for employment, is primarily the function of the Minister for Finance, but my understanding of the position of the Ministers concerned is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has that matter under his control.  I read previously the reference in the Ministers and Secretaries Act to the functions of the Minister for Finance.  Under the same Act we have the functions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as follows:</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce which shall comprise the administration and business generally of public services in connection with trade, commerce, industry and labour, industrial and commercial organisations and combinations, industrial and commercial statistics, transport, shipping, natural resources, and all powers, duties and functions connected with the same, including the promotion of trade and commerce, by means of educational grants, etc.</P>
    <P>The inquiry that it is proposed to hand over to this Commission is obviously connected with trade, commerce, industry, and labour and industrial and commercial statistics, and one would naturally think that it would be the function of the Department of Industry and Commerce to undertake these inquiries.  So that the opening of this proposed new section says:</P>
    <P>Whenever it appears to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that it is expedient to secure full examination of any proposal for encouraging industrial development in Saorstát Eireann by the imposition, alteration or removal of a Customs duty on the importation of goods of a particular class or description the said Minister may, if he so thinks fit, refer such proposals to the Commission for examination and report.</P>
    <P>So that the first paragraph of the proposed new section fits in exactly with the functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce as defined in the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  Consequently the Commission's duty, having examined these proposals, would be <Col N="2120" /> to report to the Minister on the several aspects specified in the schedule.  In the third sub-section of the proposed new section, I have followed the line which proceeds in the third sub-section of Section 2 of the Bill, but have included &ldquo;any association or body of consumers.&rdquo;  The sub-section in the Bill says:</P>
    <P>When considering any application referred to it as aforesaid the Commission shall hear every person who desires so to be heard and appears to the Commission to be substantially representative of persons, trades, or interests who would or might reasonably be expected to be affected by the granting or refusing, in whole or in part, of the concessions asked for in such application.</P>
    <P>My proposal is to alter that in this way:</P>
    <P>When examining any proposal referred to it as aforesaid the Commission shall hear any person who desires so to be heard and who in the opinion of the Commission is substantially representative of persons, trades or interests (including any association or body of consumers) who would or might reasonably be expected to be affected by the decision of the Minister in respect to the subject of inquiry.</P>
    <P>The chief alterations there are the reference to proposals as distinct from applications, and the inclusion of &ldquo;any association or body of consumers.&rdquo; There seems to be no thought in the section as drafted that the consumers of goods are interested, and while I am glad to support and give the utmost weight to the arguments of the producers of goods affected, or the intermediate consumers of goods which might enter into manufacture, I think it is essential, if there is to be a real examination of any proposal, that associations of consumers should be heard if they so desire.  But the main change sought to be effected by the proposal is to make the Minister for Industry and Commerce the Minister who will set the inquiry in motion.  I think that that should commend itself to Deputies. As I said on another amendment, this should not be a commission set up <Col N="2121" /> by a department, and having regard mainly to the revenue aspect of any proposal for protective tariffs, that it is clearly a matter, in the first place, for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and that it is an application to him and a reference by him that should set going the machinery for inquiry.  It is on these grounds that I move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson's amendment would widen the duties of the Commission to an extent that the Government does not desire.  I explained when introducing the Bill that we proposed to ask the Commission to deal with a certain type of proposals which would be supported and defended in a particular way, proposals in regard to which it ought to be comparatively easy to have most of the facts sought out and presented to the Commission. Cases might arise when the Government would wish proposals to be examined which did not fall within the scope of the Bill and the ordinary scope of the Commission, and we felt that this class of case would be best examined by some kind of an ad hoc body.  A Commission that is set up to do a particular kind of work and conduct a particular kind of examination ought not to be asked to do a different class of work and to conduct an examination which would require a different kind of approach.  I gave the case of sugar beet as an example of the kind of thing that might arise again and as a type of case which would be better dealt with by some committee set up to deal with it specially, than by the Tariff Commission. The whole principle of the Bill is that agricultural production should receive the same attention as industrial production, and one of the reasons why the Minister who was made responsible for the Commission was the Minister for Finance, was simply that he was departmentally neutral as between industry and agriculture and that it would be contrary to the general scheme of the Bill if the Minister for Industry and Commerce could refer proposals to the Committee and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture could not, because, while so far <Col N="2122" /> the Government has not been satisfied that by means of tariffs any good can be done to agriculture, that view is not accepted by everybody.  There are people who perhaps would say that in general it is true that nothing much can be done for agriculture by means of tariffs, in certain respects help can be given to agriculture, and, as a matter of fact, in so far as the assistance that we are giving to sugar beet is a tariff assistance&mdash;and it is in part a tariff assistance&mdash;we are doing something for one branch of agriculture.</P>
      <P>I do not think it should be contemplated that we say that we accept the position, as we do accept it, that tariffs can do good for industry and we are prepared to consider proposals for further tariffs in relation to industry, but that we have closed our minds in regard to the application of tariffs to the advancement of agriculture. We have not closed our minds, and we would be prepared to consider on the merits any proposals for tariffs applied to any agricultural commodity, in the same way as we would consider tariffs as applied to a manufactured article.  We did, in the last Budget, apply in a very small way a tariff to an article which is more an article of agricultural produce than of manufacture, and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture intimated that in that line he was perhaps prepared to go somewhat further.  I object to Deputy Johnson's amendment on two grounds. I object to it because it proposes to give certain powers to the Minister for Industry and Commerce which are not given to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, and because it proposes to oblige the Commission to carry out a type of investigation that would not be in line with their proposed day-to-day work.  If you get a committee to conduct original investigations you would, perhaps, choose your personnel and staff differently from the personnel and staff that you would choose if the Commission were sitting somewhat judicially to hear cases made for and against and to arrive at the facts as a result of the information that in the main was brought to its notice by people who are interested, one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2123" /> I do not say that the Commission would conduct no original investigations. I think it would have to conduct some, but, in general, it would be up to other people to conduct the original investigations and to put the main-facts before the Commission.  The Commission would have plenty of work for a considerable period in dealing with proposals actually made by manufacturers, and, if other proposals have to be considered, they can best be considered by appointing some <i>ad hoc</i> body.  I think there are no industries existing in respect to which the Minister may want to put forward proposals and in regard to which some substantial number of those engaged in these industries would not themselves put forward, or have not already put forward, proposals.  Any proposals from the Minister would be likely to relate to industries which have not been brought into existence here and that sort of investigation would be an entirely different type of investigation from that on which the Commission would be ordinarily engaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister has not seen his way to accept the point of view expressed in this section. The only sound argument he used was, perhaps, that this section was confined to industrial development and that the Minister for Agriculture might have something to say in connection with agricultural proposals.  As regards that point, I should like to point out that this section was intended to form part of a scheme and that a section which the Ceann Comhairle has ruled out gave power of inquiry into agricultural proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made the case that there might be a proposal that should be dealt with by a committee specially set up.  That would not be affected by my proposal.  This section only refers to proposals which the Minister may, if he thinks fit, refer to the Commission. It does not deprive him of the power to refer any question he wishes to any special committee which he may set up. The Minister also spoke of the line of <Col N="2124" /> approach.  That, as I have already said, is the chief objection I have to the proposal in sub-section (2)&mdash;that the line of approach is faulty and liable to create an entirely wrong outlook in regard to any proposal for a tariff on imports.  The Minister is encouraging us to think of this whole question from the point of view of the pecuniary interests of the manufacturers, and he is obliterating the effect upon the national life or the possibility even that proposals may be sound and yet may not be desired by the manufacturers.  I think that line of approach in the section in the Bill is wrong, because it only deals with applications made by interested parties.  The section I propose would allow any proposal the Minister would think desirable to be submitted for inquiry, whether it came from the manufacturers or from the dream of a citizen while lying on the sand-banks at Portmarnock.  However, the Minister has refused to give any support to the proposal, and I leave it to the Dáil to decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one point with which the Minister did not deal in his reply.  That was with reference to sub-section (3).  Would the Minister consider inserting in the Bill the words referred to in Deputy Johnson's amendment&mdash;&ldquo;including any association or body of consumers&rdquo;?  The Bill as it stands does not apparently give a right of hearing to representatives of consumers.  The words are &ldquo;persons, trades, or interests who would or might reasonably be expected to be affected ...&rdquo;  There are many associations of consumers who might wish to be heard.  Labour organisations particularly have a right to be heard.  As the Bill stands, I do not see how these organisations can put their case before the Commission.  Perhaps the Minister would consider the question of inserting those words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Commission can hear anybody it likes, but the Bill prescribes that certain people shall be heard.  It gives the right to certain people to be heard.  The insertion of these words would make it mandatory on the Commission to hear quite a large number of consumers' <Col N="2125" /> leagues if they put forward witnesses. As the Commission is obliged to report on the effect of any proposal on the cost of living, I think it will be obliged to get sufficient evidence to satisfy itself as to the consumer's point of view.  I do not think it would be wise to make it mandatory on the Commission to hear associations of consumers. They might do far better by selecting individual consumers, or other persons, rather than associations which might be got up to give evidence.</P>

      <P>May I suggest to the Minister that the very fact that there is put in in sub-section (3) a mandatory clause saying that the Commission shall hear certain people, and that there is no other section of the Bill which even suggests that other people should be heard will be taken as a prohibition against the hearing of other people?  When you specifically include certain classes of people, there is implied a refusal to hear others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is so.  I think the Commission has full power to hear all the evidence it wants to hear.  It was suggested that a limited amount of evidence might, perhaps, be taken, and it was considered necessary that some direction should be put in the Bill as to the people who would be heard, practically as of right.  Of course, there is discretion in the Commission to decide whether or not they are substantially representative of any interest, but there is a clear direction to the Commission to hear people who are substantially representative of any interest.  The intention was no more than that, and I do not think it can be held that there is anything to prevent the Commission hearing anybody it likes.  There is no intention that its power should be limited in any way. Any investigating body set up has prima facie the right to hear the necessary evidence to enable it to come to conclusions.  The Commission is asked to report on a number of things, including the cost, efficiency and conditions of labour in other countries.  That clearly implies that evidence must be heard other than evidence which sub-section <Col N="2126" /> (3) of Section 2 makes it mandatory on the Commission to hear.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Davin, I move Amendment 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (1), line 33, to delete the word &lsquo;modification&rsquo; and substitute the word &lsquo;alteration.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister has intimated that it is not his intention that &ldquo;modification&rdquo; should preclude increase of an existing tariff on any article, but it may appear to the Commission, notwithstanding anything said in this House, that &ldquo;modification,&rdquo; in fact, means reduction. The word is capable of different meanings.  I find in one dictionary the meaning is given as &ldquo;to change somewhat the form or qualities of; to alter somewhat.&rdquo;  The secondary meaning is given as &ldquo;to limit or reduce in extent or degree; to moderate, to qualify.&rdquo; In another dictionary the meaning is given as &ldquo;to set bounds to; to moderate; to change the form or quality of; to alter slightly; to vary.&rdquo;  I quote those definitions to show that there is a possibility that an interpretation would be given this word as a result of which no proposal for alteration by way of addition would be heard by the Commission. I think the generally understood meaning and common use of the word is to alter downwards or to moderate. I therefore propose to substitute for the word &ldquo;modification&rdquo; the word &ldquo;alteration,&rdquo; so that there may be no question in anybody's mind that the change can be effected by raising or reducing an existing tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a very serious question.  I did not ask the Attorney-General for any view on this point, but I asked the draftsman as soon as I saw the amendment.  He assured me that the word &ldquo;modification&rdquo; would have the same meaning as &ldquo;alteration,&rdquo; in regard to proposals to raise or lower tariffs, and he preferred his own word.  I do not know whether there is any objection to changing it to &ldquo;alteration,&rdquo; but I am assured that the word &ldquo;modify&rdquo; means what Deputy Johnson desires to have in the Bill.  As we have all our Bills coming from one office, I presume <Col N="2127" /> the same word would be used in other Bills where a similar meaning was desired. Being assured that the meaning is what the Deputy desires, I prefer to let the Bill stand as drafted.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;modification&rdquo; has been translated &ldquo;athru,&rdquo; after considerable perturbation of mind on the part of the translators.  On seeing the word first they were of opinion that the simple meaning was &ldquo;maolu,&rdquo; which would signify lessening or reducing or blunting. After some research in the dictionaries they came to the conclusion that that was not correct and they used the word &ldquo;athru,&rdquo; so that the draftsman and the translators were of the same opinion.</P>

      <P>That strengthens my case.  The fact that there are two or three average men who have already assumed that the meaning of the word was to lower or to reduce, may well indicate that the Commission, which will be presumably composed of average men, would interpret it as the average man would interpret it.  They would not be judges versed in the law and, consequently, being placed in the position of interpreting this measure, they will interpret it as the average man will interpret it.</P>

      <Col N="2128" /> SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>(1) Whenever an application to the Minister is referred by him under this Act to the Commission, the persons by whom such application is made shall, as a condition precedent to the consideration of the application by the Commission, pay to the Commission in accordance with regulations to be made by the Minister for Finance such fee not less than ten pounds nor more than one hundred pounds as the Commission with the sanction of the said Minister shall fix, having regard to the length of time and the expense which in the opinion of the Commission will be involved in the consideration of the application.</P>
    <P>(2) All fees paid to the Commission under this section shall be paid into or disposed for the benefit of the Exchequer by the Commission in such manner as the Minister for Finance shall direct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete the section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to seek the deletion of the section, and, therefore, I will oppose the motion that the section stand part of the Bill.  Again it is a question of the validity, the wisdom, of this method of approach.  It is presumed that persons interested, who are expecting to make money out of the change, will be prepared to put down a fee of possibly £100 to buy an inquiry.  It is a sum which the Commission may reduce to not less than £10.  I think that is quite unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission is to have power to make the fee anything up to £100, and presumably the Commission is going to ask for that fee before the inquiry begins. It will not know the case that is to be made or the amount of research that is required until after the inquiry has begun.  Then there would be an attempt either to reduce or increase the sum originally fixed.  For fear that inquiries may extend beyond the contemplated or expected range, the tendency will be to impose a fee of £100 in every case, with a possible hope <Col N="2129" /> thrown out that if the inquiry does not extend too widely there may be a refund, though there is nothing said about a refund in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think the principle involved is a bad one, and the working out of that principle as proposed in the section may well cause trouble.  The revenue likely to be obtained is not going to be very great unless the maximum sum is charged every time.  When it is borne in mind that before the Commission touches the matter there must have been a prima facie case made to the Minister, then again it seems to me to be undesirable that a charge of this kind should be made.  Surely, if the Minister can be convinced that a sufficiently good case is made to refer an inquiry to the Commission, that should obviate the need for making any charge upon those making the application.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand what case can be made for this unless it is to regard this fixing of a tariff as purely a private venture, and persons who may hope to profit by it are to pay something on account in the way of purchase money.  I think that is an entirely vicious principle to insert in the Bill, and I hope the Committee will not accept this section.</P>

      <P>This amendment is very necessary.  I think it is disgraceful that people should be fined for trying to develop the industries of the country, and that is what this section amounts to.  It is quite obvious that if the Commission are to do their work properly they will have to charge a maximum fine in every case.  The Commission will have to examine every case, compare it with the costs in other countries, and with relative efficiency and conditions in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How the Commission are going to get that information I do not know, unless they are going on a tour round the world.  The expenses will be very considerable, and if the Commission are to carry out to the letter the provisions of this measure as it stands now, the expenses will be very high and, consequently, they will impose this maximum fine on everybody who has the temerity to suggest protection in regard to some <Col N="2130" /> home industries.  I think that is undesirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at the matter from the merely theoretical standpoint, a good deal may be said for Deputy Johnson's amendment; but the provision is inserted in the Bill to deal with the actual situation and with the probabilities as we see them.  The Commission will have quite enough work to do for a considerable period dealing with serious and meritorious proposals.  It is desirable that it should be saved as far as possible from wasting time on trivial or frivolous matters, or on proposals which would be initiated but not pursued.</P>
      <P>It is true there is power in the Bill under which the Minister for Finance need not submit proposals to the Commission; but it is not intended to use that power except to exclude proposals that on the face of them appear to be ridiculous and appear to be such as would involve absolute waste of time. It would be impossible in practice, in view of the pressure that would be applied, for the Minister for Finance to refuse to send to the Commission any proposal which was not such as would be scouted by anybody who would hear it outlined.  People would submit a proposal that had not, perhaps, very much in it, but if the Minister for Finance refused to send it to the Commission it might be suggested that he was afraid to have it examined or to have the facts disclosed; he would be forced to avoid a deluge of attack and to send proposals to the Commission that could get any support at all or that anybody would be favourably impressed with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broadly speaking, all proposals, except proposals indisputably ridiculous, must be sent to the Commission.  There is an obligation on the Commission, once proposals are referred to it, to investigate them and hear statements for and against them.  Once a proposal comes before the Commission a considerable amount of the time of the Commission and its staff is bound to be occupied.  What is desired, then, is that people shall be subject to some payment to cause them to give consideration to their own application in <Col N="2131" /> advance of making it and before they take up the time of Commission with it.  It might easily happen that somebody would put forward a proposal for, say, the manufacture of bootlaces here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be a very good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be.  I will take any other article the Deputy likes to mention.  I only indicate it as a thing which I think would not be a very good proposition, because I think there is not a consumption here to justify the setting up of such a manufacture. I do not want to use that more than as a name for the purpose of argument.  A proposal might be put up, certain suggestions might be put forward and prospects held out, and the Minister for Finance could not say they were clearly ridiculous.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson said the manufacture of bootlaces might be a very good proposal.  That would have to be referred to the Commission and the Commission would have to spend time investigating it.  The people who put up that proposal might not be very serious about it.  We often find people who are very good at throwing out suggestions and, to insure that the time of the Commission would not be wasted if any such proposal comes before it, it is thought desirable that some small sum should be paid by those who want to take up the time of the Commission considering their proposals, delaying necessarily the hearing of other proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals can be made to cover articles now embraced under one tariff; Deputy Johnson indicated that the other night.  We have a single tariff on apparel, but there are hundreds of different classes of apparel and you might have scores of applications coming in for a higher rate for articles now charged simply 15 per cent.  You might have very large numbers of proposals coming before the Commission, and it is essential that the Commission should deal only with people who put them forward seriously, who are prepared to submit evidence and who are going to pursue the application when opposition <Col N="2132" /> is offered.  As regards written cases, you might have certain people who would put these up to the Commission, but a mere preliminary examination of them might take up a considerable amount of time.  The people who put them up, on receiving queries and demands from the Commission for further statements of fact, might begin to be less enthusiastic about their applications and might decide to go no further with them.</P>
    <P>In cases like that it might mean that the time of the Commission and its staff had been occupied for a week. The provision in the Bill is not to make the Commission self-supporting or to go any distance towards that.  It is simply to weed out a certain class of application in what we regard as the best and most practicable way of doing so.  We have some such provision in the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act. Under that Act people who make application for a guarantee must pay a certain fee.  The object of that was to prevent a waste of time on proposals that were not really serious.  It might have been said that the Minister for Industry and Commerce could weed out such applications himself and not let them go to the Committee.  The argument that I have already used would apply there, that pressure that could not well be resisted would be brought to bear on the Minister to allow an investigation.  Otherwise it would be sure to be immediately asserted that there was some hidden reason for preventing an investigation.  It was thought better to send all the applications to the Committee unless they were very bad indeed.  Once that is done the wheels are set in motion, the staff is occupied with them and time must be spent on investigations, and no fee that could be fixed would eliminate that.  There are people who would put up quite impracticable proposals and who probably would be prepared to pay a fee.  There are others who would put up similar proposals and who would not pay any fee, and that really is simply what is aimed at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It astonishes me that the Minister cannot offer any other test than the monetary test for judging the practicability or the <Col N="2133" /> seriousness of any proposal.  I would have thought that one of the first things for a Commission of the kind to do would be to prepare a questionaire and see if the answers showed that the necessary attention had been paid to the proposition.  If these answers seemed to warrant further inquiry, then that could be done without any paying down of £100, £50 or £10.  The Minister has not even said that this is to be a deposit as proof of good faith and of serious intention.  It is to be a sum which would be forfeited whether the tax is imposed or not.  Whatever may be the result of the inquiry, this £100 will be forfeited.  Of course, the effect of it will be that unless the people concerned have got promises beforehand or some kind of assurances or an <Col N="2134" /> excessive amount of confidence as to the tendency of mind of the Commission, they will say: &ldquo;We are not going to risk £100 for an inquiry which is obviously going to be queered from the beginning.&rdquo;  I say that if this examination is to be of a serious kind, having regard to the promotion of industrial activities in the country, that any proposal which is backed up by a show of evidence should be inquired into whether a payment is made or not.  I think that the rejection of this section in the Bill will simply go to emphasise the point I have made, that it is to be a mere jockeying for personal interests.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Every report made by the Commission shall be laid upon the Tables of both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal is that the reports of the Commission shall be laid on the Table of both Houses of the Oireachtas. That is an obvious requirement.  If publicity is to be given regarding the evidence, the report of the Commission. <Col N="2137" /> which presumably will be based upon the evidence, ought to be laid upon the Table of the Dáil and Seanad, and as there is no provision for that, I move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is that a report should be published and that would include, I should say, formal submission to the Oireachtas.  It is also intended that the proceedings, so far as they can be published and do not affect the private affairs and credit of individual firms, should also be published. There may be certain cases where it would not be desirable, at any rate immediately, to lay a report before the two Houses.  For instance, because of trade conditions or owing to questions of forestalling, or a variety of questions, it might not be desirable to have reports laid for any appreciable length of time before the taxing resolutions were introduced.  Then you might have cases where, for some reason, it was felt desirable that the taxing resolution should be postponed till the ordinary Budget time.  There is no reason, of course, why definite protective duties should not be imposed at any time of the year.  On the other hand, there might be reasons for postponing the introduction of resolutions which would flow from a report, until a particular period of the year.</P>
      <P>If this section were inserted it would lead people to expect that immediately the report had been issued, in whatever circumstances, it should be laid on the Table.  I think that normally it certainly should be laid immediately.  It is suggested, however, that there might be exceptional cases in which it would not be desirable to lay it immediately, if any action which was contemplated following a report was action which it was advisable to delay for, say, three or six months.  A Commission of this sort, on whose reports Parliamentary action was liable to take place, would be a Commission whose reports ought to be laid on the Table.  I am not strongly against the amendment, but I can conceive that there might be cases in which the existence of this provision in the Bill would lead to some misunderstanding or misapprehension.</P>

I may say again that practically all the amendments I have put forward are based upon the precedent of the South African Tariff Board, which has been said to have been the precedent followed by the Ministry in drafting this Bill.  This section is also contained in that particular South African Act, but it has the word &ldquo;forthwith.&rdquo;  I deliberately omitted the word &ldquo;forthwith,&rdquo; leaving certain option with the Minister.  One of the claims for favourable consideration put forward by the Minister on behalf of the Bill is that it is going to ensure publicity with regard to any and every inquiry, but publicity of the final result of the inquiry is not ensured. That is like asking a court to be public in respect to the evidence, but not to be public in respect to the judgment. &ldquo;You may hear the evidence for and against the prisoner, but we are not going to make public the verdict of the jury or the sentence.&rdquo;  I think it is essential that such a provision should be in the Bill.  If the Commission is to take evidence in public, to inquire into the pros and cons of a case and report to the Minister, and the Minister may take action or refuse to take action, may impose a tariff or refuse to impose a tariff, it is surely essential that the House should know upon what report the Minister is acting or refusing to act, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To say that the report would be laid upon the Table, even if no such provision is inserted, leaves a question open, if the one important report that we would all like to read, is not laid upon the Table.  We will not know whether a report has been presented to the Minister or not.  He may put it in a pigeon hole and say: &ldquo;We are not acting upon it for certain reasons, notwithstanding that the report is strongly in favour of a tariff on a particular article, we are not going to act upon it, but we will not report the fact to the Dáil.&rdquo; Surely it is essential that the reports made to the Commission shall be laid <Col N="2139" /> before the Dáil and Seanad.  I have left a certain discretion as to the time which the Minister may choose to lay the report before the Houses.  I am not sure that that is entirely wise, but I can see some point in the Minister's plea, and as I foresaw it, I dropped the word &ldquo;forthwith.&rdquo;  Certainly I will press for the reports to be laid upon the Table and leave the discretion as to the time to the Minister.</P>

      <P>As I have said, I do not feel strongly with regard to this, and if it is clearly understood by the House that the amendment does give some discretion as to time to the Minister in cases of necessity, and as that will be on record, I am prepared to accept the amendment.  Normally, I think the report would be laid upon the Table immediately, but I repeat in agreeing to accept the amendment, that cases might arise where delay of a considerable number of months&mdash;six months or so&mdash;might be necessary in the interests of an industry itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I just suggested the question of adding the words &ldquo;average or standard profits.&rdquo;  It may avoid further discussion on the matter if I were to urge that profits are a matter for inquiry as well as conditions of labour and costs of labour.  That phrase again has been omitted from the South African Schedule, and inasmuch as the other proposals in amendment 3, Section 2, have not been under discussion, it is necessary to raise this matter on the Schedule.  I urge that it is an important matter that ought to have the consideration of the Committee as well as any of the other references, and it might be desirable to get from the Minister some view as to whether he would accept that, so as to avoid having to prepare an argument.  The Schedule, as it stands, deals with a certain class of inquiry; it omits one very essential factor, that is the rate of profit.  So long as you are going to refer all the questions to the Commission, <Col N="2144" /> I think it is important that we should refer that question to the Commission. If it is found that excessive profits are reasons why the cost of living, for instance, is affected, there should be no barrier against an inquiry into that question.  I would put it to the Minister now that he should declare his willingness to insert in paragraph 2, or in one of the other paragraphs, this reference to average or standard profits which is the phrase in the South African Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to agree to extending the inquiry to oblige the Commission to report on the average or standard profits.  I think that we would be setting them practically an impossible task.  If we had the Commission in operation for a number of years, or if we had a general tariff in operation for a number of years and the Commission were dealing with applications for modifications in that general tariff we might then well include and inquire into average or standard rates of profits and hope to have the Commission in a position to present a report in that matter.  In the situation in which we stand, with protection just recently initiated with the Commission itself dealing, as it will in the main, with proposals for quite new tariffs, as it certainly will be doing for the next two or three years&mdash;for some time at any rate it will certainly be dealing with proposals for new tariffs&mdash;it seems to me that to make it obligatory for the Commission to report on average or standard rates of profits would be setting it a task which it could not accomplish.  That inquiry would be not only proper and useful, but also necessary under other conditions.  We propose this machinery to deal with existing conditions here, and I think it would be quite impossible for the Commission to arrive at anything in the way of standard rates of profits here.  If, for instance, the boot tariff had been in operation for seven or eight years, and if we had a reasonable number of factories here owing their existence largely to the tariff and operating under its protection, and if any modification were proposed in the boot tariff, we might then ask the Commission to report on what <Col N="2145" /> was the average rate of profit.  That would be an entirely different situation. In other conditions, I admit readily to Deputy Johnson, that might and should be a subject of report by the Commission, but in the circumstances that exist here I think you would be overburdening the Commission.  You would be asking it to do something that it could not do effectively, that would involve much inquiry and would give us no results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Bill receives the final approval of the Dáil I would like to make a formal protest against its passing. My protest is grounded principally on the basis that the Minister has, by the introduction of this Bill, evaded a definite promise, or pledge, given in the Dáil on his Budget statement of last year.  I am rather surprised that the Dáil has taken the lame explanation given by the Minister in this regard in the complacent way in which it has taken it.  I believe that a statement of that kind, made, as I am sure it was, with the full recognition of its importance, should not be made by any Minister and be gone back upon at a later stage.  I maintained from the very introduction of protective tariffs that the Government had no authority to introduce them and that before the introduction of even one of these tariffs, the Government should have in some way given the people an opportunity of expressing their considered opinion on such an important matter of policy.  Either by means of a General Election or a plebiscite, the people should have had an opportunity of giving expression to their views in regard to the whole matter of the policy of protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might remind the Minister that when Mr. Baldwin, Premier of the British Government, in 1923, I think, decided that it would be in the interests of his Government and of Great Britain to adopt a policy of protection, before taking any steps to put this policy into operation he decided that he should first appeal to the people and get a mandate from them at a General Election.  Having found that the people did not favour that policy he abandoned it, and has continued the present Government without the imposition of any protective tariff.  I maintain that the same course should have been followed here.  I have my own opinion as to the advantages or disadvantages of protective tariffs. Other people have theirs.  But once an appeal has been made, once a decision of the electorate has been taken, and if that decision be in favour of protection, for my part, if I were then a member of the Dáil, I would be willing to give what help I could in the selection of industries which might be considered <Col N="2149" /> to be entitled to the advantages of protective tariffs.</P>
    <P>Ministers have claimed that they have embarked on a policy of what they call selective protection, that through this Commission they will select the industries which have most claim for protection, which are likely to benefit themselves and which are likely to benefit the nation to the greatest extent from protection.  But I believe that once we embark on a policy of protection there is no drawing back. It has been stated by a well-known economist that protection spreads like a fire.  He says: &ldquo;Fire is not more certain to spread amongest inflammable material than is protection, when once sanctioned, to embrace a constantly increasing number of industries within its influence.  Each new protective duty which is imposed inevitably creates a demand for more protection in other industries.&rdquo;  That is the claim that I made in my first statement on this policy, that having embarked on it there would be no withdrawal, and despite the claim made by the President that the Government has only embarked on a policy of selective protection, my confirmed opinion is that in the course of a very short time we will have what will practically amount to a general tariff.  We already have tariffs on 50 per cent. of all imported articles of an non-agricultural type, and surely 50 per cent, is a very considerable advance in the direction of a general tariff.</P>
    <P>We may take it that this Commission will undoubtedly recommend the imposition of further tariffs, and I can see the day&mdash;and it is very near at hand &mdash;when we will have protection in the case of at least 75 per cent. of articles of import which, to all intents and purposes, will amount to a general tariff. I reiterate the statement that this Government has no right whatever to impose a series of tariffs without first getting the authority of the people.  The general public are very much uneducated on this whole question, and with the opportunities that would be given them at a general election of hearing the matter discussed, hearing the arguments <Col N="2150" /> pro and con on different platforms, and reading the statements which would probably appear in the Press, they would have an opportunity of forming some kind of intelligent view on the matter.  I maintain that the real issues have been side-tracked, and that the arguments used in favour of tariffs are not economic arguments but arguments of sentiment, arguments which are and can be proved to be unsound economically, but which appear to be very plausible and very reasonable from a sentimental point of view. They are built upon political propaganda, statements made by people who, when they made them, had not the responsibility of deciding what, from an economic point of view, would be best for the country.  I believe that in the course of time&mdash;perhaps a very short time&mdash;the farmers, if they are not now opposed to this general policy of protection which is being adopted, will undoubtedly realise that a general protective policy is detrimental to their interests, and the farmers of other countries where tariffs have been imposed are almost unanimously against tariffs, and are almost unanimous in their belief that tariffs are injurious to their industry.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to elaborate the arguments in connection with free trade and protection any further at this stage, but I cannot let this opportunity pass without registering a protest against the action taken by the Government in introducing this Bill, thereby evading the definite promise and pledge that was made to the Dáil by the Minister for Finance a promise and a pledge which I relied upon to be kept and because of which I felt that the imposition of further protective duties would have been left until the electorate had had the opportunity that they ought to have of deciding whether they are or are not in favour of this policy, which I maintain is a policy of a general tariff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Referring to a statement of Deputy Heffernan's, I think, on a previous reading of the Bill, the Minister explained that his statement of two years ago was not a pledge but <Col N="2151" /> rather a declaration of policy.  He said at that time:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In submitting these proposals, I should like to state quite distinctly that the Government does not believe that it would be for the benefit of this country to establish a general tariff or anything approaching it. And it will not allow itself to slip into the position of having laid the foundations of a general tariff by imposing each year a few duties and giving rise to a host of claims for others.  After the present Budget this Government will not break any further fresh ground in the matter of protective tariffs before the general election.  We may alter the rate or adjust the scope of a particular duty; and we may, if we think necessary for revenue purposes, propose to the Dáil Customs Duties on manufactured goods of a luxury or semi-luxury type, but we will not propose fresh duties of a protective character on manufactured goods of common and necessary use.</P>
      <P>There are certain loopholes in that statement, and I think it might be valuable for the country, and particularly of use to those manufacturers who may be tempted to put down their £100, if we had a statement from the Minister as to whether he really intends to keep to his word, whether it was a pledge or a statement of policy, as enunciated in April, 1925, in his Budget speech.  Are we to understand that any Customs Duties that may be proposed between now and the general election&mdash;which may and probably will include the next Budget&mdash;will not involve any duties of a protective character on manufactured goods of common and necessary use, or are we to understand that any inquiry made by this Commission, if it is intended to have effect before the next election, will only relate to Customs duties on manufactured goods of a luxury or semi-luxury type, or only in respect of revenue-producing articles?  I think, in view of the terms of the Minister's statement of policy, or pledge, that it would be desirable that we should have a re-statement of policy or a new pledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice supported, I think, by one or two other Deputies, <Col N="2152" /> told us that in respect of 50 per cent. of the imports of manufactured articles, apart from agricultural produce, a duty was already imposed.  I wonder will the Minister for Finance confirm that.  I have endeavoured to pick out certain figures from the returns that have been made available, trade and shipping statistics, etc., but I cannot find anything approaching 50 per cent. It would be well, I think, if we had from the Minister for Finance an authoritative statement as to what proportion of, say, last year's imports are now subject to an import duty, leaving out such articles as have been subject to duty for some time, tobacco, sugar confectionery, wines and beers, but taking general manufactured commodities. If the Minister would tell us what proportion of the total is now subject to import duties it would help us to understand exactly where we are and how near we are to having a general tariff established, because if, in fact, 50 per cent. of these imports are subject to duty we are certainly approching the general tariff, and that was what the Minister declared himself opposed to doing.  I think, in the interest of those who may be tempted to put in applications under the provisions of this Bill and to risk the loss of their hundred pounds, we should know whether there is any chance before the next General Election that manufactured goods of common or necessary use will be the subject of protection.</P>

      <P>It is the maximum, but, as has already been pointed out, it is very likely to be the normal figure. It is not possible to know before the inquiry begins how wide it will be, and the temptation will always be to demand the maximum figure.  I think we should have a statement from the Minister on these two points&mdash;first, as to the proportion of imports of manufactured goods which are at present subject to tariff, and whether the statement of the Minister for Justice is at all accurate, and secondly, whether there is any intention to depart from the pledge or statement of policy of the Minister, making allowance for the loop holes <Col N="2153" /> which he permitted himself when he made that statement.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice referred to a calculation that was made some time ago, when making the statement that he did.  I have not before me the exact basis on which that calculation was made, but I believe it excepted certain articles, which could not reasonably be produced here, from the list of those which might be tariffed. There was a calculation that about 50 per cent. of the manufactured articles that might prima facie be the subject of tariff, were actually the subject of a greater or lesser tariff at the moment. From that list of imports there would be excluded, in addition to agricultural produce, which the Minister for Justice excluded, items like coal, paraffin and so forth.</P>

      <P>With regard to the other question to which both Deputy Johnson and Deputy Heffernan referred, in my Budget statement of this year I modified, to some extent, the statement of last year.  I said that we had had under consideration the position of industries&mdash;I do not pretend now to quote the exact words I used; I am endeavouring to give the gist of what I said on that occasion&mdash;about which it was alleged that they would become extinct if some action were not taken before the general election.  Our view, I said then, was that we would have to deal with those industries on their merits and that we would have to weigh up the cost of preserving them, if they could be preserved, and the loss which the community would suffer if they were allowed to expire.  I do not wish to add anything to that statement at the moment.  The Tariff Commission will present us with reports which will enable us to consider the case of each industry on its merits.  As I have already said, we are no more anxious than we were a year ago to go ahead of public opinion or to commit the country to any policy which we believe it does not desire to adopt.  We have anything but a desire to present the electorate with a general tariff position, which it <Col N="2154" /> might not be easy to get out of. On the other hand, we do feel that it would be wooden and irresponsible for us not to consider the cases of individual industries of value to the country, which might cease to exist within a short period and which might be preserved at no great cost to the community. We will be enabled, as a result of the operations of the Tariff Commission, to weigh up, with reasonable accuracy, the costs of any action which may be proposed in regard to a particular industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we enter upon this question, I should like the Minister to consider the wisdom or otherwise of proceeding at the present time by this method.  I think I am right in saying that the Minister suggested on Friday last that we would take these draft rules into consideration on Thursday and Friday of this week and that at a later stage&mdash;perhaps the week following&mdash;we might take a formal motion.  Having received the rules and attempted to read them, one is struck by the great importance of the procedure.  In respect of some of the rules&mdash;particularly the District Court rules&mdash;we are, in fact, legislating on matters which, I think, have not even been the subject of rules hitherto. I think the shortness of notice and the importance of giving proper consideration to the rules would make it desirable that we should postpone consideration of the question until after the recess.  If that is not possible, then we should be given a longer time than has been suggested up to the present for consideration of them.  It has not been possible to get the considered opinion of those who are familiar with the practice of the courts, because the draft rules were not in circulation amongst the public.  Postage is not a very rapid means of communication, and sufficient time for consideration of these rules in the country has not been allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have looked up the debate that <Col N="2156" /> took place when the Courts of Justice Act was being passed and I find that a certain section was inserted by the Dáil in that Bill regarding the laying upon the Table of rules to be made by the Rule-making Authority.  That section stated: &ldquo;All Rules of Court made under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas within fourteen days after they are made if the Houses of the Oireachtas be then sitting or, if not, within fourteen days after the commencement of the next session of said Houses, and if a resolution be passed by either House within one month after the rules have been made&rdquo; certain effects were to follow.  There was contemplated in that section, as sent up from the Dáil, a month within which to consider the annulment or rejection of those rules. That section was amended in the Seanad and the Dáil agreed with the Seanad amendment.  The section in the Act, therefore, reads: &ldquo;No Rules of Court made under the Act shall come into operation unless and until they have been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and have been approved by resolution of each House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, there is formal approval required by the Act as it stands, but obviously, in the minds of the Dáil, at any rate, there was contemplated a time for the consideration of those rules.  I submit that it is not reasonable to ask us to deal with so very important a matter on such short notice.  In the discussion which took place in the Seanad, the Attorney-General, dealing with these rules, explained that &ldquo;of course the Rules of Court are in the nature of legislation.  The rules will be made by the Rule-making Authority and will be laid on the Table of the Seanad as well as on the Table of the Dáil.  Each House will have complete authority over them; they become in the nature of what one may call administrative legislation.&rdquo; That was repeated several times, and, of course, it is legislation.</P>
    <P>We ought not to be asked to legislate in this fashion without receiving ample notice, because it is not a trivial matter. It is a matter that raises the very gravest issues for the respective prisoner, plaintiff or defendant.  In some respects it seems to me these rules are <Col N="2157" /> going far beyond what Deputies contemplate as a rule of Court.  &ldquo;Pleading, practice and procedure of the Courts&rdquo;; that was the phrase used, and the general understanding was that they ought to deal with the machinery of the courts.  I find it deals with the imposition, the fixing, of penalties in certain respects, and I submit that such a matter will require a good deal of examination and possible alteration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney-General, at that time he was Deputy Kennedy, explained, in regard to the amendment sent down by the Seanad to the Dáil, that &ldquo;under the new section it would be the duty of the Minister to come in and propound the rules to each House, explain them, and get a positive agreement with them.  The Government recommend that that proposal be accepted.&rdquo;  And it was accepted, but I submit it was on the understanding that there would be ample opportunity to examine the rules and discuss them and obtain information upon them from the Minister.  It is not possible to give proper consideration to or discuss these rules at this stage.  I am certain it will not be possible to do it, with informed knowledge, even within a week's time.</P>
      <P>The courts have proceeded so far without any new rules.  It has been said here that they have been able to carry on acceptably, and I think, as much the lesser of two evils, if they are evils, that the courts should carry on still longer without new rules, rather than that the Dáil should be asked to confirm rules of this kind, that is, legislation, without having a proper examination of the rules, and giving an opportunity for informed opinion to be brought to bear upon them.  I plead with the Minister that there is no necessity for passing these rules before the recess.  We ought to have ample time, and the public in the country ought to have ample time and opportunity to examine the rules after publication before the House is asked to confirm them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to add my voice to Deputy Johnson's in asking <Col N="2158" /> that this matter be deferred.  Before these rules were in my hands, I was of opinion that the matter of the rules being made available for the courts at the earliest possible moment was one of very great urgency.  It may still be so, but I endorse what Deputy Johnson has said, that to pass these rules without a thorough examination would be a mistake. It is very hard for the ordinary layman to understand the trend of those rules in the time at our disposal. I think this House, before it passes what Deputy Johnson calls legislation &mdash;I believe the House has not the power to change the rules without the concurrence of the Minister or the Committee&mdash;should have some opportunity for considering these rules.</P>
      <P>To agree to the rules without a knowledge of what we are agreeing to would be wrong.  I was anxious to get enlightenment on this subject.  A special meeting of a committee appointed by the Chamber of Commerce was held to-day.  I was not able to be present, but I understand that when considering these rules they suggested several alterations, and that without a thorough examination of the rules. That being so, I certainly would like to emphasise that this House should not be asked to pass the rules right off.  If necessary, the rules could be held over until we re-assemble after the Recess. Our constituents may have something to say in regard to the rules, and it is essential that ample time should be given for any alteration that may be considered necessary.  I may say it is the unanimous wish of business men, so far as I know, that the rules should be held up until everybody has had ample time reasonably to examine them.</P>

      <P>I also desire to support the Deputies who have spoken in this connection.  It is the duty of Deputies to have some idea of these rules and their suitability before they give approval to them.  While I recognise that a proper understanding of the rules is a matter largely for legal minds, still there are possibilities that rules considered by certain interests to be unsuitable will be brought to the attention of Deputies if opportunity for consideration is given.  In view of the impending adjournment of the Dáil the <Col N="2159" /> only reasonable course for the Minister to pursue is to adjourn consideration of these rules until we re-assemble after the recess.</P>
      <P>It was quite impossible for Deputies, since the draft rules were issued, to give them the consideration they require. I have not even read some of the rules.  I doubt if other Deputies have made any kind of a reasonable study of the rules.  While I do not hope to be able to grasp the full significance of the rules placed before us, still I feel it my duty to make the best shot I can at understanding them. The constituents of some Deputies may take objection to certain rules and it is desirable they should have ample time to advise those Deputies so that the objections can be brought to the notice of the Minister.  I strongly urge the advisability of postponing consideration of the rules until we re-assemble in November.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no question of the Dáil adjourning before considering the resolution for the approval of these rules.  I am not prepared to take responsibility for the degree of inconvenience and dislocation that would result to the legal profession and the general community by a failure to provide rules of court for the Michaelmas Term, and to that end it is necessary that the Dáil and Seanad would consider these rules before adjourning for the summer, so that the necessary forms may be printed and the procedure settled in time to have these rules in operation for the Michaelmas Term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is complaint of insufficient time, then consideration of the rules may be left over until the Dáil re-assembles to consider Bills back from the Seanad; but the rules and the resolution approving the rules must be considered by the Dáil and by the Seanad before the summer adjournment. We must know whether or not they are going to be approved.  They are rules emanating from three committees composed of people who certainly have a knowledge of the courts and court procedure.  The Dáil, in the Courts of Justice Act, provided that <Col N="2160" /> the rules could be made only with the concurrence of such committees.  The rules, therefore, must constitute an enforced compromise, and the rules must be passed or rejected as a whole by the Dáil when made by me.</P>
    <P>It is something of an advantage that the Dáil has now an opportunity of considering them in draft and not actually made.  After Friday, 9th July, the date on which the Court Officers Bill becomes law, the position would be that rules formally made and signed by me would be before the Dáil, and the Dáil would have to accept or reject these rules as a whole.  There is a different position just now.  A set of rules has been given to me by each of the three committees, the Committee of the High Court and Supreme Court, the Committee of the Circuit Court and the Committee of the District Court.  These proposed rules are before the Dáil.  If there is exception taken to particular features, there would be time for consultation with all or any of the committees before the rules are actually made by me under the particular section of the Courts of Justice Act, so that there is at any rate that large counter-balance to the inconvenience and the charges of insufficient time for deliberation, that one could discuss and consider the rules now, still leaving time for reference back to the committees by me and a certain amount of consultation on matters on which strong views were held here.  But my mind is clear: the Dáil is not entitled to subject the public and the practising profession to the inconvenience that would result from the absence of Rules of Court for the Michaelmas sessions, and if the Dáil will not consider these draft rules this week then they must be asked to consider formally made rules later before the summer adjournment and to accept or reject those as a whole.</P>

The draft rules that have come to me from the Committees are here for discussion and there would be the opportunity for further contact between myself and the Committees on particular points that emerged in the course of the discussions.  But, after the rules have been made by the Minister on whom the onus falls, then the only course for either House would be to accept those rules en bloc or reject them.</P>

I think that the whole body of rules will have to be examined critically, because I fear, in view of what one sees in an odd rule, that these rules of court are going to bind us as a legislature to enactments which we would not, if we were giving critical examination to them, approve of.</P>

I never assumed that that was the case.  The point was never put to me.  Reading the section in connection with this matter, it never occurred to me that anything was necessary except that the rules should be made and circulated: that a resolution of the House should be passed approving of the rules, and that unless a resolution was passed by the House approving of the rules in general, that the rules could not become operative.  I would like to know from the Minister in this connection, assuming that the rules are approved of, what is the procedure for amending them subsequently.</P>

They are experimental&mdash;very much subject to alteration as well as observation of their working in practice. It will be beyond question necessary to bring before the Dáil and the Seanad for their consideration proposed amendments.  These rules are put forward, therefore, very much in a tentative, experimental and provisional way.  They are, in no sense, the final Rules of Court, and in no sense do they represent the considered opinion either of the committees or of my own Department as to what the final rules of court ought to be.  We are entering on a new system, and people qualified to advise and with a considerable knowledge of legal practice acting on the committees, have put forward these rules for approval.  If approved, their operation will have to be watched, and any amendments that are considered desirable will be brought forward as a result of such observations.</P>

      <P>With the concurrence of the committees.  The position on the question of leaving the court without rules for the Michaelmas Session is quite clear, and I do not feel that I am entitled to do that.  Neither do I feel that the Dáil or the Seanad is entitled to do it, and if the draft rules will not now be considered, then formally made rules with a resolution of approval, which must be simply passed or rejected, will have to be considered before the Dáil adjourns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of procedure, I think it will be seen by <Col N="2164" /> reference to the Act that it is possible to introduce any new rules at any time or the alteration of a rule, and that those alterations, or any new rules, must receive concurrence.  Therefore, I submit that the meaning of the section is that every rule must receive formal approval, and that they do not all stand, one consequential on another. They do not all deal with the machinery of the courts.  I will submit and argue to the best of my ability in regard to some of those rules, that they should be the subject of a specific Act which had gone through the regular processes in the Dáil: that they are outside the authority of a resolution of this House and of the powers of the Ministry and of the Rules Committee. I am not speaking now about the High Court rules, because I have not had an opportunity of examining them, but in respect to the District Court rules I have taken a little care in looking through some of them.  I believe that the Ministry is asking entirely too much from us when it asks us to pass these rules without the fullest possible consideration.</P>

      <P>If it were desired to open a discussion on the rules to-day, I confess that I am more or less at sea with regard to them.  With regard to the rules for the High Court or the Supreme Court, as far as I am concerned, while amendments may be suggested, there will not be any radical changes moved in regard to them. Obviously there will be some things which it may be desirable to bring before the Dáil&mdash;that is, criticism from the commercial point of view.  I would ask for time to have the rules examined in the light of their application to the commercial interests.  I do not know whether it would meet with Deputy Johnson's wishes if the Minister were, say, to fix to-day a little ahead so that we might then be in a position to deal with the rules.  The Minister, of course, has told us that if the rules are not considered before Friday the Court Officers Bill will have become an Act on that day on being signed by the Governor-General, and then, of course, the time for criticism of those rules will have passed.  We will then be simply told either to accept or reject them.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any validity in Deputy Johnson's point that each rule must be considered separately and be the subject of a separate resolution.  It seems plain that the Minister, when making rules, must have the concurrence of certain committees.  When he has that concurrence he is to make rules, and having made them he is to get the approval of the Dáil under Section 101 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No Rules of Court made under this Act shall come into operation unless and until they have been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and have been approved by resolution of each such House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that means that a resolution approving of them has to be passed. As to the Deputy's point with regard to amendments of the rules, I take it the Minister can alter the rules by the same process by which he is proposing to make rules now: that is to say, since the Minister is here and is responsible to the House it would be possible, by some procedure, to represent to the Minister in the House that certain things ought to be done.  The Minister could then initiate alterations if he thought fit.  In other words, any rules that are approved of would be subject to alteration, and such alteration may be initiated by the Minister at the request of the House or as the result of a debate in the House.  I do not accept the view that each rule must be considered separately and that there must be a separate resolution for it, nor is it right to say that the House makes the rules.  The rules are made by the Rule-making Authorities and approved of by the House.</P>

      <P>Quite. The procedure proposed by the Minister is that we should now debate the draft rules; that if any points are made <Col N="2166" /> which the Minister considers valid, he shall endeavour to have alterations made by Friday, and that on the day when we meet to consider business from the Seanad we shall take the motion for the approval either of these draft rules or of the draft rules with such amendments as may then have been made with the concurrence of the proper authority.  Does the Dáil agree to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that he should allow us time to examine the rules and compare them with existing rules&mdash;existing fees, existing punishments&mdash;before signing the rules.  He proposed last week that we should have until Thursday for the consideration of the draft and then have another week for the consideration of the rules as signed.  We have not had time to examine the rules and make comparisons with the existing practice. Just to give the Deputies an idea. There is on page 18 of the District Court Rules a reference to imprisonment in lieu of fines.  The existing practice is to fix a maximum imprisonment of three months.  The proposed rules suggest giving power to the District Justice in the case of a fine of £30 and upwards and to impose imprisonment for six months.  That is to be done by a rule of court&mdash;by the Rule-making Authority.  I should have thought that that was essentially a matter for the legislature.  We are dealing now not with the practice of the court, but with the liberty of the citizen&mdash;an entirely different matter.  I question very much whether such a thing as that ought to be done by a rule of court.  Then, I find somewhere else power given to the District Justice to pay away certain proportions of fines to the prosecutor or the informer, as the phrase goes.  I do not know whether that is the kind of thing that ought to be fixed by a rule of court.  Looking through those District Court Rules, they seem to me to extend far beyond what the Dáil had in mind when we spoke about rules of court, dealing with procedure and business arrangements of the administration of justice.  When we are dealing with penalties to be imposed for certain offences, that surely is a matter <Col N="2167" /> for the legislative authority, not the Rule-making Authority and not the Minister.  Consequently, we ought to have some time to consider the rules.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Deputy read Section 36 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Home Affairs may at any time and from time to time after the passing and before or after the commencement of this Act, but with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance in respect of any matter affecting public revenue or expenditure make rules to be styled &ldquo;Rules of Court&rdquo; for carrying Part I. of this Act (including the hearing of appeals from the Circuit Court and cases stated by the District Court), and may annul or alter the said rules and make new rules.  In particular rules may be made for all or any of the following matters:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Then there are set out nine headings:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  pleading, practice and procedure generally (including the entering-up of judgement and the granting of summary judgement in appropriate cases) in all civil cases, including revenue cases and proceedings as to the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution and proceedings in the nature of a petition of right;</P>
      <P>(ii)  pleading, practice and procedure generally in all criminal cases before the Central Criminal Court or any court of the High Court Circuit or the Court of Criminal Appeal;</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Deputy speaks about a particular rule amongst the District Court Rules.  He says the existing rule provides three months and the new rule provides six months, and goes on to make the case that this is not a matter that should be fixed by a rule at all.  He says that, while admitting that an existing rule makes the particular provision and enables the justice to order imprisonment for three months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy spoke of an existing rule.  I am really very much open to suggestion.  I can see an advantage in being able to discuss rules in draft before they are made.  That is not my advantage; it is the Dáil's.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister leave them in draft for another week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is a tinge of irregularity even in discussing draft rules.  The Act contemplated that rules would be made, and when made brought before the Dáil and Seanad. The reasons for discussing draft rules are (1) the fact that the rules could not be made until 7 days had elapsed that would enable the Courts of Justice Act to be signed, and (2) the desire, which, I think, is general, for an early adjournment. There was a suggestion made then that the rules as received from the Committees could be discussed by the Dáil, formally made when the Courts of Justice Act was signed, and that the resolution of approval might be taken on the day that the Dáil will re-assemble to consider Bills back from the Seanad.  It is for Deputies to weigh one thing against another; to weigh the advantage of having draft rules before them against the disadvantage of the limited time they have had to consider them.  If they object to considering draft rules in that limited time, then the alternative seems to me to be to consider made rules later.  The rules can be made on Friday, and, I <Col N="2169" /> think, will be made on Friday, and the Dáil can re-assemble next week or the week after and consider these rules. But their position then will be, that they have simply to pass or reject the resolution that will be on the paper asking for their approval.  That is not quite the position now.  I do not want to force a particular course on the Dáil, and the only course that I do feel like forcing on the Dáil is that these rules must not be left over for approval until next November, with three or four months following that for the printing of forms and the preparation of minutiae of one kind or another before they can be put into effective operation in the courts.  I want the rules passed before the Oireachtas adjourns for the summer, so that the long vacation may be availed of to make the necessary preparation for their effective functioning in the Michaelmas sittings.  I think that it would be unreasonable and unfair to the public and to the profession if the Oireachtas were to insist on adjourning over the summer before considering the rules.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The profession and the courts are of the highest importance, and it is no doubt creditable to the Minister that he wants to give every consideration to them, but I protest against placing the legislature in second place in that respect.  I say that this House is entitled to consideration from the Minister at least equal to that given to the legal profession.  I say that we are not getting equal consideration when we have those rules put up to us in this manner and are asked to consider them at a time when it is impossible to discuss them fully.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of the legal profession, and the Deputy knows it; it is a question of the needs of the public&mdash;the needs of the general community.  The real point I am making is that however deserving the Dáil and the Seanad are of an adjournment, they are not entitled to adjourn if a genuine public need is there to be catered for and if their powers of approval of Rules of Court for the public convenience remain to be operative. There is one way of doing the thing: to discuss and consider these draft <Col N="2170" /> rules.  The other way is to wait until the rules are made and more mature consideration given to them, and consider them then.  But it has got to be one thing or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The only other business besides those rules is the consideration of amendments from the Seanad.  A day cannot be fixed for the meeting for that purpose, as the date on which the Seanad will consider certain Bills cannot be stated with certainty. Therefore, it will be necessary to adjourn until some day next week, or perhaps the week after, to consider business from the Seanad.  I think it will be necessary to give some liberty for the fixing of that particular date, but this is the only other business.  I think the normal way of doing this business would be to make the rules and submit them for approval.</P>

I would just like to put it to the Minister that it is equally in the interests of the public that those rules should not be discussed by the representatives of the public until such time as these representatives have had an opportunity of reading them.  If the members of this House were to agree to discuss these rules without having had an opportunity of reading them, they would not be acting in the interests of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely I am in the hands of the Dáil in this matter.  My only insistence is that the rules cannot be left over until the November session, but as between taking up the consideration of these draft rules to-morrow and moving the adjournment now until such time as it is necessary to call the Dáil together to consider matters back from the Seanad, I do not really mind, because we can then take up the consideration, not of draft rules but of made rules.  When the Dáil reassembles to consider matters back from the Seanad, there can be three resolutions down asking approval of the three sets of rules&mdash;the High Court and Supreme Court, the District Court and the Circuit Court rules.  I think that date is sufficiently far ahead not to leave it in the mouth of any Deputy that he was taken short in the matter, or that he could not give a considered verdict on the rules.  I could make the rules on Friday.  Then when the Dáil would come back to consider matters back from the Seanad, it could consider the rules.  In view of Deputy Johnson's refusal <Col N="2172" /> to take up the consideration of draft rules to-morrow, I think, perhaps, that is the best thing to do, to simply leave the whole matter over until the Dáil reassembles to consider Bills that come back from the Seanad with whatever amendments are made there.  Then the Dáil would face the task of considering rules of court formally made.</P>

That will give us some time to read the rules.  As it is, none of us has had an opportunity of reading them.  If the Minister could delay the signing of the rules for a few days it would possibly meet the objection.</P>

      <P>The Deputy does not realise that normally the proper position under the Courts of Justice Act is that what would be before the Dáil would be the rules made by me with the concurrence of three committees. The only reason why there is any question of draft rules being before the Dáil is because of the interval before the Court Officers Bill can be signed, and these rules cannot be made until after the Bill is signed, because that deals with officers and offices that will not have statutory existence until the Court Officers Bill is law.  What I have in mind is, I think, clear enough, that the Dáil this week would consider draft rules, that the formal resolution approving of made rules would be taken on the day the Dáil re-assembles to deal with amendments from the Seanad.  There is objection taken to the draft rules now because they have not been in the Deputy's hands sufficiently long.  There is objection even to the taking of them to-morrow.  In face of that objection the best proposal that I can make is that we simply now adjourn until whatever date it is necessary to re-assemble for Seanad amendments, and on that date take up the consideration of the rules and the question <Col N="2173" /> of passing or not passing the resolution approving them.</P>

If I were sure that I would have sufficient matter to discuss the rules by to-morrow, I certainly would put forward a request that the Dáil should meet to-morrow, but I cannot hope to be in any much better position to-morrow than I am in now. Therefore, I see no other course but to agree to the Minister's proposal to bring in the rules as made when the Dáil re-assembles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the normal procedure would be that the rules would be signed by him and submitted to the Dáil for approval. The normal procedure would be to give the Dáil an opportunity for a proper examination of the rules and inasmuch as these are new courts, new institutions, to examine them with great care and compare them with past procedure. When this matter was discussed last week the Minister suggested Thursday and Friday of this week for discussing the draft rules.  I made the objection that there was not an opportunity given for communicating with people in different parts of the country who were actually interested and technically competent to deal with such matters.  The Minister then said that there would be another week possibly before the Dáil was asked to finally approve them.  With that understanding, I said that that gives us an opportunity to discuss and make our points in connection <Col N="2174" /> with the rules, and I was prepared to agree.  But there has been no opportunity to discuss this matter and to get informed opinion from the country so that these things can be discussed to-morrow.  I doubt very much whether even Thursday will allow a sufficient opportunity. I have had two or three communications from legal men in different parts of the country, and, notwithstanding the Minister's belief that it is to convenience and assist in the work of the Courts, in each of these cases these legal men say they can carry on quite well for a longer period, so as to give plenty of time and so that these men in the country would have the rules before them and the Dáil could be advised as to what line they could take in the matter.  I think the Minister is taking a line which is not justified, and I, at any rate, will protest and do my best to persuade the Dáil that certain of the rules ought to be altered or refused or the whole of the rules turned down unless the alterations are made on the occasion of the final discussion.  I am not going to take any responsibility for discussing the rules in draft until I have had some opportunity of getting the opinions of people who are competent to deal with such matters.</P>

      <P>What does the Deputy want?  Because really my anxiety is to meet him on everything except one thing, and that is the leaving over of the rules until November.  If he wants an adjournment until to-morrow he can have that.  If he wants an adjournment until Thursday, he can have that.  If he wants this matter left over until the Dáil reassembles to consider such amendments as may be made in the Seanad, that can be done, too.  It is largely a question of finding out what the general desire of the Dáil is, and naturally because of Deputy Johnson's position very special consideration will be given to his desire.  There is not any anxiety on my part to rush the rules without sufficient consideration, but there is a very definite determination not to leave the courts and the litigants without rules for the Michaelmas Session.  Therefore, I say the Dáil and the Seanad, before adjourning for the <Col N="2175" /> summer, must consider the Rules of Court which I will make when the Court Officers Bill has been signed. Now, I am open to suggestions as to the date to which we could adjourn.</P>

When the Dáil comes together again there must be before it the Rules of Court, unless the position were to be that it was to have one meeting in ten days' time to discuss the draft Rules of Court, then, after some suggestions had been made, that it would come back again in a week's time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems scarcely sound.  If the Court Officers Bill is law, and if rules may be made, then rules should be made by me with the concurrence of these three committees. It was an accidental circumstance that led to any question of draft rules being before the Dáil at all, but once the reason for that is removed, namely, the Court Officers Bill has become law, what should be before the Dáil is the Rules of Court.  Now, when will we consider those rules if we have dismissed the idea of considering draft rules?</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy <Col N="2176" /> have, in addition, to have a meeting of the Dáil to consider the Bills back from the Seanad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of the Minister wishing.  Really it is a question of what we consider our conception as to the rights and the needs of the community.  As to the Deputy's tendency to challenge me in the matter of physical stamina, I will just let that go as mere peevishness.  I want to know definitely from Deputy Johnson and his Party and the Dáil generally when they would wish to meet to consider the Rules of Court.  I posit merely this, that the Dáil should consider the Rules of Court on the dates that would admit of their being in effective operation for the Michaelmas Session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to the Minister and the House that after the Rules of Court have been made he should give the House at least the time that was proposed in the Bill that went up from the Dáil to the Seanad and which was the mind of the Attorney-General and the Ministry when the Courts of Justice Bill was submitted to the Dáil, that is to say we should have thirty days within which to consider the Rules of Court before finally approving them.</P>
