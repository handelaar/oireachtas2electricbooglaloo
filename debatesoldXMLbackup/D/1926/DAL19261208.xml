    <P>The following question appeared on the Order Paper in the name of Pádraig O hOgáin (An Clár):&mdash;</P>
    <P>To ask the President if he is aware that many Saorstát Nationals are at present domiciled within the disturbed area at Hankow, in China, and if he will state what precautions the Executive Council of Saorstát Eireann proposes to take regarding the safety of these nationals.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state how many old age pensions granted prior to the introduction of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1924, have been reduced in each county of the Saorstát; the total amount of such reduction in each county, and, whether the administration necessary to carry such reduction into effect necessitated an increase in the staff dealing with old age pensions ordinarily.</P>

      <P>No figures are available from which the information required could be compiled for the reason that in 1921 the Commissioners of Customs and Excise, London, discontinued by order the returns which had previously been furnished annually by each pension officer showing, as regards his own station, the number of old age pensioners at each rate in each administrative county and borough; and the practice of keeping these returns was not revived until December, 1924.  The consequence is that, from 1921 until December, 1924, there is a gap in the records; and as there are no figures showing the position, county by county, immediately prior to the coming into effect of the reduction in 1924, it is impossible to furnish a reply to the first and second parts of the question. With regard to the final part of the question, the additional work in connection with the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1924, did not entail any increase in the staff normally employed in dealing with old age pensions.</P>

      <P>It is not intended to utilise this building again as a Prison and it is therefore proposed to make a Closing Order at an early date in accordance with the provisions of Section 30 of the General Prisons (Ireland) Act, 1877.  The effect of this will be that the building will re-vest in the County Council on the expiration of twelve months after the date of the closing order, unless in the meantime it is utilised for some public purpose. No such purpose is at present in contemplation.</P>

      <P>Notice of the Deputy's question was the first intimation I received that there was any cause of complaint in respect of the matter to which it refers, and I regret that the Deputy has thought fit to raise such a matter in this way in the first instance and without any previous communication with me.  I cannot but feel that it is a waste of Parliamentary time for a Deputy to put down a question on a trifling matter of this kind without making any effort whatever to ascertain the facts by addressing an enquiry to the responsible department. I am now taking steps to ascertain whether Messrs.  Evans and Norton are entitled to any further remuneration, and will communicate my decision to the Deputy when my inquiries are complete.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. PATRICK W. SHAW Mr. PATRICK W. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. PATRICK W. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state (a) what are the duties of the Gárda Síochána in connection with the administration of the Cinematograph Act, 1909; (b) who are the responsible authorities for approval or otherwise, as to the suitability of the premises or places where cinematographic entertainments should take place, and (c) what authority is responsible for seeing that the provisions of the Cinematograph Act are put in force and carried into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) Under the Cinematograph Act, 1909, premises used for cinematograph exhibitions fall into two classes, (1) those which require to be licensed by a local authority, and (2) those which do not require to be so licensed, that is, premises in which not more than six exhibitions are given in any one year.  The Gárda Síochána have no functions in regard to the licensing of premises, but are entitled to receive at least seven days' written notice of intention to apply for a licence or transfer.  They have, however, been instructed to bring at once <Col N="575" /> to the notice of local authorities any case in which they have reason to believe that the conditions of the licence or the regulations made under the Act have not been complied with.  Where the premises do not require to be licensed notice in advance must be given to the Chief Superintendent of the area in which the premises are situated of the intention to give a cinematograph exhibition.  On receipt of such notice the premises will be inspected by the Gárda and in the event of an exhibition being given in unsuitable premises a prosecution will be instituted. Any Gárda may enter at any reasonable time any premises, whether licensed or not, in which he has reason to believe that a cinematograph exhibition is being given or about to be given, with a view to seeing whether the provisions of the Act or any regulations made thereunder have been complied with.</P>
      <P>(b) The licensing authority is for a county borough, the county borough council; for an urban district, the urban district council; or the town commissioners, as the case may be, and in any other case, the county council.</P>
      <P>(c) The local authority as so defined is the responsible authority for seeing that the provisions of the Act, in so far as they relate to licensing, are carried out.  The Minister for Justice will ensure that the Gárda Síochána discharge the duties imposed on them by the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister contemplating the enlargement of the powers of the Gárda in case they see that the law is not being carried out so as to prevent accidents like that at Drumcollogher rather than wait to prosecute until an accident has taken place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not such legislation in contemplation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give consideration to that aspect of the matter, because fear of prosecution may be very effective, but, if it is not effective in a particular case and many lives are lost through fire, prosecution is not going to be any remedy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy understands <Col N="576" /> that legislation of that kind would embody the principle that the Gárda are, in fact, the summary judges of whether or not the requirements of the Act are being complied with.  In the other case a performance takes place and the Gárda bring a prosecution, and the Court decides whether or not there has been a breach of the statute.  If you give to the Gárda powers of prevention you vest in them the power of deciding whether or not the Act has been complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Where there is a flagrant disregard of the law, such as having a candle burning in contact with films, surely there ought to be some power given to the authorities to prevent that happening and not wait until a disaster happens before instituting a prosecution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if and when the application for unemployment insurance benefit was received from Mr. P.

      <P>Patrick Gorman, of Chapel Street, Ballacolla, last claimed unemployment benefit on the 26th August, 1926.  This claim was disallowed in the first instance, but was subsequently allowed as a result of appeal to the Court of Referees.  As Mr. Gorman had only 5 unexhausted contributions to his credit in the Unemployment Fund, he was only entitled to 5 days' benefit on this claim, and that amount has been paid to him. He has, therefore, exhausted his right to benefit.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if and when the application for unemployment insurance benefit was received by his Department from Mr. Thomas Hibbetts, Lord Edward Street, Mountmellick, Leix; whether he is now prepared to sanction payment of the amount claimed, or state the reasons why he cannot do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>A claim to unemployment benefit made by Thomas Hibbetts, of Lord Edward Street, Mountmellick, on the 1st March, 1926, was disallowed under the first part of Section 8 (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, on the ground that no contribution had been paid for the claimant in or since the 1922-23 insurance year.  Against this decision he appealed to the Court of Referees, which recommended that the claim should be disallowed, a recommendation with which the insurance officer agreed. The claimant will not be entitled to benefit until twelve further contributions have been paid for him, exclusive of those paid prior to the 1922-23 insurance year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Andrew Scully, of Upper Grattan Street.  Portlaoighise, made a claim to unemployment benefit on the 16th July, 1926.  Owing to the circumstance that the claimant had been in receipt of compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act his <Col N="581" /> case required special investigation and had to be referred to the Court of Referees under Section 11 (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. The Court recommended that the claim be allowed and, the insurance officer agreeing, payment for 156 days' benefit was authorised.  All benefit due to date has been paid.</P>

      <P>The total estimate of the Leix County Surveyor for road maintenance for 1926-27 was £52,293 11s. 7d.  I am aware that this sum was reduced by the County Council.  The number of men employed at the middle of last month (the latest date for which particulars are available) on normal road maintenance is stated by the County Surveyor to have been 37.  In addition, the County Council are carrying out road works under loans on which 155 men were employed at the same date, and 145 on the national road scheme.  The answer to the last part of the question is in the negative.</P>

      <P>The question of introducing legislation to regulate the export trade in dressed pork from Saorstát Eireann to Great Britain is under consideration, and the Department are carefully watching the conditions under which this trade is being developed.  The slaughter and dressing of pork for consignment to the Smithfield Market, London, are, generally speaking, being done in a satisfactory manner and, with a few exceptions, the methods of packing dressed pork for transit, whether in crates or wrapped in canvas, are such as have enabled the carrying companies to deliver the meat in good condition.  Salesmen at the Central Markets, Smithfield, have testified to the good quality of a large proportion of the pork sent to London from Saorstát Eireann this season.  In those instances where objectionable methods of packing pork carcases for transit have come under the notice of the Department, representations have been made to the consignors and improvement has therefore been effected.  The Department are fully alive to the injury caused to pork exported and are taking every precaution for the proper packing and delivery of their produce by the few exporters who have shipped pork improperly packed and inadequately protected for transit.  The Department will, if necessary, take further action to safeguard the development of the pork trade and to ensure that the reputation of other Irish produce is not detrimentally affected by carelessness in connection with it.</P>

Up to the present the Department have taken the line of giving instructions to the consignors who have not packed their pork properly. That may be quite sufficient. Other circumstances that will have to be taken into account are the volume of trade and the seasons.  The Department will have to weigh one against the other, and decide whether it is actually necessary to take compulsory powers to regulate this trade.  Up to the present there is no reason to think so; but we are watching the situation, and if circumstances arise that make it worth while to do it, legislation will be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section, I would like to call attention to paragraph (IV.) of sub-section (1).  The whole section deals with the infringement of copyright, and paragraph (IV.) of sub-section (1) lays down that certain acts described in the sub-section shall not constitute an infringement of copyright.  Paragraph (IV.) of that sub-section as it is at present gives leave for &ldquo;the publication in a collection, mainly composed of non-copyright matter, bona fide intended for the use of schools, and so described in the title and in any advertisements issued by the publisher, of short passages from published literary works, not themselves published for the use of schools in which copyright subsists.  Provided that not more than two of such passages from works by the same author are published by the same publisher within five years, and that the source from which such passages are taken is acknowledged.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion has been made to me that that weighs very heavily upon publishing firms in this country.  If you take the larger English firms, such as Longmans' and Macmillan's, they, having through their general business a considerable amount of copyright matter at their disposal, are enabled to publish excerpts from authors; but that power does not lie with the Irish publishers, who have a much smaller trade.  It has been suggested that paragraph (IV.) of sub-section (1) should be amended so as to read: &ldquo;the publication in a collection, of prose or poetry or both, mainly composed of non-copyright matter bonafide intended for the use of schools.&rdquo; This is another change: &ldquo;... passages not exceeding one hundred lines from published literary works... in which copyright subsists.&rdquo; Here is a further change: &ldquo;... that such passages shall not include passages taken from copyright works within <Col N="591" /> five years from date of first publication, and not more than two of such passages from works by the same author are published from any one book.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If it is left in its present state, in books intended for educational purposes there is an allowance of two passages from works by an author within a five-year period.  The amendment would allow you to have two passages of not more than one hundred lines each: that is, you can have two hundred lines from any author in any one book, the limitation of &ldquo;within five years&rdquo; going out, that being changed so that you may not take from any work within five years from the date from which copyright first ran.  That is a definite change from the Act of 1911 and from the Commonwealth Union uniformity.  It is within the Berne Convention.  That proposition was made to me.  It was made too late to allow me to have an amendment put down, or even to allow of sufficient examination; but the examination that has been given to it makes me very definitely disposed to accept it.</P>
    <P>I did get an opportunity of consulting one or two Irish authors about it, and I found that their reaction was favourable in the main.  They said: &ldquo;Certainly the taking of passages from our works will not do any harm. It will not impair our copyright.&rdquo; One man went so far as to say that to a certain extent it was an advertisement. It is not regarded as impairing copyright.  That author said that if the acceptance of such a change as this put the whole copyright matter outside the Commonwealth Union, although he thought it was good, he would then object to it.</P>
    <P>I want to give notice that on the Report Stage I am going to set down this amendment as an amendment of my own, and am disposed to accept it. In the meantime, I will see if the authors generally can put up any definite case as to the benefits that are likely to be derived from being inside the Commonwealth Union in addition to being inside the Berne Convention. I give notice at the moment that that <Col N="592" /> amendment will be tabled at the next Stage.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy O'Connell I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In line 29, to delete the word `fifty' and substitute therefor the word `thirty.' &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposition is to reduce the <Col N="593" /> period.  One purpose might be to ask for some justification for the period of fifty years.  The proposition is that the period of copyright be limited to thirty years, that figure being fixed as being approximately the time which would allow the children of the author to come to manhood.  It seems to be long enough unless there are very good reasons for the extension to fifty years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the term of fifty years after the author's death is really one that is more or less of international agreement at the moment. Article 7 of the Berne Convention reads:&mdash;&ldquo;The term of protection granted by the present Convention shall include the life of the author and fifty years after his death.  Nevertheless, in case such term of protection should not be uniformly adopted by all the countries of the Union, the term shall be regulated by the law of the country where protection is claimed, and must not exceed the term fixed in the country of origin of the work.  Consequently, the contracting countries shall only be bound to apply the provisions of the preceding paragraph in so far as such provisions are consistent with their domestic laws.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is just what the Convention aims at.  The fifty years' period is the one that is common to most countries. There are exceptions to that.  I was hoping to hear some arguments as to why thirty years should be put in instead of fifty.  We can change fifty years to thirty years and still remain within the Berne Convention.  The change to thirty years is again a definite step outside the Commonwealth Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is quite a variety in the periods in the different countries.  In the United States it is twenty-eight years from first publication, with an extension of a further term of twenty-eight years on application. Holland gives fifty years or the life of the author, whichever is the longer; Switzerland, the author's life and thirty years after, and Germany the same.  I make the point that the monopoly rights of the writer ought to tend downwards rather than lengthen. <Col N="594" /> Therefore, I suggest thirty years, as against fifty years in the Bill.  If the Minister thinks there is strong reason in favour of keeping it fifty years I am not going to press the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say I do.  Let it remain for further consideration on Report, because, if there is a definite step out of the Commonwealth Union on sub-section 4 of Section 154, then we can consider this in a much clearer atmosphere.  At the same time, if there is any substantial reason put forward on this point alone, apart from having what happens under Section 154&mdash;if there is any reason why thirty years is preferable to fifty years, then we can discuss it on its merits.  There is variety with regard to the laws in the different countries.  I think it is right to say that, though Deputy Johnson read two or three instances where the term was less than fifty years, still I think it is right to say that, on the whole, the life and fifty years thereafter would be the rule, and that the lesser period would be the exception.  Some countries go as far as the life and eighty years after death.</P>
      <P>There are some, of course, which go to the other side&mdash;a life of ten years after death&mdash;so that I have not any great feeling for it one way or the other.  I cannot see any strong objection to making it a 30 years' period and neither can I see anything in favour of the 30 years.  If we leave this suspended until we see what action is going to be taken on Section 154 we would have a better idea of what is going to happen by adopting the 30 year term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite agreeable to do that.  When we say that property in a work might remain with the author for the period of his life and the life of his children until they become adults, that is a fair principle I think&mdash;that the youngest child will be an adult by the time the copyright expires.  I think that is fairly clear evidence in favour of restricting it to 30 years.</P>

      <P>Is it not a question of value?  In other words, the asset that is created by the copyright if it is for <Col N="595" /> a longer period is a more valuable and saleable asset than if it were for a shorter period.  Is not that the real crux in the thing?</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly.  If you make it 100 years you are giving the author a present from the community for a longer period.  On the question as to whether that present should be of an excessive value, I think that a certain principle might be invoked taking into account the public protection of the author's property for the period of his life and the life of his youngest child&mdash;that is until the youngest child is in a position to earn its own living as an adult.</P>

      <Col N="596" /> This amendment is called for by the need for protecting the workman and avoiding certain difficulties that have arisen on the other side with respect to workmen's compensation.  The term &ldquo;in the course of his employment&rdquo; has been open to a good deal of very wide interpretation and there has been a good deal of controversy as to what constituted the &ldquo;course of employment.&rdquo; The proposal is to ensure that the knowledge gained, which has led to the creation of the value, has been in the &ldquo;discharge of the obligations resulting from&rdquo; the employment: that is to say that a man may get an idea entirely outside his employment and put it to use, but a controversy might arise or legal difficulties might arise if the employer said that the knowledge gained was in the course of employment.  I think it is reasonable protection to ask. I think the intention is clear enough and this is merely to make assurance doubly sure.</P>

It is a question of the ownership of copyright and the statement is that the author of the work shall be the first owner of the copyright, provided that &ldquo;where the author was in the employment of some other person under a contract of service of apprenticeship and the work was made in the course of his employment by that person. ...&rdquo; Deputy Johnson wants to make it, where the work was made &ldquo;in the course of and in the discharge of the obligations resulting from.&rdquo; It is a very intricate legal point.  Originally, in the Workmen's Compensation legislation the phrase was &ldquo;in the course of employment&rdquo; and there was added&mdash;in order to make the thing much more clear and distinct&mdash;&ldquo;arising out of and in the course of.&rdquo; There has not been anything which has brought so much grist to the Bar mill as the insertion of that phrase, and I am afraid that the same thing would result here.  It is only going to pile up difficulties and I doubt if there is very much going to be gained by adding those words, but I think it is <Col N="597" /> going to add much from the point of view of legal practice.  As regards adding anything by way of extra security for the person under apprenticeship, I have my doubts.  I am not very anxious to have the amendment rejected because I think that the intention of the amendment is implied in the Bill.</P>

      <P>We are dealing definitely with the matter of copyright. We are dealing under that with the employment of one person under a contract of service where some matter, say, about copyright is likely to arise.  It is very difficult to see a contract of service in which &ldquo;in the course of&rdquo;&mdash; that is in the hours given over to the purpose of the service contracted for&mdash; the employee could produce anything that would not fall under this regulation here.  He might, of course, by a breach of his contract.  In other words, the employee might apply himself to the production of something outside the terms of his contract with his employer, and in that respect break his contract by devoting time to it which should have been devoted to the service of the contractor on something else.  The whole thing is rather involved, and is <Col N="598" /> open to a lot of argument, but so far as I have been able to read it, the intention of the Deputy's amendment is definitely in the Bill.

      <P>On this section I should like that the House would give some consideration to what are the obligations put upon publishers in this country with regard to the delivery of books to libraries.  Originally, the obligation used to be that copies of every book published had to be delivered to the British Museum, and copies on demand had to be delivered to the places mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 178, and, in addition, to Trinity College, Dublin.  The obligation of publishers prior to this was, therefore, to deliver one copy to the British Museum automatically and to deliver on demand five other copies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obligation which is now placed on publishers, if this is passed, is that there should be delivered automatically <Col N="600" /> to the British Museum one copy, and that there should be then in addition to this the four other copies which are referred to in the sub-section, and one to Trinity College, Dublin, and one to the National Library.  So far, the publishers' obligations are, in the matter of mere numbers, increased by one.  I think it will be regarded by most Deputies in this House as desirable to continue the getting by this country of a single copy of every book published in England.  It is at our disposal as to where that copy should go, but I think it desirable that the single copy coming here should be continued.  That can be obtained if publishers in this country deliver, automatically, a single copy of every book published here to the British Museum.  That is the balance.  We can get a single copy of every book published in England if we give back in return a single copy of every book published here.  That is the bargain that has been struck.  There is a further obligation being put on publishers here to deliver of everything they publish a copy to Trinity College, Dublin, and a copy to the National Library, and then a copy to each of those four libraries outside the country.  There are two points for consideration.  When we get a single copy of every book published in England we are going to continue what used to be the practice, and that book shall go to Trinity College, Dublin, on the grounds that the collection is already there, and that if it were diverted from Trinity College to, say, the National Library, you would only have a collection up to a certain period in Trinity College, and beyond that period in the National Library.</P>
    <P>It was considered under the circumstances advisable to continue the flow of that book to Trinity College, Dublin. In that respect certain representations were made with regard to the difficulty of access to Trinity College Library. The matter was raised before the Committee, and Deputy Professor Thrift indicated that if a case could be brought before him where any genuine reader was refused access to the library&mdash;Deputy Thrift did not admit that there was any lack of access to the College&mdash;and if that could be proved, any difficulties there were <Col N="601" /> would be removed.  Having decided that a single copy of a book coming across from England should go to Trinity College, Dublin, and that a single copy of every book published in Ireland should go to the British Museum this Bill, in addition, imposes the obligation of delivering a copy to the National Library, and four other copies to libraries outside the country. That was objected to at the Committee. One member of the Committee who represented the authors held that it was to the advantage of authors that these books should be sent to these four libraries&mdash;Oxford, Cambridge, Scotland and Wales.  I cannot say that any arguments were put forward to justify that publishers should be made to pay for what was alleged to be entirely for the benefit of Irish authors.  I am not disposed to insist, but I draw attention here to what was laid down.  No amendment was put down in Committee, but one could be put down on the next Stage dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, a matter for argument to find out how far any benefit is going to come to the country, which benefit publishers should pay for while the advantage would go to the authors, as alleged.  The only thing that is necessary is that a single copy should go across to the other side, and that in return we should get a single copy of every book published on the other side. Is it right that the copy coming across should be continued to Trinity College and then having the collection in Trinity College to insist that Irish publishers should add to that collection by giving an additional copy of everything published here in the future. Should we go anything farther, and insist that a single copy of everything published here should go to the National Library, and further that four copies should go across to the other libraries?  I deal with that on Committee, and it can be raised again on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I should like to corroborate, and more than corroborate, what the Minister has said.  I cannot say that Trinity College has been perfect in the matter of this <Col N="602" /> access, because its accommodation is limited, but I can most emphatically claim on behalf of the authorities that it regards at present, and as far as possible in the future will continue to regard, this trust as a national trust, and that the books it holds there are for the good of the whole country.  I can certainly say that within the very limit of what our accommodation permits facilities should be given to every genuine student to consult the books. I believe that pretty soon there will come, and I believe they are in the course of coming, increased facilities, so as to meet every possible demand for consulting books by students in Trinity College Library.  I would entirely support everything the Minister has said with regard to Trinity College. With regard to what the Minister has said in dealing with this section, I think it is a very substantial gain for this country that these copies should be held in the public libraries of other countries.  It brings our literary work and literary culture under the notice of a much wider range of people than it might otherwise reach.  I would certainly take the view that there is a real gain to the whole country by a continuance of this privilege on our part, that is, the gift of those books to the principal libraries of Great Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very doubtful whether this provision of free copies of his books to a variety of public libraries is an advantage to the author.  There are books and books. There are some books which I have no doubt would be largely advertised for the author, by this provision, and it would help to sell the books.  Those who had read the book in the library would buy it.  They would speak about it to others who had not the advantage of or facilities for reading it in the library, and they would buy it.  But there are works, costly of production, that could be sold only at a high price, and the larger the access of the public to these books, without purchase, the worse it would be for the author.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one consideration.  The second, I would submit, is that if it is <Col N="603" /> an advantage for the author, why should the author not pay for it?  Why should the publisher pay for it?  The publisher takes great risks.  The publishing firm has a large amount of capital invested in this.  For one book they publish that sells well, twenty will have to be disposed of later as remainders or go as waste paper to the manufacturers to make pulp.  This, it is contended, and I think with good reason, is an unjust tax upon one particular trade.  Whatever of advantage will accrue to the author let the author pay for, or, let it be a part of the valuable consideration in his transactions with his publisher, as to which of them is to provide the work.  Why a publishing firm in Ireland, handicapped in such a variety of ways, should be called upon to provide rich libraries in Great Britain with free copies it is very difficult to understand.  What advantage will accrue to the publisher?  On another item of it I am very loath to speak, though I think I ought to speak on it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up an illiberal attitude with regard to Trinity College. At the same time, I think it is well to remember that when this privilege was accorded to that great institution it was the only university in Ireland.  Trinity College had many advantages which I will not dwell upon here and now.  This has been one advantage, and admittedly of great price.  The National University of Ireland, which was created in recent years to provide for the people of Ireland who had long been excluded from that great University, has practically no library and no funds wherewith to furnish itself with a library, and here we are making what is ostensibly an Irish Statute, to provide for copyright in Ireland, and instead of coming to the aid of that institution it is proposed that we should perpetuate the advantage that is given to its rich rival.  There should be equity in this matter.  I quite agree to the proposal to give it to the National Library of Ireland.  That is for all the people, and it is open to everybody, practically night as well as day.  There are practically no restrictions, except those of respectability and <Col N="604" /> orderly conduct, as to the classes of people who are permitted to utilise its services.  I certainly would object very strongly to this clause.  I put down no amendment to it, it is true; I wanted to hear what case could be made for it. If there was some sort of reciprocity gained by it, if any advantage could be shown to accrue to the people from it, I certainly would not oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us whether there are any obligations on these libraries to house the multitudinous books that are sent them, or do they make a selection and merely house those which they think are worthy of house room or that fit in with the general scheme of their libraries? May they give away, or throw away, or sell, the free copies that they receive? In general, I would like to know whether this free gift imposes any obligation, or whether there is any understanding with the libraries that have been in the habit, for so many years, of getting these free copies, as to what they will do with them.  I can hardly imagine that they undertake to give house room to every book that is published, and yet if they make a selection I would like to know that there is some standard of selection and discrimination, and what that is.  I make the suggestion, too, that we might consider, where there is any obligation to provide free copies to libraries outside the country, some of the growing new libraries in the United States of America.  Recent experience has led me to the knowledge that there is a considerable number of libraries being built up in the United States, and they are seeking, in out-of-the-way places, for books dealing with this country to build up their libraries. It may be said that they are all able to pay.  No doubt they are, but if there is any question of the benefit of the author to be taken into account, I would imagine that the benefit that would accrue to the author by a statutory gift of this kind to an American library would be very much greater than a free gift to three or four British libraries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question between publisher and author I am not very clear.  I rather imagine that in the fixing of the price to an author the number of free <Col N="605" /> copies more or less enters into the calculation, and I am also aware of the fact that publishers are not ungenerous in sending out review copies, so that I really do not think that that enters into it very much, except one is assuming that in any case the library will possess itself of such a copy, that if it were a book fitting for that library, the library would purchase it. But before making this a statutory gift, I would like to feel that there is some assurance that the books that are to be sent freely to the libraries will be stored, or if there is to be any culling, that those that are discarded will be returned.  The object, I would imagine, from the point of view of the State, in guaranteeing them free books, is to have some assurance that the work of Irish authors will be in some way perpetuated, that it will be at least available somewhere at some future time.  From the State point of view that is the only argument I can see.  It is not our business to go to extremes in advertising the work of authors or the publications of publishing houses.  I am glad that the Minister has offered to leave this question open.  Presumably, while he is opposing the section as a whole, he is not quite sure about the value of this provision and he is leaving it for discussion and possible amendment.  I would like him, between now and the Report Stage, to give consideration to the suggestion that, in place of these British libraries, or some of them, or one of them, it might be more desirable in the interests of those for whom the sub-section is compiled, that one American library, or more, would be substituted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point just raised by Deputy Johnson, I want to emphasise the point that so far as sub-section (2) is concerned only books that are asked for have to be supplied, and therefore the question of storing them does not arise. With regard to other libraries, I believe it is the practice of the British Museum, though I am not quite sure of it, to keep every book.  In connection with Trinity College, so far as Irish books are concerned, I do not <Col N="606" /> think the point arises, because I think they always keep Irish books.  The only question with regard to the keeping of a book or not in Trinity College depends on whether it belongs to the fleeting class of fiction that is so much published nowadays.  That kind is not kept.  But practically none of that type is published in Ireland.  In my original remarks I might have laid a great deal more stress than I did upon what the Minister has said as to the value to the student public of having a continuous collection.  If I did not belong to Trinity College I think I would be able to say as emphatically as I do now that any real student would feel that the value of a collection of books was most seriously impaired if on a certain day he had to go to a certain place to consult some books, and had to go from that to some other place to consult the remaining books.  It is the continuity that is of value to students.  That arises particularly in connection with periodicals, but it is quite general.  It is unfortunate, I admit, that the National University has not the collection behind it that Trinity College happens to have, but we have to face the facts, and the facts are that this collection of books is at present stored in Trinity College.</P>

      <P>I would like to supplement the remarks of Deputy Thrift as to the co-operation that exists between libraries and students generally, apart from Trinity College altogether.  I passed some libraries to-day, and I saw some of Professor Magennis's volumes there.  There are no more welcome volumes in our library than the works of the same gentleman.  More and more our libraries will have to work together and supplement the efforts of one another.  As far as scientific periodical literature is concerned, there is a certain amount of arrangement made to-day between the different libraries.  I am sure Deputy Magennis knows that it exists between the University, the National Library, the Academy, and other institutions in Dublin.  There is no waste and there is no dog-in-the-manger methods, about Trinity College. We welcome students.  Our shelves are open to any scholar, whether his subject is Irish history&mdash; particularly so I might say in that case &mdash;or any other matter.</P>

      <P>I did not speak to disprove, even in advance, anything that my friends Deputy Thrift and Deputy Alton have just said.  I drew attention to the fact that at the time this privilege accrued to Trinity College it was solely because it was the one University in Ireland. Now, because Trinity College has that monopoly for some centuries, the argument is made that it should continue to have that exceptional privilege. There is such a thing in these days as advertising on the part of Universities. Deputy Alton is well aware of that.  He and I are not unconnected with a certain movement which exists to make known to the various universities of the world the special qualities and the special type of studies that may be pursued at a particular institution. Can there be a better advertisement for Trinity College than that everywhere in the Copyright Acts, the Berne Conventions and all the rest, the University that is named is the University of Dublin&mdash;Trinity College, Dublin?  There is that as a natural and inevitable consequence of the continuation of this privilege.  I quite confess <Col N="608" /> that it appears illiberal on the part of a representative of another University to take up this attitude, but at the same time whether I like it or not I feel that I have to make the case.</P>
      <P>What other case, against the idea of doing justice to the National University, is to be placed in the argument? Simply this: that research students, bibliographers and all that fry will find it easier to pursue their investigations under one roof than if they have to go from roof A to roof B; in such a vast city as this, not yet greater Dublin and yet so vast, with so few transit facilities that to go from College Green to Earlsfort Terrace would be prohibitive ! Why, our students and professors go not merely to the British Museum in London but to the Universities of Paris and Italy.</P>

      <P>Well, to University College, Dublin.  Starting off from this period, leaving aside all the advantages of having a collection together, let us say there is a certain book to be delivered by Irish publishers to some one place in the country.  Why should it be the University College, Dublin, rather than the University College, Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should it be University College, Dublin, rather than Trinity College, Dublin?  I think we immediately find ourselves up against the necessity of insisting that publishers will provide not one book or two books, but probably four or five&mdash;to the three colleges of the National University, to the National Library and to Trinity College.  I think if that were the situation and the suggestion, we would have to come to a decision that there should be a single book supplied, and that only to the National Library. That would be the best suggestion, I think, of those.  But all that we are considering, at the moment, is the obligation on Free State publishers to provide for the future a copy of Free State published works, because we cannot impose upon English publishers the necessity of giving any further copies than the one.  That is the most we can get.  That is really the big thing. The question is that a single book is going to come along as it did before and it has to be diverted to some resident place.  Where is that going to be?  I do not say that this is settled. I have consulted quite a number of people about it.  I have spoken about it to the authorities of the University Colleges&mdash;I think to them all, but <Col N="610" /> certainly to two of them&mdash;and I have had some communications with the National Library people, and the whole difficulty is the question of housing. There is not one of them, really, who is prepared to take the single copy of the English published works except there is added to that a provision of money for library accommodation. That was the difficulty I found myself in when we were deciding where this single copy coming from England was to be housed.</P>
    <P>Leaving out the argument as to why a student or research worker should not run about from College Green to Earlsfort Terrace, and from College Green to Leinster Lawn, there is a decided advantage in having a collection together.  If that collection be thrown open to the public, if they have better reading facilities, I do not see that there can be any great complaint on that score.  I do not know what change may happen before this Bill gets through, but I am disposed to think it is a matter of argument as to whether better accommodation can be procured.  Supposing this section goes through in regard to the single book from England being diverted to Trinity College, Dublin, I do hold that a selection should be made.  I think it should be necessary, and it is put into practice at the moment.  If it were found that facilities were not given to the reading public, if they could not get access to this collection, there might have to be a change.  This whole provision can be repealed, but I do think that the advantages at the moment are very much in favour of letting the single copy of the book come as before to Trinity College, Dublin.  I think it follows that there is not much good in arguing that Irish publishers should give a single copy of everything published in Ireland to the National Library and to the different University Colleges.  The obligation should be only put upon them to house a single collection of the books published in England and the Free State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson made a point as to getting an American library concession rather than these I mentioned.  I certainly think there would be no hesita- <Col N="611" /> tion in making it compulsory that a single copy of every book published in the Free State be diverted to some American library if, in return, we got from America a copy of every book published there.  There will be no hesitation in coming to a bargain of that sort.  There is no provision allowing such arrangements to be made, but really the arrangements are so far off that I think if an arrangement did come to be made we would have to have legislation empowering a contract to be entered into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in this, more or less.  The accommodation in regard to England is a single copy coming over here in return for a single copy going to the British Museum.  Sub-section 2, where we are handing over four copies, was inserted on the application of the authors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that from the author's point of view a single provision in regard to the National Library would be more beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="612" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Much more beneficial, but how this arose is a matter of history.  There was some arrangement under which books were delivered to these places and it was urged, on behalf of the authors, that inasmuch as there is at present a collection of Irish works at the Bodleian Library, Oxford University Library, and Cambridge, it would be well to continue them.  I was not impressed with the argument.  I do not know why we should put this burden on the publishers. I would say this much about the publishers, that the burden upon them has been increased by a single book.  If the single book could be wiped out the publishers are under no further obligation than they would be when they entered into their business. To this extent there is no great hardship inflicted on them.</P>
      <P>But with regard to America, I would certainly say this, even though it did incur Government expense in seeing that a single copy of every book published in the Free State went to America, if we could get in return a single copy of everything published in America, it would be a good bargain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the obligations of housing, the position of Trinity College is, of course, going to be somewhat different under this Bill to what it was previously. Previously Trinity College had an agency arrangement which cost them several hundred pounds per annum to have a choice made as to the books which were demanded by Trinity College. At the moment the obligation is that the publisher of every book published in the Free State shall deliver, at his own expense, and there is a proviso in regard to certain things which may be excluded.  In most of the places where these books used to go, they were very much embarrassed by the amount of material flowing in.  There are certain cellars in the British Museum where &ldquo;Comic Cuts,&rdquo;&ldquo;Chips&rdquo; and these things, which have to be received, are housed for a certain period.  It was to prevent that sort of thing occurring that we limited that provision to sub-section (1).  I do not propose, at the moment, to put down any amendment even for the Report Stage with regard to sub-section (2).  I simply spoke here <Col N="613" /> with the intention of ventilating what I felt was, to a certain extent, a hardship, and I leave it to anybody who is interested in the matter, who thinks that justice is not being done, to put down an amendment for the next date with regard to sub-section (2) or any other sub-section dealing with the delivery of books to libraries.</P>

      <P>I did not think it proper perhaps for me to refer to the matter, but as the Minister has referred to it I might say that this is a valuable privilege and one that we value very much.  But it is not a privilege that does not impose upon us a very great and a very big responsibility, namely, the responsibility of providing storage, which is a very serious one, and not only that, but the cost of the upkeep of the number of books that comes to us is also very serious.  We do not shrink from it, but looking to the future it is within the bounds of possibility that, much as we would dislike it, it might be necessary for the College to have to come to the State and to ask to be relieved of the enormous responsibility. I hope the day may never come when we are forced to do that, for the reason I have given.  It is not a gift which is not costly to the receiver.  It most undoubtedly is, however much they may value it as they do.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a remark about this section which refers to search warrants.  I would like to ask the Minister if he would consider, between this and Report Stage&mdash;I have not put down any amendment to this effect&mdash;the question whether it would be advisable to have a member of the Gárda Síochána, when entering a house with a view to inspecting electrical apparatus, to be necessarily accompanied by some competent officer of the Ministry.  It is not to be expected that a member of the Gárda force would be qualified to judge as to what is the nature of the electrical apparatus.  He might interfere with electrical apparatus which may have nothing on earth to do with wireless apparatus, but in regard to which he could not judge.  It seems to me that it would be a right and proper thing that somebody who does understand the subject should accompany the officer in making this search.  I should like that the Minister should consider this matter before the Bill comes up for Report Stage and, if necessary, that he would insert somewhere about line 44: &ldquo;That such member <Col N="616" /> of the Gárda Síochána should be accompanied by an officer appointed by the Minister,&rdquo; or words to that effect.</P>

      <P>In connection with this section there is rather a large point to which I want to make some reference, and again just to draw the Minister's attention to the matter.  This section deals with the enforcement of powers generally.  It limits interference to such apparatus as interferes with the working, or injuriously affect wireless telegraphy generally.  But, as a matter of fact, there is a very much bigger question with which it might be possible to deal without seriously restricting the work of electrical companies generally.  There is no doubt that a great deal of the complaints that arise from receivers of broadcasting comes from electrical disturbances coming from electrical apparatus which is not telegraph apparatus at all.  It is a very big question that I am asking the Minister to face.  But it may be possible to deal with such interference, and it is quite likely, in future, that means will be discovered for preventing that interference. I think it would be well that he should take upon himself powers for dealing with that if it is possible to do so when the occasion arises.  This section does not give him such powers.  It gives him power to deal with interference that arises from wireless telegraphy <Col N="620" /> apparatus.  I know this is a big thing, and I think it is worth the Minister's while to consider it, and that is what I am suggesting to him.</P>

The Deputy has not pointed out in what respect we could advance beyond that stage.

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £112,208 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1927, for the purchase of fuel during the Coal Emergency, 1926, and for expenses connected therewith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 16th November I made a statement here regarding the measures that were being taken to insure a supply of fuel, and in that statement I indicated that these measures, although not large, would involve a certain substantial liability in the event of the normal source of supply becoming available at a date earlier than could be anticipated.  That situation has since arisen.  Supplies have become available earlier than was anticipated, and this Vote is for the purpose of meeting the Government's commitments.  At the end of October, when it became necessary to take measures on behalf of the Government of a special type, the situation with regard to fuel was as follows:&mdash; The supply of coal on private order delivery during November and December amounted to 95,000 tons.  That represents about three weeks' consumption in Dublin under normal conditions, but we looked to it being about five weeks' consumption, on the basis that the railways, gas, and electricity works were excluded, as it was thought that they were going to fend for themselves.  The orders were consequently short of requirements in the two months November and December, and if the strike continued, or even if the strike was settled, there would be a considerable interval between the closing of the strike and the date on which supplies from England became available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time I was unable to obtain from the British Government any forecast as to the end of the strike and when supplies from England might be expected.  It was only, in fact, on the 24th November that we got any definite information, and when the information did come it was to the effect that supplies of a certain amount of British coal <Col N="623" /> would be available on the 29th November. At the end of October a decision was taken that supplies on private order should be supplemented for the ensuing six weeks to the extent of about 35,000 tons, to be delivered mainly at the beginning of December. That meant that total provision was made for eight weeks to the extent of about 128,000 tons&mdash;95,000 tons on private order and 35,000 tons for which we were making arrangements.  That represented a normal import to Dublin for four and a half or six weeks, if we excluded, as before, the larger consumers. It will be seen that the commitments were on a moderate scale, having regard to the situation at the time the orders were placed.  Arrangements were made with the Coal Merchants' Association to the effect that the Association would finance the purchase of the Government orders and provide for their distribution to the consumer at a price to be added to the c.i.f. price in Dublin.  That addition was fixed by my Department and it ran to 22/- a ton.  A further agreement was made that if within seven days from the date of discharge the Association did not take delivery of any of the cargoes ordered by the Government that part was to be taken up by the Government.  In all, our commitments were 33,000 tons.</P>
    <P>I cannot be more precise at this stage, as a percentage had to be allowed for inaccurate weights, waste from slack, and so forth.  4,500 tons were immediately disposed of at the end of November, and when the release of British coal was announced it was found possible to cancel an order of 1,700 tons. That left 27,000 tons, most of which arrived last week, or will arrive this week.  That has not yet been disposed of; a payment for it has now to be made.  The average c.i.f. price in Dublin for this; including a certain amount of brown coal and briquettes, will run to £3 10s. per ton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us the proportions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot, at the <Col N="624" /> moment, but if it is thought necessary I can get them immediately. I can take certain items with regard to bricquettes and brown coal if the Deputy means the deficiency there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>And if possible, Continental and American coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The average c.i.f. price here of coal, which includes a certain amount of brown coal and bricquettes, is £3 10s.  Half of that will be taken into Government stock and the price adjusted to current rates. The remaining half is for sale, and tenders for it have been invited.  That is the entire Government commitment, less 4,300 tons disposed of and a cargo cancelled.  That represents a normal week's imports to Dublin.  If export was still stopped the coal on order would be disposed of immediately.  As it is, the difference between the original cost and the present market price represents a very small margin out of the public funds, as insurance provided against further emergency. If I am asked what is the present market value of any coal in Dublin&mdash;I am not going to say the present market value of the coal we have&mdash;I would have to be guarded in my answer, as it would depend on the date of the order.  When we purchased, the price, if the importer was to get even his costs out of it, apart from any profit, was very big.  With regard to coal coming from England, brought in by some small firms who had no forward contracts, that should be sold to the consumer in Dublin&mdash;and limited to Dublin only&mdash;somewhere between 60/- and 65/- per ton.  That is for English coal brought in by some of the firms who had no forward orders, and consequently they had not to lay off any losses on forward purchases against present coal prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that 60/- to 65/- c.i.f. to which is added something equivalent to 22/-?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No. 65/- is the price to the consumer.</P>

    <Col N="625" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>So we may deduct 22/- to get the c.i.f. price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You may deduct something more than 22/-, as c.i.f. was the price fixed by the Coal Merchants' Association for Government coal and did not include any item of profit. Something more would have to be taken into account.  This Vote represents money needed to pay for coal brought in in order to tide over the emergency period.  It simply represents money for the purchase of fuel and the incidental expenses in connection with loading and discharge.  There will come to the Exchequer whatever moneys are got from the sale of this coal, either to the public through tender or whatever amount will be fixed upon as a proper one to be charged to the Board of Works for taking it into Government stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say what the net deficit will be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that until I find out what the selling price will be.  One could estimate £50,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel myself in a great difficulty about dealing intelligently with this question.  Everything depends, I think, on the wisdom shown by the Minister in making his purchases. We are still awaiting information as to what proportion of these purchases were bricquettes that will burn, and also brown coal, American and other Continental coals.  It appears to me that until we get that information we are not able to form any judgment as to the wisdom of these transactions.  I ask the Minister if he can to postpone discussion of this Vote until he is able to supply us with the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the view of the Deputy that the Vote should not be gone on with until there is some description of the type of coal that was bought?  I would like to know what that has to do with the question.  Whatever was bought at the time of the emergency was bought when simply anything that could be got to burn was taken.  If the Deputy's point is that he wants to raise some debate as <Col N="626" /> to whether any briquettes or brown coal should be taken, or whether any should be taken from Westphalia or Poland, or whether we should have concentrated on American coal, I could see the necessity of giving details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My point of view should be very easily seen.  The Dáil is asked to sanction the expenditure of £112,000 for certain coal purchases. The Minister has told us that it was necessary to make purchases.  For the total amount of coal purchased he has given the average price, but he has not given us any information upon which we can judge the wisdom of his Department in making these purchases for this emergency.</P>
      <P>We have been reading, for instance, day by day in the newspapers about the amount of briquettes that have been on fire on the quays, and we have had complaints about material that will not burn, and about the inadequacy of the coal supplied to certain establishments because of its unfitness.  Now, while it may be true for the Minister to say that it was necessary to purchase anything that would burn, we ought to have at least the information upon which we might base criticism, if criticism is to be applied, as to the qualities and quantities of the respective coals that were purchased, and also as to the relative prices, c.i.f., of American coal. Silesian coal, briquettes, etc.  The information the Minister has given is not sufficient, and it seems to me that the policy of the Department in making these purchases can only be criticised when we have information as to what purchases were made, and the prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wants to criticise what purchases were made and the relative prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the relative prices.  We get an average of £3 10s. for the whole quantity in Dublin. An average of £3 10s. might mean an exceptionally high price for briquettes that are not suitable.  We may have something to say upon the wisdom of the Department in making these several commitments.  That information, at least, should be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="627" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the position the Deputy adopts. The Deputy apparently wants to say that such and such was ordered at such and such a price, and that it was a bad price, irrespective of what the circumstances were, and whether it was a matter of simply snapping at any offer that was made at the particular period, and as to whether briquettes should have been bought at a particular time, when they were the only thing on offer. I do not think there were more than 4,000 tons of briquettes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are getting on; that is one item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>And if I were to say that there were 24,000 tons of briquettes I wonder to what point the Deputy's criticism would advance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait and see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the brown coal ordered&mdash;I am not speaking of the brown coal delivered&mdash;that would have amounted to not more than 8,000 tons. I doubt if it would have amounted to 6,000 tons.  The position that the Dáil has to consider is this, that there was a situation developed here with regard to the lack of supplies of fuelling in this country.  When that situation arose, and the first time it was discovered the reason why forward purchase had not been made by coal merchants in the ordinary way was that the financial commitment was too high and the resources of the coal merchants were not equal to it&mdash;at least that the financial resources that the coal merchants thought fit to allocate to this matter were not strong enough.  In that situation what amounted to a guarantee was asked for and given, and that amounted to the bringing in of about 33,000 tons of fuelling, of which we, at the moment, are discussing 27,000 tons.  There was one cargo cancelled, and another was disposed of without loss.  We are discussing, therefore, the question of the provision of a little more than a week's normal imports of coal into Dublin by way of insuring that no further emergency would arise.  It is apparently now being put to me that this vote cannot be considered until the Deputies <Col N="628" /> get the details of the consignments and prices at which they were ordered and of any charges that were incurred by way of cancellation charges or anything else.</P>
      <P>I do not know that it is a reasonable demand in the circumstances, particularly coming from a Party which alleged that sufficient provision had not been made.  The actual commitment of the Government is now discovered to be that of a week's normal supply of fuelling imported into this country in order to prevent any further emergency arising such as arose in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is prejudging my criticism&mdash;if there is to be criticism.  What I am contending for is that on an emergency estimate of this kind we are in duty bound to ask for such information as would give some justification for granting the vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>For passing the vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and when asking for particulars of this matter the Minister appears to imagine that it is unfair to ask whether there is anything like fair discrimination used in the purchasing of the various kinds of fuel.  I think that is a very reasonable request and I cannot understand why the Minister should cavil at it.  Are we not to get this information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked for a case to be made and I have been told that this information is required if there is to be criticism.  I have not seen any case made for the granting of the information asked for.  If the House thinks it is necessary I will postpone the Vote until to-morrow and get that information, but I will not postpone it on the case that Deputy Johnson has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister.  How could the House found any criticism unless it has the information which I am seeking? Surely it is a reasonable thing to expect the Minister to come forward and tell us something about the purchases he has made when he is asking us to vote £112,000.  I believe, for one, that it was essential that the Government <Col N="629" /> should enter into commitments of this kind.  In view of the failure of the coal merchants it was certainly necessary for the Government to come to the aid of the public when that section of the community which had undertaken to supply fuel to the community had failed.  But we have the right to ask ourselves whether in undertaking this abnormal duty to protect the community anything like a fair use was made of the Minister's responsibility &mdash;whether the purchases were in reasonable proportion.  He tells us that they were prepared to go in for any thing that offered.  Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Then cannot we hear from the Minister what in fact was available, because there is information available as to what other people who were purchasing were able to buy at.</P>

      <P>As regards this Vote, I am not going to insist that it should be passed to-night.  I simply come forward with the request that a certain amount of extra money should be voted, and I described the circumstances in which the situation arose.  I object, as I objected before, to the use of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; on the part of certain people&mdash;on the part of the Coal Merchants' Association&mdash;in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="630" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it a success?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a failure, that failure has to come, and that is a matter of which the Deputy knows nothing.  It will be seen that whatever the Government may lose it will be nothing to the losses that certain coal merchants may have to suffer, coal merchants who definitely did purchase ahead and who went far beyond what reasonably could be expected of them in relation to their finances.  It is not right to throw out casually the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; in regard to the Coal Merchants' Association.</P>
      <P>It is very easy for somebody who has no concern with the business, who has absolutely no concern with the thing and no responsibility for anything that may occur&mdash;any losses that may fall upon people who are dealing with the situation&mdash;to throw out the suggestion that there was failure.  It is very easy to say: &ldquo;If there was not failure, was there success?&rdquo; That is the attitude of one who is relieved of all responsibility, financial and otherwise, in the matter, and who simply has to oppose.  He should see, however, that the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is not used casually.  That word should not be casually thrown out in this way, and the suggestion of failure on the part of the coal merchants to deal with the situation should not be lightly made.</P>
      <P>I should say there was very little failure up to recently, and the failure then was on the part of certain people who left an association with which they had made certain commitments.  In the circumstances certain emergency action was taken.  The net result of it is what I have described already and what I will describe again in the same words. They were left with the prospect of selling a certain amount of coal at a price less than what we bought it at, plus another moiety to be taken over into Government stocks at an adjustment price equivalent to the market rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are left with twenty-seven thousand tons on hands, the equivalent of something a little more than a normal week's supply in Dublin.  That alone is sufficient to justify this Vote. An emergency has been tided over.  The <Col N="631" /> prevention of another emergency such as that which arose in October has been definitely seen to, and the Government stock of coal is the equivalent of one week's normal supply in Dublin.  That is the case I make for putting this Vote forward.</P>
    <P>If there are people in this House other than Deputy Johnson who think further details should be given and who can put up a case for these details, I am ready to listen to them.  I can get the figures later if they are needed.  I want to see first if there is any real reason for objecting to the Vote at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister thinks that the only duty of the Dáil, when we are asked to vote money, is to accept the Minister's statement, and adopt or refuse the Vote accordingly.  The reason that estimates are brought into the Dáil is to give the public, through the Dáil, an assurance that matters of this kind will undergo criticism, or may undergo criticism, and that Ministers are expected to give the Dáil information as to the transactions, especially abnormal transactions, that are conducted by their Departments.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to object to any question being raised regarding the transactions of his Department.  We are to adopt or reject the Vote without getting any information.  If that is the position Ministers are going to take up in regard to bringing estimates forward, then they had better re-cast their whole financial system, because the theory of bringing forward estimates to the House is surely based upon the assumption that the House is going to have a right to criticise expenditure and demand information regarding the occasion for that expenditure, and, if necessary, details.</P>
      <P>The Minister has protested against my use of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; as applied to the coal merchants in relation to their maintenance of supplies. My information comes from the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister told <Col N="632" /> this House that he had made arrangements with the coal merchants at the beginning of the coal strike, in certain directions; that they were to keep in constant touch with him, and keep him informed as to the course of their trade prospects, the quantities of coal being imported, existing stocks, etc.  Up to a point he was kept informed, and was satisfied.  Suddenly he learned that the merchants had failed to keep him informed, and had failed to maintain supplies.  They found themselves at a point when the city was faced with the prospect of being without coal.  Yet he resents the use of the word &ldquo;failure.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister himself is responsible for the charge that the coal merchants failed to maintain supplies, and failed to keep him informed of their inability to face the financial responsibilities, so that he would have an opportunity of protecting the community in the case of the possible failure of the coal merchants.

      <P>If I am any judge of the English the Minister uses, he undoubtedly gave the impression to this House, during the statement he made on the coal situation, that the coal merchants, or the great majority of them, had defaulted.  The Minister asks Deputy Johnson to quote him.  If the Minister has a copy of the Official Report, I would ask him to look at it, and see if he did not make the statement that only four out of nineteen merchants continued to order coal, although the original arrangement was that they should continue to order coal. The Minister told us then that he was <Col N="633" /> assured coal supplies were being ordered, and that the situation was well in hand.  The Minister apparently believed that.  Then we were told the Minister suddenly discovered this was not being done, and that only four out of nineteen merchants were doing it; that the other fifteen had failed to do it.  If they failed to do that, and did not tell the Minister that they were not doing it, then I do not know what the word failure means.</P>

No doubt the Minister used the default of the coal merchants as justification for his action and inaction during his recent statement in the House.  Now apparently he comes along realising that he has overdone it, and he asks the House not to think that the coal merchants have failed.  If ever there was dismal failure, the coal merchants failed on that occasion.</P>

      <P>I did not tell you anything of the sort.  I said there was failure with regard to information, and that was the only phrase in which the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; crept into my statement. Further, when speaking of it I said that with certain reservations I had been informed that the position in Dublin might have been relieved, and I further said: &ldquo;But it is only fair to <Col N="634" /> say that the sudden Continental embargo on export and the chaos into which American supplies fell during October must have made much confusion in the best-laid plans, and involved inevitably a shortage until deliveries improved.&rdquo; That is described as an indictment of the coal merchants. I had no intention of laying any such indictment against the coal merchants, and I objected on 16th November last just as much as I do now to people who have really no information about what is involved in forward purchases, but who can sit easily without any responsibility or a feeling that loss is going to come upon them, criticising people who were seeing losses ahead for not acting up to the Deputy's theoretical views&mdash; shipping finance.  Deputy Norton, like Deputy Johnson, has a very easy disregard of the amount of money that has to be spent on the forward purchase of, say, 100,000 tons of coal at 84/- a ton. There are times when freedom of criticism and absence of financial responsibility do not go well.  I want to hear if there is complaint from any other side of the House against the passing of this Vote beyond the poor case that has been put up so far.  It has been urged that the Vote should not be passed unless details are given of every cargo that came in, and that there should be a division not merely of brown coal and briquettes, the quantities of which I have already given in a rough way, but a further division as to how much was American, how much was Westphalian coal or Polish or any other type, with, I suppose, the price per cargo.  I have not yet heard anyone ask for that information except Deputy Johnson.  If there is any other section in the House that seems to want that information and thinks that the Vote ought not to be passed until it is given, then I will see about getting the information, but the case made so far for the provision of these details has not impressed me.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the views of the Minister may be in regard to the work of the House, but we have been meeting for two days a week for the last two or three weeks since we resumed.  I would have thought that even on the score of cost the Minister for Finance would have considered the question whether we ought to have this prospect of a week's work and then sudden decisions that we are going to adjourn for another three or four days.  We are not told beforehand and no communications are made as to the course of business or what is expected between one side of the House and the other, but we are suddenly told on a Wednesday that we are going to adjourn until, presumably, Tuesday next, and this is repeated week after week.  If only on the score of finance and the saving of railway charges incurred by the State one would have thought that some better management of the business of the House would be forthcoming.  I would like to know if we are to have an opportunity and if a definite date will be fixed now for the discussion of the report circulated in reference to the Imperial Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter has been deferred three different times.  It was definitely agreed by the Minister and myself that it would be taken to-morrow.  Yesterday the President told us that it was not fitting&mdash;I think he suggested because of the ill-health of the Minister for External Affairs.  If that is the explanation, then, of course, we must accept it, but I have a feeling that there is really no good reason why we should adjourn leaving unfinished the Local Government Bill, which, I understood, was required to be passed, and <Col N="636" /> also the discussion that Deputy Magennis was speaking about yesterday on the Financial Agreement White Paper.  I would like to have a definite understanding when we are to have a statement from a Minister who can speak with authority upon the work of the Ministers at the Imperial Conference so that there may be a discussion on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on the Imperial Conference will take place this day week.  The delay has been due to the fact that the Minister for External Affairs has been indisposed.  But for that the discussion would have been taken before the date that is now fixed. It is not always possible to arrange business so that it will occupy a full week.  Sometimes business that is expected to be controversial turns out not to be so controversial, and sometimes, to meet the wishes of the House, a Bill has to be withdrawn, as was the case with the Land Bill, which, if it had been gone on with, would have occupied quite a considerable amount of time in discussion, and would have prevented adjournments taking place. There certainly is no wish to bring the House up for two days rather than have a full week's business and get done with it, but things do not always pan out as is thought.  No one can foresee very well the length of time that will be occupied in the discussion of any particular business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it might be best that I should make a general statement with reference to the Ultimate Financial Settlement on which Deputy Magennis spoke.  Deputies are aware that since the setting up of the Free State the land annuities have been paid over to the British Government to meet the interest and sinking fund, on the land stock that was issued in respect of lands from which these annuities were payable.  A difference of opinion arose between the British Government and ourselves in regard to the income on the interest portion of these annuities.  We withheld portion of the annuities against our claim for income tax.  We were not entitled, of course, to all the income tax on those annuities.  We were entitled, in our own view, to the income tax on the whole of some of them, and to half the income tax on the remaining portion. However, a diametrically opposite view was taken by the British Government, which held that as the practice of deducting income tax at the source in respect of these lands had ceased long before the setting up of the Free State no change should have been made, and that the annuities should be paid over to the appropriate fund in full.  While that particular discussion was going on there was going on at the same time a discussion in regard to the problem of double income tax, and we were able to reach an agreement on that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That agreement solved the problem of the income tax on the interest portion of land annuities, because as the land annuities went out of the country they were no longer liable to our tax. On the other hand, the new arrangement in regard to double income tax left our Exchequer as well off as it was before.  Deputies may have noticed that while I said in my Budget speech that the new arrangement in regard to income tax would leave our Exchequer in approximately the same position as it was before, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said, I think, that the British <Col N="638" /> Government would lose between £200,000 and £300,000 per annum.  I will not go in detail into the discrepancy between these two statements. In some respects that discrepancy arose from non-agreement as to the actual effect of the agreement.  In the main the discrepancy arose owing to the fact that we regarded ourselves as entitled to the income tax on those land annuities, and the British Government regarded themselves also as being entitled to it, so that while we held ourselves no better off, the British, because they were in a position that was no better than if they had waived their claim to income tax, regarded themselves as having lost a considerable sum.  Apart from any question as between the Exchequers, this new arrangement in regard to double income tax was a substantial benefit to a very considerable number of taxpayers, small taxpayers in the Free State, who, under the old arrangement, were not able to get full relief.  These were shareholders in companies like Guinness's and the National Bank.  Shareholders who were not exempt were all right, but shareholders who were exempt were not able to obtain repayment of the Saorstát tax.</P>
    <P>A substantial sum, perhaps £30,000 or £40,000 per annum, actually went into the pockets of Saorstát taxpayers as a result of the arrangement about double income tax.  That arrangement had certain other advantages for us besides leaving the Exchequer as well off as before, as well off as it would have been had we without dispute got income tax on the interest portion of the land annuities.  It did benefit to a substantial extent a considerable number of Saorstát taxpayers, and, moreover, it did away with a great many sources of annoyance and a great deal of inconvenience to taxpayers, and it meant that after it had been put into operation the administrative cost would be lessened.  In view of all that, we felt that it was fair to waive the claim which we had made in regard to income tax on land annuities for the years that had passed, and to pay over to the British Government the sum of £550,000 which we had withheld.  As I have already indicated, we held that against our claim.  It was a larger sum <Col N="639" /> than I think we would have been entitled to even if our claim had been accepted by any arbitrator as correct. There was a margin for safety.</P>
    <P>That covers the first four items under the heads of the Ultimate Financial Settlement.  The vital clause so far as we were concerned was the clause providing for the settlement of the double income tax problem on the residence basis.  As a matter of fact, this particular agreement could have been entered into long before if we had been able to see that the settlement under the residence basis would have been satisfactory to us.  Even at the date of the signature of this agreement all points had not been worked out by the two revenue departments, and it was with some doubt that we were actually able to sign that particular agreement. However, the figures were available shortly afterwards, and the matter was completed satisfactorily.  With regard to Article 5 of the heads of working arrangements, this wa s regarded by us as a very satisfactory settlement of the Local Loans Fund question.</P>
    <P>Heretofore we had been paying to the British Exchequer the amount actually collected annually in repayment of loans made in this country out of the Local Loans Fund.  We felt that that was not a satisfactory position, that the Local Loans Fund had borrowed money at rates of interest very considerably less than money is now worth, and that, consequently, money repaid from here would be re-employed by the British Government on a very profitable basis.  The arrangement will ultimately give us a sum that will be very substantial.  The amount outstanding in respect of local loans at present is about £10,350,000.</P>
    <P>The present value at 5 per cent. of an annuity of £600,000 per annum for twenty years would be seven and a quarter million pounds, but, of course, the present value of our gain on the new arrangement is nothing like £3,000,000, because some of the sums which we will receive will not come in for a very long time.  The amount that we collect during the present year will be about £686,000, and it will continue for the first twelve years or so to be <Col N="640" /> over £600,000 per annum, perhaps for the first fifteen years.  Thereafter, until the end of the twenty years' period it will be less than £600,000 per annum, but at the end of the twenty years' period our payments will cease.  On the other hand, money will continue to come into our Exchequer up to the year 2000&mdash;that is, some of the loans will not be repaid until the year 2000. But for ten years after the twenty years' period substantial sums will be coming in.</P>
    <P>Since the separation of functions a certain amount of discussion has gone on in regard to British Government property which was handed over.  This does not apply to the property of the ordinary civil departments, but rather to the War Department's property and lands, Admiralty property, property held by the Disposals and Liquidation Commission, and Royal Irish Constabulary property. The property in question in this particular clause had been estimated by the British as being worth £5,000,000 odd, but, of course, it was not property for which, if they had decided, instead of transferring to us, to sell to private individuals and take cash, anything at all approaching that amount could have been obtained. Against the British claim that they were not bound to transfer it to us, but to sell to us or sell it otherwise, we had urged that we were entitled to the greater part of it.  In this agreement the British handed it over finally without making any claim for payment.</P>
    <P>In connection with Article 7, the Compensation (Ireland) Commission gave awards in favour of the British Government, amounting in all to, I think, £490,000.  Of that, £130,000 was subject to reinstatement conditions, and, I think, could never have been claimed by the British Government, because, of course, they would not have reinstated, except in certain cases where landlords or others might have a right to compel them to reinstate.  But ordinarily they never would have reinstated, and a great portion of that would never have been drawn by them. There remains £360,000.  We claimed that in respect of some of the property <Col N="641" /> covered we had a claim to transfer. The amount of that property to which we could have established a claim to transfer was not considerable.  One of the very big items in the £490,000 was the property destroyed in the Shell Factory fire, cars burnt, which were, of course, War Office cars, and which would, if they had not been burnt, have been transferred to England at the end of the hostilities.  So that I do not think that of the £360,000 remaining we could have established a claim to a transfer of any very considerable amount.  Undoubtedly, if the claims had been examined and threshed out item by item we would have had to pay a sum substantially in excess of £275,000.</P>
    <P>After the setting up of the Free State the question of the payment to the railways of the second moiety of the sums that were due under the Irish Railways (Settlement of Claims) Act, of 1921 arose.  The position, of course, was at that time that the railways needed the money urgently, and the British had a very strong case for declining to pay, because, in general, the financial relations between the Governments had been arranged on the basis of the clean cut, and their claim was that they had no liability to pay, that they were out of the country, and that whatever was due to the railways should be paid by us.  At that time we were not actually in a position to pay, and we also urged that the losses and liabilities of the railways arose out of the European War, and that they should pay.  The result of the discussion was that, subject to the matter being raised at the ultimate financial settlement&mdash; which, of course, at that time it was thought would include the whole question of Article V., and so forth&mdash;the British paid over to the Saorstát railways on the 15th January, 1923, the sum of £1,085,721.  The matter was, as appears in this paper, raised at the financial settlement, and was disposed of, as Deputies see, by Section 8.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of discussion went on between the two Governments in regard to the portion of the Unemployment Fund deficit, attributable to the Irish Free State.  The general arrangement in regard to Government funds <Col N="642" /> was, that they were divided on some equitable basis.  If the Unemployment Fund had money to credit, that would have been divided, and we would have got our share.  As the Fund was in debt, we, at a certain stage of the negotiations, claimed that the new Irish Fund had a debt to the Exchequer to be calculated with reference to the number of unemployed and the funds that have been drawn.  We claimed that that was due to the Irish Exchequer.  That was, I think, an ingenious argument, but it was not one that we really could sustain, because it meant that the division of these separate funds was to be conducted on the basis of &ldquo;Heads I win, and tails you lose&rdquo;; it meant that if the Fund had something to credit we would get a share of it, but if it was in debt the British Government paid.  The actual amount of the deficit of the Fund had been borrowed from the National Debt Commissioners.  Of course the money had to go back to them, and if we did not pay it meant that British workmen would pay for the sums that Irish Free State workmen had received.  So that I think that, although this is a matter which was in dispute for a considerable time, the equities were not with us, and there was no alternative for us but to abandon it.</P>
    <P>Article 10 of the heads of working arrangements is really consequential on the agreement of December last year. We escaped under that agreement the liability for British war debt, and consequently we could not continue to claim any share of the reparations or any share of the repayment of inter-Allied debts.  The Contingency Fund is practically a Reserve or Suspense Account of the Consolidated Fund of Great Britain to provide for unforeseen expenditure in advance of Parliamentary sanction.  It is consequently different from funds like the Development or Road Fund, and others which had to be divided, but the fact that we did not receive a share involved no expenditure on our part.  As Deputies may have noted in the annual estimates &mdash;I am referring now to Section 11&mdash; on page 73 there is a note with reference to the pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary. It states: &ldquo;It has been <Col N="643" /> agreed provisionally that Saorstát Eireann will pay 75 per cent. of the above pensions without prejudice to the ultimate financial settlement.&rdquo; That 75 per cent. was fixed after a consideration of the distribution of the Royal Irish Constabulary during the preceding twenty years.  The proportion of the Royal Irish Constabulary assigned to the Free State area varied from 78.59 per cent. to 73.99 per cent., but over the 20 years the average was 75 per cent. From time to time various other bases for the division of the pensions charge were discussed.  These were: the rateable value of the property requiring police protection in the Saorstát and in the Northern Ireland area, the statistics of indictable offences and the population of the areas, but we came to the conclusion that the division based on the distribution of the force over a period of twenty years was a fair division, and consequently the provisional agreement to pay 75 per cent. was confirmed in this ultimate financial settlement.</P>
    <P>With regard to Article 12, certain matters were, during previous discussions left open for consideration at the ultimate financial settlement, or it was arranged that they should be then taken into account.  The principal of these was a sum of £180,000 which had been lent to the Dublin South Eastern Railway Company by the British Government. It is a matter on which there was some doubt as to whether they were entitled to claim it or whether, under the general arrangement, it passed over to us and that was deferred to the ultimate financial settlement.  By Clause 12 of the Articles, the British Government abandoned their claim for that sum of £180,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There are very disputed amounts I am now about to mention.  There was a claim by the British Government for £479,325 4s. 6d. for munitions supplied to the Provisional Government, and, in the very early days, to the Government of the Saorstát.  There was a further claim of £28,996 8s. in respect of military stores supplied to the Government of <Col N="644" /> the Saorstát.  The larger amount was in respect of munitions supplied in the very early days of the Civil War, and it was to be dealt with as part of the ultimate financial settlement, but we have always disputed the amount. Things were done in a rough and ready way at the time, and any stores were handed over, any sort of ammunition and weapons that were available.  We always claimed that a great quantity of this stuff was unserviceable and should not be paid for.  Prior to the signing of the document which I am now discussing the British had, I think, reduced their claim to about £250,000.  We were still of opinion that £250,000 was excessive, having regard to the value of the stuff, but it is perhaps correct to say that Clause 12 of the Agreement gives us, say, £200,000.</P>
      <P>The £180,000 to which I have referred was a matter about which there was a difference of legal opinion and was an extremely doubtful matter, but in respect of the munitions, if it had not been lumped in this general settlement which we are now discussing, we would certainly have had to pay some sum.  It might have been difficult to arrive ultimately at a figure.  Perhaps a figure would have to be arrived at by arbitration and we would have to pay some sum like £200,000.  I regard this whole settlement as one in which we were very fairly and very reasonably met by the British Government.</P>
      <P>It disposed of a series of questions which might have been a cause of friction between the two Governments and a number of questions that required to be settled.  I regard the whole arrangement as one very advantageous to the Free State and one in the making of which we were met in the very fairest possible way by the British Government.</P>

      <P>Very good.  I have here volume 13 of the Official Report.  I should say, as a matter of passing interest, that I do this, and interrupt my comment, merely out of courtesy.  On previous occasions the President refused to allow me to interrupt him.  He chose to regard it as an indignity.  I do not intend to imitate him.  I will not follow him in any item of behaviour in this House, and, therefore, I depart from my criticism to read what he requires.  I start with the first one, which I quoted yesterday.  It is column 1312.  If I read these passages, the President will be the first to complain of the length of my speech.  I apologise to the House for giving them these passages again.  It was quite bad enough that we had them in their original utterance.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;There is nothing so detrimental <Col N="646" /> to financial prosperity as impending unascertained liabilities.  It is essential for conditions of ordered finance that we should know the amount of our debt for good or for ill.  This question of our liability was, I am bound to say, approached by the representatives of the British Government with a friendliness of feeling and the broad outlook of real statesmanship. They were not out to haggle over petty details or minor considerations.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Did I say his statement was not true?  I refused to guarantee its truth&mdash;a very different thing.  Now, in column 1308 we have this very significant passage from the President.  It will excite his ire that I have to explain that this passage follows upon the statement that he did not know the exact amount of Ireland's counterclaim.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would hesitate to make any forecast as to the amount of what our ascertained liability would be if our case and the case of the British Government had been laid before an arbitrator in cold figures&mdash;an arbitrator who was bound to interpret those figures and those claims in the strict and rigid atmosphere of international finance.  Suffice it to say that others who have entered into the realm of prophecy on this subject have arrived at figures varying from an annual payment of £5,000,000 to a claim for an annual tribute of £19,000,000.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Baxter: What are the President's own figures?  What are the figures of the Executive Council? That is what we want to get at.</P>

      <P>To remit the payment of a huge share which rightfully is ours.  Now, I would invite you to notice the date of this document&mdash; 19th March, 1926.  Why was not that communicated to this House before November?  Is it not a strange coincidence that the moment chosen for this revelation was the moment at which we were being congratulated on our enhanced status within the Empire, when a new atmosphere of friendship and brotherhood had been created, according to the President's gushful pronouncements on the matter.  It is either susceptible of explanation or it is a curious instance of remissness on the part of the Executive Council, that that Ultimate Financial Settlement, arrived at so far back as March, is only revealed to members of the Oireachtas in November. It appears from this precious document that Ireland is the debtor nation when, as between the two States &mdash;Great Britain and ourselves&mdash;there was a popular delusion, in which the President used to share or professed to share, to the effect that the debt was due to us.  As far back as 1896 there was a Childers Commission, composed largely of English politicians, and it found in favour of our claim of over-taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the debate on this Pact and the cancellation of Article 5, I quoted a statement of Lord MacDonnell, better known as Sir Anthony MacDonnell, who computed that the total tribute exacted from Ireland&mdash;that, of course, included the Six Counties&mdash;down to the last pre-war year was £326,308,000, over and above the expenditure on so-called Irish services.  He exclaimed over those figures&mdash;&ldquo;They represent an empire's ransom.&rdquo; Yet it appears that it is we who have been the debtors <Col N="650" /> all along.  Item I. in this document says: &ldquo;The Government of the Irish Free State undertake to pay...&rdquo; Lower down: &ldquo;The Irish Free State Government agree to discharge...&rdquo; There are seven of these Agreements by the Free State Government to pay or to repay or to remit payment.  Seven of them! I thought as I read the document that when I would come to the end I would find: &ldquo;The British Government agree to pay for the ports retained as naval bases so many hundred millions.&rdquo; But there is not an iota about that.  What I referred to in that debate as &ldquo;the distribution of the pirate's loot,&rdquo; has now been made.  It appears now in the distribution that all the wealth and all the resources that were accumulated during the period of union of the Free State territory with that of Great Britain&mdash;that all that, or so much of it as we know about, belongs to Great Britain.  Take the German reparation taxes that are payable. Under No. 10, &ldquo;The Irish Free State Government agree to make no claim in respect of any of the assets of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, including inter alia the Civil Contingency Fund and receipts on account of reparations and inter-allied debts.&rdquo; Our land was confiscated, sold and re-sold to settlers; huge rentals were exacted from the peasantry, and spent abroad.  Our trade was ruined.  We have never, as President Kruger, did, put in a claim for reparation on these matters.  No.  England is the righteous nation in these relations. We are the debtors.  &ldquo;The Government of the Irish Free State undertakes to pay to the British Government, at agreed intervals, the full amount of the annuities accruing due from time to time under the Irish Land Acts, 1891-1909, without any deduction whatsoever, whether on account of income tax or otherwise.&rdquo;&ldquo;Without any deduction whatsoever&rdquo;&mdash;not even a deduction for the cost of collection. Why should the Government of the Irish Free State undertake any such obligation?  Mr. Baldwin, in a recent speech, said that &ldquo;Ireland exports a higher proportion of her income than any other country in the world.&rdquo; For that quotation I am indebted to <Col N="651" /> an article in the &ldquo;Review of Reviews&rdquo; by Senator Colonel Moore.  Included in that exportation of our income is this tribute&mdash;for &ldquo;tribute&rdquo; is the proper word&mdash;amounting to between two and a-half and three million pounds.  Those Land Acts that are referred to in the White Paper from 1891 to 1909 were made in settlement of the land disputes that arose because of the assertion of the Irish people that the land was theirs.</P>
    <P>It was admitted by Gladstone, who was the first in 1871 to frame the Land Act that revolutionised the whole attitude of the British Liberal Government to the Irish land question, and he recognised that that was the claim, that that was the positive and unshakeable decision of the Irish people in regard to land tenure.  Now, these moneys that are paid in the form of land annuities, what are they but the redemption of Irish land from foreigners, because in so far as the money goes out of the Free State Government it is going to people who refuse to remain in citizenship here.  There are some landlords, to their credit be it remembered, who remain citizens here.  When the President went with that big nought in his mind, that he was so bent on securing as the residue when the balance of our claim and that of Great Britain had been struck, why was he not mindful of the land annuities.  Did not the national equity require, when once it became a question of a settlement of financial relations between Great Britain and Ireland, that the land charges should be one of the very first considerations. The President was so bent on cementing friendship, as he called it, so bent on disseminating this atmosphere of good comradeship and fine fellowship, that all that escaped him that would have been very much present in the consciousness of an ordinary Irishman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I refuse to be interrupted.  Any Irishman with the red blood of Irish nationality in his veins knows that next to the national claim, the claim with regard to the land, was predominant.  Yet it was forgotten in this settlement.  Petty questions of law were allowed to put it aside, and now, under what is supposed to be an ultimate financial settlement, the Free State finds itself charged with the perpetuation of this annual tribute. Not only that, but under Article 2, which is retrospective, the Free State citizen is obliged to look on and see a sum of more than half a million of money repaid to the British Treasury, the amount hiterto withheld in respect of income tax.  The Minister for Finance has given a most unsatisfactory explanation of that, so far as I could take it down at all.  It is all a matter of what we feel.  &ldquo;We regard ourselves as entitled to income tax,&rdquo; he said, but he did not get it.  &ldquo;We regard ourselves as entitled to it.&rdquo; Why did not he regard himself as entitled to a complete cancellation of land purchase annuities?  Only a few days ago the <Col N="653" /> President defended the Executive against the charge of over-taxation and over-expenditure, claiming that if he reduced expenditure he would cut off necessary services.  Here, before him, is a source of income to our Treasury to the extent of from two-and-a-half to three millions a year, but he never thought of that&mdash;truculent almost to the limit of ferocity in dealing with his own country; mild and obsequious in dealing with the enemy.  That is the President's procedure.</P>

Who put Ulster out of Ireland politically? No wonder I am, politically, a long way from my base, and I resent it.  The Minister for Finance regarded ourselves as entitled to income tax.  Was that all we were entitled to?  Surely any Irishman would contend that we were entitled to the cancellation, not of the income tax, but of the payment of the annuities.  Article 5 is declared by the Minister for Finance to be very satisfactory. By some sort of juggling with figures he found it satisfactory, but what I find satisfactory in it is the revelation he made in trying to show it to me to be satisfactory.  He calculated that the amount outstanding at present in respect of the Local Loans Fund is about £10,350,000.  Where is the President's big nought?  Why were the public left to believe that we started with a clear financial sheet, having still a substantial loss?</P>

      <P>This is no matter for amusement&mdash;the commitment of the Irish people to a tribute of millions of money at a time when so many Irish citizens are being harried with their pockets stuffed with sub-sheriffs' writs.  The President used words that were intended to create the impression, and which, in fact, did create the impression, that we had the smallest debt, the debt being confined to the loan recently raised.  It is not a week since, at a public meeting, a member of a distinguished profession here in the city of Dublin referred to our financial clean sheet.  He corroborated what I allege, that the impression was <Col N="655" /> deliberately created in the public mind that after cancelling Article 5 we were in an excellent position financially. Now I learn what I did not know before, that the amount outstanding under the heading of Local Loan Funds is £10,350,000.</P>

      <P>Under Article 7 &ldquo;The Irish Free State Government agree to pay to the British Government the sum of £275,000 in full and final discharge of all claims made to the Compensation (Ireland) Commission in respect of damage done, prior to July 11th, 1921, to property belonging to any of the British Government Departments mentioned in the last preceding paragraph.&rdquo; Possibly that damage includes damage to public buildings taken over.  Why are we obliged to reinstate in their original condition public buildings which, presumably, are transferred property to the Irish Free State?  Is England coming back?  Is that the idea?  Are the buildings to be made assets to the value they had at the time of the original transfer?  What is the idea?</P>
      <P>In Article 8 the Minister tells us: &ldquo;The British Government waive all claims against the Government of the Irish Free State for the refund of any portion of the sum paid by them under Section 1 of the Irish Railways (Settlement of Claims) Act, 1921.&rdquo; He stated that the British Government had a strong case for declining to pay.  What I am wondering at is, that the Minister made that remark exclusively with regard to Article 8.  Surely that remark applies to every Article in this document to which his signature appears. If the British had not a strong case for declining to pay where they declined to pay, why did the Minister accept the decision?  Why is it only with regard to this small matter of monies paid under the Irish Railways (Settlement of Claims) Act it is necessary to assure us that the British had a strong case?</P>

    <P>Under Article 9 &ldquo;The Government of the Irish Free State agreed to pay to the British Government so much of the deficit of the Unemployment Fund of the United Kingdom as may be attributable <Col N="656" /> to the Irish Free State on the basis of the relative proportions of the insured populations of the two countries as at 31st March, 1922, with interest thereon from that date.&rdquo; Does Ulster agree to pay that?  Did the Northern Government agree to pay that?  On the contrary, they received a huge subsidy to make their Unemployment Fund all right.  What is fair treatment for the Six Counties is not equity for the Twenty-six Counties.  I suppose we are always to adopt that attitude when our Ministers go to London.  It is part of the London atmosphere of good-fellowship.</P>
    <P>I dealt with Article 10 when dealing with the unruly interruptions of the President.  Under Article 11 &ldquo;The Irish Free State Government agreed to repay to the British Government 75 per cent. of the pensions and compensation allowances payable to ex-members of the R.I.C. under the Constabulary Acts, subject to the exception mentioned in Article 10 of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo; There is one slogan the President is very fond of, and that is, &ldquo;England always honours her bond.&rdquo; Why does not England honour her bond with regard to the Royal Irish Constabulary?  Why are we to pay part of the pensions?  It has always been contended and admitted in this House that pensions are deferred pay.  Therefore, why are we paying for the services of the R.I.C.?  If I were to quote for the President the words of the late President Griffith, I suggest he would not accept them.</P>
    <P>With cruel irony, when England forced upon this country her policy of free trade, to compensate Irish agriculture for its ruin she agreed to take over the cost of the Constabulary.  She agreed to do that as a recompense for the destruction of the agricultural industry consequent upon a free trade policy.  Now that we have got freedom to make our own laws and our own arrangements one of the first uses we make of that freedom is to take over a retrospective payment to the members of England's army of occupation. Everyone knows that is what the Royal Irish Constabulary was.  Over and above its superficial aspect of being <Col N="657" /> a police force it was armed.  A member of the R.I.C. was more than the gendarme in France.  It was the British head.  Admittedly, the Royal Irish Constabulary was the army of England here.  Indeed, we established a splendid record of good-fellowship and comradeship with Great Britain when we set our hands to Article 11.</P>

      <P>I do not repudiate the Treaty.  I thank you for teaching me that word.  Who repudiates the Treaty?  Every man who brings the Treaty into odium and disfavour in the land; every man whose conduct in public affairs incites criticism in the Irish citizen's mind that the Treaty has failed, and that we are being defrauded in some respects, is an enemy of the Treaty.  What worse enemy of the Treaty is there than this White Paper with the signature of our Minister for Finance attached to it. The late Colonel Saunderson, in a debate in the British House of Commons, pointed to the Irish Parliamentary Party and declared: &ldquo;There they sit; eighty-three solid arguments against Home Rule.&rdquo; In our Front Bench, with the Ministers who were responsible for this so-called settlement sitting on it, we have a solid argument against Treaty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>If England was so generous as the <Col N="658" /> President asks us to believe, why did not our representatives, I will not say take advantage of the generosity, but utilise it?  Why is all the concession on our side?  The Treaty, the President forgets, was, to some extent, in the melting-pot from the moment that he and his colleagues went over into the blue fog in London on a certain day and agreed to Treaty No. 2.  I am talking with reference to this which is a consequence of Treaty No. 2, and he has the temerity to quote to me Treaty No. 1.  Are we possessed of such short memories?  Does he hold us in such utter contempt as to think that we forget what was said within the last hour by the Minister for Finance&mdash;that one of these Articles here was a consequence of the Pact, the Pact being the setting up of a new Treaty in certain respects?</P>
    <P>What I contend is our representatives dealing with these financial matters, not at arm's length, but face to face with the British representatives of finance, should have fought our case; they should have made our case; they should not have been so bent on establishing a reputation for themselves in the ha'penny newspapers and the illustrated Press of what good fellows they were.  Their duty in these matters was not to be popular with the British newspaper-reading public; their duty was to make the best bargain that they could for Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have a little light upon this question.  The position as it appears to me is not satisfactory, because it is not clear.  My queries in the matter are very simple. Article 5 of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty (December, 1921) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Free State shall assume liability for the service of the Public <Col N="659" /> Debt of the United Kingdom as existing at the date hereof and towards the payment of war pensions as existing at that date in such proportion as may be fair and equitable, having regard to any just claims on the part of Ireland by way of set-off or counter-claim, the amount of such sums being determined in default of agreement by the arbitration of one or more independent persons being citizens of the British Empire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, there was a liability assumed for the Public Debt of the United Kingdom. It appears to me what requires to be answered is what was included in the Public Debt of the United Kingdom? I refer to the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and in Section 23 there is a reference to Imperial liabilities:</P>
    <P>Ireland shall in each year make a contribution towards the Imperial liabilities and expenditure mentioned in the Sixth Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>The Sixth Schedule begins with a reference to National Debt charges.  I take it that the Public Debt referred to in the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty at least includes, if it does not represent entirely, what I call National Debt charges.  The Sixth Schedule sets out:</P>
    <P>National Debt Charges, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The charge in respect of the funded and unfunded debt of the United Kingdom, inclusive of terminable annuities paid out of the permanent annual charge for the National Debt and inclusive of the cost of the management of the said funded and unfunded debt; and</P>
    <P>(2)  All other charges on the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom for the repayment of borrowed money or to fulfil a guarantee other than charges in respect of local loans stock and any guaranteed stock raised for the purpose of land purchase in Ireland.</P>
    <P>That reference &ldquo;other than&rdquo; is part of the paragraph which refers to other charges on the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom.  It appears to me, as I read it, that charges in respect of local loans stock and guaranteed <Col N="660" /> stock raised for the purpose of land purchase are part of the public debt of the United Kingdom.  If that is answered in the affirmative that is the actual position; that represents the public debt in the absence of any contrary statement.</P>
    <P>Then we have to read Article 2 of the settlement of last December, which states that &ldquo;the Irish Free State is hereby released from the obligations under Article 5 of the said Articles of Agreement.&rdquo; We are therefore released from the obligations to assume liability for the Public Debt of the United Kingdom or that part of it which, in the Treaty settlement, came to the Free State.  I am at a loss to understand any other interpretation. There may be one evident which I am not able to see, but it requires explanation.</P>
    <P>If there is a responsibility lying upon the British Government for Irish land stock and the interest thereon, that, I take it, would be part of the Public Debt.  Any share of responsibility in respect of that, or in respect of local loans stock, was wiped out by the Agreement of last December.  If that is controverted and the denial is made clear, then it seems to me there is no case in respect of the claim for the retention of the land purchase annuities or the fund that is created by the land purchase annuities.</P>
    <P>I would like to have some clear statement of the case; some repudiation, and evidence in support of the repudiation, of the statement that the interest on land stock is part of the Public Debt of the United Kingdom.  If it is not part of the Public Debt, then presumably it is not guaranteed by the British Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>We were released from the obligation to assume a share of that Public Debt which included interest <Col N="662" /> on the Irish Land Stock.  The Minister, I hope, will make it clearer than it is at present.  To me it is clear enough that every portion of the liability which fell upon the British Exchequer in respect of the Public Debt was wiped out in December last.  Therefore there was wiped out the obligation to pay any sum of money towards interest on Irish land stock, and, as a consequence, if that is even an arguable interpretation, we would be entitled to retain in this country the amount of money received in land purchase annuities.  That seems to me to be a question that ought to be particularly dealt with by Ministers.  On the information that is before me at present, it seems to me that we are not liable to pay the sums mentioned in paragraph 1 of this White Paper.  And again it seems to me that the undertaking entered into, in respect of that, leaving the question of local loans out for the moment&mdash;I will leave that to settle itself, because I take it the same reasoning would apply to one as to the other&mdash;is one that it is hard to understand. At any rate, I would like to have it made clearer than it is, if it can be made clearer, why the Government accepted the liability to pay the full amount of the annuities accruing under the Irish Land Stock inasmuch as the Irish Land Stock was a liability of the British Exchequer, which we were relieved from paying by the agreement of December, 1925.</P>

      <P>It should be understood that so far as Article 1 was necessary in this paper at all it was really only necessary for the last two lines&mdash;that is, &ldquo;without any deduction whatsoever, whether on account of income tax or otherwise.&rdquo; The whole question of the payment of these annuities in general has been settled and decided by the Oireachtas, and the matter is provided for in the Land Act of 1923, so that the question that was settled by these heads of settlement was that there should not be a deduction for income-tax.  We have been claiming income-tax, and we have been holding the money in support of our claims for income tax on the interest portion of the debt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The appropriate authority was the Land Purchase Fund or the Land Purchase Account, the primary security for the payment of this loan.  The liability of the British Exchequer in respect of this loan is a contingent liability.  The Exchequer comes in, in so far as annuities are concerned. The fund into which the annuities are to be paid does not meet the requirements of Interest and Sinking Fund.  A different kind of argument may be put up in reference to the Excess and Bonus Stock.  There may be matters to be argued so far as that is concerned.  But so far as the ordinary issues are concerned there is nothing to argue about.  That is met out of the annuities which repay the Interest and Sinking Fund, and any liability which the British Exchequer has in that respect is purely a contingent one.</P>

      <P>I cannot go into Mr. Justice Meredith's decision at all.  Now, there is just the other aspect of the thing, and that is that this agreement, and the agreement of December last, were not drawn up with all the detail with which an Act is drawn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is, everything that might possibly be questioned is not set down. They are not articles that were months in preparation and in course of elaboration. The circumstances, therefore, in which these agreements were made, and the understandings on which they were based, must be taken into account.  The <Col N="665" /> basis on which the December Agreement was come to was that public debt did not include liability in respect of land stock interest.  That was specifically understood between the two parties. The President informs me that it was mentioned during the debate.  In respect to the local loans, the position simply is that a certain amount of money was lent to people by the fund. Now, we might claim in respect to the local loans fund that the fund should be divided, that we should assume our share of liabilities, and that we should get our share of the assets, but that is impossible where you have a stock issue to the public.  You cannot say that a certain part of the local loans stock held by an individual is to be the responsibility of the British Government, and that another portion is to be the responsibility of the Free State Government, so that it is not practicable to divide the fund, and the only thing to do is to arrive at some arrangement which would be equitable to both parties. It might even have been claimed that the land purchase fund should have been divided just, for instance, as the Church Temporalities fund was divided between the Saorstát and Northern Ireland.  It might have been claimed that the land purchase fund should have been divided, that we should have taken our responsibility for a share of the stock, and that we should have received the assets.  The reason that was not done was because it was not practicable, and it would have been no better for us.  We would certainly have had to assume liability for stock up to the full value of the annuities that we were receiving.  Probably, under any arrangement for a division we would have been much worse off, but again it was not a practicable thing to divide the land purchase fund.  It was not possible, for instance, to say that the dividend on the land stock held by Deputy Magennis should be the liability of the Saorstát Government, and that the dividend on the land stock held by Deputy Good should be the liability of the British Government.  You cannot divide stock which has been issued to the public in that way.  It was not practicable to divide the fund, and the only thing that could be done was to arrive at some agreement.  You could <Col N="666" /> not have any agreement fixing in equity and fairness the liability of the Saorstát at less than the amount of the annuities the Saorstát was actually collecting.</P>

It may be necessary to give notice before the adjournment for Christmas of the extension of the Medical Act for possibly three months.  It may not be necessary to continue it for three months, as an agreement has been practically reached in the matter, and it is only a question of working out the details, but fearing that a Bill embodying the agreement would not be passed in time it may be necessary to extend the present Act.</P>
