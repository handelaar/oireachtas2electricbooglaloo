      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy refers to an extension of the existing arrangements either by way of the approval of the Kesh-Pettigo road for the conveyance of non-dutiable goods and motor cars, or the establishment of a Customs station at Pettigo for the clearance of goods imported and exported by rail, or both.  The volume of traffic conveyed into and out of Pettigo is not considered sufficient to warrant the expense that would be involved in the adoption of either course.</P>

      <P>What I want to draw the Minister's attention to particularly is not so much the railway traffic, which I have already brought to his notice in a previous question, but where goods have to go to Ballyshannon, and the merchants have to pay carriage both <Col N="1650" /> ways.  The Minister has already established posts in other parts of the country where the ordinary motor car van will get through, and where non-dutiable goods will get through without touching in any way the dutiable goods.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture <Col N="1652" /> whether he is aware that six tenants, stated to be rack-rented, on the estate of Florence Bateman, Oughill, Redcross, Wicklow, applied to have a fair rent fixed in January, 1923; that their case was tried by the County Court Judge on the 30th May, 1923, and that since then no decision has been given; whether the Minister is also aware that the Land Commission has decreed these men half-yearly; that they have refused to pay, and have not paid any rent pending the Judge's decision, and whether the Minister can state when the decision will be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the rental lodged by the landlord to enable the Land Commission to collect compounded arrears of rent and payment in lieu of rent, the tenants referred to were returned as holding under judicial rents fixed at various dates between 1897 and 1905.  The Land Commission applied to the tenants for compounded arrears of rent and payment in lieu of rent calculated on these rents, but the tenants refused to pay on the grounds that they had applied to the Civil Bill Court to have fair rents fixed for a further statutory term.  Unless and until new rents are fixed as a result of these applications, the Land Commission had no option but to collect on the basis of the existing judicial rents, and as the tenants refused to pay proceedings were taken in the Circuit Court.  The Circuit Court Judge, after hearing the parties, gave decrees in favour of the Land Commission against which the tenants have appealed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the applications to have further fair rents fixed, the Commissioners understand the applications were heard by County Court Judge Drumgoole in May, 1923, and judgment was reserved until the holdings had been inspected by the County Court Valuer.  As the applications were made, not to the Land Commission, but to the Civil Bill Court for County Wicklow, the Land Commission cannot take any action as regards them, and it is for the tenants to take such action as they may be advised to have their applications disposed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Deputy nor myself can take the place of the Judge and announce his decision for him beforehand.  In the meantime, the rent is there, off which they have got a 25 per cent. reduction.  The Land Commission must recognise the law as it is and the existing position, and collect the rents on that.  What alternative have they?</P>

Thompson, who is the owner of several other farms in the same county, on April 28th, 1926, on instructions, it is alleged, received from one of the Land Commission inspectors, and whether the Commissioners do not now propose to divide these lands amongst the local uneconomic holders and landless men; whether Mr. Thompson's previous residential holding at Barraghaun, Errill, Co. Leix (Estate of Richard Edmund Mills, Record No. 1248), was entered in a provisional list published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, dated November 20th, 1925, in the name of Mrs. Elizabeth Winters (Thompson's sister-in-law), Ballagh, Charleville, Co.

      <P>With regard to this question, I have not got full particulars of the case, but as I understand the position it is something like this.  Mr. Thompson had a number of farms&mdash;I do not know how many&mdash;and he assigned one of them to a third party, a relation.  That is being retained, and acquired by the Land Commission.  If the Land Commission proposals are put into operation he would be left with something, so far as I can gather at present with the insufficient information at my disposal, like 150 Irish acres.  I am not in a position at the moment to give the names of the farms to the Deputy, but so far as I can ascertain from a short examination of the files, the position is as I have stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. The Land Commission issued an offer for the purchase of 382 acres situate on the estate of J. W. E.

The lands held by the Ferbane Co-operative Farming Society, Ltd., have been vested in the Land Commission under Part III of the Land Act, 1923, and, from the date of vesting, the Society is deemed under the provisions of the Act to have entered into a subsequent Purchase Agreement for the purchase of the lands from the Land Commission.

      <P>The Land Commission have included untenanted lands in the townland of Ballickmoyler, comprising 45a. 3r. 3p., and Rathtillig, comprising 291a. 1r. 24p., in a Provisional List of lands published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> as lands which, if not excluded in consequence of a valid objection, will vest in them on the appointed day.  An offer for the purchase of the lands has recently been communicated to the owner, which he has not accepted.  The lands are gazetted and the price will be fixed by the Judicial Commissioners.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Fifth Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges I desire to say that it embodies a complete new draft of Standing Orders, which in practice means that the existing Standing Orders would have to be annulled and the proposed Orders adopted.  Deputies who have read the Report have seen that the proposed new Standing Orders have been subjected to a number of processes.  They were first prepared by the Clerk and his assistants after consultation with me.  They were then gone over by myself, and afterwards submitted to an informal conference of certain Deputies whose advice it was thought desirable to obtain.  They were then considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, who made certain amendments.  For certain reasons it would be desirable that the Standing Orders should be adopted before the Recess, so that work could be done upon them during the Recess.  The suggestion is that the Report be put down for consideration on Thursday next.  If in the interval Deputies who are particularly interested desire to have any point explained, they could apply to any member of the Committee or to myself, and we might, perhaps, be able to settle the matter. If, on Thursday, it was discovered that there was no serious objection to any part of these Standing Orders, I think, in view of the general business, we could proceed with them.  In many important respects we are following in practice, not the Standing Orders by which we are bound, but those contained in the draft.  They are, to a large extent, the product of our own practice.  If that is agreeable, we will make an Order fixing the consideration of the Report for next Thursday.</P>

Is it the intention of the Local Government Department and the Finance Department to set the work in motion, as far as possible on these trunk roads, this summer?  I ask that for two reasons.  The first reason is that you will have the fine weather and the long days to get ahead with the work, and it can be done much more satisfactorily now than in the winter; my second, and perhaps more important, reason is that it will give relief to the unemployed.

      <P>In page 3, to add at the end of Section 3 a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Upon the trial, with a jury called from a panel of jurors returned under this Act, of any person for a felony other than murder, treason, or treason felony the court may, if it see fit, at any time before the jury consider their verdict permit the jury to separate in the same way as the jury upon the trial of any person for misdeameanour are now permitted to separate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to avoid the unnecessary locking-up of juries.  I may say that it meets with the approval of the judges and of the counsel who conduct prosecutions on behalf of the State.  It is felt that the mandatory locking-up of juries where a case lasts from one day to the next should be reduced to the minimum, and that a discretion should be left in the court, except in cases of murder, treason, or treason-felony, to dispense with the locking-up of jurors overnight. It is very often an inconvenience to Dublin jurors that in some case which is really not a grave matter, they should be obliged to spend the night together in the Four Courts Hotel, as happens at present, under the existing condition of the law.  My own feeling was rather in favour of allowing this provision to wait over for the more comprehensive Juries Bill which will have to be introduced in the winter or early next year, but I have been assured by the Under-Sheriff of the City of Dublin and by the counsel who generally conduct prosecutions on behalf of the State that it would be a very considerable relief if this provision were inserted in the present Bill.

      <P>In page 8, before Section 18, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>On and after the 1st day of November, 1926, entertainments duty within the meaning of Section 1 of the Finance (New Duties) Act, 1916, shall not be charged or levied on payments for admission to any entertainment as respects which it is proved to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that the entertainment consists solely of one or more courses between greyhounds.</P>
      <P>This amendment exempts coursing matches from the entertainment tax.  I felt unable to agree that bets on any event whatever should be exempted from the betting tax.  On the other hand it is recognised that in the circumstances under which bets are made on coursing matches, the incidence of the tax would be rather heavier than on racecourses.  There is also the fact that it is not intended to hold out any hope to the people concerned in the promotion of coursing that anything might be done to assist them in the matter of stakes, and consequently it was felt that there is a case for the particular concession that is offered, that is exempting coursing matches from the entertainment tax.  My belief is that, from the revenue point of view, it will probably leave us in very much the same position actually as if we were getting no betting tax on the betting done at coursing matches.  The amount of money involved is not considerable. It is perhaps in the neighbourhood of £1,000.</P>

I can quite understand that when he is determined to have a tax on betting on racing he must also, for the sake of fair administration, carry the same rule into effect with regard to coursing.  I see his difficulty, and I sympathise with it.  I also see the point that executives of coursing meetings who very often have little or no connection with owners, will welcome the present suggestion in preference to a tax on betting, but I do not receive it with the enthusiasm of members of the executive.  I am an owner, and not a member of an executive, and the whole drain now is going to come out of the pockets, to a large extent, of the owners who are already carrying coursing on their backs.  I believe this is the best the Minister could do, and in the circumstances I am more or less compelled to accept it.  I do not, however, receive it enthusiastically, as I am satisfied that the whole drain is going to fall on the owners, without whom no sport could be held.</P>

      <P>The Minister has undoubtedly gone a long way in this matter, but I see some difficulty still in relation to open coursing.  Where open coursing is carried on&mdash;it is quite different from park coursing&mdash;there is no charge for admission to the ground.  I have several coursing clubs in County Meath in my mind at the moment which practically all carry on open coursing.  They have to drive in the hares and coursing is not carried on in the same manner as at a park meeting.</P>

      <P>They pay out each year a considerable sum of money in prizes. This money is not realised on gate receipts but on voluntary contributions from people who are sympathetic to coursing.  In fact the majority of the subscriptions they get are as low as 6d. for each day's coursing.  A very large number of people who attend such coursing meetings do not subscribe at all.  It is the people who own the dogs who subscribe and who have a bet on the dogs.</P>
      <P>The whole burden of this tax will be placed on the owners of the dogs, who, if they want to keep open coursing, which is very necessary, in existence, must continue to give voluntary contributions to the club.  At the same time if they wish to bet on their dogs and keep alive their interest in the coursing they will have to pay the tax.  I do not think that the Minister went very deeply into the matter or he would have given more consideration to open coursing clubs.  In County Meath there are at least five clubs that have open meetings.  They will derive no benefit; indeed they will be victimised as compared with their better-off friends who arrange park coursing.  At Dunshaughlin they have four coursing meetings every year.  The club is kept up by voluntary contributions; some contributions are as low as 6d. and some as high as 5/-.  A man who would have a number of dogs running would probably give 5/-.  The people who attend the meetings and who take an interest in coursing will be called upon to pay this betting tax.  I think it is unreasonable and I believe it will help to kill open coursing in this country.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give us any information, based on the experience of the Department, in relation to the way the entertainment tax falls?  Does it fall on the proprietor of the entertainment, or the grounds or building in which the entertainment takes place, or does it, as presumably was intended, fall on the patrons of the entertainment?  It would be well to have that made clear, because there seems to be a very general opinion held by persons interested in the provision <Col N="1670" /> of entertainment that it is they who pay the tax, whereas the public have a belief that it is the public that pay it.  It would be well to have an authoritative declaration on this matter from the Minister, so far as he can base his statement on the experience of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The Minister is well aware that if this betting tax is started at coursing meetings it will take three or more officials to calculate the amount which the State will receive from the tax.  It would not be worth the Minister's while to impose it as the amount to be realised will be very small.  On behalf of the people who asked me to oppose this tax, I desire to thank the Minister for agreeing to exempt the matter from taxation.  As it is an old Irish sport, the Minister might go a little further.  He might consider the possibility of buying out, in different areas, a sufficient amount of land for the purposes of coursing.  The Minister for Finance could arrange with the Minister for Lands and Agriculture to take over land, and in that way he would encourage this old Irish sport. <Col N="1671" /> In my constituency it is difficult to get armers to allow people to course on heir land.</P>

      <P>It would be quite impossible to agree to exempt bets on coursing, or any bets, from the betting tax.  That would make the proper enforcement of the tax impossible.  All that I could do to meet the claim that coursing was in a peculiar position was to give this concession on the entertainment tax.  Taking the entertainment tax broadly, the general position undoubtedly is that the public pays.  When the entertainment tax was imposed, houses of entertainment, theatres and picture-houses, put up their prices by the amount of the tax, so that the public pays.  The scheme they have in mind when they clamour for the abolition of the tax is that they should keep up their prices at the present level so that the public would pay them, but they would not pay the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>There are certain cases where you have not a regular entertainment. Take, for instance, something like a coursing match which occurs occasionally, and where they have a fixed price of one shilling or one and sixpence.  It would not be convenient for them to alter their price.  There is something in the nature of a round figure and it always remains at that.  It was possibly at the same figure before the entertainment tax was put on, and it remained at that level with the tax, and if the tax is taken off it will not change.  Taking the tax broadly, there is no doubt the public pay it.  If the tax were taken off it is quite probable that the harvest reaped by the owners would be only a temporary harvest and a certain amount of competition would gradually drive down prices to the level that would allow for the removal of the tax.</P>

      <P>In page 10, Section 23 (1) to insert after the word &ldquo;bets,&rdquo; line 19, the words &ldquo;(with the exception hereinafter mentioned)&rdquo; and to insert before sub-section (2) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Bets entered into on any racecourse in Saorstát Eireann in respect of any horse running thereat shall be exempt from the duty prescribed by sub-section (1) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment to the Finance Bill was repeated by me in order to get the Minister's decision in regard to a refund of half the tax collected for the improvement of stakes.  I must say it is the unanimous opinion of all persons interested in racing and breeding that this refund is absolutely essential, as even a reduction of the tax from 5 per cent. to 2½ per cent. on the turnover will seriously reduce the attendance of the public at race meetings.  If the various race companies are not recouped in this way they will naturally be obliged drastically to reduce the stakes, with inevitable injury to racing and breeding.</P>
      <P>I have just received two telegrams from the Curragh which I will read. The first was handed in at the Grand Stand at the Curragh and reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Shaw, Leinster House, Dublin. Turf Club unanimously favour your amendment advocating a refund of half betting tax to racecourse executives for the benefit of racing.  The Turf Club are in no way opposed to a tax on betting away from the course and strongly urge that the burden imposed on racecourse betting should be as light as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1673" /> The second telegram is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At a meeting of the Executive Committee of Breeders, Owners and Trainers' Association held to-day the following resolution, proposed by H. Usher and seconded by T. Rea, was passed unanimously:&mdash;&lsquo;That in the opinion of this Association the tax proposed to be levied on betting at racecourses will have a paralysing effect on the continuance of racing, and from what the council of the Association knows of the financial position of the various racecourses now carrying on in the Free State, any further drain on their resources must eventually be fatal to racing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance can check this statement through the Revenue Commissioners who are quite aware of the position above referred to.  The Breeders, Owners and Trainers' Association call on Shaw and friends in Dáil Eireann to resist the imposition of this tax unless half of it is allocated to the improvement of stakes.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I am rather confident that the Minister will meet me in that matter, perhaps it is not necessary for me to say any more for the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter that has a technical and practical aspect. The technical aspect is, of course, that provision for what is desired by Deputy Shaw could not properly be made in a Finance Bill.  If any money, the produce of taxation, is to go in expenditure, whether it be monies paid out for an ultimate object by the Government or whether it is handed over to other people, it should properly be done by way of submission of an estimate to the Dáil and the voting of the money.  That means that whatever it might be desirable to do in the way of increasing stakes for race meetings would be a matter for another Bill and a matter for inclusion in the annual Estimates. This matter has been considered by the Executive Council, and while we are clearly of opinion that we must not injure racing, it is not certain whether such a proportion of the tax that is collected at race meetings would be necessary in order to save the position of racing.  We do not know, for instance, whether the combined effect of <Col N="1674" /> starting the totalisator and imposing a betting tax may not be to improve the position of racecourse executives.  It it were to happen that the position, owing to the combined operations of both these things&mdash;because the totalisator will be a protection as against the discouragement that would result from the betting tax&mdash;is going to be that racecourse executives will be better off, then there would not be a case for improving the stakes up to the amount of half the tax collected at the races.  On the other hand, if the combined result of the two things were to turn out that the revenue of the racecourse executives was seriously injured, we would not object to recommending the Dáil to provide the money for stakes up to half the amount of the tax actually collected from the bets made on the course.  But this whole matter is a matter that cannot be investigated in advance.  We do not know what revenue we are going really to have from the tax on the course.  We can form various estimates, but these estimates may be proven to be right or wrong. We have had prognostications of all sorts, but we do not know what the effect of the betting tax is going to be on the revenue that will be available for rececourse executives.  In regard to the totalisator, the position is that a decision can be easily enough come to. We propose to take 5 per cent. of the takings of the totalisator, and as the totalisator will be depriving racecourse executives of a certain revenue that they get from bookmakers, and as their consent would be necessary to setting up the totalisator, it is a fair enough proposition that the net receipts of the totalisator should be divided&mdash;that is, in case the Revenue Commissioners are actually running the totalisator&mdash;between the State and the racecourse executives.  In the case where other people are running the totalisator under licence, it will be a matter of striking a bargain which would result in the State getting as much revenue out of the totalisator as if it were running the totalisator itself directly.  So that as far as the totalisator is concerned the matter is simple. With regard to the tax on bets at racecourses, there is nothing to guide us or <Col N="1675" /> nothing to indicate what we would have to pay or whether we would be properly called upon to pay anything. My own view is that probably a case will appear for our paying something towards the stakes.</P>
      <P>There is the fact that the British Government at the present time is providing about £1,600 per annum for the provision of stakes at Irish races.  It seems to me quite likely when we examine the figures of the revenues of the racecourse executives after the tax has been put into operation that some particular figure, in the way of supplement of stake money, will be called for. The position of the Government is that they are prepared to recommend the Dáil to do what may appear to be necessary to prevent the position of racing in Ireland being prejudiced by the imposition of the betting tax up to half the amount that would be collected from bets at racecourses.  But they are not prepared at the moment to say that they would recommend the Dáil to provide that sum when they do not know whether the whole result of this tax will be so to prejudice racecourses that they would have no just claims for the amounts.  This is simply a matter of stating the policy of the Government on this question.  We could not properly deal with the business here and now.  We can only say what our view is, and what we intend to propose under certain circumstances, because I am quite clear what ought to be done about this matter is to vote whatever money is going to go for an increase in the stakes, year after year in the Dáil. Our position simply is that we do not think that the position of racing should be prejudiced.  We believe that the amount of racing or some amount of racing approximate to what goes on at the present time is necessary for keeping the horse-breeding industry at its present pitch, and keeping up a proper interest in the horse-breeding industry. In fact, I can go a little further, and say we believe that the industry would benefit if stakes were increased, even apart from the betting tax, because if there were greater sums available in stakes there would be encouragement to a different type of owner to breed and race horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" /> The position is not that if the race meetings remain with approximately or precisely the same revenue as they have at present we would not propose to do anything, but if the race meetings are not appreciably injured, we would not necessarily propose to do very much, because we would be glad to have all the revenue that we could get out of what is really a luxury for the purpose of enabling us to remit taxation in other directions.  On the other hand, if there appears to be any serious injury to racing as a result of the tax, which would require an increase of the stakes to counteract it, and keep racing going, we would be prepared to consider sympathetically the point of view put forward by Deputy Shaw, and to make recommendations.  Meantime, as I have said, the whole position is too indefinite, and actual experience is required before a decision can be come to, or before any firm promise can be made in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill I proposed an amendment, the effect of which was what Deputy Shaw has now suggested, namely, that half of the tax so collected should be devoted to improving the stakes.  You, sir, ruled that it was out of order on that occasion.  The Minister has now stated that he is of opinion that this is not the proper time or way to raise this question.  Perhaps I may be allowed to suggest that it would be possible to bring about this desired end by means of the Appropriation Bill.  I do not know, sir, what your views upon that are.  But the Minister seems to think that the only method of appropriating this money would be by introducing a new resolution and passing a separate Bill.  I would suggest, if he were so disposed, that the money having been voted by these resolutions and by this Bill, provision could be made in the Appropriation Bill for the allocation of that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, I was particularly interested in the tone of the Minister's most recent speech on this subject. When he introduced this betting tax he informed the House that he expected to get a revenue of from £150,000 to £200,000 from it.  His latest confession <Col N="1677" /> amounts to this, that he does not know what he is going to get, and that he cannot make any promise about allocating any sum, because he really does not know where he is.  That has been my attitude all through the discussion of this proposed tax: that the Minister for Finance, not having sufficiently investigated the subject, not being in a position to state definitely what he expects to get by means of this tax, is in reality taking a leap in the dark.  We have it now on his own confession that he cannot make certain allocations for a certain purpose of the tax collected on the course, because in reality he does not know what he is going to get. I think that certainly is a timely confession, and one that shows the nature of the proposed tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister has sought to draw a distinction between a tax on bets made with bookmakers and a tax collected by way of the totalisator.  He seems to be confident in regard to the totalisator.  To use his own words, it will be a simple matter.  I fail to see how it will be any more simple in regard to the totalisator than in regard to the tax collected from the bookmakers.  I do not know whether the Minister's advisers have informed him of the custom in other countries. Perhaps he is not aware that in every country in which there is a betting tax a certain sum actually has been allocated and is definitely earmarked for the purpose of improving the stakes or encouraging horse-breeding.  In France, where the system first came in, where the Pari Mutuel first saw the light of day, I think 50 per cent. is allocated for the improvement of stakes and the remainder is given for charitable purposes, such as hospitals.  Similarly in Australia and New Zealand.  In these countries it is not done by way of an actual proposal dependent upon the amount of tax collected, but it is a definite rule laid down by the respective Parliaments that no matter what the amount may be, or whether the tax is collected by way of the totalisator or from bookmakers, a certain percentage shall go to the improvement of stakes and for the benefit of horse-breeding.</P>
    <P>I fail to see why we cannot follow that beaten track.  Even though the Minister has confessed that he does not <Col N="1678" /> know what he is going to get from the tax, I do not see that that alters the principle of the suggestion in any way. The suggestion is that if this tax produces revenue&mdash;no matter what that revenue may be&mdash;a certain proportion should go towards the improvement of stakes and for the benefit of horse-breeding. I do not think that that suggestion is dependent upon whether the tax hits the race meeting executives or not.  This is a tax which undoubtedly will hit various classes.  It will hit those who go to race meetings merely for the sake of pastime and enjoyment and who have to pay entertainment tax.  There is no proposal here as in the case of coursing to remove the entertainment tax.  It will also hit those who go there for business purposes, such as bookmakers, and it will hit the owners and trainers.  To suggest that if it does not seriously injure racing nothing is to be done for the improvement of stakes, or for the benefit of horse-breeding, is, I think, hardly fair. I think in face of the strong representations made to the Minister, especially the latest one which we have just heard from Deputy Shaw, there is no reason why he should not proceed along the well recognised path and in accordance with the customs which have been adopted in other countries.  To say merely that this is not technically the opportunity for bringing it up and that he would require a separate resolution and separate Bill to do so, I think is altogether burking the issue.  I suggest that it would be possible, if the Minister so desired, to allocate a certain percentage of the revenue derived both from the bookmakers and the totalistator upon the Appropriation Bill.  That is, if he so desires.  But evidently he does not so desire.  I must say as one who has taken part in those discussions that I am gravely disappointed at the Minister's attitude to-day because he leaves no hope for encouragement for either horse-breeders, owners or the executives of the race meetings in Ireland, and I think it is to be regretted that he is not able, as has been done elsewhere, to give an assurance of a certain percentage no matter what the tax may be.</P>

      <P>My instructions from <Col N="1679" /> the owners, trainers, breeders and stewards of the Turf Club are very definite, and those are that they should get a definite promise from the Minister on this subject.  The Minister's reply is vague.  We know that racing is bound to be injured and I must ask the Minister to reconsider this matter or otherwise I will be obliged to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shaw expressed his great confidence in the benevolent intentions of the Minister with regard to the betting tax and the portion that was asked to be allotted to the racing executives.  It is a well-known fact that the racing executives all over Ireland are in a very poor way. In fact, the Curragh executive, which controls the premier flat-race meetings in this country, and which has special advantages in the way of having a racecourse and appurtenances practically free of rent, find great difficulty in paying their way.  The plan the Minister has in mind appears to be that first of all he has to find out whether or not injury has been done to the race meetings by the imposition of the tax before he goes to their assistance. It may be too late to go to their assistance then because many of them may be out of existence.  As it is, the smaller meetings all over the country are offering very poor stakes which are not sufficient to attract a good class of horse.  It is absolutely necessary, if they are to be kept on their feet, that some help should be given in view of the fact that it is almost certain injury will be done to them by the imposition of the tax.  It is a matter for regret that the Minister did not fall in with the suggestion made by Deputy Shaw on behalf of the owners and breeders and give those people a definite promise that he would come to their assistance in the way of apportioning to them part of the revenue collected by this tax.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Shaw's first amendment on the Committee Stage was before us we thought the Minister was going to accede to this proposal, that half should be given back, and the position of the owners, trainers and breeders then all over the <Col N="1680" /> country was clearly stated.  At that time the opinion of the premier body in Ireland ruling races, namely, the Turf Club, was not available.  Now we know definitely, through the telegram Deputy Shaw read to the House, what their opinion on that matter was, and I think such opinion ought not to be lightly set aside.  Of course it is a well-known fact that of the racing corporations throughout Ireland excepting the Curragh and Fairyhouse there are only four that pay any dividends, three in Dublin and the one in Tramore.  That being the case, I think a definite blow to horse-breeding and racing will be struck if this money is not promised to be given back to increase the stakes. I think, as far as practically an outsider can understand the technicalities of the case, that it will have a very bad effect on racing and horse-breeding, and everything in that connection, if the Minister does not see his way to state definitely that a certain sum of money shall be set apart for stakes, whether it be taken from the tax or whether it be a sum allocated definitely by him now, as Deputy Redmond suggested, through the Appropriation Bill. I hope even at this late hour he will reconsider his position.</P>

      <P>I hope Deputy Shaw will not be so easily led on this amendment as he was on the Committee Stage of the Bill, and that he will not accept promises from the Minister as to his intentions, that he would, as he stated in the Committee Stage, see that two and a half per cent. should go towards the stakes of the race meetings.  I put an amendment down on the Committee Stage to reduce the entire betting tax from five per cent. to two and a half per cent.  On the statement the Minister made I withdrew the amendment, and as Deputy Shaw was putting down his amendment to-day I did not wish to put mine on the Order Paper.  If I did I would put it to the House.  To my mind the House should not accept the Minister's suggestion now that the Turf Club, himself and his Government will consider this matter, and that then the Minister for Finance will see what amount of money, if any, he will return. It will all depend on whether the race meetings are flourishing.  If they are <Col N="1681" /> flourishing with the five per cent. tax there will be nothing refunded.  How is the Minister to find out how many men will be unemployed from the different occupations?  Will he be able to find out from the Labour Exchanges that so many men in the Curragh and Newbridge were dismissed?  Will Deputy Shaw tell him how many men he himself will dismiss?  I think the House should not accept the suggestion of the Minister.  If the House does it will be something like the promise we got concerning the report of the Old Age Pensions Committee.  The old age pensioners were to get the shilling back that was taken off their pensions, but they have not received it yet.  The same will apply to the promised refund of half the two-and-a-half per cent.  I think, unless the Minister gives an undertaking definitely that this sum will be refunded, Deputy Shaw should press his amendment.  I hope that every Deputy who is a lover of sport, and who wishes to see this industry flourish, will support it.  I fail to see how the Minister for Finance has in any way met any of the suggestions made to him.  The Finance Bill is actually the same to-day as when it was introduced except that in some cases the penalty has been increased from £200 to £500, and that without any authority whatsoever. I think it is clear that no amendment will be accepted by the Minister and no suggestion will be given effect to.  I do not believe that the Minister is at all serious when he says that he will consider, at some future time, representations as to refunding of half the two-and-a-half per cent.  He says that the amount must be voted by the Dáil.  If it is he will come forward next year perhaps with an Estimate for £100 to be distributed amongst all the race meetings.  He will tell us that is all the Government can afford.  That is the reward Deputy Shaw will get for the manner in which he puts forward the claims of the owners and breeders, the Jockey Club, etc.  That is the only guarantee he has got from the Minister.  Whether he is going to accept that guarantee or not I do not know, but I say that he should fight for his rights.  I think that Deputy Shaw should insist upon his amendment, and I think the Minister <Col N="1682" /> should be shown up, so that we will see whether he has his voting machine behind him.</P>
      <P>It is a terrible think to put this tax on every class of sport, where there is a bookmaker.  If the Labour Party were to organise a sports in aid of the unemployed, and bookmakers were to attend there, this tax would have to be paid.  So far as I am concerned I do not believe the Minister has any intention of giving anything in the nature of a substantial sum out of the amount of money collected at racecourse meetings. I am opposed to the 5 per cent. where it is imposed, and I regret not having had an amendment down to reduce it to two-and-a-half per cent.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider sympathetically the plea put forward by Deputy Shaw. I look upon this matter purely from the employment point of view.  We are hit very hardly in Kildare by unemployment at present, and if, as is contended by the Turf Club, this tax is going to injure racing and horse-breeding generally, then we at the Curragh will have more unemployed men thrown upon our hands.  I cannot see why the Minister will not consider the strong representations forwarded to him by the Executive of racing at the Curragh.  I do not believe these gentlemen would put forward any sort of plea to trick the Minister.  The Minister should take cognisance of the views of the people. I cannot see why he would not give half the two-and-a-half per cent. tax on course betting to the racing executives of the country.  In this country we have an industry renowned all over the world, and the Minister is doing his best to kill it.  His protestation as to seeing how it will go for twelve months is all bunkum.  There is nothing to prevent his halving the racecourse betting tax and handing it over to the racing authorities.  There are a large number of men employed in the Curragh, and we want to see that they are kept in their employment.</P>

      <P>When we come to consider the question of racing we make certain concessions in order that racing may not be injured.  But we do not want to reduce unnecessarily the amount that may be realised by this tax.  If it was necessary, in order that racing might not be seriously injured, to devote half of the two-and-a-half per cent. to the improvement of stakes, I think we would be willing to do that. But if it is unnecessary to do it and we do not know whether it will be necessary or not, we think it would be wrong to sacrifice a substantial portion of the expected revenue from the betting tax. We have heard the statement that racing would be killed; but do not believe it.  We do not believe that racing would be killed by a 5 per cent. tax.</P>

      <P>We do not believe that it will be killed by a two-and-a-half per cent. tax and it is very doubtful whether it will be injured by such a tax.  The more I consider this matter the less impressed I am by the protestations of people who say that racing is going to be killed.  When you hear people talking of a small pool of a hundred thousand pounds or so in racing and making statements that there is no new money coming into betting, and when it is practically demonstrable that there is a big sum, running well towards £1,000,000 of new money coming into it, every year, you cannot pay much attention to the vague statements of people who say that racing is going to be killed or seriously injured by this tax.  Perhaps I am paying too little attention to the serious arguments because I have heard so many exaggerations. But when you do hear a number of exaggerations&mdash;demonstrable exaggerations&mdash;you are inclined to take with a grain of salt all other statements.  I have grave doubts whether the two-and-a-half per cent. tax will inflict any injury on racing. If I were satisfied that a tax as low as two and a half per cent. would inflict an injury, I should perhaps meet Deputy Shaw somewhat differently.  I am <Col N="1684" /> not convinced and, consequently, I cannot say that I would advise the House later on to vote a sum equivalent to half the yield of the 2½ per cent. tax.  I believe it is not desirable that the House should pass a law enabling half the yield of the tax on course-betting to be paid over to the racecourse executives out of the Central Fund.  I believe the House should continue to have control of it&mdash;that the whole money collected from betting should go into the Exchequer and that any sum to be paid out for any purpose whatsoever should be brought before the Dáil from year to year and voted. I am certainly clear that that is the proper procedure.  I am not prepared to promise, on behalf of the Government, that we will bring along an Estimate for the increase of stakes equivalent to half the yield of the tax on course-betting.  On the other hand, I am promising this&mdash;that if the operations of the tax show us that, in practice, the tax is seriously injuring racing and that it necessitates a substantial sum being provided for stakes, we are prepared to recommend the Dáil to provide that sum.  But we do not want to pledge ourselves to come here seeking a sum that may be entirely unnecessary. It may be that what I believe to be the most likely thing will happen&mdash;that there will be no appreciable decline in the attendance at racecourses and no appreciable falling-off in the revenue of racecourse executives. If that were so, there would be no case for our providing a very large sum for the purpose of increasing stakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared frankly to admit that, apart altogether from this tax and having regard to the part played by racing in regard to the horse-breeding industry, there is probably a good case for some increase in stakes at the moment but not to the extent of the sum that half the 2½ per cent. tax might amount to.  I see no reason why we should tie ourselves hand and foot in the matter, so far as we can be tied by promises. We realise the importance of racing and we are quite sympathetic in the matter.  We are prepared to make the necessary recommendations to the Dáil when evidence is available but, as for acting on all the exaggerated and unreasonable <Col N="1685" /> prognostications of disaster, that I am not prepared to do.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot arrive at any conclusion other than that I have advocated.  In regard to what the Minister has said just now, I think I would not mis-describe his attitude if I said that it was that of locking the stable after the horse was gone.  He proposes to leave the stable door open for a year and, at the end of the year, if he finds the horse gone, he will lock the stable.  It is a very serious thing to suggest that an industry like this is to be injured and that then we are to come to its rescue.  It strikes me that the Minister has developed into a sort of gambler himself, because he is willing to take the risk and responsibility of ruining this industry and then coming along, say this time twelve months, and proposing something whereby he will hope to revive the industry. I, for one, do not approve of that attitude; I do not think the risk is worth it.  The Minister has once again dealt out to us the usual story that if we do not pass this tax we shall have to tax food necessities.  There are other means of raising revenue besides taxing food.  The Minister himself supplied us with one means the other night, when he told us that if he had not overlooked it he might have secured £160,000 from one person, by reason of death duties.  If provision had been made on those lines, there would have been no necessity for this tax at all. On practically every tax proposed in this Budget, we have been told that the alternative is to tax food commodities. I think that is bordering on the ridiculous. There are many means of raising money.  The Minister has not surely exhausted his own resources and the <Col N="1686" /> resources of his advisers.  To suggest that to allocate a certain sum now, would be giving up control is, I think, beside the mark.  We have control. We can at any time we please revoke that allocation.  But in order to satisfy those who are now engaged in this industry and who have put forward their representations reasonably as well as strongly, I think the Minister should adopt the suggestion that a certain sum &mdash;it may not be 50 per cent. but it should be a definite percentage&mdash;be allocated now.  Something definite is what is asked for and not the promise that if racing is seriously injured, then something may be done in the future to prevent its total collapse.  I think that is an untenable position for the Minister to adopt, especially in regard to his own admission that although it is a luxury tax, the subject matter of the tax is one of the utmost concern to us, as it is one of our great industries.  As a result of the remarks made by the Minister and of the attitude adopted by him, I, for one, shall call for a division on this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that it is as well that I should express my views on this question.  I listened with care to the arguments that have been put forward, and I must say that I am entirely unconvinced that any legitimate case, even for doubt or hesitation, has been made on the score that the imposition of this tax will reduce the income of the racecourse executives. The proposition that is being discussed is not the effect of that tax on betting will have upon horse-racing, but the effect of the tax on the attendance at race meetings and on the income of the racecourse owning companies from that source.  I do not believe that there is going to be any appreciable reduction in the number of people who will pay for admission to a racecourse because of the imposition of 6d. in the £ on their bets.  No good arguments of an anticipatory kind have been adduced to further that proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite natural and easily understandable that people who are faced with what is a minor revolution in their own particular calling are afraid; something new has suddenly come before <Col N="1687" /> them; they are frightened by it, and they want to destroy the spectre. I can understand even more easily men who are engaged in this business being frightened by the threats of their employers, and alarmed as a consequence of the fear that has been created, the agitation that has been stirred up.  I can understand, for instance, the people who are employed on the Curragh being alarmed when they are told by their employers that this new project will destroy the source of their livelihood.</P>

      <P>They have stated that on their own account, as I suggest, echoing the alarm that has been created by their employers, and they have circularised Deputies in envelopes and with printed material provided, to all appearance, by these same employers. I can understand, as I say, quite rightly and sympathetically, the alarm which is occasioned in the minds of these men, and I have no blame whatever to attach to them for expressing these fears.  But I say that in this House, and outside it, as far as I have been able to follow the public prints, no substantial evidence has been adduced or arguments put forward to convince an impartial observer that this is in fact going to interfere with the attendance on racecourses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to listen to them, and I understand that they have said this thing, but that is all that they have done; they have merely expressed an opinion without putting forward any argument in support of that opinion.  As I say, every body of men, following an industry for a generation, as soon as something comes up against them, especially in the form of a tax, immediately react to that as though it meant inevitable destruction confronting them.  I say that nothing that has been put forward convinces me, or has moved me even <Col N="1688" /> an inch or two towards conviction, that the effect of this will be to reduce attendance at race meetings.  People are attracted to race meetings sometimes by the pure love of sport, sometimes by the love of money-getting for its own sake, but the great majority by a mixture of the two things.  They feel somehow that there must be the attraction of chance in addition to the pleasure of the sport, and one helps the other.  I do not believe for a minute that that psychology will be affected by the prospect of having the odds shortened to the extent that this tax will involve.  That is really the kernel of it, as I see it, and nothing that has been said convinces me that that is wrong or doubtful.  In that case the claim for the abolition of this tax with respect to racecourses falls to the ground from the point of view of argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other proposition regarding the return of a portion of the tax collected to the racecourse company is an entirely different one, and I think that that is met on two grounds by the Minister's statement.  I think it is quite sound for the Minister to take up the position that he refuses to put into a Bill a promise to hand over out of the Exchequer an indeterminate sum to private companies, sums which may be great or small, but which he cannot calculate, and to make that part of the Finance Bill.  I think the Minister would be quite wrong to do anything of the kind.  He has gone to the utmost that he can go legitimately; that is to say, as Finance Minister he is prepared to recommend to the Dáil under given circumstances that a Vote be taken and a grant made to these companies as compensation for losses.  I think that is a reasonable position for the Minister to take up, and I think he has met the case put forward.  He might go a little further and follow out what, I think, he seems to have suggested&mdash; that is, inasmuch as the stakes are too small at present, and as the companies cannot afford more, and as he realises that horse-breeding and the racing industry depend to a considerable extent on the amount of the stakes, he could promise to increase these stakes, not merely to make up for the losses but <Col N="1689" /> actually to give an increase.  That is a promise that I think the House would not resent, but, on the matter of procedure, I think the Minister was perfectly right and justified in resisting any temptation to put such a promise into a Bill as to pay over an indeterminate sum on chances which might not be fulfilled.  I think it is a wrong procedure even to suggest, and I will certainly vote against Deputy Shaw's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been disappointed at the attitude the Minister has adopted in this matter because the full revenue from starting-price betting, the full revenue from excise duty and from licence duty, half the totalisator receipts, and half the amount from the racecourse executives, would give a very substantial sum to the Treasury.  I have no doubt whatever that if he did accept this it would yield, as long as the money is there, the amount he estimated.  As my definite instructions are to ask for a Division if the Minister is not able to give a promise that 50 per cent. of the money would be refunded, I am afraid that there is no alternative but to do so now.</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage of the Bill I think a very strong case was made for giving complete relief from this stamp duty.  The Minister on that occasion made, I think, a very weak answer to the case put up. On the Minister giving an undertaking to look into the matter with a view to raising the amount of wages on which stamp duty would be payable to £5, I agreed to withdraw my amendment at that time.  The Minister comes along now and offers what I consider is inadequate relief.  He offers to increase the amount by £1, from £2 to £3, and proposes to continue to levy this receipt stamp duty on wages over £3 on all public servants who are obliged to pay this while outside people are exempt.  The position will be that public servants receiving a weekly wage have to pay four times the amount paid by public servants who get their salaries monthly.  I thought that the Minister, having given an assurance to look into the matter with a view to increasing the amount to £5, would at least have increased it to that sum.  I am sorry that he should come along now and only offer the very small relief contained in this amendment.  So far as I am concerned, the Minister's amendment does not meet my point or satisfy me, and I think he should have been more generous when he undertook to look into the matter.  If he had made the figure £5 it would have given me some satisfaction, but as it is it practically gives me none, and means practically nothing.</P>

      <P>(3)  In this section the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; includes the area of jurisdiction of the Provisional Government set up under Article 17 of the Treaty of 1921.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, as appears from the first words of the proposed new section, is to remove doubts.  Heretofore the view has been taken and acted upon that the Finance Act of 1922 applied, in so far as it was by circumstances applicable, to the Saorstát, and of course taxation has been collected on that basis since the Saorstát came into being.  In fact, a couple of sections of that Act have actually been repealed by the Oireachtas, but in the course of a recent case before the Supreme Court certain expressions were used which seemed to cast doubt on the matter, and once those expressions were used which did throw any doubt on the fact that this Act was in force in the Saorstát, it was necessary for us to take steps to remove that doubt.  We have examined the matter, and while we feel it is only a matter of doubt we do not desire to leave it where it is and invite litigation, and if litigation did arise, of <Col N="1695" /> being put perhaps in the position of defending the validity of the Act by arguments that we did not particularly care to use.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 22, to add at the end of the Third Schedule the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If any person proves to the satisfaction of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that he has paid in respect of any vehicle to which this paragraph applies the duty chargeable under this paragraph for any period commencing on or after the 1st day of January, 1927, and that during the whole of the period for which such duty was paid the vehicle was a hackney carriage as defined in Section 4 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1888, and was fitted with a taximeter and was lawfully plying for hire on the public streets or roads as a vehicle so fitted, he shall be entitled to repayment, where such duty was paid for a period of twelve months, of the amount (if any) by which the duty so paid exceeded twelve pounds or, where such duty was paid for a period of less than twelve months, the amount (if any) by which the duty so paid exceeded the proportion of twelve pounds appropriate to such period.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is to meet a point raised by Deputy Cooper and other Deputies on the Committee Stage.  In the case of a hackney which is a taxicab fitted with a registering device we are remitting any duty in excess of £12 which may be chargeable upon it.  It is given in the form of a rebate, because otherwise a vehicle entitled to it, and used only for two or three weeks in the year, might receive it.</P>

      <P>I think it would be only right for the House to vote against the <Col N="1696" /> Fourth Stage of this Bill.  The Minister for Finance gave no relief in his Budget this year.  He maintains that the 5 per cent. tax on betting is to pull up for the loss to the Exchequer by reductions on the cost of foodstuffs.  I hold that the Minister in his Budget has not reduced taxation on any foodstuffs, but has increased it.  We are now asked to agree to a measure that will increase the cost of living.  We have been told that the entertainment and betting taxes must be collected for the purpose of reducing the cost of some of the necessaries of life.  I hold that the 10/- licence for motor drivers included in the Finance Bill this year is unnecessary and uncalled for, as well as the 5 per cent. tax on betting and the 2/6 per cwt. on oatmeal.  All this is increasing the cost of living, and I ask the House in giving their final decision to vote in opposition to this.  It appears the Minister can come here and introduce any measure, and when, as explained by Deputy Norton, he promises to consider an amendment he comes back and gives entirely inadequate relief.  The Minister has the voting power behind him and he knows he can get any measure passed.  The old cry was: &ldquo;If I do not get this through I must resign.&rdquo;  I would like to see any Minister of this Government resigning on the question of the Budget. I ask the people of the Saorstát whether they are prepared to pay the high taxation put upon them by the Budget.  Let it be put on the programme of Cumann na nGaedheal and test the country.  We should try above all things to reduce the cost of living, which has not been reduced as we have been led to believe by the Government, who tell us that it is only 93 points above pre-war days.  I say it is 150 over pre-war days.  The Minister for Finance would not reduce the cost of the one luxury the worker can afford to get, and that is tobacco.  An ounce of common tobacco pre-war cost three-pence, and now it is ninepence, an increase of 200 per cent.  The Government are giving no help or facilities to the people so that they might be able to keep body and soul together.  I could fully understand it if this measure was brought before the House in <Col N="1697" /> 1920 or 1921 when the country was in a state of revolution and when there was plenty of money flying about.  The ex-service men were then coming forward and joining the National Army, and even a great number of the civil servants of those times were no doubt very anxious to fight for their country. You had the Secret Service, big wages and plenty of money in circulation, but to-day there is nothing of the kind.  I hold that this is not a measure that the people expected.  They want something better, and I for one will certainly oppose it.  I am convinced that the Minister and the Government are not sincere in the promises made and they have not been fulfilled.</P>

I think their exclusion from the benefit of the amendment is a great injustice to the owners of the ordinary hackney cars in the rural districts, and in the provincial towns.  These cars have not the speedometers the Minister speaks of, and, therefore, will not get the benefit which the taxi-cabs owners in Dublin will reap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw attention to the inadequacy of the provision made for the relief of unemployment in the country, and to suggest that there is a growing necessity for some extension of the Unemployment Insurance Act.  In answer to a question put by me here recently the Minister for Industry and Commerce admitted that the numbers of unemployed were increasing, and it is well known to anybody who takes any interest in the matter that the majority of the unemployed have exhausted their right to unemployment benefit.  Under the system that exists the position is that a man who has been unemployed for a certain time and gets work of a temporary nature, insurable work, say, under one of the relief schemes for three months, gets 12 stamps for that three months' work, and when he becomes unemployed again he is entitled to draw in respect of these 12 stamps 12 days' pay.  Then he is finished and is penniless, and his only hope is to get something from the rates.  But what is the position of the man who has not been fortunate enough to get even three months' employment?  He has no unemployment benefit to get for he has no stamps.  Only the man who has been lucky enough to get employment can draw unemployment benefit, and that is a side of the matter, I think, which is not known to many Deputies. It is a side of the matter, I submit, that has not received the consideration it should receive from the Government. Deputies who go home every week-end, Deputies I am sure of all parties, are aware of the growing poverty and destitution in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated here before, and it is worth repeating for the claim can be justified, that it is the duty of the Government either to provide work or to maintain people willing to work. There are, undoubtedly, many thousands of young men unemployed, and they cannot get employment notwithstanding the fact that many thousands of young men and women are clearing out of the country to America.  It is <Col N="1699" /> well known that there would be many more thousands going if they could get away.  We cannot blame them, for if they remain at home there seems to be no hope of their getting an opportunity of earning a living.  It is all very fine for people in fairly good circumstances, who have nothing better to do than write to the newspapers, deploring this wave of emigration.  If these people want to stop emigration there is only one way of doing it, and that is to provide for people who remain in the country work at a remuneration which will enable them to live in moderate decency and comfort.  I submit that the Government has not done and is not trying to do that.  I submit that it is the Government's duty to do that. The Government can set an example and give a lead, and it is not good enough for the Government, or any Minister, to tell the Dáil that they are not responsible for unemployment and that it is not their duty to provide work for the unemployed.  It is the duty of the Government to provide work for those who are willing to work.  We hear a good deal about relief schemes, and we are told that there is going to be two million pounds set aside for the making of new trunk roads.  I am glad that the Government has seen its way to make that provision for roads and, incidentally, to give employment, but I want to point out that even if that two million pounds were to be spent this year, it could only be spent, owing to the very nature of the work, in certain districts and will not reach districts where distress is greatest.</P>
    <P>Then, again, an Arterial Drainage Bill was introduced last year with a great flare of trumpets by the Government, and we were told that it would give employment.  When is it going to do so?  On the Government's own showing, it will not be sooner than 1927, and, perhaps, it will be at the end of 1927, but there will be no actual work done under the Act this year. That is the Minister's statement.  There will be no relief for unemployed workers under that Act this year, and the reason which is put forward for that decision by the Ministry is that <Col N="1700" /> they have not a staff of engineers.  I am told that there are even engineers unemployed.  I do not know if they would be suitable for the work to be carried out under the Act, but I say that if the employment of ten or twelve extra engineers would enable the Minister to start the work this year, rather than next year, they should be found, in order to give the maximum amount of employment for unskilled workers. I am not satisfied that the Government has made any serious attempt to deal with the problem of unemployment. The number of unemployed to-day is greater than it was three years ago. That cannot be denied.  The point, which I would like Deputies to grip, is that, day after day, the number of persons entitled to receive unemployment benefit is steadily decreasing because they have no stamps to their credit.</P>
    <P>Deputies and the public should not be lulled into a false sense of security as to the position of unemployment by the official figures.  Those figures only represent the numbers that are entitled to draw unemployment benefits, and it is well known that there is a far greater number unemployed who do not come into these calculations at all.  I do not think that it would be an exaggeration to say&mdash;unfortunately we have not accurate official figures&mdash;that there are in the Free State to-day, between men and women, roughly 80,000 unemployed. That is a very serious matter, not only for the people unemployed but for the country as a whole, because, in one way or another, they will have to be fed, and they certainly are a drain on people who are working and producing, and they are a drain upon the country.  I cannot understand the Government wasting their time on trivial little Bills and Acts instead of devoting it to trying to obtain a solution of this question of unemployment.  I think that the Dáil ought to say to the Government, especially as it is going to adjourn for a long time, that it is not satisfied with the way they have been dealing, or rather not dealing, with the question, and should give instructions to the Government that it should be tackled this summer in a serious way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the case which has been so ably made by Deputy Morrissey in connection with the inadequate provision made this year for the relief of unemployment. In so far as the unemployed are concerned, they need not thank the Government for having done anything for them during the past year, or for intending to do anything during the coming year.  In this year's Estimates we have an inadequate sum of £50,000 for relief schemes, in a country where there are, approximately, eighty thousand people idle and without means of sustenance. Under the Local Loans Fund there is a quarter of a million available for certain works.  We can understand how inadequate that is when parcelled out to local authorities, even though the whole amount were parcelled out this year.  The plight of the unemployed is deplorable and, notwithstanding the speeches we hear from Ministers and others who ought to have some responsibility, that trade is improving and unemployment decreasing, we still find cases to-day of men and women in continuous unemployment for three years, and without any prospect of being able to get employment. I suggested the other day, in connection with the Housing Bill, that the Government should raise a loan of ten million pounds for the purpose of dealing adequately and expeditiously with that problem, and providing some relief for hungry men and women who expect, and who have a right to expect, the Government to make provision for them in this crisis.  The President pooh-poohed the idea.  He thought that it was quite impossible to raise a loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the last North Dublin by-election Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll said as a member of the Government Party, that if Mr. Leonard and Mr. O'Connor were returned the Government proposed to borrow £20,000,000 for reconstruction. If £20,000,000 could be borrowed for reconstruction then, seeing that only one of these gentlemen was returned, £10,000,000 can be very easily borrowed now.  I think that it is only by means of raising a loan for reconstruction, for housing and for the development of the country's resources that we will ever develop the country's resources and incidentally provide for <Col N="1702" /> those hundreds of thousands of people who are hungry to-day.  No money, we are told, can be borrowed for housing. No money can be borrowed for reconstruction while millions of pounds can be paid in compensation, millions can be spent on an army and £400,000 can be paid to John Bull this year under the recent London Agreement.  Yet no money can be provided to deal with housing for the working classes especially, and no money can be obtained for reconstruction schemes or schemes which are likely to give employment. I think that is a deplorable condition of things, and every Deputy, no matter what Party he is attached to, must realise that the problem of unemployment is very acute.  What is worse, there is no prospect of amelioration in the condition of affairs.</P>
    <P>I have before me a letter from a member of the Balrothery District Council in which he says that there are 140 people idle in the village of Swords and hundreds of people idle in the town of Balbriggan.  All over the County Dublin the condition of the unemployed is deplorable.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health recently agreed to apply Section 13 of the Poor Law Act with a view to providing for the wants of the people who are in a state of acute distress there.  The operation of that section comes to an end on Monday next. If the section is not re-applied in this area hundreds of men and women who can get no assistance whatever at present, will be forced into a condition of starvation.  As the Dáil is going to adjourn for quite a long time, and as there is no evidence that the problem of unemployment will have decreased by the time we re-assemble next October or November.  I want to voice with Deputy Morrissey my protest at the failure of the Government to make any adequate provision for the relief of unemployment. I think the working classes are entitled, notwithstanding the utterances of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to expect that the Government shall find work for them.  It is the duty of the Government to find work for the unemployed. If they do not regard it as their duty to find such work then they should clear out and give control of the administration <Col N="1703" /> into the hands of people who will regard it as their duty to save every citizen from the poverty and destitution which unemployment is forcing on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. COLOHAN Mr. COLOHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to support Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Norton in their plea for the unemployed.  I do not think the Executive Council realise the gravity of the situation at all. Year after year this problem has cropped up and we have got no satisfaction from the Ministry.  I understand that there is a good deal of money to be spent on the trunk roads this year, but that will not give the employment that is necessary to cope with the present situation.  It is only in selected areas where the roads are very bad that work will be carried out.  The remaining portions of the country, the remoter districts, will receive no benefit whatever from the work carried out on these schemes.  That of course is inevitable when you are carrying out schemes of this sort, but I say to the Government that they must provide money to give relief to these people who are unemployed for anything from three months to three years.  It is criminal on the part of the Government to allow this situation to be steadily getting worse from year to year.</P>
      <P>We have had our own Government here for the last four years, and what are they doing to relieve the sufferings of the mass of the people?  Absolutely nothing.  It is enough to make men say: &ldquo;We wish to God we had the British back again.&rdquo;  I ask every Deputy to show his detestation of the way the workers are being treated by calling on the Minister to provide a sufficient amount of money to give employment so that the people may get something to do.  I see smiles around me in some quarters, but the smiles are coming from the big men of finance. They are not coming from men who have to work hard; they are sure that their families are wallowing in luxury at home.  That is not so with the workers, and I ask every Deputy to do his utmost to see that the Government puts an end to this destitution at once.</P>

At the <Col N="1704" /> same time I think it is very hard for any Government, even if it were a Labour Government, to deal with this question of unemployment, particularly when we have councillors representing districts where acute distress prevails who will not put forward some scheme to the Government to show that money could be expended with some return in that area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I will point out in a few moments where the money will come from.  I have supported the workers on every occasion in the Dáil. I have done everything in my power to try to convince the Government of the necessity of giving an adequate sum for the relief of distress.  We have to-day something over 80,000 people registered as unemployed, but how many thousands of unemployed are not registered?  How many thousands of agricultural labourers are never registered?  How many thousands of workers are there in rural districts who are not eligible for unemployment benefit or who are not engaged in any insurable occupation?  It is in these districts that real distress exists.</P>
      <P>In answer to a question last week the Minister for Finance said that the drainage schemes, particularly in Westmeath, cannot be carried out this year. Deputy Morrissey has explained why; there are not sufficient engineers.  If that is the only drawback, there are, as the Deputy said, dozens of engineers unemployed in the Saorstát, men who are quite capable and who have sufficient qualifications to carry out any drainage scheme.  To deal with this question of unemployment in country districts why not put these drainage schemes into operation immediately? Why not employ these engineers?  It would be money well spent in relieving distress amongst hundreds of thousands of families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do admit that it is very hard for any government to deal with the situation at the present time.  We have too much to meet.  By the agreement arrived at here £15,000,000 have to be paid to England as our portion of the War Debt, or as the amount of money <Col N="1705" /> England has paid to this country by way of compensation.  Certainly I do agree that that amount of money could be used to better advantage by being put into some industry that would be instrumental in giving employment to our unemployed.  We have been told on every occasion here that the Government have done their best.  I admit the Government have done a good deal. In the matter of housing a great deal of money has been expended by the Government, and a great deal of employment has been given in all parts of the Saorstát where the drainage schemes are in operation.  I know that in one particular case in Westmeath the Government have given their sanction to an expenditure of £550 for drainage and I think the work has been in progress for about a fortnight.  The £2,000,000 grant under the road scheme will not relieve distress amongst all the workers.  It will certainly give employment to a number of men, but there are hundreds of men and women living in country districts who will receive no benefit whatever from that Trunk Road Scheme.  We want something to help the workers of the country districts and towns.  Through the action of the Dáil here, I hold, as I have said before&mdash;through their putting on tariffs they have given employment to about 6,000 workers in the industries protected, but that protection was instrumental in throwing out of employment 10,000 workers.  There is more unemployment to-day in the Saorstát than when the tariff was put on.  The Government is responsible for this unemployment amongst the people.  It is useless to ask sympathy from a body of people who do not know what sympathy is.  It is very hard to expect any member on the Government benches to realise the true position.  It would be very hard to expect them to know exactly the conditions under which the workers have to live, because none of these Deputies ever had the experience of having to go to bed supperless or seeing his little ones go to school without their breakfast.  Yet that is an everyday occurrence with the children of the unemployed in the Saorstát to-day. One particular man, in the town of Moate, came to me last Saturday. He is in receipt of 5/- a week outdoor <Col N="1706" /> relief, and out of this he has to pay 3/- for rent.  That leaves him 2/- to support himself, his wife and two children.  There is not another shilling going into that house.  If that mother has to go round from house to house who is to blame for it?  Who brought her to beggary?  I hold it is those who will not find employment for her husband. That is the position that we are coming to.  It is degrading to dwell on the position to which the workers are being reduced.  I know that the rest of the people could do a lot to ease the position of the unemployed.  One should not expect the Government to do everything. The farmers around the country can do a lot.  The landlords can do a lot and the employers can do a great deal.  If the farmers will only till more land, if each farmer would only employ one man extra, if those who now employ nobody would employ one man, or if those who are in a big way would take on an extra man it would do a great deal to lessen unemployment.  In addition, if the houselords would give the unemployed man time until he is in employment and not press him to pay them a rent out of the outdoor relief or the dole, things would not be quite as dark as they are for the unemployed. The question of unemployment is not a problem for the Government alone, but every man and woman in the country is in some measure responsible for easing the situation.  The country is now safe.  At least we hope so.  Under these conditions people who have money to invest should invest it in this country.  The circumstances are different from what they were a few years ago, because a man did not then know how soon the building he was erecting or the factory that he was establishing would be blown up.  In this connection I do say that we have to thank the Government who withstood that attack on the State and brought forward very drastic legislation in order to establish a state of peace in which we are in at the present moment.</P>

      <P>Peace has been established and the country is now quite safe for the investment of capital.  I feel sure that the Labour Party will <Col N="1707" /> now do everything in their power to co-operate with those engaged in building up the industries of the country.  I feel sure that no drastic step will be taken by official labour against any employer so long as he pays a fair wage and so long as working conditions are reasonable.  All the worker asks for is a fair wage to enable him to rear his children.  The investor now has nothing to fear.  The Free State has been established and so far as the laws and their administration are concerned there is fair play for all, but there is one other thing needed.  We have not real freedom. The freedom the worker expects is the freedom to earn a sufficient livelihood to maintain himself and his family.  We want more employment in the Saorstát.  A few years ago, in 1919-20 there were 850 people employed in the Woollen Mills in Athlone.  To-day there are only 340 working alternate time.  In another factory there you had 184 a few years ago, and to-day you have only 16.  In another woollen mill there you had 78 five years ago, and now you have only 30.  Every man in the town who employed two men at that time employs only one to-day, and the man who at that time employed one man now ceases to employ. As a result you have 780 people unemployed in Athlone alone.  You have 340 people unemployed in Mullingar.  In the small town of Longford you have 400 unemployed.  Those people will not benefit by the Trunk Road Scheme. Still we are told here that the Government tried to do something.  The suggestion made by Deputy Norton that £10,000,000 should be borrowed for the purpose of relieving distress is a good one.  I hold that every man who is willing and able to work should be given a chance of working.  We must not allow such people to starve.  The man who commits suicide is guilty of a crime, but if a man is allowed to die of hunger then the crime of murder has been committed by those who allowed him to die and they must be held guilty of murder.  We are asked here to-day to try and get the Government to introduce some measure that will give immediate help.  I do not want to see any measure introduced to help the people through the Labour Exchange. <Col N="1708" /> I want to see an opportunity given to all who are willing to work to earn their livelihood.  Help through the Labour Exchange is now only given to those in insurable occupations.  That help would not reach the people for whom I am speaking.  I appeal to the Government to do something to relieve unemployment.  If they would even advertise that the country is safe and that foreigners can come in and invest their money in the country&mdash;that is if they cannot raise a loan themselves&mdash; it would help to give employment.  I want the Government to realise that large numbers of the citizens are suffering to-day in a very bad way.  I do agree that every Deputy is anxious and willing to relieve the distress amongst the unemployed.  It is a problem that requires the immediate attention of the Government and of every Deputy here if we are to get away from the position of allowing our people to starve.</P>

      <P>After the apologia submitted on behalf of the Government by Deputy Sean Lyons, Ministers will probably have very little further to say on this matter.  I contend that this is a matter where the Executive Council is on its trial for violation of the Constitution.  Article 3 of the Constitution provides that all citizens shall have the same rights and privileges.  I ask any reasoning Deputy to consider the position of the unemployed and the position of other citizens of the State.  Are the large mass of people who are unemployed through no fault of their own enjoying the same privileges as are enjoyed by other citizens of the State?  Is the Government taking steps to see that they enjoy the same privileges, consistent with their position, as workers having nothing to protect but their lives, and consistent with the position that they have nothing to give to support their lives but their work?  Is the Government taking steps to see that these citizens are getting the same privileges as other citizens of the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter on which the Executive Council clearly can be indicted for violation of Article 3 of the Constitution. They are making no effort in the matter.  The paltry dribs and <Col N="1709" /> drabs that have come the way of the unemployed are in no way an attempt to meet the situation.  Probably the Government will say that they have investigated the matter, that they understand the matter and that they are meeting it just exactly as it ought to be met.  I have in mind one constituency and I ask the Government what knowledge it has of the distress in that constituency.  That constituency is not in favour with some members of the Executive Council who might say that the people are unsocial and uncivilised in parts of it.  Probably not one member of the Government Party has gone into that constituency to investigate the matter for at least two years.  Not one member of the Government Party has come in contact with the suffering people of these districts.  I come in contact with those people every day.  I want to assure the Executive Council that I am not endeavouring to make any capital against them in this matter. Distress in that constituency is of a most acute character.  There are people drawing home assistance who have not had work for 18 months.  Ministers and others say: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo; You are taking it from them in some direction or other. The rates will have to support them if you do not give them work through some scheme financed by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Government is moving very slowly in the matter of land distribution. If so much land is kept out of cultivation and production what is going to happen?  We are told that the only cure for the abnormal economic position at the moment is more production.  Why does not the Government give a lead and put more land into cultivation by distributing it? They could easily distribute land for productive purposes more quickly than they are doing.  Drainage schemes are held up, too.  I asked the Minister something over a month ago why drainage schemes submitted by county councils were not gone into.  He had no sensible or reasonable answer to give.  Such work would relieve a good deal of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lyons told us&mdash;it was a very <Col N="1710" /> pregnant phrase&mdash;that the country is quite safe for people to invest money in.  What about the people who  prepared to invest their labour in the country, who are not allowed and who are kept idle?  No work is provided for them and no extension of unemployment benefit is given them.</P>
    <P>I said here on one occasion that time always justified men who revolted because of their starving wives and children.  They will justify any abnormal action that men may take because of their starving wives and children. The situation is desperate in some parts and unless the Government take steps immediately they may find themselves faced with a situation which, in order to quell, they had to pool the resources of the nation on another occasion.  They pooled the resources of the nation once to preserve property and life.  Here we have a body of citizens whose lives are in danger and the lives of whose families are in danger, and the Government are pooling no resources to save them. They are making no effort, as was suggested, for a loan to save these people from starvation.</P>
    <P>The situation which was abnormal has become ordinary.  The condition of unemployment and starvation which was very abnormal has now become the ordinary condition.  People find themselves living such a low standard of life, a mere starvation existence, that suffering is an every-day occurrence with them.</P>
    <P>On a former occasion here there was very keen difference of opinion&mdash;very sharp difference of opinion&mdash;as to the rights of this country or the obligations of this country to pay certain moneys to another nation.  We are very anxious and willing to recognise our obligations to other countries.  We are very willing to acknowledge that we owe money to other people.  In the case of citizens of this State who for twenty or thirty years, perhaps, have given labour and who are willing to give labour to the State to-day and work the resources of the State in order to produce for the State, we are not fully acknowledging our liability.  I am prepared to say that any abnormal action, any action out of the ordinary, taken by these people to vindicate their rights to the <Col N="1711" /> privileges enjoyed by other citizens will be justified by time, will be justified because of the condition in which the unemployed and the poor find themselves.</P>

      <P>This House is likely to adjourn in a few days for a very long period and I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without joining in the appeal made by Deputy Morrissey that the Government should do something very quickly for the relief of the unemployed, especially in the city of Dublin.  I am aware that in certain parts of the city to-day there are families in abject poverty, almost on the verge of hunger.  The question of unemployment benefit is rather difficult to handle.  Men with families who are a long time out of employment cannot get unemployment benefit until such time as they have twelve stamps on their cards, which means that somebody has to give them three months' employment before they are eligible for benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey has stated that there are some 80,000 people unemployed. Half of those are not in receipt of any benefit.  At least one-third are married and have families ranging from two to six.  In Dublin such men and their families have to depend upon societies like the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Roomkeepers' Society to give them help to prevent them from having to go into the union or go hungry.  Both of these societies have very little funds at present to help deserving cases.  The Government should take immediate steps to find out the number of unemployed people who are not in receipt of benefit, and make some effort to give them relief.  I have knowledge of one case where a man has been idle for three years, notwithstanding the fact that he has made every effort to get work.  When he looked for unemployment benefit he was told he must have twelve stamps on his card before he could get any. That is not fair treatment.  It is with very much regret that we see appearing on the streets of Dublin again a number of barefooted and ragged children.  We all thanked God when barefooted children were no longer to <Col N="1712" /> be seen on our streets.  For some seven or eight years one hardly saw a barefooted youngster on the streets.  To-day, however, barefooted children are again to be seen with faces showing the pinch of hunger.  That ought to be proof to the Government of the conditions obtaining in Dublin at present.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should like to mention a complaint which was made to me only yesterday by two out-of-work tradesmen who said to me: &ldquo;Is it not very hard that we cannot get work while foreigners are being allowed to come into the country to do work which we could do?&rdquo; In Limerick, I believe, there are foreigners arriving almost every day to do work which could be done by some of our unemployed. That should not be allowed. When those large schemes were entered upon, those who were unemployed had great hope that they would get employment for a long period.  It is not fair that two tradesmen like those should be left to walk the streets of Dublin because of the ease with which foreigners can come into the country to do work which they are capable of doing.  In a small way I understand that that is also going on in connection with the beet factory in Carlow&mdash;that the list of foreign labour is growing slightly every day, instead of diminishing. I think that that ought to be stopped also.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Government should resort to borrowing in order to deal with the unemployment problem.  I agree that borrowing on a large scale is the only method of dealing with it.  It is urgent and necessary to take some extraordinary measures in order to provide for those out of employment.  I suggest that the present generation has borne much more than its share of the hardships and sacrifices that have been made within the past ten years, and I think the Government ought to make up their minds that posterity ought to pay something for the so-called freedom we have attained.  I think that borrowing is the only remedy for our present unemployment, and it will have to be on a large scale, in order that works of a reproductive character can be initiated. <Col N="1713" /> Instead of receiving unemployment benefit, I would prefer to see those who are unemployed put at some work of a reproductive kind.  I feel certain that the unemployed in Dublin would much prefer to get work than a few months' unemployment benefit, because they look upon that only as a temporary relief, hoping some day that the Government will do something to take them out of their present unfortunate predicament.  I join in that hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it will be possible to extract from Ministers on this occasion, after long waiting, some declaration of policy in regard to this most urgent and possibly the most acute question that faces the country.  I am not one to belittle the seriousness of the difficulties of the problem.  I know it is not easy to propound any single remedy that is going to be capable of application in a week or two or a month or two, but at least we ought to have from the Ministry at this time&mdash;they have had a long period of thought on the matter&mdash;some declaration of what their policy is in respect of this problem of unemployment. The figures are quite unknown of the number of unemployed men and women in the country at present.  People make estimates which may be within a reasonable amount of accuracy.  They may be eighty thousand, sixty thousand, fifty thousand; we do not know, but we know the extent of the problem is very wide indeed and is growing more and more acute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Its acuteness is felt by very many of those who feel it is an outcome of the deliberate policy on the part of the Ministry which they have not yet been willing to change.  I am speaking now quite incidentally of the policy of ensuring that preference in the matter of employment will be given to ex-soldiers of the National Army, not merely preference, but monopoly in many cases. I have contended on that score many times that if there is to be choice in respect of public employment, particularly employment of a relief kind, the men with the greatest number of dependents should have the first preference whether they served in the National Army or not.  If you come to men of equal need, whether for themselves <Col N="1714" /> or for their dependents, then I have no objection to giving preference to men who served in the National Army, and I go further and say I would give preference to those who served in the National Army where there is equal need; surely the time has come when that preference has to be put into a second place and the need of the man and his family ought to be considered as more insistent than a reward for some service rendered three years ago.  I say the Ministry has had a long time to cogitate and consider as to their policy upon this question, and one can only gather from statements made from time to time that they are living in hope that by the ordinary processes of trade revival there will be a gradual increasing absorption into employment of those at present unemployed and that by the expenditure of public moneys on public works a big break can be made into the army of men who have been so consistently unemployed for so long a time.  That is not a policy satisfactory in itself.  It is useful.  It has relieved the situation considerably, but all the time that policy has been carried out you have left behind amies of unemployed, ranging from sixty to eighty thousand people.  You are continuing the same policy.  You will contemplate leaving this army of thirty to sixty thousand people unemployed.  I say it is a refusal to recognise responsibility. Surely when we consider ourselves a community whose public activities are directed by a Government, there is just as much moral compulsion and as much responsibility upon that Government to see that this steady movement towards starvation should be arrested, and that this attack upon the lives and morale of the people should be stopped as if there were an emergency rather more sudden but not less disastrous in the shape of either invasion or internal revolt.  An internal revolt or invasion does call upon all the resources of the people to resist and meet that danger.</P>
    <P>I insist again, as I have done so often, that here you have a problem which means an attack on the very life's blood of the nation, an insidious gnawing at the vitals, more disastrous because it is so insidious.  Yet there is no <Col N="1715" /> policy of meeting it.  There is no attempt to meet it except by a little movement here or a little movement there, not one of which proposes to deal with the problem as a whole.  We speak of the problem of the country as a whole and inevitably we are bound to think of the problem as it affects all parts of the country, but I am prepared just to take the county Dublin.  There are fifteen members for the city of Dublin and I have no doubt they are all prepared to speak for their own constituency. It is not very often in this House, to my loss, perhaps, that I have put forward very special pleas for county Dublin.  I have been blamed for it naturally, and it so happens that county Dublin is represented by fairly active members in this House who have, I think, taken a national view of their responsibilities and have thought of the country and not of their own constituencies. I think that can be said of the representatives of the county Dublin, but what is the result of taking that national view?  The result is this constituency has been neglected to an extent which does not reflect credit upon the authorities responsible and possibly those Deputies for the county who have thought patriotically of the nation rather than of their own particular interests have to bear some blame for not sitting on the doorsteps of Ministers pleading and begging for benefits for their constituents.</P>
    <P>In this constituency, which is one of the largest in the country and contains a fairly considerable urban population as well as a rural population from Dunlaoghaire to Balbriggan out of town after town, village after village, you get the cry, &ldquo;Unemployment is destroying us.&rdquo;  You have in the urban districts of Rathmines and Pembroke thousands of men unemployed, exactly the same as in the city of Dublin, but in the less populous districts where people are apt to think the residents are able to live on nothing you have the same cry of unemployment and necessity for assistance.  We have, as Deputy Norton has said, this cry from the north county.  Underpressure of need it was found necessary to extend the provisions of the law relating to special relief and to extend Section 13 of the <Col N="1716" /> Poor Law Act to the Balrothery Rural District.  That was simply to allow special outdoor relief to be given to men whose wives and children were clamouring for bread in an agricultural county.  They have got it, and it is expected to be withdrawn this weekend.</P>
    <P>I propose to ask the Minister for Local Government to extend that, and perhaps he will extend it, in the hope that after two or three weeks a certain amount of work on the roads and the farms, hay-making and so on, will be obtained.  But when that has passed what have they to face?  Ministers have not dealt with this problem with the seriousness they ought to have dealt with it, and with which they have dealt with other problems.  They have not faced this problem as they faced the agrarian problem or as they faced the problem of defence.  You may spend money here and there and it will be useful and valuable and it will relieve the situation, but I want to know whether the Ministry is going to put forward to us a considered policy. They have been asked time and time again in this House what was their policy.</P>
    <P>They told us they had the Shannon scheme, a beet sugar scheme, schemes of roads and house-building, with proposals for tariffs and hesitation and doubt as to whether tariffs will be valuable or not; but with all these proposals, you have remaining this army of unemployed.  I have come to the conclusion that while this method of tinkering with the problem may have some effect, it is absolutely essential that provision should be made for those who remain.  I entirely agree with the proposition that it is infinitely better to set men to work, but if you do not set them to work then you are bound to provide them with means of maintenance and I prefer the method of the unemployment insurance scheme with such extension as may be necessary.</P>
    <P>But what has been the policy of the Ministry?  The policy of the Ministry has been to cut down the benefits available under the unemployment insurance scheme, to cut off the extensions, to limit the number of weeks that men may draw unemployment benefit and <Col N="1717" /> to leave them to the chance of the labour market which has not shown any sign of revival.  It is too late, of course, at this portion of the session to expect anything of that kind to be done.  We have asked for it on every possible occasion, but up to now it has been refused.  After the Recess we shall be into the winter.  People, somehow, are able to get through the summer season, but the winter will come and I make this urgent plea that the Government will, as the first business of the next session, bring in a scheme of unemployment insurance extension which will fit the requirements of the case for the winter.</P>
    <P>We hope that the moneys that have been voted will be spent quickly during the summer to absorb as large a number of unemployed as possible, but do not let these months pass over without recognising that the winter is coming and that these men and their families require to be fed and clothed.  I say it is an absolute necessity, to avoid risks that are facing us, that some extension of this unemployment insurance scheme should be assented to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan has said that history justified men who had revolted on behalf of their wives and children in case of hunger and of need.  Ministers have been very fortunate in their unemployed public within the last few years.  It may be not unfairly charged against some of us that we have been too quiescent, too trustful, too patient. But there are spirits in the country not quiescent, not patient, and I am not sure whether it would not be good for the country if those spirits took possession of the minds of the people.  It is not in the power or the capacity or even suited to the temperament of some of us, but unless there is evidence of real anxiety and real determination to meet this problem, I would say &ldquo;Good luck&rdquo; to the man who will fire the enthusiasm and the passion, if you like, of the unemployed men.</P>

      <P>This question is undoubtedly serious and it is increasing in seriousness as time goes on.  We have been looking forward for a long time now to a revival of industry and a general advance towards a more prosperous and a better state of affairs. <Col N="1718" /> Looking around to-day and regarding the conditions commercially, industrially and materially, one is forced to confess that the evidence of our prosperity is illusive.  We are no nearer a solution of this question than we were a considerable time ago.  I should like to be in a position to controvert the statements that came from the Labour benches, in urging the claim for proper consideration of the unemployed.  I should like to be in a position to say to our friends on the Labour benches that they have been too fond of throwing the responsibility on other shoulders, without recognising that a large amount of responsibility attaches to themselves.  To-day, I think that Labour representatives are seriously trying to shoulder as much of the responsibility as they can.  No accusation lies to-day against Labour, as may have been the case in the past, that they desire to make it more difficult to carry on.  That being so, and, recognising as I must and as everybody in this House must, that the burden of the unemployed is becoming intolerable.  I would ask the House to face the situation and see if any solution can be arrived at to ameliorate the condition of a large number of men and women who are to-day in a very hopeless state.</P>
      <P>It is undoubtedly a very difficult problem and one finds it puzzling to make suggestions as to how it should be solved.  Deputy Norton's scheme for a large loan, to be invested in housing, does not appeal to me.  His claim and the claim of some members of the Labour Party is for a policy of inflation.  A policy of inflation, while it may be temporarily good for the workers, does not solve any problem. We would have to look on this suggestion of inflation as a remedy which would have a very bad effect even  the immediate future.  Even if you got £10,000,000, you could not spend it on building.  As Deputy Good has said over and over again, skilled labour in connection with the building trade is to-day fully occupied at relatively good wages.</P>

      <P>We have been told here that the grants for the building of houses have been taken advantage of to a greater extent in the country than elsewhere.  However, as regards the country the position must be determined by the farmers.  The farmers can say whether they can employ more labour or not.  It is up to the people who are in a position to give employment to provide as much employment as they can to meet the situation.  But even that may not meet the case.  The suggestion has been put forward that the Unemployment Insurance Fund provides the best means of dealing with this question.  I am inclined to agree with that.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce holds that the Unemployment Insurance Fund must be worked on actuarial lines.  Grants out of the unemployment fund which are not represented by stamps to credit get the fund more deeply into difficulties and render it more and more insolvent. If the unemployment fund is actuarially unsound and unable to meet the needs of people who cannot get employment, I would suggest to the Government that they examine the basis of the fund, with a view to reconstructing it and allowing a margin which would be available for people out of benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the difficulty in connection with the unemployment fund in the past&mdash;here I accuse the members of the Labour Party&mdash;was largely due to the abuse of the fund, in the sense that every labourer who contributed to that fund and who had the good fortune to be employed all the time, regarded the money he paid as money which he ought to get out of the fund if he possibly could.  Instead of a man being proud of having contributed to the fund, without being a burden on it at any time, every opportunity was taken to get back the money paid.  That was <Col N="1720" /> largely though not altogether the case. It is there I think that responsibility lies in connection with the administration of the fund, in the past, at all events.  I do not say that that operates to-day.</P>
    <P>I do not see any other way out of this difficulty.  There is no use in our calling on the Government to bear the burden and do this, that and the other thing.  All sections of the House ought come together, recognising that this is a problem that must be faced.  It cannot go on as it is going, and the Government must be the instrument through which every section of the House will be enabled to contribute something towards dealing with the needs of the case as we find it to-day. We cannot face another winter in the position in which we are to-day.  There is undoubtedly an enormous abuse by men who are deliberately out of employment. There must be a considerable number of those.  There must be a considerable number of men, too, who are so long out of work that they are really unemployable at present.  But we cannot ignore the fact that we have a responsibility in the matter.  I say deliberately to every section of the House that we must do something as regards this question and do it as soon as ever we can.  I join with the Labour Party in asking the Government to explore the whole position in the hope of arriving at some policy to deal with the large number of unemployed that we have.  So long as there is unemployment in our midst to the extent that there is to-day, with no apparent hope of lessening it to any great degree, we cannot ignore our responsibilities in the matter, and a real effort should be made to absorb as many in commercial undertakings as possible.  We cannot controvert it, and I know it to my own knowledge, that men are waiting for work week after week and year after year, until they become practically unemployable. We cannot fail to recognise our responsibilities in this connection, and I ask every section of the House to face the problem and see what can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this matter at all until references were made to the farmers and to <Col N="1721" /> agriculture.  The farming community have very few suggestions to make.  An unfortunate position was created in the agricultural community a few years ago by unreasonable strikes.  Where they took place tillage was curtailed and cows sold and sent away to England. These cows are coming back and tillage is coming back.  Things are improving, but they cannot become right all of a sudden.  Cows are becoming normal in number in county Waterford, where two or three thousand left in one year. County Limerick has increased its cows by two thousand or more this year, and the numbers in Tipperary are also increasing. Tillage is also coming back, and if we can be spared&mdash;as I think we should be, in view of the lessons of the past&mdash;these unreasonable and ridiculous strikes, and if Labour could make up its mind to accept what can be got out of the industry, not what cannot be got, we would have less unemployment in agricultural districts.  I believe that there is more unemployment in county Dublin, the highest paid centre of agriculture, than anywhere else.  You can trace all this back to the demand for a wage which the land, in Dublin and everywhere else, cannot pay.  There is a good deal to be done on both sides, and if we are prepared to help we want help from Labour.  There is no use telling us that a man requires a living wage on which he can support his family in comfort.  The standard of comfort and decency ought to be the standard that the country can bear.</P>

      <P>I desire to say a few words in support of the case that has been made by members of the Labour Party and by Deputy Hewat in regard to the question of unemployment. I do not think that the word &ldquo;case&rdquo; is the proper one; I think &ldquo;demand&rdquo; would suit the attitude of these Deputies better.  The most refreshing thing about the discussion has been the fact that members of the Labour Party and Deputy Hewat, who, on other occasions, may differ, have agreed that this problem is one of the greatest urgency and that it should be dealt with at once by the Government on a broad line of policy.  That it is pressing, imminent, and of the greatest &mdash;possibly the greatest&mdash;importance of anything on the political horizon at the moment cannot be gainsaid.  I am sure that not a day passes but every Deputy is confronted with the appalling condition of affairs in regard to unemployment, both in his own constituency and elsewhere.  It is a problem which presents extreme difficulties. It is not confined to this country; it is still in existence in England. <Col N="1723" /> The conditions are somewhat different there, and I do not think that there is the same &mdash; shall I say &mdash; justification for the extent of unemployment, proportionately, in this country as there is in Great Britain.  Be that as it may, they have made provision across the water for dealing with this matter on certain lines.  Here we actually limited the amount of unemployment benefit by depriving those who, at one time, were entitled to what was known as uncovenanted benefit, of that sort of relief, whereas in England they have actually extended that.  I am strongly in favour of all kinds of relief works, works of the nature of road-making, and indeed of large projects such as the Shannon scheme and the proposed beet industry, both of which I was in favour of&mdash;though I was not in favour of the methods employed in either&mdash;particularly on account of the employment that they would give.  While I agree that the Government has done much in that direction and that the works of public utility which have been embarked upon will undoubtedly for the moment relieve a certain amount of unemployment, still they will not actually do anything eventually to do away with the problem that now confronts us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Minister has now an opportunity, in answer to the demands put forward conjointly by Deputy Johnson and Deputy Hewat, of announcing, if he is in a position to do so, what the Government policy is in regard to the question of unemployment. It may be asking too much; I know that it is not an easy matter for any Government, but I would like to impress upon the Government the extreme urgency of the matter and the necessity for being prepared to come here in the autumn with some plan for dealing with this problem, a problem which will necessarily become more acute as the winter approaches and goes on. Unemployment is by no means confined to the City of Dublin.  Possibly, in proportion to its population, the City of Dublin is better off than many provincial towns, because within the last few years industries have grown up in <Col N="1724" /> Dublin.  Tobacco factories have been started and other institutions have come into being.  But take the ordinary provincial town, take the scattered villages throughout the country&mdash;I am not now referring to the rural areas but am confining myself to the towns and villages&mdash;I say that the state of unemployment in them is probably worse than it has ever been, and the state of trade in any of these centres, as Deputy Hewat has said, is certainly nothing to boast of.  That being so, we are confronted now, and we shall be confronted more so when we resume our sittings in the autumn, with a problem which is of the utmost urgency and imminence and which I trust the Minister will be able to say to-day that he and the Government intend to deal with, not altogether by way of temporary assistance or relief, but more by way of a permanent policy whereby he hopes to alleviate and, if possible, do away with the greater part, if not all, of this unemployment.  As I said before, it is not a child's task, but the Government are there, and while they are there they are responsible for providing for unemployment, just as much as they are responsible for the general conduct of any other affair in the State. Unemployment is certainly one of the problems which they cannot and must not overlook.  It is knocking at the door.  It is there night and morning. Some of the people who are out of employment are in a pitiable condition, so that it is the solemn and immediate duty of the Government, at the earliest possible date, to propose some measure, not of temporary but of permanent alleviation.  I hope that the Minister will be able to give us that assurance and I anxiously await what he has to say on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the statistics which can be produced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce regarding unemployment are no indication at all of the amount of unemployment there is throughout the country. A great many people who were employed did not come within the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Act. I come from a district that has been very much affected by unemployment. <Col N="1725" /> Deputies are aware that Fermoy, Queenstown, Buttevant, and a few other districts were very hard hit by the departure of the British troops and the unemployment that ensued.  Some of those who were employed were young men, others were old men, and there were some women, none of whom was registered under the Unemployment Insurance Act.  In Queenstown there are 500 or 600 men unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>Call it what you like. These men are unemployed and they do not care what the town is called if they can get something to eat.  A great many of them who are hungry are sorry it is called Cobh.  At any rate there are five or six hundred men walking the streets because there is no work to be done in Haulbowline.  A similar state of affairs exists in Buttevant.  A large number of men are idle there, and no provision has been made for their employment.  It was hoped to get a beet factory there, but that hope failed. It was then hoped to get the Aubeag drainage carried out, but that is postponed. There is now one hope on the part of the unemployed in that district, and that is to get a share of the £2,000,000 grant that has been promised. If we are to get this grant, for whatever work it is to be utilised on, let it be given immediately.  Men whose wives and children are hungry cannot afford to wait.  The Government should expedite the giving of this grant in order that the children can be fed and attend school.  At present some children cannot go to school, as there is no use in trying to teach them while they are hungry.  We have five flour mills in the district running less than half time.  In previous years they gave a good deal of employment.  We also have two woollen mills, one of which is shut down.  The other, I might say, is crawling along, keeping the rust off the wheels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what I have said, Deputies will understand the amount of distress that prevails in that district.  I urge the Government to immediately issue the £2,000,000 that they promised and allow some of it to be utilised in removing dangerous corners on the roads.  The money need not be all spent in metalling <Col N="1726" /> the roads.  Some of it could be spent in removing dangerous corners, which are a menace to present-day traffic, and which have been responsible for the death of a great many people. I earnestly appeal to the Government on behalf of the people that I know are hungry, because they cannot find employment, to issue this grant immediately and give each county its proper quota.  Cork, being the largest county, is entitled to the largest amount and it also contains the best people.</P>

      <P>I think the practical suggestion put forward has been the suggestion of Deputy Johnson that during the Recess the Executive Council should consider whether the policy in regard to unemployment benefit should not be reconsidered, and that it should, in fact, prepare to put legislation before the Dáil when it re-assembles giving extended benefits.  It is very easy to talk about dealing with the problem of unemployment in the way some Deputies talk, but it is a different thing to solve the problem.  This Government cannot be expected to do what other governments have been unable to do.  I do not know that mobilising the resources of the State in the way we would mobilise them to meet an invasion would suffice.  It is much easier to mobilise the resources of the State to deal with a military emergency than to mobilise them for industrial action.  In the one country where a great experiment is being carried out of mobilising the resources of the State for industrial action I do not know that the evils are completely got rid of.  It is very difficult, of course, to get authentic information, but I understand that the difficulties of mobilising the whole resources of the people can be understood from the devices and measures that have to be resorted to in that country.</P>

      <P>I am not very much influenced by the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; or by the people who talk in a scoffing way about what is a stupendous experiment, but I am pointing out that when we are asked here to provide a remedy for unemployment we are being asked to do what is not, I think, possible for us to do.  The best we can do is to alleviate it.  There can be alleviation by way of relief and by way of extended unemployment benefit, as Deputy Johnson has suggested.  We had some hesitation in arriving at the decision not to pay uncovenanted benefit any longer.  We had the position under review at various times since then, and we are not tied in the matter. If on further consideration of the situation, and if other measures do not sufficiently lessen the unemployment problem, we would be prepared to restore uncovenanted benefit.  We do not want to do that, because we believe that the payment of uncovenanted benefit gives rise to abuses and has its own economic disadvantages; that it is not as good as a scheme of works which, perhaps, might not cover as many people, but if we could meet an appreciable number of individual cases by works it would be better than meeting the larger number of cases by unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have done a good deal towards providing work.  What we are doing is not to be measured by the size of the Vote for the relief schemes this year. It is true that the Vote this year is only £50,000, but there are other funds provided which will give employment. There is not £250,000 but £500,000 in the Local Loans Vote, and employment will be given by the expenditure of that money.  £250,000 of it is available for loans to local authorities for certain classes of public works.  That will give a substantial amount of employment. Other parts of it are for loans to improve lands and for the erection of farm buildings.  Another part of it will be spent on drainage works under the Drainage Maintenance Act.  I might say that although nothing will be done under the Arterial Drainage Act, that a <Col N="1728" /> very considerable amount of work will be done during the summer under the Drainage Maintenance Act and will give employment to, I suppose, about 3,000 men.  Then we have provision in the Votes for a sum of £348,000 for housing grants.  That again will give a good deal of employment.  In the Land Commission Vote there is provision for a sum of £300,000 for the improvement of estates, and that also will provide a good deal of employment.  For the erection of new works and for certain drainage works, there is a provision in the Board of Works Vote for a sum amounting to £766,000.  Some of that will go in material, but a great portion of it will go in giving employment.  We are taking steps to supplement the Road Fund so that a very substantial amount of abnormal employment, or, shall I say, employment out of the ordinary, will be given on roads.</P>
    <P>The amount that we are spending on the sugar beet subsidy will result in a good deal of employment being given in the erection of the factory, the making of sidings and all that, while a substantial amount of employment will also be given in the factory itself. I do not know at the moment&mdash;I have not the figures to hand what will be spent on the Shannon scheme during the year, but I think I am safe in saying that three-quarters of a million pounds or more may be spent.  We are doing these things, and while we probably would have done a great number of them even if uncovenanted benefit was still being paid, there is no doubt but that in considering schemes we were influenced by the fact that uncovenanted benefit was not being paid, and we were anxious to extend and hurry on and give employment so far as we could.  If we could open out in other directions and spend money usefully on capital works, we would be very anxious to do it and meet the situation that way rather than resort to uncovenanted benefit which has certain objections relating to the morale of the workers, objections not as bad, of course, as leaving the workers without anything.  There is no use talking about big loans.  That is beginning at the wrong end of the stick.</P>

      <P>We are dealing very substantially with housing at the moment, and if we were advancing money out of local loans we would have to consider whether we would not have to modify the present grants.  In any case, that is not one of the types of industry where employment is worst. Our policy to meet it has been to get schemes as quickly as we can that are sound schemes and to carry them on. In addition we have had the tariff policy which has had some little effect, and which will have more effect, but which cannot be expected to give great results speedily.  New legislation such as that which the Minister for Agriculture has introduced has also, by whatever benefits it has already conferred on agriculture, tended to give employment. But there is no royal way of meeting the problem of unemployment. All countries practically, certainly most countries, at present are troubled by it. I doubt that the heroic measures of mobilising the whole resources and forces of the people are practicable. If they were practicable they could only be carried out after making great sacrifices.  They might leave us no better, and might even leave us in a worse position than at present.  But if <Col N="1730" /> people think that by next October or November, or later, this or any other government is going to come in with a plan to deal with the unemployment problem they are expecting too much. The most we can do is to hope that the measures we can take will substantially alleviate it, and that the co-operation of all interests will still further alleviate it, and bring it at any rate to bearable proportions.  It is perhaps worth while reiterating that it is not a matter for the Government.  All sorts of people, if they feel that it is a serious problem, must in their own business think of how help can best be given towards dealing with it.  I have many times talked about people who have control of business, industry, and capital, and who are not too prompt to do anything in this country, and there are also even cases&mdash;it is not necessary to go into them&mdash;where the labour interests have not been as accommodating as would be wise.  I do not want to raise a debate on that, but it is nonsense for anybody to say that it is labour, trade unions, strikes, and that sort of thing that are responsible for the trouble.  There is no one section or interest who can throw all the blame on others.  I do not say the Government has done everything it might have done, but at least it has done something, and if it is called upon to do more, other interests involved might also be called upon to do more.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  Perhaps the shortest way of dealing with this matter would be to take the Deputies through the sections of the Bill in which the main principles of the Bill are raised.  Section 2 deals with compounded arrears of rent, and though the section is long the proposal is quite simple.  Deputies will remember that the provisions of the Land Act, 1923, in cases where three years' arrears, were due were to add a half-year <Col N="1731" /> to the purchase money and to collect the remaining two and a-half years.  Practically one year has been collected, but there is some of the first year still outstanding. That leaves one and a half years fully due, and the proposal here is to add all the arrears, the one and a half years, and what is due to the purchase money.  I need not go into Section 3, as it speaks for itself.  Section 4 deals with building ground.  The operations of the Land Act, 1923, revealed that there were certain directions in this regard in which the Act could be usefully amended.  It was found that there were a number of farms, for instance, near Dublin, Cork, and other cities and towns, where there was a certain frontage, on the road, perhaps a small frontage, of 5 acres, extending a hundred yards along the road, suitable for building.  For that reason the whole farm of 100 acres, or perhaps 200 acres, was excluded from the benefit of the Land Act.  That undoubtedly was a grievance.  The proposal now is to sub-divide the holding into two portions, one portion suitable for building ground, and then you are left with the rest of the farm.  This section provides that the rest of the farm shall be purchased as a separate holding, and that the tenant shall continue as the tenant of the building ground with exactly the same tenure as he had previous to the Act.  We could not meet the case in any other way.  I am not prepared to ask the Dáil to say that building ground, as such, should be purchased.  I think it would be a retrograde step.  Every country in the world is making provision empowering municipalities and such like to acquire land for building purposes at something which is not its market value.  I am not going to prejudice that case.  My position is that I am leaving the building ground exactly as I found it.  I think it would be unfair to hand over the tenant's interest to the landlord, or the landlord's interest in the building ground to the tenant, and consequently to concentrate all the effects of whatever legislation may in the future be put into operation as against one particular party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only prophesying. It would not affect the local authority even if afterwards legislation would be introduced to acquire building ground at some price which was less, or more, if you like, but which was different from the market value. The fact that the entire interest in the building ground had been transferred to a single individual under this Act would not, of course, affect the right of the local authorities, which they had obtained presumably by an Act of Parliament, to acquire these rights from that person, but I do not think we should in any way interfere with the building ground.  I do not think that we should interfere with the tenures. I do not think, at this stage, we should transfer ownership from one person to another, and thereby concentrate all the profits, or all the losses, in one person.  I suggest that the position, so far as building ground proper is concerned, should be left as it is, but, so far as the rest of the holding is concerned, it should get the benefits of the Land Act.  The section provides that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 is an important and rather unusual section.  It provides that the compulsory powers given to the Land Commission under the Act of 1923 for the acquisition of land for, say, congestion or other purposes, shall be limited to this extent: that where, in the opinion of the Department of Agriculture the land is being used for the raising of high-class breeding-stock, the compulsory powers of the Land Commission shall not operate.  It would take a long time to go into the merits of that section, and I really went into them during the debate on the estimates for the Department of Agriculture.  I think that possibly that may result in a very big increase in the production of high-class stock animals, and, if it does, it will confer great benefit on the country.  It would be difficult to measure exactly how much it would run into, but it would be a great many millions.  I believe, further, that this will not interfere, to any appreciable extent, with the powers of the Land Commission, and that the real effect will be that people, in order <Col N="1733" /> to insure themselves, will begin to breed high-class stock animals on their home farms.  Section 6 gives the right to subtenants on purchased holdings to purchase. That is all that is to be said about that.  Section 7 deals with drainage, and provides that out of the purchase money a capital sum may be set aside for the reconstruction of, say, an embankment or any other drainage work. Reading this section with the sections in the previous Acts, it will mean that the Land Commission will have power to set aside, out of the purchase money, a capital sum, or, rather, land bonds, which will yield interest, and which may be liquidated, for the reconstruction of existing embankments, which were neglected or were in disrepair. Also there is power already to set aside a sum, the interest of which will accrue for the maintenance of embankments. The position will be that the Land Commission may require the county council to take over the maintenance of drainage works, and the county council can recoup itself.  The drainage will be paid for out of the rates struck on the lands to be benefited, and the rates will be recouped from this fund.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is purely technical, and so is Section 9.  Section 10 is rather important.  It was found, for instance, under the Land Act of 1923, that it was difficult to acquire land on which a number of years' arrears of rates had been due.  The lands were vested in the Land Commission, and perhaps there was a couple of thousand pounds' rates due.  They were let in for the purchase money, and also for the arrears of rates, amounting, perhaps, to one-quarter of the value of the land. The Land Commission found that they could not take over possession.  There are cases of that kind at present.  Even if they did acquire the land, and paid the purchase money, which would cover not only the cost of the land but the arrears of rates, and if they had to sell again, the tenants' annuity would be far too high.  This section makes the Land Commission liable for the rates from the date on which the lands become vested, and the owner shall be liable for the rates up to that date. There is also provision that arrears of rates of that sort, in the last resort, may be paid out of the purchase money. <Col N="1734" /> Section 11 is somewhat similar in principle. It enables the Judicial Commissioner to make an order vesting the lands in the Land Commission on the appointed day in cases where the owner refuses to give up possession.  I think a case of that sort was debated in the Dáil.  The appointed day is named, the objections have been dealt with, and legally the land is vested on the appointed day.  The owner refuses to give up possession.  The Land Commission at present is under the necessity of going to law with the owner before taking over the land.  That delays the purchase operation.  In this we give power to the Judicial Commissioner to issue an order on the Sheriff to place the Land Commission in possession of the lands.  That is, to some extent, in the interests of owners, as they have been squatters on the land, and have difficulty of getting rid of them.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with the point I have covered regarding the transfer in connection with embankments to the county council.  Section 14 is of little importance.  It is really technical. Section 15 empowers the Land Commission to discontinue proceedings where they have come to the conclusion that the price, as finally fixed by the Judicial Commissioner, is too high for the purpose of re-sale to the tenants. Section 16 allows the Land Commission to aggregate three or four estates, and thus make up the losses in one case by the gains in another.  They may, for the purposes of exchange, buy very cheap land, and have to buy another farm, subject to the land purchase annuity. That farm will be expensive, as the annuity has to be redeemed out of the purchase money, and it is necessary, in the interests of common fair play, to give the owner a fairly good price, because otherwise nothing would be left after the redemption of the annuity. This enables estates to be aggregated to make up the losses on dear land by the gains on cheap land. Section 17 deals with the question of the collection of arrears of land purchase annuities, and gives the Land Commission all powers in connection with arrears which the county council has for the collection of rates.  I think it is a necessary section, and, if this <Col N="1735" /> Bill passes and becomes an Act, we propose to ask the Land Commission to take advantage of it immediately.  I think it will have a big effect.  The tenant purchaser is sued now for arrears, and a decree is given with costs, to which some people object.  The sheriff goes out and gets a return of no goods.  Somebody else is grazing the land.  That is quite common, and is happening all over the country.  It has defeated the Land Commission in its work of collecting arrears.  Under this section the Land Commission may seize any goods on the land, no matter to whom they belong.  It is provided also that the remedies given by this section to the Land Commission shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, any other remedy that they already have for the recovery of any such arrears. It is also provided that a certificate, purporting to be under the common seal of the Land Commission, shall be evidence in a court of law as to any sum due, and that such sum is payable to the Land Commission by the person named in the certificate.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is of very little importance. As a rule a decree has to be renewed every year.  This section alters that.  A decree obtained by the Land Commission against a defaulter need not be renewed more than once within a period of six years.  Section 19 gives the sheriff the same power in the execution of a decree as he has already for rates.  Sub-section (3) of the section is somewhat similar to the provisions already in the Enforcement of Law Act.  Sections 20, 21 and 22 deal with cases where holdings are put up for sale on foot of a decree for arrears of annuities.  Of course everyone knows what happens in such cases.  No one will bid for the land.  Even the mortgagees will not bid.  Suppose there is a holding subject to a land purchase annuity and somebody has a mortgage on it.  The Land Commission gets a decree against the owner for arrears of annuity; the sheriff finds no goods or chattels on the land.  The Land Commission is then under the necessity of putting the holding up for sale and it is advertised.  In a great many cases there are no bidders, not even the <Col N="1736" /> mortgagee, not even people who have claims on the land.  They all feel so absolutely certain that no one will bid that they just leave it so.</P>
    <P>There is no sale and no collection. They all go along to the county councils and abuse the Land Commission for not collecting the arrears.  They point out that there are great losses to the rates owing to the arrears, and the particular representative from the locality is generally able to make a very convincing case against the Land Commission and in favour of the poor unfortunate ratepayers of the district who are mulcted to pay the arrears, but not a single one of them will bid for the land.  We propose to alter that; we propose to vest the land in the Land Commission first of all, subject to no charges except Board of Works charges and the annuity.  The Land Commission may put the holding up for sale.  The mortgagee may buy it.  If he does not his mortgage lapses. He has an opportunity of buying in the land, but if he does not his mortgage lapses.  I see no way out of that.  The Land Commission has clear and full possession and is entitled to divide the land.  These are very drastic steps, but I see no way out of the difficulty we are faced with but by taking these steps and I have no sympathy with the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Remember that as a rule people like to get cheap land in this country and that they are not deterred by most considerations from buying cheap land if it is on offer.  Remember, on the other hand, that in these cases the ratepayers have to pay the arrears of the Land Commission annuities, due very often to the default of the owner&mdash; there are, of course, some cases of hardship &mdash; due to the fact that he had not been working very hard and had been taking advantage of the immunity which he had enjoyed for some time. Remember also that the mortgagee, who as a rule, if it were a shopkeeper sold out the land would come in immediately with a claim, will not bid for the land.  If the ratepayers themselves will not help themselves and will not do what they ought logically to do in all the circumstances, the Land Commission must protect the credit of the <Col N="1737" /> State.  We are taking powers here to take over that land, to acquire it and vest it in the Land Commission, subject to no other charges except public charges, that is to say, the Board of Works charges and the charge for the land purchase annuity.  We may not divide the land perhaps.  We may not be able to divide the land, but we will hold the land and we will put the owner out of possession.  If the Dáil agree to these propositions, we propose to put these measures into operation stringently.</P>
    <P>We also propose, in Section 22, to transfer the land to the county council where the county council so desires That, perhaps, may look a little naïve to some people, but there are cases already where a county council took over such land and was surcharged.  It was decided afterwards that they had no right to pay money for it.  I believe if they took over the land and paid the annuities they did the right thing. In the case of a holding where no annuities were paid, they took it over for the purpose of recovering the annuities.  We propose to give every county council power to do that, and if we give them the power, and they exercise it, there will be very little unavoidable arrears.  The county council, in the case I have mentioned, I am glad to say, was the Donegal county council.</P>

      <P>They will.  Sections 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27 deal with the cases popularly known as the committee cases and Land Bank cases.  I will deal first with the committee cases. Land was purchased in 1920, say, when land was very dear, at something like what would now be regarded as three or four times its actual value, purchased at anything from £30 to £80 per acre by committees with a view to dividing it amongst themselves, or purchased by a committee on behalf of others in the district with money that was borrowed from the local bank at a rate of interest of 6 per cent.  Prices fell in 1921 and to-day the land bought at £50 an acre in 1920 is not worth half the money.  In addition, in view of the times, in view of the fact that <Col N="1738" /> usually there were no farm buildings on these farms, and that a farm of two or three hundred acres could not be suitably farmed by a group of farmers, they had no alternative except to put stock on them.  It was possibly a long way from their houses.  They could not adopt the same methods as they would have adopted in connection with their own holdings.  The farm was too far away to cart manure to it, and they could not till it.  They simply grazed it, and then they met with all the loss of stock perhaps in 1921.  Possibly they did not buy their stock to the best advantage, and possibly they now find the original sum with big arrears of interest facing them.  That is an impossible position.</P>
      <P>It is somewhat the same with the Land Bank cases.  The Land Bank advanced the purchase money to the purchaser, who had to deposit with them one-fourth of the purchase money.  They very often had to borrow that deposit from the local bank, and pay a high interest on it.  In addition, they had to pay the interest on the full purchase money to the Land Bank.  Everything that happened in the case of the committees happened in the case of purchases by the Land Bank.  They now find themselves faced with the capital unpaid either to the Land Bank or to the local bank, and there are big arrears of interest.  There is complete confusion in the sense that some have got grazing rights and others have not. The lands are not being farmed properly. Nobody is taking an interest in them.  They are all hoping that something will happen to relieve them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal here is fairly drastic, but it is the only proposal that will meet the case.  We have to recognise this is a legacy from the past and the situation must be cleaned up.  The Land Commission under this section may buy the land at the full price; they may resell at whatever price they think the land is worth and the Minister for Finance finds the difference.  In each case, of course, the Land Commission will be the judge of what the land is worth.  It is provided here that the Minister for Finance should be consulted in regard to these cases in the course of the operation of the Act.  In <Col N="1739" /> the main, subject to certain details that are set out in the schedules, those are the provisions of Sections 24 to 28, inclusive.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, deals with compounded arrears of rent, the right of a tenant on a purchased holding to purchase his holding, provision for embankments and drainage works, and the giving of additional powers to the Land Commission to collect land purchase annuities and to deal with difficulties arising out of the fact that rates on land to be acquired by the Land Commission are in arrears.  It exempts from the compulsory sections of the Land Act, 1923, farms that are used for the breeding of high-class stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill inasmuch as it goes portion of the way to meet the necessities of the case.  The Minister proposes to amend some of the defects of the 1923 Act.  He did not amend them when he had the opportunity of doing so, but I suppose there is no use in trotting out the phrase: &ldquo;We told you so and you had a right to do it then.&rdquo;  We welcome the Bill because it goes a further step in the right direction.  I will ask the Minister to go still further in the same direction.  The principal sections of this Bill are in response to the appeal introduced in the Seanad, and some of the suggestions made by ex-Senator Butler are embodied in it.  A few sections that we consider very important are omitted.  The Minister has carried <Col N="1740" /> out his promise to us, and he has done so very fairly.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to be more explicit&mdash;I hope he will be in Committee; I think that is the proper place &mdash;in regard to Section 3, especially sub-section (3) of Section 3, which deals with cutting down and uprooting. The section is very bald, very definite and very drastic.  Section 4 deals with potential building ground, and that matter is very important. The Minister said the Act of 1923 was not fair; he found it applying unfairly in the neighbourhood of Cork and Dublin. I want to remind the Minister that it applies still more unfairly in the neighbourhood of provincial towns where the same meaning was given to the section and where there was no chance in our time of having it operative. Decisions were given around provincial towns under this section that could not be justified.  Whatever can be said of the conditions around Cork and Dublin, nothing at all can be said for enforcing these conditions around provincial towns.</P>
      <P>We welcome the proposal omitting portion of the holding; we would much further welcome it if the section were omitted altogether, but as we have it we would ask the Minister to put some sort of a time limit on the operation of this section with regard to potential building ground.  It may be in ten years' time.  If so, it is a reasonable proposition.  It may be in fifteen years' time, and even still we would not call it an unreasonable proposition; but if it is away in the dim future, 50 or 100 years hence, we say it is not a reasonable proposition. There should be a limit, and this proposal is not reasonable inasmuch as there is no definiteness with regard to the period over which the provision should operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 deals with drainage and maintenance.  This is a provision that we insisted on being contained in the 1923 Act; it was contained in it and it dealt with particular sales under that Act.  I do not know if the Minister has taken power in this Act to deal with the sales previous to the 1923 Act. Perhaps the time is ripe when provision should be made to deal with these particular <Col N="1741" /> cases.  In all the previous Acts no provision was made with regard to drainage and maintenance.  Estates needing drainage, and that were drained at one time, were handed over to bodies of tenants without any provision with regard to the maintenance of waterways or the condition of the drains.  The result was that the responsibility was placed on the individual tenant.  It should have been on the body of tenants and provisions should be made compelling them to maintain the drainage system.</P>
    <P>The result of that neglect is that at present you are faced with the necessity of, practically speaking, a national drainage scheme.  That was not the case at the time of purchase.  More attention was paid to drainage inasmuch as the landlord carried out supervision of the work done by the tenants. Once the change came about every tenant became a force unto himself. One knows the differences amongst a body of tenants; one could not agree with the other, and the present state of affairs came to pass.  I have no hesitation in inviting the Minister to step in on any estate and see that land is not deteriorated.  Land, in fact, should be brought back to the state in which it was handed over to purchasing tenants 15 and 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>Section 8 also deals with the problem to be found in the country where the tenants purchased under the previous Act and sub-let.  The sub-let portion is held since he bought it, and now the sub-tenant is not in a position to be able to buy.  This section proposes to remedy that, and we will welcome it. Section 12 deals with this question of the repairs of embankments, and that, we think, is a wise and a necessary provision.  Section 13 deals with the maintenance of those embankments and makes provision for handing them over to the county council.  That, too, is a necessary and wise provision.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other sections, I have very little comment to make, and any comments I have to make will find expression in Committee.  So far that is dealing with what the Bill contains. I would now like to talk about what the Bill does not contain.  One class of <Col N="1742" /> tenancy from our point of view should have got equal consideration under this and the previous Bills.  They should have got the same consideration as the other class of tenancies.  That is the tenancy with the title of fee farm grant, long leases or leases renewable for ever, that from the nature of the letting had no right whatever to be designated by either one or other of these terms.  I refer to cases where we find fee-farm grants carrying a rental of £2 an acre, 50/- an acre, and in one particular case&mdash;and I find other Deputies have the same experience&mdash;£3 an acre. Those tenancies on the face of it are not fee farm grants, long leases or leases renewable for ever.  They are not in the same category at all.  We have on the one side a picture of a real genuine case, bearing and deserving this title. The lands bear a rental of 1/-, 2/6, 5/-, 7/6, and 10/- an acre.  These on the face of them are what they purport to be.  It will be also found that the time at which the lease commenced will give some real justification, some real claim to come in under those particular heads.  These lettings will be arrived at through family considerations, marriage settlements, moneys advanced or lent on the lands, and one or other of the technical matters that would find expression in that sort of a letting.  But where we have tenancies of a very recent creation we will also find in the cases I have referred to&mdash;family settlements, moneys advanced and so on&mdash;that they all date back previous to 1880.  They all date back and have some histories and associations attaching to them. But if you go into the newer creations, the ones bearing the rentals I have referred to, they are all of recent creation and the term was put into the letting in order to evade any land legislation that might be enacted.  I can speak with authority on this question. I have before my mind and in my attache case a letting to my predecessor and to myself where one of the provisions in the letting was that this holding was not to be subject to the operations of any Land Act.  The legal adviser in this case and the lessor thought they were amply provided against any future Acts.  They find now that they were not.  They did not select the proper term.  They had not <Col N="1743" /> the best advice.  But the lawyer who was able to give advice said:&mdash;&ldquo;Put fee farm grant at the head of the agreement, or a lease renewable for ever or a lease renewable for life, or a long-term lease, and that is the only safe ground you have got.  In that way you will evade the Act and the intentions of the Legislatures in Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;  Up to now they have done it.  And according to the Minister's new Bill they are to be allowed to do it. Now we ask the Minister to get at the back of these smart people, these rogues, and not allow them to get away with it.  The intention was obvious. With regard to what I should call the genuine cases, the cases deserving of this term, the rental and the term hung together.  One was explanatory of the other.  A small nominal rental and the title were understandable to anybody. Both explained each other.  The rental explained the term and the term explained the rental.  In all these cases it was a nominal charge.  Now the use of these terms in the other class of letting that I have described is not a use but an abuse of the term.  They have no claim whatsoever to the term. All the essentials of the letting, that is the prices charged for, have no claim whatsoever to the term.  The term has no application whatsoever to the nature of the letting.  The term has no application to the price.  When we hear of a fee farm grant at £2 or £3 an acre then we know that is a contradiction in terms and it has no application in fact.  I repeat that people who have recently been trying to make lettings have, with their lawyers, been casting all round them for a term of evasion, for a term whereby they could evade any Land Act that might be passed, for a term that would not bring them in under the Act.  Some of them have been lucky in the selection of a particular term, lucky in the provision of a particular section.  These are the people whose lawyer suggested to them the term fee farm grant or lease renewable for ever.  All the rest have gone by the roadside.</P>
    <P>Lettings of any description, no matter what the title was, had the same meaning fifty years ago; indeed, they had the same meaning forty-five years <Col N="1744" /> ago.  The particular description might have mattered a little to the landlord but it mattered nothing at all to the tenant, for whatever document was set before him he paid the fine going in, and put up with it.  He agreed to a rental, and whatever the document put before him was he signed it and did not know what was in it.  They were all the same that time&mdash;all lettings were the same. There was no land court then.  To the tenant they all meant the same thing. I do not see why the particular lessor that was lucky enough to select a fortunate term should be put in a better position than any of the others who were less fortunate in selecting a term. He is protected by a term in a title that he has no right to.  He is simply hiding behind a legal phrase, and he has no more right to protection from that legal term than a robber would have to seek immunity from robbery if he hid himself in a law court&mdash;the robbery would be no less robbery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he will.  It is even possible that the Minister may see what is right.  A tenancy that carries a rental up to and above the full agricultural value&mdash;a hundred per cent. higher than the value that was fixed by Land Courts in the last thirty years&mdash; cannot be called a fee farm grant in essentials.  As a matter of fact, these particular tenancies were the highest rented tenancies of any that were in existence thirty years ago.  These people have no claim whatsoever in equity to shelter behind that term. Probably the Minister will meet me with the argument that this class of tenancy&mdash;fee farm grant tenancies and all the rest&mdash;can be redeemed by making application to the Land Commission. <Col N="1745" /> That is true &mdash; we do not deny that &mdash; but that is not sufficient.  All the benefits that tenant purchasers had under previous Acts are denied to such a tenant.  He has never had those benefits and he will be subject to the redemption of the fee-farm grant, according to whatever value the Judicial Commissioner may put on the land. We know the price that a Judicial Commissioner would fix on land three years ago would be in excess of what he would fix to-day; and we know that what he would fix to-day will be vastly in excess of what should be fixed a few years hence, and vastly in excess of what would be fixed in 1914, when conditions were normal.  They are below normal to-day, but the minds of men are not normal&mdash;even judges' minds are not normal in this connection.  They are basing their judgments on the fictitious price paid to-day for agricultural land which, as a commercial proposition, is not worth anything like the price paid for it.  We do not think that a value put upon land in present conditions would be a just agricultural value, regardless of the fact that the seven shillings in the pound and the allowance for arrears have been availed of by other tenants that come under previous Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not ask to have these terms&mdash; fee-farm grant and lease for ever&mdash; ignored, where they are in fact in conformity with each other.  Nor do I want the matter to be decided by the Dáil.  I want the matter to be decided by a court.  I want it to be left to the Judicial Commissioner or some similar judicial person to decide what is and what is not a fee-farm grant.  I do not want the Dáil to make a hard and fast rule.  I want it to be left at the discretion of a judge, taking into account the nature of the letting, the time at which it was entered into, and the charge per acre that was put on the land, in comparison with other genuine fee-farm charges and also in comparison with the rental fixed by Land Commissioners on agricultural land of a similar kind in the particular district.  I do not think that is unreasonable; I do not think that is confiscation, and I do not think that is riding over or interfering with the <Col N="1746" /> just rights of those who hold land, as the Minister states, under old and ancient titles.  I do not want these people interfered with.  I want to have the shelter torn from over the head of the fly boy, the slippery fellow who is sheltering behind this term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>What sanctity does the Deputy mean is in such a contract? The only sanctity there is&mdash;if it can be called a sanctity&mdash;is that such a man selected a lucky term and put it into his title and got the tenant to sign it. What sanctity is there in any other title that came under the previous Land Purchase Acts?  They are all in the same boat.  It is only a question of a word; they all carry the same meaning. I do not want the Dáil to decide this question, but I do want the Judicial Commissioner, or some person of that description, to say who is or who is not entitled to the protection afforded by these titles.  Surely we are not going to be told by the Minister that these lucky, clever fellows have hoodwinked the legislature and that the Minister is going to allow them to get away with it.  I am sure the Dáil can find a method of doing justice in this matter.  If it is not done in the way I suggest, or in some similar way, this Bill will not be doing justice.  Two or three pounds per acre is being paid for land which, if it were not for the protection afforded by this particular term, would have had a rent fixed for it in the Land Courts of from 15s. to 22s. 6d. per acre.  Indeed the rents I mention would be more like a first than a third term rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In illustration of this, I should like to mention the case of the Woodsgift property in County Kilkenny.  This was a property in the possession of a gentleman named Hughes, who got into monetary difficulties and sold it. I am not sure whether it was his first mortgagee in Dublin who came into possession.  I do not know whether he bought it directly from Mr. Hughes or got it through debt.  Anyhow when he came into possession he redeemed the Land Commission annuity.  He <Col N="1747" /> came in when things were very low in 1919 or 1920, bought stock and tendered it to the Government of the day. They had to accept it and he got off lightly.  The land became his own absolutely.  What did he do then?  He proceeded to break the farm up into small farms of fifteen or twenty acres. He charged a fine to every tenant going into his land.  The fines amounted to more than the redemption value and the debt or the price he paid to the previous occupier.  In addition, he charged them from 30s. to £2 or £2 10s. an acre, annual rent, and at the head of the agreement he put in the term &ldquo;fee farm grant.&rdquo;  Is it people of that description, this man, the Dobbinses and the Lloyds, that the Minister proposes to protect?  There are several others I could name.  This is a case of recent date, and I think it is enough to prove my contention that these people have been masters of evasion, have studied all the recent Land Acts and their operations, have scored over their fellows and have selected more evasive and better terms. In their case it is the last term that has been reached.  All the other terms and leases have been thrown to the wind and disregarded, but this particular term has been retained.  I hope the Minister is not going to protect the land jobbers of Dublin and elsewhere even though they belong to the legal profession.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  I can find it out, but there is no personal reflection on either Deputy Redmond or the Minister.  There was also the question of residential holdings not contained in the Act, and I think this also is rather a term that has been taken undue advantage of.  This will be, perhaps, a more acute question about the city of Dublin than anywhere else, at least to the extent that there will be very many more cases on the question. My own personal opinion is, where there was an obvious intention on the part of people making lettings that it <Col N="1748" /> was a residential holding and that they hoped at some time to resume possession for themselves and their families, that that should be respected.  But in other cases there was no such intention and advantage was taken of this exclusion in this particular Act.  We must remember there was no exclusion of residential holdings previous to the 1903 Act, except it contained a park, and what is known as a big gentleman's residence, altogether a different meaning from the residential holding in the 1922 Act.  I should protect them where there is a genuine letting and where advantage is taken of this term it should be left to a judge to determine.</P>

      <P>I rise to welcome this Bill on behalf of tenant farmers who have not yet got an opportunity of purchasing their lands.  If there were any mistakes or drawbacks in the Bill of 1923 this is an honest endeavour on behalf of the Minister to make them good or to confer now any benefits that were not then conferred on the tenant. There are certainly, as Deputy Gorey has pointed out, some necessary amendments to this Bill.  I say, all fee-farm grants, all long leaseholds and those who have been excluded by the residential provision or otherwise, and who worked their holdings mainly as agricultural holdings, should be included in this Bill.  Under the Act of 1923 some tenant farmers who held land along the river banks and who were known as riparian owners were excluded from the fishing rights.  I hope the Minister will include these people under the Amending Bill, and that they will own the fishery rights on their portions of the river.</P>

You may have along the river bank one person, perhaps a next-door neighbour to a man who purchased his land under the Act of 1923.  That man's neighbour may be fortunate enough to possess the rights under previous Land Acts, but those rights are absolutely useless to him to-day because a man who purchased under the 1923 Act is deprived of rights because he is not in a way to protect those rights, and the Land Commission at the moment are not protecting them.  They cannot protect them.  The thing is mixed up. It is not worth while, because you have already so many enjoying the rights under previous Acts that it would not be worth while to protect those lands. I certainly think those are points of which the Minister, when the Bill comes into Committee, ought to consider by way of amendment.  I welcome the Bill because I think that it will be a great relief to those who would be compelled to pay compounded arrears of rent; those being added to the purchase money will be a great relief to those people who otherwise would be compelled to pay them under the Act of 1923.</P>

      <P>I suppose there was never a Land Bill introduced that did not require amendment, and the Bill we are now discussing proposes some amendments in the nature of extensions and some rather stringent amendments in the nature of restrictions. At the same time, everyone will welcome the proposed amendments of the 1923 Act &mdash; great as that Act was and is&mdash;and well as it is working, up to the present.  There are certain proposals in the Bill which at first glance seem distinctly drastic.  I allude to Section 17, which deals with the collection of arrears.  The Minister has explained that in future the sheriff may seize any goods, no matter to whom they belong &mdash; goods.  I presume, mostly in the shape of stock &mdash; which are on the holding of a person who has not paid his <Col N="1750" /> annuity.  Of course that may be necessary. At the same time, it is distinctly drastic.</P>
      <P>I know of a case which occurred in the last couple of years, where cattle belonging to one man had strayed on to a holding belonging to another.  The owner of the holding had not paid his annuity.  The cattle were seized, under what authority I do not know, and the owner of the cattle had actually to go to the local pound and had to pay £5 a head to get his cattle out.  I think there were 10 cattle, so that he had to pay £50, and he has not been able to recover the money.  In this case, I understand, the cattle were not on the land by way of agreement or otherwise. They were there, in fact, as trespassers. Perhaps it is more a question for Committee, but I think it should be taken into consideration whether, in all cases, goods belonging to another party should be at the disposal of the sheriff when he is seizing goods belonging to tenants who have not paid arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 21 and the following sections also strike me as being rather severe.  If a person has a mortgage on a holding, and the tenant of that holding has not paid his annuity, the Minister says the Land Commission are to have power now to take over the holding, and that holding shall be only subject to what has been described as, I think, public charges such as Board of Work charges and of course, the annuity. He went on to say that the Land Commission shall have the further right to put up this holding for sale.  He, quite accurately, described the state of affairs at present existing when he said that when such sales take place now, even the mortgagees themselves, for one reason or another, do not make a bid.  But it is proposed by this section that if the mortgagee does not bid and buy that holding his mortgage goes. That certainly is very drastic.  I think it will have to be considered very carefully, because every mortgagee may not be in a position to bid for the holding. I do not know at what price the holding is to be sold, but presumably it is to be at the discretion of the Land Commission. That is all right, but mortgagees who lend money on land often do it to accommodate their neighbours <Col N="1751" /> and not for reasons of profit.  They may not be in such circumstances when the Land Commission puts the holding up for sale as to make a bid.  Therefore, I think we will have to consider that position carefully before we give final sanction to it.  These are drastic proposals. I admire what I was going to describe as the drasticity of them but, certainly, the circumstances are such as call for drastic measures.  At the same time before giving final consent we will want to make sure we are not slightly over-stepping the mark.</P>
    <P>In regard to what Deputy Gorey said as to what are known as fee-farm grants I should certainly like to support him in his appeal to the Minister, not so much to amend the Bill as to extend the Bill in that respect.  What the Deputy said is perfectly true that a large number of fee-farm grants that exist to-day are fictitious.  They were made, as everyone knows, in recent years, at all events, to evade the terms of recent Land Acts.  Perhaps the House may not be fully aware that in certain portions of the country there are clusters of these fee-farm grantees.  Now the Act of 1923 makes provision for what is known as tenanted land and all tenanted land is vested in the Land Commission, but fee-farm grants are expressly excluded from the term &ldquo;tenanted land.&rdquo;  It is true that provision is made in the Act for the redemption of those fee-farm grants but those tenants may not be always in a position to redeem them and, furthermore, even if they did take advantage of the section providing for the redemption they do not get the same advantage as if they had been ordinary year to year tenants.  For instance, they do not benefit by the wiping out of arrears.  Take a case where A owns a farm in a certain part of the country separated by a fence from another farm owned by B; A being an ordinary yearly tenant his land becomes immediately vested in the Land Commission.  He purchases at a reasonable rate; a certain amount of his arrears are wiped out or compounded; B. who has gone through precisely the same conditions in the past as A, and <Col N="1752" /> has been subjected to the same state of affairs, and has precisely the same kind of land and possibly pays about the same rent gets none of the advantages that A gets because he holds under fee-farm grant.</P>
    <P>Further we must consider that at a certain period, not very long ago, as at previous periods a longer time ago, the tenant farmers in Ireland were advised to withhold their rents; and they did so in most cases.</P>

      <P>I will not quarrel with the Minister as regards the facts.  Let me assume, for the purpose <Col N="1753" /> of my argument, that that was the case.  Let me assume that A and B adopted the same policy and did not pay their rents.  I say it is hardly fair that A, because he is a tenant from year to year, should be excused those arrears and that B, because he is a fee-farm grantee, should have to pay them.  That is my argument.  There may be what Deputy Gorey describes as genuine fee-farm grants in existence, but I say that the larger number of them &mdash; I am personally acquainted with some in my own constituency &mdash; in existence to-day are what Deputy Gorey described, and what I describe now, as fictitious fee-farm grants. The grantees are really tenants who would have come in under the previous Land Acts but for the subterfuge that Deputy Gorey has so aptly described.  It is true that in the congested districts the Land Commission have power to deal with fee-farm grantees as they deal with ordinary tenants, but it is not for the congested districts I am speaking.  I know areas in the south and south-east of Ireland where there are clusters of these classes of tenants.  It would not be any disservice to anybody &mdash; it certainly would not be any worse injury to the landlords or fee-farm grantors than was the case under previous Land Acts&mdash;if the lands held under fee-farm grant were allowed to come within the term &ldquo;tenanted land,&rdquo; as defined in the Land Act, 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister has considered this matter.  I know he is thoroughly conversant with the whole subject &mdash; probably more so than any of us.  I do not know whether he is in a position to tell us how many of these tenants there are but I would like to know.  I would appeal to him on the grounds which Deputy Gorey put forward, and for the reasons which I have stated, to insert a clause in this Bill extending the operations of the Act of 1923 to fee-farm grantees in the same way as they apply to ordinary tenant farmers. I do not think that is an unreasonable request.  The matter has probably been under the consideration of the Minister continually since the Act of 1923 came into operation, and I hope he will be able to give the view <Col N="1754" /> we have put forward favourable consideration.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister is it because he sees there are possibilities of failure in the Land Commission in certain contingencies that he shows this faith in the county councils?  Has he more faith in the ability of the county councils to do certain work than in the ability of the Land Commission and is he, therefore, piling on to them work which the Land Commission is not able to do?  I hope he will tell us that.  I want to express my doubts as to the ability of the county councils to make good the harm, because that is what it amounts to.  I should like to hear how far Donegal County Council made a success of their venture.  As regards Section 23, I should like to have from the Minister a definition of &ldquo;turbary rights.&rdquo;  There may be attached to a holding free bog.  A tenant may have the use of a bog on the property and may not pay any rent.  In other instances turbary rights were taken into account when fair rents were being fixed.  We have other cases then in which the tenant is, conditional on paying 1/- a year, or, perhaps, 10/- a year, entitled to turbary rights.  I should like to hear what the Minister's interpretation of &ldquo;turbary rights&rdquo; is. These rights differ very much on different holdings.  Unless we have a clearer definition than is given in the Bill, a good deal of confusion will eventuate.</P>

      <P>Captain Redmond stated a few minutes ago that in 1920 and 1921 the powers that were, advised the tenants not to pay their rents. That is not so.  The Sinn Féin authorities at that time and the Minister for Home Affairs gave directions that rents <Col N="1755" /> were to be collected.  I happened to be one of the members of the Sinn Féin Courts at the time and we gave decrees in those courts for the rents. I am sorry to say that another organisation at the time assumed control and advised that payments should not be made.  The secretary of that association sent an ultimatum to the secretary of the court asking why decrees were given.  As the Deputy referred to it I wish to correct him.</P>

      <P>If the Oireachtas is to provide the difference between what the land is worth and what was paid for it, it should also provide the difference in the case of those who hold lands under fee-farm grants to meet the difference between what the landlord would demand and what it would be worth to the tenant.  One has just as good right to come in as the other.  One made a mistake in buying land too dear and the other made a mistake in signing an agreement with the landlord.  It does not matter whether it is four or five years old or fifty years old.  One made the mistake before the Act of 1881 of signing fee-farm grants and the other made the mistake of giving too much.  I think that this is a bad thing to put into the Land Act.  A future Government, or a future party outside, might adopt the policy of saying that it would be good for the country to take up more land and divide it in the same way, purchase land and establish a financial institution the same as the Land Bank, come in and say to the Oireachtas, &ldquo;We will have to ask <Col N="1756" /> you for money to meet the deficiency caused by the high prices paid.&rdquo;  I think that is a bad policy to lay down.

      <P>I want to say a word about what I regard as an omission from the Bill, that is, that it does not make any attempt to modify the law as regards residential holdings.  The manner in which the law is interpreted at present bears very hardly upon genuine farmers who have acquired a certain type of house, a house that perhaps in the past was not regarded as a farm house, but which has lost caste and is now occupied by a farmer working the land.  I know one case particularly of a farmer working the land and occupying a house of the class to which I allude who was held to be occupying a residential holding and was excluded from the terms of the Land Act.  I think it would be well for the Minister to look into this question and insert a provision in the Bill which would bring genuine holders of that class into its ambit.</P>

      <P>There are some valuable provisions in this Bill, but two or three bad ones.  After robbing the county councils of their functions by means of the Local Officers Bill, this Bill proposes to constitute them as bailiffs and emergency men.  Section 22 gives an impossible job to county councils and one which I prophesy will be a disastrous failure and a fiasco. County councils will never be in a position to carry out this confiscation proposed in the Bill, and I hope that the Minister will have the good sense to drop this section, as it is an ignominious insult to the decent men who constitute the county councils.  When the Bill is in Committee I will return to this subject, when I will have had time to give it more consideration and study.</P>

      <P>I wish to say at the outset that this Bill will undoubtedly be hailed with delight by those people who rushed into the market when the price of land was at its zenith, and the trustees of such farms who made themselves responsible for the money borrowed, the major portion of which was <Col N="1757" /> borrowed at an exorbitant rate of interest, will undoubtedly heave a sigh of relief when they read the provisions of the Bill.  Latterly, as I happen to know only too well, the banks have exercised extreme pressure on these people in order to recover the money lent, and if the State had not come to their assistance there was no prospect before them except utter ruin.  I wish to refer to a few clauses that I do not think have been touched on up to this.  In Clause 13 the Minister proposes, by order, to require county councils to undertake the cleansing and maintenance of water-courses, etc.  Some of the watercourses on estates that the Land Commission are already dealing with, run through at least two counties, and it seems to me that in order to have unified control the Board of Works is the proper body to carry out, at all events, the initial part of the work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is satisfactory. Section 15 states that if the Judicial Commissioner fixes a price that is considered too high the Land Commission may drop the purchase.  In other words, the Commission has power under the section to drop any proceedings for the acquisition of lands that they have started.  It seems to me that if the Judicial Commissioner fixes an exorbitant price and the Commissioners refuse to proceed further with the matter, some machinery should be provided whereby the Commissioners would have a right to appeal to some higher tribunal, to some body or to the Minister.  I observe that this section only refers to land outside the congested districts, and even admitting that there may not be a great demand for land outside these districts, or a great amount of congestion, still I feel that <Col N="1758" /> quite a sufficiently large number of people in the congested districts would be willing to go to outside districts. Section 22 has been referred to both by Deputy Baxter and Deputy White.  I certainly think that the Minister should not ask the county councils to undertake the management of farms that have been acquired by the Land Commission on account of debt.  The county councils, on account of the additional duties that have been imposed on them, by the Local Government Act of 1925, have quite enough to do without assuming this additional responsibility. After all, the Minister has got a number of officials, the State Solicitors, quite competent to undertake this responsibility.  I think that in cases where farms have been vested in the Land Commission and where the Land Commission is not anxious to proceed with their division, they could leave them in the hands of the State Solicitors, who would be sufficiently able to carry out the work.  I am satisfied from my experience as a member of a county council that there is every likelihood if a county council were responsible for the management of these farms that certain abuse would inevitably creep in.  I have not got quite the same high opinion of members of county councils as my friend Deputy Gorey has&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I entirely agree with Deputy White that there are a few useful sections in this Bill and quite a number of bad ones.  The useful sections certainly are Sections 2 and 4, which deal with compounded arrears of rent and the exclusion of tenanted land that is suitable for building sites.  We are certainly in agreement with these, and I believe that it was apparent to every man who has gone through the country, estimated the resources and viewed the conditions, that Section 2 is more than overdue.  With regard to Section 3. I am with the Government in their opposition to the sub-division of holdings, and in so far as permanent tenancies would be created, to sub-letting. But my agreement ceases at that point.  I hold that there should be free working of land.  I would even go so far as to say that I believe in land as a free commodity on the market. Permission must be obtained from the Land Commission for a person to make a temporary letting, and as I suppose this section will be very strictly interpreted, the words, &ldquo;other than temporary pasturage, adjustment and conacre,&rdquo; should be inserted so as to give widows, who might often find it inconvenient to work their late husband's land, an opportunity to live until their children grew up and were in a position to do so for themselves.</P>

      <P>I also agree with the fact that something in the nature of a public authority, other than those boards of trustees which have proved such a disastrous failure in the country, should deal with the question of drainage.  I am wondering whether the county council is the fit and proper body to do that.  Bodies subsidiary to the county councils have been suppressed, and the work has accumulated on the county councils, the membership of which has been increased, with the effect that business is often more protracted than it would be in the case of smaller bodies, and I am wondering whether a change is not necessary in this respect.  I believe that drainage must be worked from some central authority, certainly with a local advisory body, but I do not know if the county councils could manage this question properly, and it is an urgent and pressing one.  With regard to the arrears of rates on land, the Minister was not very informative. He said that arrears of rates on lands were owed for a number of years even for five and six years.  That was a blank and bald statement.  He never told us why arrears have been owing on some of these farms. I propose to enlighten him.  The fact is that in several instances the owners were forcibly dispossessed five or six years ago.  Sinn Féin clubs took over the land, worked it on the <Col N="1761" /> communal principle, and, I believe, in some instances, offered it for grazing purposes so much being offered for every beast put out to graze.  That was the only use to which it was put. I heard on reliable authority that it was proposed, out of the money thus collected, to pay the rates.  Committees were formed but they have gone west and the arrears of rates are outstanding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in West Clare.  There were only one or two cases of land seizure in West Clare. In these cases the owners have been out of possession since 1920, but they are called upon to meet liabilities for land they did not work and from which they received no income, having been forcibly put out of it.  I hold that is not a fair proposition.  It seems to me that the councils did not do their duty and neither did the rate-collectors. The councils and their servants should be held responsible for all the arrears of rates.  There was ample opportunity of going on the lands and getting the rates many times, but that was not done.  These bodies failed and were wanting in their duty and there is no reason why the Dáil should be unjust to the owners and should let those people who were negligent escape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I approve of what Deputy Redmond said in regard to mortgages on land. The effect of the Minister's proposals, it appears to me, will be to restrict credit on land.  It will not be as easy as in the past to raise money on land by way of mortgage.  As Deputy Redmond pointed out a mortgagee is not always in a position, when his land is up for sale, to come in and make a bid.  In my opinion he would want a sum of money equal to the original amount of his mortgage in order to secure himself.  Roughly the effect will be that the amount that could be raised would be reduced by half, or a little over 50 per cent.  If a mortgagee is not able to put up the money to make a bid for a holding a dishonest mortgagor could defeat him by getting a friend to buy the land for the <Col N="1762" /> nominal amount due to the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  I am not very much in favour of the Government's proposal that the lands should be acquired by the county councils. It appears to me that the councils have enough to do without embarking on land schemes, even though they have the sanction of the Minister for Local Government to do so.  The proposal that the councils should strike a rate to retain those lands appears to me farcical.  In other words, that means that the ratepayers and the community are to be charged with the maintenance of those holdings where the owners have definitely refused to meet their just obligations.  If a sale proves abortive when the land is cut up by the Land Commission &mdash; this at least has been my experience &mdash; a sale years afterwards will be just as difficult. The real difficulty with regard to Sections 24 to 28 is, as far as I can see, that we have to accept the position as we find it.  I strongly protest against the whole policy, which seems to have had its origin in 1919 and 1920, and which has been continued almost up to the present hour.</P>

In connection with this question of land settlement, I question whether the Government is pursuing a wise and safe policy.  I have on many occasions in this House given expression to my views on that matter.  Of course the unfortunate people who have been let in, and who were duped into taking land under those conditions, for them I feel the greatest sympathy, and I do not propose to resist the relief that is going to them under this section, <Col N="1763" /> but I do indict the attitude and policy of the Government through all these transactions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Who started this policy of land settlement other than the present Government under the Land Bank system?  Were not the Sinn Fein organisation and the First and Second Dáil the fathers of such a scheme?  It appears to me that these people who were put into occupation of the land are defaulting now, not so much because the land was bought at an excessive price, but because in most cases they were poor men without any capital.  Without capital, with the holdings too small and trying to put too many men on the land, trouble arose, because they were given uneconomic holdings at a stiff price, which they were unable to bear.  Take the case of men who bought land in the open market in 1920.  In the Land Bank cases they got the fee simple.  Some men bought land in 1919 or 1920, and paid every bit as much per acre for it as people who bought in the open market. In some cases they paid more, and in other cases they bought inferior land and relatively they paid a higher price for it than was paid for land bought in the open market.  They cannot come to the Government looking for assistance. Men bought securities in those days which have since depreciated very considerably in value, but they cannot look to the Government to be recouped. Men made an investment which was quite legitimate and for the good of the country.  Every man who contributes to the national wealth is a good citizen.  A great number of men did their utmost to contribute to the national wealth and suffered losses by doing so, and yet they have no relief and no redress to get, but as a matter of fact they are taxed to maintain the failure and the impossible policy inaugurated in 1920.  I am not going to resist the relief that is going to these people, because I commiserate with them in their position, but for Heaven's sake let this be a <Col N="1764" /> warning for the future, a warning that impossible prices cannot be paid for land, and that you simply cannot put people on the land without some capital.  The earnings from land are limited, and one or two bad seasons may create and precipitate a famine. There is one further objection I have, and it is that the Minister did not tell us the sum that we have to meet.  From a rough calculation, I estimate that there is a direct loss of between £200,000 and £250,000 in those cases where land was bought either by the Land Bank or those Committees that were set up.  The scheme itself for purchasing the land was defective to this extent: that the deposits should have been applied to reduce the overhead charges.  That should have been taken into consideration as part of the purchase price, and only on the balance outstanding should the annuity have been charged.  That was not done, and that in itself was enough even in better times to damn any hope of success that there was or that could have resulted from these societies.  I hope that what has occurred will be taken as a warning.  This has also to be taken as an indication that it is part of the salvage we have to pay and the inevitable price that we are called on to meet as a consequence of what occurred in 1920.  Let us take a warning from the land bills that we are now called upon to foot.</P>

      <P>There are just a few words I wish to say on this Bill. At the outset I endorse the appeal of Deputy Gorey for the inclusion of fee-farm grants and long leases.  That is an omission in the 1923 Act that I think ought to be rectified.  There were a good many men who took advantage of the opportunities that presented themselves and who, as Deputy Gorey stated, had their lands re-sold and redeemed.  These tenants are now ruled outside the Bill and with Deputy Gorey I agree that they should be included within its scope.  I hope something in that direction will be done before the Bill is finally passed.  In my opinion Sections 9 and 2 are very valuable and will facilitate the vesting of land.  Sections 9 and 6 will, I think, <Col N="1765" /> help to get over the difficulties created by people who failed in the past to look after the regularisation of their title to land.  We all know that this failure on their part was a great source of obstruction in the past and caused great delays in matters relating to the ownership and acquisition of land.  A good many tenants, unfortunately, were rather remiss in attending to this matter.  The land passed from father to son and when this was not done in a regular legal manner, great delay afterwards took place in the matter of investigation of title before, under a purchase scheme, land could be vested. Many tenants have a great grievance in that respect.  Because of their inability to comply with all the regulations on the appointed day, they could only get a reduction of twenty-five per cent. on their rents whereas if they were in a position to submit the necessary proofs they would have been entitled to a reduction of thirty-five per cent.  The matters dealt with in the Bill with regard to the question of vesting as well as the machinery for the appointed day will facilitate tenants in getting the benefit of reductions which they should have got under previous Acts.  With regard to building ground and drainage, these were dealt with in the Act of 1923 but not in a satisfactory way.  I am glad to find that provision has been made in this Bill to rectify the omission in the Principal Act.  Of course I suppose at the time we could not have foreseen all these things.  I hope that under this measure that we are now arriving at the final stage whereby we can settle in an equitable way this question of land purchase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to range over the Bill as it has already been fully dealt with.  I want to deal with the effect the proposals in the Bill will have on credit facilities to farmers. I want to point out what I consider inconsistent treatment in different sections of the Bill with regard to banks. It is common knowledge that the main mortgagors of farmers are banks.  In Section 21 the proposal is to cut out the bank altogether if at a sale it refuses to buy a farm.  That is what it really means.  The Land Commission takes a <Col N="1766" /> particular form, and if the bank is not there to buy the whole thing goes by the board.  In the other case the banks have advanced the money and the Government comes along and proposes to pay the banks the last penny.  I maintain that is inconsistent policy, and, while I am all the time for the collection of rents and rates, I do not know how we could allow Section 21 to remain portion of this Bill.  The Minister looks at the bank as a mortgagor in one case and says it has no rights.  Could he not have looked at the banks in the other case and propose to pay them 10/- in the £.  Would not that be a better proposition than the Minister's?  I merely say these words just to give an indication of my opinion regarding the proposals, which will not, and cannot, be accepted by the tenant farmers.  I support all that Deputy Gorey has said in connection with the fee-farm grantees. The Minister need not pride himself about the fact that he will have to deal with all the fee-farm grantees in Ireland.  If he did it would not involve any loss, and I think those who are fee-farm grantees should be included, and I hope to get them in on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey said he would refrain on this occasion from saying, &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo; Well, I am glad of that, for I would be under the necessity of asking him who told me, for I got advice from all sides on the question, and from certain Deputies, and really the position is that I think Deputy Gorey's Party is in a position to say, &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; whether I was bringing in a Bill dealing with those points in the measure now before us, or whether I was bringing in a Bill to repeal all land purchase Acts.

      <P>Exactly. What else does it come to?  The Deputy <Col N="1767" /> is a very intelligent man, and he knows exactly what he means.  It is as Deputy Johnson said, free trade in land &mdash; that is repealing land purchase. I hold that he has repeated that one hundred times in different forms.  I could go to the Seanad, and I think we all know what they think of land purchase.  I think we may leave it at, &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; or we would never go forward.  Dealing with the sections, as to the meaning of Section 3, sub-section (3), which I was asked to explain by Deputy Gorey, the sub-section is: &mdash;</P>
      <P>The tenant of a holding to which the Land Act, 1923, applies shall not without the consent in writing of the Land Commission cut down, or uproot or permit to be cut down or uprooted any tree upon the holding, and if any such tree is cut down or uprooted in violation of this condition, the tenant shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding five pounds for each tree so cut down or uprooted.</P>
      <P>I think that simply puts a holding which has not been purchased, but in respect to which payment is being made in lieu of rent, in the same position as the purchased holding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.  The tenant who purchased the holding can cut down trees without the consent of the Land Commission.  Now, in fact, all holdings are purchased, for the legal position is not the actual position, which is that as from the date of the passing of the 1923 Act, all tenanted lands came under control, at least for some purposes of the Land Commission, and will be purchased, and, therefore, we might as well have the same regulations and laws in regard to tenanted lands not yet vested as in regard to purchased lands.  That is all that is in it.</P>

      <P>I do not think so &mdash; that that goes any further in regard to tenanted lands subject to payment in lieu of rent than sections in the previous Act dealing with purchased lands.  We may go into that in Committee. It is not very important, but there is a similar section in the 1909 Act.  Regarding building ground, I do not think I need say any more on that subject.  I agree with what Deputy Gorey has said.  I stated that this case applied not only to cities like Dublin and Cork, but also to provincial towns. That is to say, we have there also a grievance under the 1923 Act, that the whole farm is excluded because a small portion is building ground and could not be purchased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point the Deputy made, and he suggested a time limit.  I am thinking over it.  There are many objections to a time limit, and it will be very hard to fix it.  There is no finality about the land purchase. There is not a terrible grievance if a man purchased all his holdings except a small portion that abuts on a road near a town.  I think he is doing very well as he has special advantages over a farmer in the country, because he is living near a town and close to a good market and he also has his farm at an extremely low rent.  A question was raised in connection with maintenance of embankments or drainage works on lands purchased under previous Land Acts, and it was suggested they should be also dealt with in this Bill.  Again I am sure Deputy Connor Hogan will agree with me that it would be a very dangerous proceeding indeed to reopen the previous Land Acts in that respect, and it would be very difficult. Arrangements in fact were made with every purchaser.  In the previous Acts there were powers to make general arrangements but there was nothing specified as to what the arrangements were, for the sales were all qualified and consequently subject to negotiations. Certain allowances were made <Col N="1769" /> to the landlord or tenant or anyone concerned before the prices were fixed, and in fact arrangements were always made in that way for the maintenance and upkeep and reconstruction of embankments. What happened was a certain sum of money was deducted from the purchase money and vested in trustees for that work.  Generally also the Land Commission before handing over works put them in order.  One would imagine that was a reasonable arrangement for all concerned.  Imagine a farm adjoining the sea, and a fairly large drain running through that farm. It was put in order for the purchaser. The Land Commission did all the reconstruction that was necessary.  They vested the fee simple in the lands of the tenants adjoining and vested a sum of money in trustees for maintenance. That would affect, say, 60 or 70 tenants and they consented to three trustees who had no financial difficulties.  They got a sum of money and had only to administer that trust.  All their interests were in keeping the drains and embankments in order but they would not do it.  That was due to petty jealousies.  One man said one thing and another said another.  The trustees, perhaps, disagreed amongst themselves and allowed the drains to be choked or the embankments to fall in and they would not repair them.  I do not know whether it would have been right to let them get out of their own difficulties.  They should have sufficient social sense to do it for themselves. It is absurd to suggest that such work should be transferred, not to the county council but to the central government. Some Deputy suggested that it should be transferred to the Board of Works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  I am dealing not only with what you said but what others have said.  It was suggested that this work should be transferred to the Board of Works.  Imagine the Board of Works being responsible for a comparatively small embankment running through the lands of, say, fifty tenants in the country and having to send down an inspector.  It would <Col N="1770" /> be three times as expensive as if the trustees or the county council looked after it, because they are much closer to it.  I do not think that the Dáil should agree to transfer work of that kind to the Board of Works.  Deputies are very fond of protesting against centralisation. Here is work essentially for local bodies, and it could be done much more cheaply by local bodies than by a central government.  Is it suggested that because it requires a little public spirit or a little combination among people, that this should be sent to the Board of Works so that these people may at least unite in denouncing the Government?  Fee-farm grantees have, in fact, all the benefits that tenant purchasers are entitled to, with this exception, that they do not get the same treatment in regard to arrears.  Fee-farm grantees in congested districts do get the same treatment.  In cases which, as Deputy Gorey would say, are thoroughly authenticated cases, the Land Commission resells the land to them at the purchase money, and out of that all fees are paid.  In fact, fee-farm grantees in congested districts really get all the advantages of tenant purchasers, and the only point in this is the point about arrears.  It is all very fine to talk about such lands at £5, £6, or £10 an acre.</P>

      <P>In any event we can debate all these points in Committee. Deputy Noonan raised a question about fisheries.  That is another vital question.  At present the fisheries are transferred to the State who may let them to tenant purchasers or anybody else.  This Bill has no jurisdiction over fisheries which are not appurtenant to lands.  It has no reference to several fisheries.  As to the question of arrears, Deputies are surprised and are prophesying most shocking consequences from the exercise of these powers.  These powers, however, are in existence already in regard to rates, and rates are often as heavy as land annuities.  Is it an interference with the land?  It is not, except that it is interfering with the fraudulent letting of land.  Deputies do not seem to be aware that if there are two mortgages on land, one mortgagee is in a position of selling the land on his own mortgage, and if he cannot get a better price, the second mortgagee is out. From the point of view of credit there is, in fact, no change.  All the excitement over this section is due to the fact that Deputies do not realise that these provisions are in full operation in regard to rates and in regard to charges by people other than the Land Commission.  We are merely putting these land purchase annuities in line with the rates, and the Land Commission in line with certain other classes of mortgagees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The common practice of a bank is to go in and buy as mortgagee.  They do it every day.  What really is interfering with the land as security for credit is the difficulty of selling it.  If credit is tightened far and away too much, as it has been, and if farmers find it difficult to get credit, that is one of the principal reasons and we will have to face up to it.  The difficulties of selling are due to the habit some committees and some farmers have, who are in a position to do it, of borrowing money.  Then a farmer writes to a bank manager to say that he was <Col N="1772" /> at the first meeting held by John Mitchel and was afterwards at Mitchelstown with Mr. O'Brien, and if he sends down the sheriff to evict him out of the holding which his father held before him there will be trouble.  That is the sort of thing that is interfering with land as security. No one is going to compel the county council to do anything which they do not wish to do.  We are merely giving them the option if they wish to take over the land.  I am not in love with this provision, and I merely inserted it as a compliment to the county council of Deputy White.  As regards turbary rights, if the turbary is part of the holding it is purchased by the tenant at a reduced rent.  Deputies know how the tenant purchases.  If the tenant is a first-term man he purchases at one reduction, and if he is a second-term man, at another reduction, and so on.  If the turbary is part of the holding it is purchased with it, but if it is not, this gives us power to buy turbary as untenanted land, and to vest the turbary in the tenants. That covers that point.</P>
