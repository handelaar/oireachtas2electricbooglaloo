      <P>I move for leave to introduce the Trade Loans (Guarantee) (Amendment) Bill, 1926. The long title fully explains the object of the measure:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A Bill entitled an Act to extend the limit of time imposed by the Trade Loans (Guarantee) (Amendment) Act, 1925, on the giving of guarantees and the making of loans under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1924, and to modify the aggregate capital amounts in respect of which guarantees may be given and of the loans which may be made under the last-mentioned Act.</P>

      <P>There is a special reason why this measure should be taken as early as possible on account of the matter referred to by the Minister for Finance on a recent Vote.  I urge that unless the Deputy has some special reason against the proposal the Second Reading should be taken next Tuesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not want to go into reasons.  The fact that the matter raised by the Minister for Finance a couple of days ago is to be re-debated in the Seanad is one reason why I think the Second Reading of this Bill should not be taken sooner than I suggest.  The <Col N="934" /> second reason is that I anticipate an Interim Report from the Committee of Public Accounts will be presented to the Dáil on matters which will affect the Bill.  For those reasons I thought it would be well if we deferred the Second Reading of the measure.</P>

      <P>If it were merely for the first reason stated by Deputy Johnson I would again urge that there is great reason to have priority here, for certain remarks that will necessarily arise on Second Reading may have reference to the matter to be debated in the Seanad on Wednesday next.  If this Interim Report of the Committee of Public Accounts is going to deal with anything relative to the principle of this measure, I can see a certain reason for the Deputy's point, but I cannot understand how any Interim Report of the Committee of Public Accounts would in any way change the principle of this measure.  It might have an effect upon the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That the provisions of Resolution No. 3 of the Financial Resolutions agreed to by Dáil Eireann on the 4th day of May, 1926, shall be deemed always to have had effect in relation to income tax chargeable in respect of any profits or gains other than those falling within Case III. or Case V. of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act, 1918.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory <Col N="936" /> effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913.</P>
    <P>This Resolution is to enable the section which is in the Bill to be covered. As I stated when the original Resolution was introduced, it followed a certain decision in the House of Lords which we believed would be adopted by the Courts here, in the case of Whelan <i>versus</i> Henning.  In that case the House of Lords decision only applied to incomes arising from foreign possessions, and it was thought the view they took could not be applied to incomes arising from trades or professions here; but further consideration has led us to believe that it may be so applied and, as a matter of fact, that is the view taken by the British Government. The section that is in our Finance Bill is identical with the section in the British Finance Bill and this supplementary Resolution is introduced for the purpose of covering the section.</P>
    <P>I explained that the House of Lords decision was that although tax was assessed on the basis of the three years average, if there was no income in a particular year, and the source of income was in the possession of the taxpayer, no tax would be paid.  That would mean that very great inequalities might exist.  It would mean that the taxpayer&mdash;the particular sort of taxpayer to whom it would apply&mdash;would get the advantage of the bad year twice.  Deputies will see it more clearly if I quote the case of tax payable on the basis of the income of the preceding year, and that will shortly be the basis that will be adopted instead of the three years average.  The British Government have already announced the abandonment of the three years average.  We have not felt able to do so this year, because our staff will be sufficiently taxed by the change in regard to double income tax relief.  The very carrying out of the change will involve labour on the staff, and we do not feel able to make the other change. Next year it is hoped we also will be able to announce the abandonment of the three years average, and charge tax, in cases where the three years <Col N="937" /> average is now the basis, on the basis of the preceding year.</P>
    <P>If we were charging tax on the basis of the preceding year and did not legislate as we are legislating in Section 3, the effect would be that if a man had an income of two thousand pounds last year, and if this year he had no income, he would pay no tax, because he had no income, and if next year he had an income of five thousand pounds he would still pay no tax, because he had had no income in the preceding year.  It is also would produce great disparity of treatment between individuals because it might mean that an individual who had an income of ten pounds would be charged tax on two thousand pounds, that being the average, whereas a man who had no income would be charged no tax whatsoever. The section is for the purpose of legalising and reinstating the practice that has prevailed ever since the introduction of income tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is entirely retrospective. There is just one matter I would like to mention.  One individual brought a case before the Circuit Judge and he got a decision in his favour.  We do not believe that decision was right, but we are not appealing in that case; in fact we have withdrawn notice of appeal which was lodged and we are letting the individual who succeeded in getting judgment have the benefit of that judgment.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">RESOLUTION No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That there shall be charged, levied, and paid for and upon every licence to act and carry on business as a bookmaker issued under any Act passed or to be passed during the financial year beginning on the first day of April, 1926, an excise duty at the following rates, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  on a licence expressed to be in force for one year ...  ... ten pounds <Col N="938" /> (b)  on a licence expressed to be in force for any period less than one year&mdash;two pounds for every day of such period.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is the section imposing a licence duty on individual book-makers. The licence fee will be £10.  It is proposed to issue licences for periods less than one year at a fee of £2 for every day of such period.  We are allowing licences to be taken out for a lesser period than one year because it has been the practice for book-makers from outside the Saorstát to attend occasionally and it is not considered desirable to put a stop to that entirely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading of the Finance Bill I stated that as I only took exception to the section, I would not insist on a division on the main Bill.  In connection with the supplementary Financial Resolution now moved, I purpose taking the same attitude. I stated on that occasion that the persons for whom I spoke were not unreasonable and were agreed that revenue could be obtained from racing, but that it should be such as the industries of racing and thoroughbred bloodstock could bear, and I still maintain that.  The following alternative proposals suggested as a compromise will show that that is the spirit in which they are made:&mdash;We suggest: 1&mdash;That at meetings where the &ldquo;tote&rdquo; or pari-mutuel is operated a 5 per cent. tax be charged, 50 per cent. of the net receipts to be refunded to the race company for the purpose of increasing the stakes to be run for.  2&mdash;The proposed tax of 5 per cent. on all bets made with bookmakers on race-courses to be reduced to 2½ per cent., and half the net revenue to be likewise refunded towards the increase of stakes.  Although we have made that suggestion we still believe that even a 2½ per cent. tax on turnover will take sufficient money out of racing at least to seriously injure it.  3&mdash;The proposed tax of 5 per cent. on starting-price betting to be reduced to 2½ per cent., the revenue obtained to be used for the State.  4&mdash; The proposed tax of 5 per cent. on bets made at coursing meetings to be withdrawn owing to the serious injury that would be caused to this national <Col N="939" /> sport, and the fact that the net revenue obtained would not more than cover the cost of collection; also, to the fact that very many coursing meetings heretofore run in the Free State will be transferred to the &ldquo;free of tax&rdquo; State of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>If the Minister agrees to these suggestions it will leave me in the position to decide my attitude in connection with the amendments standing in my name for the Committee Stage.  I might mention that with the exception of the Deputies who supported my attitude in this House, as well as Senator Parkinson and Senator MacLoughlin, who rendered invaluable assistance both here and outside, I have not consulted the stewards of the Turf Club or any other interested parties with regard to this offered compromise.  My reason for not doing so was that I received no assistance whatever from them in the matter.  I hope, therefore, that as we have endeavoured to meet the Minister half-way he will endeavour to meet us half-way in the very reasonable proposition that I am putting up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That an excise duty of twenty pounds shall be charged, levied and paid on the registration and also on every renewal of the registration of any premises in any register or premises maintained under any Act passed or to be passed in the financial year beginning on the 1st day of April, 1926, providing for the registration of premises in which the business of bookmaking is carried on.</P>
      <P>(2)  That the duty mentioned in this resolution shall be charged and levied on and shall be paid by the person who is entered in such register as the proprietor of the premises in respect of the registration or renewal of the registration of which the duty is chargeable.</P>
      <P>This resolution imposes an excise duty in respect of premises registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have some information from the Minister as to what he believes will be the effect of this resolution.  It has been represented to me that the registration of premises in towns and cities is likely to be demoralising: that is to say, the effect of registration will be to add to the number of people who live, move and have their being in and around bookmakers' premises: that it will bring these premises into the region of respectability and generally will tend to fix the habit of betting amongst people who ought to be more beneficially engaged and that in a general way the effect of the registration of premises in towns as bookmaking establishments is going to have a detrimental effect upon the social habits of the people.  I wonder whether the Minister has considered this question of registration from that point of view and whether it will, in effect, lead to the legalisation of ready-money betting and make every place that is licensed a place within the meaning of the Act so that ready-money can be taken from anybody in the form of <Col N="941" /> bets.  That is the case that is put up to me by people who are not squeamish at all about betting or the effects of betting.  I would like to know whether this matter has been discussed with the Minister for Justice, and what the view of the Ministry is in regard to that aspect of the question of the registration of bookmakers' premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has been discussed with the Department of Justice.  The position at the present time is that in almost every village in the country you have bookmaking establishments and you have a continuous evasion and disregard of the law.  You have the position in which it is quite impossible to suppress a practice that is illegal.  We feel that on the whole it is desirable that what cannot be suppressed, what the whole community more or less indulges in, should be legalised, regulated and controlled. The bookmaking premises will be registered after inquiry in all cases by the police as to the suitability of the premises.  They will not be allowed to be located in certain situations.  The congregation of people will not be allowed on betting premises.  Nothing will be allowed except the carrying on of the actual business of bookmaking. A man whose premises are licensed will not be allowed to carry on roulette or games of that sort on them.  He will simply have premises where people can go in and record their bets and be given their dockets, and at which they can call in due course, in the ordinary public way, to receive anything that may be due to them as a result of the race.  We do not believe that that is going to do anything in the way of increasing betting or to fix the habit of betting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone at the present time who wants to make a bet can easily find the means of doing it.  I understand that there is no difficulty anywhere for people who want to lay a bet to find a channel through which the bet may be laid.  We do not think any ill result will follow the licensing of premises to which people may go without any evasion of the law and without committing any crime and put on their stake. These premises will be controlled. People will not be licensed to carry on <Col N="942" /> betting who have shops or public-houses. We believe that in the future the ordinary licensed bookmaker will co-operate with the police in preventing the carrying on of surreptitious bookmaking establishments.  A person paying his licence duty and tax would naturally be resentful of people carrying on betting on premises in respect of which no tax was being paid.  There will be supervision of these registered premises.  As regards juveniles, they will be prevented, just as they are prevented from being served with drink on licensed premises, from going to these registered premises for the purpose of betting.  With the registration of premises the practice of betting can be regulated, and instead of having detrimental effects the social effects will be, I think, somewhat beneficial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether it is contemplated that betting on registered premises will only be allowed in respect of horse racing or coursing, or whether a registered place may not become a mere betting school?  For instance, if the premises registered were used for playing the game of &ldquo;house&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the margin of difference is very, very small.  You will find it difficult to avoid the registration of premises for the chance picking out of a number or the chance picking out of a horse.  Perhaps these are matters that can be raised more correctly on the Bill that is to regulate these things.  I think, however, they are matters that the Minister ought to bear in mind in framing his Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputies will understand that the excise duty proposed in this resolution is in the nature of a tax.  Therefore, it must be introduced in this way by means of a financial resolution, and put into the Finance Bill which deals with taxation. A Bill to deal with the machinery will, of course, be necessary, and on that all these questions will properly arise, but it is necessary to proceed in this way to levy an excise duty.</P>
      <P>Resolution 3 put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">RESOLUTION 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That there shall be charged, levied, and paid out on and by every bookmaker who makes, lays, or otherwise enters into any bets on or after the 1st day of November, 1926, an excise duty of five per cent. of the amount of every bet entered into by him on or after the said 1st day of November, 1926.</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purpose of this Resolution the amount of a bet shall be the sum of money which by the terms of the bet the bookmaker will be entitled to receive, retain or take credit for if the event the subject of the bet is determined in his favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, I suppose, is the contentious resolution.  I must say that I welcome the tone in which Deputy Shaw spoke. Heretofore so far as I could discover there was a disposition simply to oppose any tax on betting.  We were told that various bookmakers were willing to promise considerable sums by way of a licence on bookmakers, but not to agree at all to a tax on betting.  As a matter of fact, at one stage in the discussions, <Col N="944" /> when I mentioned the idea of a 2½ per cent. tax I was told that 2½ per cent. was as bad as 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>With reference to the specific point that Deputy Shaw mentioned, it is not proposed in the Betting Bill to take power to set up the totalisator against the wishes of the owners of the premises. It is not proposed that we should take power to go to racecourses and set up the totalisator there.  As a matter of fact, in the draft of the Bill I think a specific clause is in to say that the consent of the owner of the premises must be got.  It follows, really, from that that arrangements as to terms on which the totalisator will be conducted, if the State is to conduct the totalisator, will have to be made with the owners of the courses.  On the other hand, if persons like stewards are given the licence on certain terms to conduct the totalisator, terms will have to be settled and perhaps different terms in individual cases.  The conditions in different courses may require different terms.  In that case I would not contemplate putting into a Bill that certain sums out of the totalisator profits or tax should be paid over to the race committee.  At present the racecourses do derive a certain revenue from the bookmakers and they would certainly have to have some revenue corresponding to that.  They would certainly have to have payments made to them from the totalisator.  I think that is a matter that should be left to arrangement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shaw suggested that we should only have a tax of 2½ per cent. on bets made on racecourses and that we should give half the revenue to the committee or the racecourse executive for increased stakes.  I indicated at one stage that, if we were having a 5 per cent. tax, I was sympathetic to the idea of returning half the tax obtained on racecourses to the committee for the purpose of increasing stakes.  It is rather a different proposition to say that the tax should be reduced to 2½ per cent. and that half of the 2½ per cent. should be given to race executives. That would leave a very small revenue, I am afraid, from actual racing here, for the State.  I have always been willing to consider the case of <Col N="945" /> the racecourses here, but, as I said on the last day, I have so far been kept at arm's length; there was nothing but an unbending opposition to any tax on betting.  As I said, the statement was made to me that a 2½ per cent. tax was as bad as a 5 per cent. tax.</P>
    <P>There was no real attempt to supply figures to me that would enable me to come to a decision on the matter.  I will say this&mdash;that such information as has been placed before me and such information as I have been able to gather, since the tax was first proposed, indicates that the original estimate of revenue of £150,000 to £200,000 from a 5 per cent. tax was a conservative estimate, or probably an under-estimate. If information is put before me, and if the people concerned are prepared to meet me and discuss the matter that there is going to be a tax on betting as distinct from a tax on bookmakers&mdash;if that happens between this and the Committee Stage or the Report Stage of the Bill&mdash;I am prepared to give sympathetic consideration to the proposal that the tax should be 2½ per cent. on racecourses. I would like to have figures put up indicating more clearly than I can know at the present time what the revenue is likely to be from it.  I certainly do not want to injure Irish racing.  I do not want, even, to take the risk of injuring Irish racing and if I am met fairly in the matter by having facts placed before me, I am prepared to give sympathetic consideration to the whole matter.  But we have not been able to get it because there was a determination, as far as I could see, to defeat the idea of a tax on betting.  There was a suggestion that seemed to be impracticable and unsatisfactory for a stiff tax on book-makers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the idea that there should be no tax&mdash;as I think I gathered from the Deputy&mdash;on coursing, I do not think I could agree to that.  I do not see that any form of betting could be excepted from the tax.  As I said before, I see the economic importance of horse racing.  I see that horse breeding cannot be carried on in a satisfactory way unless there is racing. Consequently, I am not anxious to take <Col N="946" /> any risk of injuring Irish racing and indirectly injuring the horse breeding industry.  But coursing seems to me to be quite a different matter.  I do not think it has any economic importance at all.  I see no reason for any concession in regard to coursing.  Certainly no argument has been put up to me by anybody that coursing is of any economic importance.  Perhaps arguments could be put up.  I am always willing to consider arguments.  As I say, Deputy Shaw's speech to-day is the first sign that the people who are interested directly in racing were prepared to meet us reasonably and prepared to discuss practical propositions, and I hope to submit any facts that are at their diposal.  There would be certain difficulties in having a five per cent. tax on betting off the course, and a 2½ per cent. tax on the course.  There would be attempts at complete evasion and attempts at partial evasion, if we had two rates.  We would have people, perhaps, who would not be prepared to take the risk of complete evasion but who would be inclined to take the lesser risk by paying a tax at wrong rates.</P>
    <P>I have not any information at present that would justify any consideration for the proposition that bets off the course should only be taxed at 2½ per cent.  As I understand it, this particular betting that goes on in towns and villages away from the racing gives no support at all to racing, and is of no advantage at all to racing, and no damage at all would be suffered if it were to happen that that sort of betting were reduced to a very trivial amount.  In fact, I think, there would be distinct advantages.  On the matter of racecourses, I have already indicated willingness to meet the case put up.  As Deputy Shaw has now put up a case, I can say to him that, if he would see me in the intervening days before a stage is reached that the Bill cannot be amended, I am prepared to meet him in the most sympathetic way.</P>

When he is dealing with this question of betting on and off the course, how is it proposed to deal with bets made on Irish race-courses on English races?  That not infrequently <Col N="947" /> happens, when there is a big race on.  Is such a bet to be taxed at 2½ per cent. or 5 per cent.?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I will use my best endeavours with Senator Parkinson and any other person to procure figures to bear out the statement we have made on several occasions that a five per cent. tax is excessive, and that a 2½ per cent. tax is possibly even more than racing can bear.  I believe that a 2½ per cent. tax would yield more than a 5 per cent. tax, because a 2½ per cent. tax would allow racing to go on, whereas a 5 per cent. tax, I believe, and every man who has any knowledge of the subject in Ireland believes the same thing, would cause racing to cease inside nine months.  This matter will be fully discussed on the Committee Stage.  I do not think there is any necessity for me to say much further than that we are very definite with regard to our claim to have 50 per cent., at least, of the money that is provided out of the totalisator or the pari-mutuel refunded to the race committees for additional stake.  The racehorse owner in Ireland is a man who, at the present time, is supplying all the sport, the amusement tax and everything else, in connection with racing, and there is no doubt at all about it that he is the person who gets the least out of it.  A horse in training in Ireland at the present time, costs at least £6 a week.  You take a horse to a meeting for a £50 stake.  When the entry, railway freight, and other expenses are totted up, I can assure you that there is very little out of it, even if the horse wins the race.  If this 2½ per cent. is allowed, stakes can be increased and the owner can, at least, be given a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to coursing, I am very sorry that the Minister has not given me any encouragement in that case. <Col N="948" /> The only answer I can make to him is that we will have to go up to the North of Ireland and have the coursing meetings held there.  Any person who read to-day's newspapers could have seen that in Westmeath yesterday the coursing club decided that if the tax was imposed on coursing they would take steps in that direction.  They have already sent a deputation to Northern Ireland to procure a suitable place to run the very successful meeting which was held there last year and which is known as the Belsize Cup.</P>
    <P>The Minister has met us&mdash;I do not know if I could exactly say fairly, but he has at least given us some hope of being able to prove the facts that we have suggested.  I would ask him, in conclusion, to reconsider his decision about coursing.  I have made what is, in my opinion, an unanswerable case about coursing.  I have explained that there are thirty-two dogs in a stake. After the first draw, there are sixteen dogs left.  They are drawn again, and there are eight left.  After the next draw, there are four left, and then two.  There remains eventually only the winner.  Whoever is the lucky owner of that dog will have to pay 25 per cent. to the Government, and not 5 per cent., if he invests in the first course and continues investing until the stake is disposed of.  That constitutes, in my opinion, an unanswerable argument. I also put up the case that, where the dogs are from two counties, the partisans of one county are pitting their money against the people from the other county.  The supporters of the winning dog receive the money belonging to the partisans of the opposing dog's county, with the result that the Government will get 5 per cent. on every course from the two dogs&mdash;winner and loser.  I gave racing nine months to live under the proposed arrangement, and I give coursing one month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where the Minister gets his information with regard to coursing, nor do I know where he gets his information with regard to racing.  He seemed to pause a little with regard to racing.  We, in the South at least, are not Puritans and we are not afflicted with a Puritan mind. <Col N="949" /> If it be urged that horse-racing and the breeding of thoroughbreds deserve encouragement, I should like to remind the Minister that he will get no licence-fees from horses.  He draws an annual licence-fee from greyhounds.  I would like to remind him that there is a considerable trade between this country and England and America in greyhounds. I refrained from speaking about this matter, because the first thing that would be said by Minister, and, perhaps, by some members of the public, would be that I am an interested party. I am an interested party.  I frankly admit that.  For that reason, I have refrained from saying much about coursing, and I do not propose to say much now.  But I might inform the Minister that I have sold six dogs this year to America, costing as much as two racehorses. Other people&mdash;small people, and not the people who own thoroughbred studs&mdash;are dependent, to a great extent, on the breeding of good greyhounds. More than ten greyhounds have been sold out of this country for £400 each quite recently.  If the Minister does not regard this as an asset I think he is badly misinformed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coursing is the sport of the poor people.  It is the sport of the peasant and it is a very mild form of sport. Does the Minister desire that the plainer element of the community be denied their sport?  He seemed to be more favourable to racing.  His mind appeared to be absolutely directed against coursing.  There are very few lords or people with incomes interested in coursing or trying to make a living out of the breeding of greyhounds.  Quite a lot of money is invested in greyhounds.  A lot of money has been invested within the last ten years in the hope that this enterprise would be a national asset. Might I remind the Minister that some people invested £2,000 in greyhounds and tried to bring decent blood into the country.  They have succeeded in that, with the result that Irish greyhounds to-day can compete with any greyhounds in regard to price.  They are commanding prices in London and elsewhere equal to the best in the world. That is due to the enterprise of a few people.  I hope the Minister will extend <Col N="950" /> the invitation he has given to Deputy Shaw to the representatives of coursing to hear their case.  If he does, I am sure they will be able to supply him with facts and figures which he is not at present in possession of.</P>
    <P>This is a personal matter with me, and I have refrained, therefore, from entering into it.  But when I listened to what amounted almost to sneers and jibes on the part of the Minister, I was forced to stand up and give him some slight indication of the position. When he spoke about a tax on the betting in respect of coursing, I said the other day that it did not matter.  That is true to a very large extent.  The class of people who engage in bookmaking at coursing meetings are not very liberal in their odds.  There is not very much money, perhaps, involved.  At the same time, this drain will be sufficient to put an end to all betting on coursing and, if it does not kill coursing within a month, it will certainly kill it within three months.  The Minister would do well to extend the facilities he has offered to the representatives of racing to the representatives of coursing.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has met the situation fairly with regard to horse racing.  I should like, however, if he would give more attention to the point raised by Deputy Gorey.  Coursing meetings are organised by the peasant and poorer class and, if there is a tax put on coursing, it will become extinct in a very short time.  The introduction of the totalisator to race courses will, undoubtedly, be a great advantage, and the liberal offer made by the Minister, in the way of subsidising stakes, will go a long way in making this tax a very popular one.  In this matter, the Minister is like the man who speculates to accumulate. The people have been heavily taxed on other matters, and I think it <Col N="951" /> is a wise policy to attempt to get a tax-return from racing.  However, I would urge the Minister to adopt a different attitude towards coursing meetings.</P>

      <P>I hope the day is not far distant when game cocks will be allowed to fight in this country and get a death according to their nature, rather than having the head wrung off them by a cook.  In my own district, greyhound-breeding is an industry. Very close to me at home a man bred a litter of pups, which he can sell at seven guineas each.  The farmers have reason to be jealous, because he will make more out of these pups than they would make out of a litter of bonhams. Again, as Deputy Gorey has pointed out, this is the poor man's sport.  It is the sport of the clerk and of the business man and of every other class who go out to the meetings on Sundays. Poor people who otherwise would be tempted to kill a hare in order to make a few shillings will not touch the animal on account of coursing.  They all meet upon Sundays.  It is a splendid thing to see them meet and select the best dogs at the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this betting tax gets as far as the coursing field, I agree with Deputy Shaw that, if not in a month, then in three months, or in six months, you will have coursing killed.  It would be a pity if the Irish Cup should go up to the North of Ireland.  You could hardly call it an Irish Cup then even though it were won by an Irish dog. When the Minister for Finance gives this matter cool consideration, I hope he will be as well disposed towards coursing as he is towards racing.  Then you have a lot of poor bookmakers concerned. They have a grievance.  Of course, you have honest men and rogues in every occupation.  The means of living may be taken from these book-makers and their families may be left starving.  They have decent families too&mdash;some of them.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister for Finance <Col N="952" /> to reconsider the whole matter, as far as coursing is concerned, and not to impose this tax on the poor man and the poor man's sport.  If he has a good dog to-day that may bring him £300 or £400 in a few years, he may have to scrap him simply because the industry and the sport will become extinct.</P>

      <P>I have no material that would justify me in attempting to analyse the figures in that way.  I do not know anything about the matter that Deputy Doyle mentioned regarding jockey coupons.  I have given no consideration to it.  With regard to coursing, I stated that the tax on betting was decided on as a luxury tax. We raise our taxation mainly from necessities.  We tax the very poorest people&mdash;even people who are destitute &mdash;in regard to the clothes they have to buy and the sugar they have to consume. We, even indirectly, tax them, to some extent, on the rent of their houses, by means of income tax procedure.</P>
      <P>We tax all the poorest people of the country on their necessities, and we impose a tax where anything in the nature of a luxury can be found that will yield a revenue.  It is desirable that the tax should be on a luxury rather than on a necessity.  It was because of that belief and that feeling that we decided on a tax on betting. Having decided on a tax on betting, the reason that we felt inclined to give some concessions in favour of horse-racing was that we were satisfied that horse-racing was essential to the success of horse-breeding, and that horse-breeding is an important industry. Consequently, while we were imposing a luxury tax, we did not want that tax to fall unjustly on an industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;To reduce sub-head E by £250.&rdquo;  The sub-head makes an allowance to the President for a motor car of £500.  I have put this motion down because I think the justification for fixing that amount has not been satisfactorily explained, and because I think that the allowance, without further explanation, is too liberal.  The President has said that the depreciation of a car for the first year would be £300.  I do not know whether that is generally accepted by the owners of motor cars, and, when we consider that the allowance in question is supplemental to the provision for two chauffeurs, we can only come to the conclusion that the cost of running a motor car is a sign of very great prosperity in the country, if these figures are to be taken as evidence. We know from our observation how many cars there are in the country, and if we were to assume that, apart from the driver, the annual cost of running a car is £500&mdash;I am speaking of the more costly cars which run pretty frequently&mdash;it indicates a reserve of wealth for spending, partly for business and largely for pleasure, which is not in accord with what we are constantly told is the actual position in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much inclined to doubt whether £500 for depreciation, unkeep, and cost of running, is a reasonable charge, such as would be considered reasonable for the owners of motor cars in the ordinary course of their private business or pleasure.  I base my suggested amount, £250, upon certain figures that have been given in the Dáil in one way and another, as to the allowances made by the Ministry of Finance.  I find, for instance, that <Col N="955" /> a Chief Superintendent of Police is allowed for his motor car service £160 a year and a Superintendent is allowed £120.  A Chief Superintendent of Police is believed to require to use his car very generally, and it has to be a car of some quality.  As I say, a sum of £160 a year is allowed for that.  I have suggested that, in lieu of the service for which a car would be required for the President, a sum of £250, or £90 over that allowed by the Ministry of Finance to a Chief Superintendent of Police, is not unreasonable and, perhaps, would be considered fairly adequate. It presupposes, say, 10,000 miles per year at sixpence per mile.</P>
    <P>I think it is considered that sixpence per mile, the cost of running, depreciation, etc., is a fairly reasonable allowance, and that 10,000 miles a year is a fairly liberal running allowance.  It is, of course, possible to exceed that, and to reach a figure of 20,000 miles per year.  I think somebody suggested that it was possible to do 40,000 miles a year with certain cars, but a normal allowance would, I think, be 10,000 miles per year at sixpence a mile.  That would leave the sum allowed at £250. I think the method of making a fixed allowance in such a case is preferable to the method that was previously in operation, but I am not satisfied that the method of computation has had proper care, and I think it is too liberal. On those grounds I have moved to reduce the sum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The change was made from the old arrangement whereby a Government-owned car was used by the President.  That was an unsatisfactory arrangement, and it created difficulties for the Accounting Officer.  The car was used for necessary public and private purposes and it was decided, instead of that, that an allowance should be given to the President for a car.  It is necessary that the President, in view of his office, should have a car such as he would not keep if he were not holding the office of President.  There are people who will visit the head of the Government and who will have to be offered the use of his car.  It is not desirable that any person coming on a visit to the State should be offered only <Col N="956" /> the use of a taxi.  A car of a good type is necessary.  I think that there ought to be more than one car available. The allowance given was examined very carefully, and, in my opinion, it is not at all excessive.  When a car of a good quality is bought you have to reckon your interest on your money, your road tax, your cost of insurance, the very rapid depreciation and the heavy running cost.  I wish to say no more than that the figure was carefully considered, that it is not excessive, and that I would not put myself into the position of using the platform afforded here to answer the sort of semi-scurrilous criticism which one hears in regard to this matter.  I know about this matter.  It has been gone into very carefully by my office and anybody who knows the cost of running a car which is used very considerably, which may be used for long trips, and which may be put at the disposal of other people, will realise that the allowance is not unreasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want it to be thought that I am niggardly in regard to the social functions which the President's position requires him to carry through.  I have a very clear view as to the position which the President ought to occupy in such matters. Nevertheless, I have thought it desirable to have this matter discussed, not with a view to any platform or any appeal to public antipathies, but I based the proposition upon evidence which has been supplied one way and another.  The Minister has assured us that this matter has been very carefully considered.  I have no first-hand knowledge, nor have I made inquiries of people who use motor cars to any degree. I am only going on evidence presented by the Minister's own staff on matters that have come before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I took the figures that have been so presented, I have assumed 10,000 miles annual service at sixpence per mile, and I have added on £90 or £100 for the difference as between the cost of a car which would be used by a chief superintendent of police and such a car as would be used by the President, for excessive depreciation and insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that allowance is not sufficient for <Col N="957" /> the difference in depreciation, and so on, my argument does not hold.  But I am not satisfied yet that the difference is warranted, and it still seems to me to be more than is reasonable as an allowance for a motor car.  I do not want to press the matter too hard, unless other Deputies have something to say and have views to give as to the comparative costs of running motor cars.  I am forced to the conclusion, though, that if this is to be taken as a sign to the public of the cost of keeping and running a motor car, and allowing for the additional cost which one in the position of the President will have to bear, it does show that there is an immense amount of reserve wealth in the country which the Minister for Finance will, no doubt, take due account of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one thing I wish to add.  If we had a President in office for a series of years we would not want the sum of £500 every year.  But you have to face the fact that there is a bigger depreciation in the first year.  A man who buys a car because he is the President and has to sell that car six months afterwards, if he ceased to be President, might have on the sale a very big loss, but if you write off the depreciation in the first year there is not such depreciation at all in the second year, and in the third year the depreciation would be still less.  The view we took was that we must allow for the bigger depreciation in the first year, because the President might cease to hold office at or before the end of the first year.  Further investigation will follow, and when we have completed the second year some reduction will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were satisfied that the sum that was actually necessary last year will not be necessary this year the whole of this £500 will not be paid to the President, but a fair estimate will be made.  But the attitude I had taken up in this matter was that the position ought not to be that the President should be faced with a big loss on a car out of his own pocket because we had made arrangements that the car should be his own property.  The President was anxious to have no car, but I insisted that a car should be continued, because I did not think that <Col N="958" /> certain people at whose disposal we require to have cars placed should be given a taxi.  If we had not that arrangement we would require to have a car or cars actually owned by the State.  One does not want to overdo the dignity of office, particularly the dignity of a political office, but I think that certain consideration is necessary with regard to it.  This whole matter has been considered in my Department in the most impersonal way, simply with the desire to arrange a position that would be fair to the President and to the State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will see that there is a very slight change in this Vote. The matter has been discussed in previous years, and I think last year, in order that the expenditure might be restricted as much as was reasonably possible, I said we held the view that future Governor-Generals should have their residence in what was the Chief Secretary's Lodge rather than the Viceregal Lodge, which is a very big house and which is costly to maintain.  The actual costs of running it and keeping it clean and in a proper condition are considerably in excess of what they would be for a smaller house.  That matter has been considered further during the year, and I can say very definitely that that is <Col N="959" /> the policy of the Government, and I assume that it will be carried out by whatever Government is in existence when a change takes place.  But we do not feel that we could or should make a change at present.</P>
    <P>The present Governor-General was not anxious to live in the Viceregal Lodge.  We urged him, and I might almost say obliged him to take up his residence there, and we feel that it would not be right or fitting that he should be evicted now and put into another house.  We do not feel prepared to take any such step.  But we do feel that in the future the Governor-General should take up his residence in what has been the Chief Secretary's Lodge, and if that is done, certain savings can be effected.  Some public use can possibily be made of the Viceregal Lodge, and there will be a saving on this particular head.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Deputies should consider that there would be all the savings that some people indicate.  I have never been anxious to take the line that we should, as it were, attack the office of the Governor-General by refusing a reasonable amount for the establishment.  I think that there would be no national economic gain by it.  We would offend susceptibilities that would not benefit us to offend. Again, I think we can take it that we have definitely established a new thing in the British Commonwealth of Nations; we have got one of our own citizens, one of our own people, as Governor-General.  I regard that as a very definite step forward which we should not recede from.  I think it may be taken as being established that the Governor-General in future will always be one of our own people, one of our own citizens, and it might well be the case that it would be bad economy to do anything that would lower the status of the Governor-General's office. I certainly do not take the view that the Governor-General is in any way the representative of a foreign power.  He represents one of the elements of the Oireachtas.  He stands here as a representative of the Crown, but the Governor-General cannot be appointed without the assent of the Government <Col N="960" /> of Saorstát Eireann.  The Governor-General will, in future, as I say, so far as Saorstát Eireann is concerned, be one of the citizens of the State, and the office may serve a very practical utility in the future.</P>
    <P>I am as much against lavish displays or lavish entertainment as Deputy Johnson is.  I think that we do not want people to adopt a line that was supposed to be characteristic of Ireland a century or so ago.  I would be very much against that.  On the other hand, I think that a dignified establishment is necessary.  It will serve, perhaps, without any lavishness, to keep some of our citizens from turning their eyes elsewhere, and the holder of the office, if he is, as he will be, outside the political arena, may, if there is great stress in the future, provide a centre where people who are very much in conflict might come together.  In any case, I think it is a narrow and a short-sighted view to take of the matter to attempt unduly to reduce the dignity of the office.  We all, perhaps, have not been able to think as much about the political evolution of the State as we would like, but I certainly would like to put forward the view that the people who simply think that the Governor-General is somebody with whom we have no concern and who might be made the mark of all shafts of attack, are not looking at the thing with a great deal of vision.</P>

      <P>My motion is to reduce the Vote by £3,000.  I do not propose to enter into a discussion of the Constitutional position of the Governor-General, but it is necessary to advert to the connection between the cost of the establishment and the salary which is provided for by the Constitution. If we are to vote the sum of £6,667 for the establishment, in addition to the other accommodation, and the salary of £10,000, totalling £26,700, the idea that the Minister has in a manner suggested is in his mind, of the creation of some sort of society circling round the Governor-General in future, makes me place more importance upon the amendment even than I had originally placed upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is not a good tendency to encourage this social circle round an <Col N="961" /> officer of State on the basis of these figures, and on the assumption that these figures are going to set a standard. I ask whether, if we had an entirely free hand, we would fix £10,000 salary for the Governor-General? Everything that has happened, the salaries of the Ministers and the civil servants, all show that it would not have been the choice to have paid £10,000 salary, plus establishment expenses, on this level.  We have been obliged to fix this sum of £10,000 by virtue of our Constitution and Treaty. But we are not bound to provide an establishment at this rate, in addition. We are bound to make suitable provision for residence and establishment.</P>
    <P>I maintain that this is excessive and that it is not a suitable provision for this country.  It is not a suitable provision for the position which the Governor-General has hitherto occupied, and, I hope, will continue to occupy&mdash;not one around which, as far as the public can see, society circles, but a position occupied by one who is presumably taking his part in the business of the State.  In those circumstances I think that the addition of £6,000 to the £10,000 is excessive, and that the burden of keeping the establishment should be shared by the Governor-General out of his salary, if we are to provide for the kind of establishment which requires this heavy expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown that it is the policy of the Government to change the residence so that the establishment expenses would not be so high.  But he hinted that the savings would not be so great, or at least not so great as some people imagine.  I do not know, but I hope that such a change as may be made will be of a kind which will allow a considerable saving out of the £6,600 for the establishment; and unless the change from the Viceregal Lodge to the Chief Secretary's Lodge will allow considerable savings, he should look round for another place which would allow considerable savings.  So long as we are bound to pay the £10,000 salary to the Governor-General, we ought not be bound to pay anything like this £6,000 for establishment expenses in addition to office accommodation. I think that the Committee <Col N="962" /> should show by its voice, by the only method it has of expressing its views, that this sum is too great and that if changes can be made which would allow a saving this year, then these changes should be made and put into effect.  The change over from the Viceregal to the Chief Secretary's Lodge should be put into effect and a good part of this £3,000 which I ask should be saved could be saved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support Deputy Johnson's amendment.  I think that the amount for this establishment is altogether too great.  The sum of £26,706 is large, and I do not see any reason whatever why the amount should be so great.  At any time when the amount which was to be allowed to the workers was under discussion here we heard from the Ministers that the reason the wages were fixed at such a low level was because the country was too poor to afford any more.  I say that the country is too poor to afford this salary to the Governor-General and the upkeep of his establishment.</P>
      <P>If we are compelled to pay the Governor-General £10,000 a year by way of salary, we are not compelled to pay him £3,000 for expenses, together with £300 for travelling expenses, and, roughly, £10,000 for the upkeep of the establishment.  I think it is out of all proportion to the capacity of the people of this country to pay, and especially so at a time like the present, when most people in the country are finding it very hard to make ends meet and when many thousands are finding it very hard to get enough to eat.  In these circumstances this is an extravagant sum to ask, and I put it to the Committee that it is a sum which it ought not to grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole establishment seems to be run upon a very extravagant scale. There is here just one small item&mdash;telegrams and telephones.  There is, I am glad to see, a substantial reduction in this, but I submit that £535 this year is certainly a very extravagant amount, particularly when we turn over the page and when we see the amount for telegrams and telephones for both Houses of the Oireachtas is only £390. This is one of the items of the Governor-General's <Col N="963" /> establishment that I confess I have never been able to understand. They must be continually using telephones and telegrams without going to the trouble of writing letters.  We find £1,400 for water, fuel and light, and for the last three or four years we had, roughly, £1,000 a year for the supply of furniture to the Governor-General's establishment.  It seems to me that this establishment is run upon a scale of extravagance which the people of this country cannot afford to bear.  I think that the amendment put down by Deputy Johnson is a reasonable one, and I will vote for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. JOHN CONLAN Mr. JOHN CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHN CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this amendment I desire to speak with all the respect due to the Governor-General both on account of the high office he holds and also because of the valuable services he rendered to the farmers of Ireland in the past.  Having said that, it may not be an impertinence upon my part to draw the attention of the Committee and indirectly of the Governor-General to the example given by a personage who held the office of Governor in the dim past in the country of Judea.  This personage, Nihimins, wrote as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And there was prepared for me day by day one ox and six choice rams besides fowls and once in ten days I gave store of choice wines and many other things.  Yet I did not require my yearly allowance as Governor for the people were very much impoverished.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Further on he wrote:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For twelve years I did not eat the yearly allowance that was due to the Governors.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Our Governor-General, being a well-read gentleman, will have no trouble in verifying that quotation, and I would say to him, in the words of the well-known character in Dickens, Captain Jack Bunsby, &ldquo;when found make a note on't.&rdquo;  A profane writer asserted that &ldquo;they did not know everything down in Judea,&rdquo; but at all events they seemed to have known when the people were badly off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The attack on the expenditure under this Vote is <Col N="964" /> what might be called &ldquo;a popular stunt.&rdquo;  It is a very large amount especially if the salary of £10,000 be added in.  It is not unnatural that exclamations of surprise should be provoked in view of the efforts of all the economisers to reduce the national expenditure so as to find money for the profitable investment of it in services that are essential to the development of the country.  After all, I think the philosophic attitude towards the matter is that there is very little use in kicking against the pricks.  We made the bargain.  We took the Treaty and one of the terms of the Treaty is that we pay this salary.  We cannot very well have it both ways.  I, therefore, do not join with those who attack the expenditure, regarding it as a lump sum, with all the items standing on precisely the same level.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Johnson has reminded us, even the upkeep of an establishment for the Governor-General is one of the terms of the Treaty.  Therefore the provision of an establishment is part of the price for such a measure of liberty as we have secured through the Treaty. It is a contract.  We do not like it; not even the Ministers like it.  They know very well that if those who framed the Treaty settlement had their own way, that would not have been one of its terms.  It is a serious infliction, undoubtedly. It makes a serious inroad into the national fund.</P>
      <P>As regards the type of establishment to be provided, and the amount of the annual cost of it, to that we are not committed.  There is no determinate figure.  True, it must be suitable, and I am not hostile to those who talk about upholding the national dignity; but I do think that the President of the Executive Council should be a much more important figure.  I will leave personalities out of the question; I will not follow Deputy Conlan in introducing the personality of the holder of an office.  But, speaking of the two offices, it should be part of our policy&mdash;of every nationalist policy&mdash;to heighten by every means the status and the dignity of the head of the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson and all of us who have discussed this matter before are agreed that it is not advisable, and certainly <Col N="965" /> in the first years of the establishment of the Free State it was far from politic, to encourage the introduction into the conduct of that office of the practices that had been associated with the Viceregal office heretofore.  Therefore, my accusation in this matter is confined particularly to one thing, and it has no reference whatever to the holder of the Governor-Generalship. That one thing is the selection by the Government of a habitation or an official residence for the Governor-General, which, on their own showing, was very costly.  It required that the Viceregal Lodge should be re-conditioned. Students of the annual estimates will have noticed that there was a considerable sum necessitated for installing electric lighting.</P>
    <P>It is a very costly building to keep up.  Privately, I have represented that the Chief Secretary's Lodge was a much better and a less costly residence. I was told, and I believed that it was an admirable reason at the time, that it was a house much more difficult to defend.  In point of position, in that particular period of danger, it would have been extremely difficult to protect in a military way, especially the rear of the Chief Secretary's Lodge.  Therefore, I feel more or less&mdash;I want to be quite frank about this&mdash;that the case against the Executive Council for selecting a costly house is not one that altogether holds good, inasmuch as the defence might be made of needs must when the devil drives.  I do not know that that is exactly the defence; I heard nothing to that effect from the Ministers to-day.  But needs must when the devil drives would, in a way, mitigate &mdash;well, it is not criminality, but I will use that word for the moment.</P>
    <P>Surely, once peace was restored, when the &ldquo;Cease Fire&rdquo; order had been given and there was apparently no great risk, steps might have been taken to effect this transfer?  I sympathise with the attitude of the Minister for Finance in holding that it would subject the Governor-General to a certain amount of inconvenience; but then what I really feel&mdash;I hope I do no injustice in suggesting this&mdash;is that in the back of his mind was the idea that since the acceptance of that house had been forced upon its present occupier, <Col N="966" /> it would be rather awkward for the Executive Council now to force him out of it.</P>
    <P>After all, the personal convenience of one individual and the saving of the faces of other individuals, while very desirable from the Christian charity point of view, is nothing in comparison with the saving of thousands of pounds.  Above all, it is little in comparison with impressing on the public a firm belief in the genuine desire of the Government to reduce expenditure wherever possible.  I do not know, because it has not interested me to inquire, what is the practice in the Commonwealth, in the Dominions and the other elements of the Commonwealth into which the Treaty has given the Free State entrance and in which it has secured position.  I assume that in those other countries a great deal of these more intimate expenses are made out of the income of the occupier.</P>
    <P>No doubt what the Minister for Finance has said is very sound&mdash;that the Free State is the first that has had the privilege, for privilege it is, of selecting one of its own citizens to occupy this position.  It may be that the set-off to that is that we could not have a man of wealth and means.  But it occurs to me that the reply to that is that for such a man a salary of £10,000 a year ought to be so ample as to enable him to defray his household expenses just as any other citizen does and must&mdash;does, indeed, because he must.  While, therefore, I assent to the claim that the salary and the provision of a household are things from which we cannot exempt our people in regard to expense, provision in respect of the household can be brought under the pruning knife of the economiser, and, while I do not wish to make capital out of trifles, I do say that £9,360 odd &mdash;something like £10,000 in round figures&mdash;which appears in connection with this Vote, is rather heavy.</P>
    <P>The President, I remember, pointed out, in mitigation of the cost of housing the Governor-General first in the Viceregal Lodge, that the Governor-General himself was able to provide the furnishing of it.  I must take it, therefore, that reference to furniture, to which my friend on the left has referred, does not mean furniture in the <Col N="967" /> ordinary sense, but must mean something in the nature of equipment and repair of equipment in the house and installations.  I do not know; I can merely guess.  I join with Deputy Johnson is claiming that, as a mark of the sincerity of the Government in their desire to prune down unnecessary expenditure, they should give the public a guarantee that this is a service which might be very well docked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Vote last year I drew particular attention to the amount of money spent on telegrams and telephones.  The amount last year was £850.  This year it is £535, or a decrease of £315.  Still I think the amount is excessive.  I cannot understand the continuous trunk calls, day after day and hour after hour, which would justify a charge of this description. The Minister, when speaking on the question of residence, said it was their policy that a less expensive house should be provided, and that they had decided, as a policy, that the Chief Secretary's Lodge should be used in future instead of the Viceregal Lodge. He also said that they would not and could not change the present occupant out of the present residence.  The impression that conveyed to me, and probably to most other people, was that the present occupant of the Viceregal Lodge was consulted and that he objected or rather considered that it would not be a proper thing to remove. If the Minister wishes to convey that the Governor-General was consulted and objected, it is all right. If such a thing did not take place it would be well, I think, to correct it, but that was the impression conveyed to me and some other Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are bound, of course, in this matter by certain provisions in the Constitution.  I do not know what was in the minds of those who signed the Treaty, whether additional money to the sum that had already been agreed upon should be allowed, or whether the salary attached to the official office should cover every expense.  Deputy Magennis has said that every other private establishment in the country <Col N="968" /> must provide for its own maintenance out of income.  This office seems to me to involve a considerable charge.  It has been said an example ought to be given to the country by the Executive Council showing that they wish to economise from the top and to share in the common lot.  There is no need at this hour of the day to urge the necessity of economy.  It is a national necessity.  I think it would be showing the right attitude and the correct one if the suggestions made about this Vote were adopted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of the debate that I would like to say a word on.  The Minister has pointed out that in the desire for economy in the future the occupant of this position should live, not in the Viceregal Lodge, but in what was formerly known as the Chief Secretary's Lodge. Visitors to other countries are much impressed by the Government buildings and the official residences provided for the occupants of an office such as that held here by the Governor-General.  In that respect we should try to create a good impression.  I would be exceedingly sorry if any effort were directed towards economy in this direction.  In my opinion it would be exceedingly false economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was pointed out on the Estimates that there are certain Departments which it is necessary to maintain for the upholding of the dignity of the State.  This is one of the buildings that would come within that category, and while it might seem a saving of a few thousand pounds a year to move the Governor-General from the building that he now occupies to the Chief Secretary's Lodge, I think that would have a very serious effect on the minds of visitors to this country.  In the end it would not be helpful to this State. There are expenses which are essential in connection with the unkeep of the dignity of the State, and this is one of them.  If the office is to be maintained I say it ought to be maintained with proper dignity.  We are anxious to attract visitors to the country.  When they come they will, naturally, call on the occupant of this office, and I think we should like to see him maintain <Col N="969" /> that position with the dignity associated with similar positions in other countries.</P>

      <P>It has been said from time to time that this is a drag on the country.  I am not at all of that opinion.  If this office is to be maintained, as was the intention when the Treaty was signed, then it should be maintained in such a way as to create a favourable impression on visitors from other countries.  Visitors attracted here spend considerable sums of money in this country and give a considerable amount of employment here.  We have had a good deal of talk on this point as to whether the attraction of visitors is desirable.  Notwithstanding what Deputies on the Labour benches may think, the view of those who have studied this problem is that it is a wise policy to attract visitors to this country.  I would like to see, in addition to the other tourists who come here, people who occupy high positions in other countries visiting this State.  They should be properly entertained on their visits and should be encouraged to spend money here.  I think that is the wise policy. While I will use every effort that one can to exert economies in other directions, I do not think it would be wise to have economy in this direction.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Good's main argument, but I would like to point out to him that the Chief Secretary's Lodge is a very handsome and beautiful residence, and that it would be no unworthy residence for the Governor-General.  I am doubtful, however, about the Minister's proposal from another point of view. It is possible that you might find some person who would lease the Chief Secretary's Lodge as a private residence, but I do not think you will find any private individual who would lease the Viceregal Lodge, based as it is on the assumption that there would be a large staff and a large number of visitors.  You might find it hard to get a wealthy person to relieve you of the burden of its upkeep.  If you instal the Governor-General in the Chief Secretary's <Col N="970" /> Lodge you will then have the Viceregal Lodge on your hands.  I do not think it has been suggested by anyone that it should be allowed to fall into ruin.  The burden of its upkeep will not come on this Vote but on the Board of Works Vote, and you will still have that charge, but there might be the possibility of making a profitable bargain for the State in regard to the Chief Secretary's Lodge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point made by Deputy Cooper.  I think there would be some difficulty in leasing the Viceregal Lodge.  With regard to some of the suggestions that have been put forward, whatever purpose it was used for it would be an expensive building. Certain economies have been effected in the matter of telephones and telegrams, and I believe that the decrease will be greater next year.  Some part of the economies effected did not come into operation until the beginning of this financial year, and this Estimate represents an expenditure at a higher rate than will be incurred during the latter part of the present year.  There are private wires to Government Buildings, 'phones at gate lodges and various things that make the telephone there somewhat expensive.  I do not think that Deputy Conlan fully appreciates the conclusion that would follow from his remarks, which would be that only rich men could ever have this office of Governor-General.</P>
      <P>If we got the position where in practice we were confined to rich men, then I do not think we could be at all sure of having the office filled in future by citizens of this State.  The Deputy should remember that the salary of £10,000 a year is not £10,000 to the Governor-General.  Income tax and super-tax amount to a very considerable reduction of that sum.</P>

      <P>Then the Governor-General has to attend all sorts of charitable and public functions, and his attendance at these functions is necessarily followed, I suppose, in almost all cases by subscriptions, great or small.  If you cut down the provision for the establishment unduly a poor man in that office would <Col N="971" /> find his position extremely difficult, if not impossible.</P>
      <P>There are other charges.  Deputies have spoken as if the only charges falling upon the occupant of the office were charges in relation to maintaining the house and entertaining a certain number of visitors of a certain standing to the country&mdash;entertaining foreigners who come here and whom the Government would like entertained.  There are also other inevitable expenses that the Governor-General cannot avoid.  I believe that a cheaper house would lead to an appreciable reduction in the cost of the office, but I do not think that the expenses under this Vote could be so very much reduced.  The reduction would occur in the expenses that fall under the Vote for public buildings.</P>
      <P>Some reduction could be made here so that possibly the number of staff required and the minor charges in connection with the house would be distinctly less.  When we asked the Governor-General to go to the Viceregal Lodge we had thought not merely of military defensibility but of what was politic, and I say again, apart from the consideration of the person holding office and the charges that fall upon him, I do not think it would be of any benefit for the Government to give way to a certain tendency that is in the country to be little the office by excessive reduction.  Some of the objects&mdash;I do not say it in reference to Deputy Johnson's amendment&mdash;of the calls outside for a reduction of the expenses of the Governor-General's establishment are actuated mainly, if not wholly, by a desire to hurt susceptibilties.</P>

    <P>We have got complete control of our affairs by the Treaty.  We undertook in the Treaty to pay the Governor-General a salary equivalent to the salary paid to the Governor-General in Australia, and we undertook to maintain a suitable establishment, having regard to the duties that fall on the Governor-General.  I do not think that we are doing more than that.  In so far as we are incurring an undue cost it is really simply that we have the Governor-General installed in an expensive house, and I believe that in these national bargains you must keep faith in the spirit of the agreement as well as <Col N="972" /> in the letter.  I believe that we are doing no more than that.  As regards the Governor-General's own preference in the matter, his desire always has been to go back to his own house.  The Government induced him to live in an official residence, as I think a Governor-General ought to, and they feel that they should not ask more of him or ask him to shift about from place to place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The question really resolves itself into what is suitable. As we have admitted, we are bound by a fixed salary of £10,000 and to provide for a suitable establishment, but in my view the determination of what is suitable should be with the Ministry here, and the Dáil in regard to the provision of funds, and its suitability to this country in every respect, political and social.  I think, therefore, that discretion should be exercised by the way of reducing this sum very considerably. I do not think the Irish delegates signed the Treaty on the understanding that the establishment should be of a kind which would suit a salary of £10,000 a year.  I think that suitability should be interpreted as meaning suitable for the conditions of this country.  I will confess that my feeling in this matter is prompted by the belief, which I had confirmed by Deputy Good to-day, that if we continue the retention of this establishment on this scale, and with a salary on the scale that is fixed, the social ideas embodied in Deputy Good's statement would become prevalent.  That is to say, we may economise in everything that affects expenditure&mdash;on old age pensions, feeding of school children, and even, perhaps, technical education &mdash;though I believe Deputy Good never thinks of that, for he believes technical education is of value and should be increased&mdash;anyhow, the suggestion is that there should be economy in every matter affecting the civil and social life of the common people, but that we should not think of economy when we are dealing with the possibilities of foreign potentates or aristocrats from other countries coming to join the social round with would-be aristocrats in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a tendency which I want to prevent developing, and it is because I <Col N="973" /> think that there is a danger of Deputy Good's idea being carried through that I am prompted to move in the direction I have done this year as in previous years.  I do not want to create that social division or, shall I say, to emphasise the social, the caste distinctions which might well develop and become very much more clearly marked in the future if Deputy Good's ideas were carried through, and have the maintenance of an establishment of this kind on the assumption that there is going to be a society.  We are going to prevent, if we can, the creation of this class distinction of social grades, which we sometimes realise have created certain cultures and advantages of a kind, but, unfortunately, all based on the degradation of those below.  If you raise the common people, then you may find the possibilities of the cultural development which the creation of those social grades has hitherto allowed.  But I really fear the ideas which Deputy Good gave eloquent expression to coming to practical working out in the Governor-General's establishment, and therefore I intend to test the House on this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson's amendment is to reduce the Vote by a sum of £3,000, and on that he is building a big structure that is not warranted by the sum of £3,000.  Deputy Johnson, I think, would be logical in his arguments if he said there is no occasion for the Governor-General's establishment at all, and that the expenditure on the establishment and its upkeep was not justified.  Of course Deputy Johnson attaches to his amendment the usual arguments.  But I say the problem which he puts before the House is one which the country itself will have to decide in its own interests, and I think the country would say that at the present time we are at too early a stage in education, politically and socially, to be able to form a just appreciation of the importance or otherwise that people are going to attach to what is known as the social side of things.  The Governor-General is, of course, a figure-head, and represents all classes in the country.  I do not think the Governor-General's establishment is inclined to lower the <Col N="974" /> status, but rather to raise the people of the country.</P>
      <P>As a figure-head I think he must be required to express the feelings of dignity that the country may have or develop and, in that direction as I say, the country, as a whole, will have to decide these matters.  In the meantime I join with Deputy Good in deprecating that the position should become one whereby the status of the Governor-General would inferentially be lowered until such time as the question has been fully developed and considered by the country.  Undoubtedly the transfer of the Governor-General from the Viceregal Lodge to the Under-Secretary's or Chief Secretary's Lodge would save in running expenses, but would it save materially anything to the country under the argument as put forward by Deputy Bryan Cooper?  I think not. I think the saving in small details would be more than absorbed by the loss of having the Viceregal Lodge untenanted and going into disrepair.  I think infinitely more the step will be in the direction of the country deciding that the institution that has been set up to accommodate the Governor-General is one which is unnecessary. In looking to the possible growth of importance, in industry, culture and wealth that the country is asked to look forward to, I think it is a mistake to lower the whole ideas that were prevalent when the Governor-General was asked to undertake office and reside in the Viceregal Lodge.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat does not, I fear, appreciate the fact that Deputy Johnson's amendment refers to the allowances towards the expenses of the Governor-General. If Deputy Hewat will look at page 2 in the book of Estimates he will see under sub-head B: &ldquo;Allowance to Governor-General for expenses, provision for the maintenance of the official residence and establishment of the Governor-General&mdash;£3,000.&rdquo; If Deputy Hewat will turn back to page 1 he will find a reference to Estimate 11 where £9,360 are provided under the heading of official residence, furniture and the rest.  Deputy Hewat is replying to a case that he did not hear made.  Naturally he finds himself in difficulties notwithstanding <Col N="975" /> his unmeasured abilities. He has given a different account of the position in the State and the functions of the Governor-General from those which were more correctly given by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I wonder where Deputy Hewat discovered that the Governor-General is a figure-head to represent all classes in the State.  In Canada, which is one of the co-equal members of the Commonwealth, the King, as head of the Commonwealth, is referred to officially as King in Canada, and there is a Governor-General there to represent the King, and as the Minister for Finance said to-day, the Governor-General here represents the Crown that is referred in the Articles of the Constitution in respect to the constitution of the executive authority.  Consequently this pleasing fiction with which Deputy Hewat indulges himself has no foundation. He is thinking of the Viceregal days and wants the junketings and the aldermanic feastings restored, and he and the other of the twin brethren, Deputy Good, believe all those expenses will attract hordes of tourists to our shores.  Does he mean, I wonder, that these things will be advertised, a spectacle like Barnum's great show or somebody's circus, and that the railways of other countries will run cheap excursions to behold those glories?</P>

      <P>I am referring, in regard to tourists, to Deputy Good's speech.  I am sorry if I did not make that sufficiently clear to Deputy Hewat.  Our policy, as nationalists, is to uphold the citizens' side in the Constitution.  It is idle to pretend we are ignoring the culture and the civilisation of the people as something to be developed and, as developed, to be prized.  That is one of the figments of the organ that represents officially the Party to which the two Deputies belong.  Readers of it this morning will understand my allusion. The moneys voted here are not to develop Irish civilisation.  Consequently no defence can be entered of them on that ground.  It is merely <Col N="976" /> under the Treaty to carry out our Treaty obligations which provide, in addition to the salary, an appropriate residence for the Governor-General, and really the only practical question in that connection is the question totally ignored by the two Deputies, namely, how much expenditure will suffice to provide an appropriate house with the further sub-question of whether it would not be advisable, in view of the special stress economically which every member of the community is feeling, that the Governor-General should defray out of his £10,000 official salary some of these domestic expenses provided for here out of a State grant. That was really the question, but Deputy Johnson's proposal is to put it as I have put it in other connections, to cut our coat according to our cloth. We are not trying to lower as some or other of the two Deputies&mdash;I always, unfortunately, without meaning any disrespect to them, find a difficulty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very good, I will put it this way then.  The chief representative of the business party has stated or alleged that it is lowering the status.  How can a desire to conserve the finances of the country be described fairly as an attempt to lower somebody's status?  I did say I seek to elevate the status rather of the position of President of the Executive Council. I am not making any secret of it at all that the political angle from which I view this is wholly different from the political angle from which the business party view it.  Viewing it from the national standpoint, I deprecate anything that would lower the status and dignity of the high office of President of the Council, but I do not see why we should do anything more than we are obliged to do by way of fulfilment of a contract in regard to Treaty obligations.  It is the business of the Executive Council, as soon as may be, to reduce this annual expenditure by a transfer of the household to a less expensive location.</P>

      <P>Deputy Magennis criticised this Vote in rather caustic terms.  This is the first time that I have ever heard him criticise it, and I should <Col N="977" /> think that he was under the same obligation in previous years when this Vote came up to criticise it.  I think it is only fair to the Governor-General, who is part of the Constitution&mdash;the Constitution we all accepted&mdash;that it should be said that the expenses of his position are very considerable.  He is the only person&mdash;perhaps through our generosity&mdash;who can entertain learned societies when they visit this country. There are many learned societies that would visit Dublin, but we find when it comes to adopting the usual entertainments of other countries we have not them provided here, partly because we have not very many wealthy citizens. We have to fall back on the Governor-General to entertain these people when they visit our shores.  I would be for leaving the full amount of money as it is, because I think it is desirable, in the interests of this country, from a national point of view, that we should have an official social entertainer.  An official social entertainer is necessary in this country, as we have no very rich people now resident amongst us.  If we do away with the office of the Governor-General and if we cut down our President's salary we will be in the position that when anybody comes to visit our shores we cannot extend the hospitality that is extended by other countries.</P>

      <P>May I say that Deputy Hennessy is under a complete misapprehension in supposing that this is the first time that I have had the audacity to criticise what he recommends.  In the Provisional Parliament I objected to the title &ldquo;Governor-General,&rdquo; to begin with. I objected altogether to paying more than the Treaty obligation required. I have to-day, as then, and as on a subsequent occasion, stated the case as fairly as I could.  We cannot have it <Col N="978" /> both ways&mdash;to have the position that the Treaty gives us and also to go without paying the price.  Since we must pay the price we have to endure it. Deputy Hennessy probably did not hear me making that statement.  I am confining myself exclusively to the lopping off of charges upon the public purse so far as is consonant with our Treaty obligations.  There is nothing at all, I claim, inconsistent, either in my attitude, or in any utterance I have made to-day, with what I have said or how I have said it, from the very beginning.</P>

      <P>On sub-head A, I would like to extract a little information. Apart from the controller of the household, who, I presume, is in general command of the household arrangements and whose salary is £600 inclusive&mdash;possibly he is living upon the household&mdash;and apart from the chaplain, £250, and the medical attendant, £100, there are a private secretary, £350; an assistant private secretary, £350; a clerical assistant, £215; a clerk and a typist.  I assume that the clerical staff mentioned there is occupied in the official work of the Governor-General, but there are, in addition, two A.D.C.'s receiving £350 and £300 respectively in addition to their substantive pay, borne on the Army Vote.  I think it was explained that the duties of the A.D.C.'s were to travel with the Governor-General when required, but what other duties are involved I do not know.  I would like to have some information as to what the duties are other than accompanying the Governor-General on his travels, and what the salary is including that which is borne on the Army Vote.  Perhaps the Minister could give us that information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That raises another question.  The rank of colonel carries with it a salary which is deemed to be sufficient for that rank, but if we appoint an officer of the rank of colonel to act as A.D.C. and allow an additional £350 to him, it makes the position of the colonel who happens to be the choice for this office one of very great value.  I cannot see the justification for drawing pay for these Army officers from the Army Vote and paying an additional £350 and £300 inclusive. On would think that the duties of A.D.C. to the Governor-General would be such as would require officers of experience, indicated by a higher rank than that of colonel, and that the salary of that office in the Army with, perhaps, some small additional allowance to meet what might be losses of another kind, would be sufficient, but I do not see the justification for taking a colonel and an officer of a rank less than colonel out of the Army, appointing them to the office of A.D.C. to the Governor-General and allowing them £350 and £300 respectively as additional pay.  Can it be said that the duties are more important than those of a colonel or higher officer <Col N="981" /> in the Army; an officer who would be receiving in the Army a colonel's pay plus £350?  I think it very unlikely, and it must be borne in mind that a sum of £350 is allowed as a travelling and subsistence allowance for the officers of the household, so that the travelling expenses are not to be borne out of the £350 salary.  It seems to me that the cost of A.D.C.'s is entirely excessive for the duties required.  We cannot say what the exact cost is because the Minister is not able to tell us what rank they hold in the Army and therefore what their pay is in the Army, but as additional allowances I make the protest that these sums of £350 and £300 respectively are too great.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not because the duties are more important, but because they are more costly, that the allowances are made.  Certain allowances were fixed when the A.D.C.'s were first appointed.  Those were fixed after some examination of the possible <Col N="982" /> charges, but since then the matter has been reviewed and the view is still taken that the duties these officers have, and the contacts they make, do involve them in personal expenditure, and that expenditure is not of a type that could be vouched and reclaimed. It would not be the type of expenditure that would be repaid on presentation of vouchers, and it does reach a fairly substantial figure.  It is one of those matters that perhaps we could not permanently fix for some time yet. We might not be able to say that this is the figure which for all time, without question, would be the exact figure required, but so far as it has been investigated up to the present, it is felt that some such figure as this is a reasonable figure and does not place the officer who is in the position of A.D.C. to the Governor-General in any substantially better position than an officer of the same rank who is serving in the Army.</P>

It was revised downwards from the original figure when a supplementary estimate was required to provide for the grant-in-aid of the Joint House Committee and the extra grant to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  The sums required then were found by saving, with the exception of about £10, which was found by means of a supplementary estimate.  The result was that the original provision under sub-head (a) was written down and the revised figure is here given for the purpose of comparison.  There are reductions in the travelling expenses of Teachtaí and Seanadoirí.  Those reductions are based upon last year's figures.  I do not think there are any other features of the Estimate to which it is necessary to refer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he would inform the House and, through the House, the public, as to the position with regard to travelling expenses?  I think it is within his knowledge that there have been suggestions made about revision of the terms and a consequent cheapening, though extension, of the facilities for travelling.  There is a great deal of misunderstanding with regard to this matter, and I should like the opportunity to be taken to remove some of these misapprehensions.  I can speak in this way, because travelling expenses never come my way.  I think it <Col N="984" /> might be well if I made a statement with a view to getting the Minister to amplify it.  While there is provision made for travelling expenses, it is very rigidly confined to travelling expenses to the constituency of the member, when he is attending to duties connected with his membership of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The question that I asked at the beginning had reference to the suggestion to extend the area of travelling facilities while reducing the cost per journey, that is to say, making third-class journeys possible.  It has been explained that that would require an alteration in the Act affecting this question of travelling expenses.  The chief reason I desire to speak on this matter is to remove what is a very general view&mdash;that Deputies may travel anywhere, at any time, on any business at the expense of the State&mdash; which, of course, every Deputy knows is entirely false.  Unfortunately, the public have an entirely wrong view on this question of travelling expenses and are unaware that travelling expenses are rigidly confined to the official journeys of Deputies attending to their duties here.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I am strictly in order or not, but I would like to draw the Minister's attention to a matter that has been discussed pretty extensively in the part of the country from which I come. This matter arises out of a report made by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and statements have been made by responsible people in regard to alleged payments to Dáil organisers out of public funds.  I am quite satisfied that these statements are groundless, but they have been made the basis of wholesale charges of corruption and jobbery.  I should like the Minister to clear up the position, so that people who are likely to be deluded by statements of this kind will be made aware of the truth of the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the point raised by Deputy Johnson, certain proposals for a change in regard to the arrangement for travelling expenses are at present before my Department, and are being considered.  The present arrangement is that a Deputy <Col N="985" /> must obtain a voucher for each journey between his constituency and Dublin. In certain cases that causes inconvenience to Deputies, and sometimes it is difficult for them, if they decide suddenly on travelling, to obtain a voucher in time.  There is also the trouble of claiming repayment.  It was at one time suggested that an attempt should be made to arrange with the railway companies to issue season tickets to Deputies.  That was explored, and it was found that it would be more expensive to the State than the present arrangement, and that it presented other difficulties.</P>
      <P>Another arrangement suggested was that third, instead of first, class travelling vouchers should be given.  That also is receiving consideration.  I do not think that I need express any opinion upon it at the moment.  When it has been explored as well as it can be, the view of my department will be submitted through the Ceann Comhairle to the proper committee, and through it to the Dáil for further examination. It should be perfectly clear to members of the public that the payment of travelling expenses for members of the Dáil is very rigidly regulated, and is strictly confined to travelling between the constituencies and the metropolis.  Deputy Tadhg O Murchadha raised a point about ex-Dáil organisers.  I thought that that was one of the points which the Minister for Agriculture referred to the other day when criticising a certain maker of speeches in the country.  I do not know exactly what to say about it.  I scarcely know to what the allegations refer. To the best of my knowledge, the rumours were set afoot by the fact that under the old Dáil there were certain organisers in connection with certain Irish classes.  These organisers were taken over, like other old Dáil servants, by the Saorstát Government.  There was some delay in re-grading and assimilating them into the ordinary civil service classes, and they were continued on the same rate of pay by the Saorstát Government.  I do not know how anything about them arises on this Vote &mdash;in fact, I know nothing directly about them.</P>

      <P>Some speeches have been made in the country advocating economy.  The Deputy who made those speeches is present in the Dáil now. He was so kind to his constituents as to look for a cut all round in salaries, and he declared that he would look for a ten per cent. cut.  That would apply also to Deputies and Senators.  If the Deputy who made those speeches is now prepared to fulfil his promise, this is the place for him.  I have spoken in the country on the subject of economy. I have been challenged here to forfeit my salary, and I am quite prepared to do it if other Deputies do the same.</P>

      <P>Probably if it was the challenge would not be made so freely. As regards the question of travelling expenses and the manner in which Deputies are treated, I do not think Deputies are treated at all in a proper manner.  If you go to the office here you get a voucher.  Then you rush to the station and you may have to wait, perhaps, five minutes before you get a ticket and in the meantime you very often lose your train.  Very often you cannot get a ticket.  Surely some facilities should be given by having season tickets.  Last year the Minister for Finance promised to consider the question of facilitating Deputies by getting in touch with the railway companies.</P>

      <P>If that was done, we are still in the same position.  It will <Col N="987" /> hardly be worth while to do it now as we will have an election next year.  In the country a good deal has been said with regard to the travelling expenses of Deputies.  I agree with Deputy Johnson and Deputy Murphy that there has been a good deal of mud thrown in regard to that question.  It is said that Deputies get vouchers every time they are going on business to their constituents.  We are supposed also to get hotel expenses, and it is said that Deputies who sit on committees are paid expenses incurred by sitting on them.  I would like the Minister to do something in regard to these travelling facilities, even to speak to the people in the railway offices in order that, when vouchers are submitted, tickets will be given immediately in exchange so that we will not be kept waiting for our trains as I have been on a few occasions.</P>

      <P>As regards the avenue suggested, I am not concerned as I receive no travelling expenses because I do not incur them in attending here.  I hope, however, that any committee to which the suggestion is referred will turn it down.  I do not believe that men travel first-class out of snobbery but simply for comfort. Deputies travelling long distances from distant parts of Ireland should, I think, get opportunities for travelling under <Col N="988" /> the most comfortable conditions possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps further opportunity may be given to make clear that point which Deputy Lyons has made, namely, that service on committees does not mean any further expense. No member of a committee of any kind, so far as I know, receives any additional allowance by virtue of his service on a committee.  As Deputy Lyons has said, that is another very widely spread misapprehension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The allowance that Deputies receive for hotel and other expenses is £360 a year.  If they attend committees, and if they incur additional expense by attending committees, as many Deputies do, they suffer, and whatever extra cost is entailed is borne by themselves.  I do not know whether we could do anything to facilitate Deputy Lyons and prevent him missing his train.  Perhaps we should try to get some sort of a clock or watch for his benefit.  With regard to his statement about the allowance to Deputies, of course, that is a statutory allowance and does not arise properly on the present Estimate.  But it is a sum that no more than meets the cost that falls upon Deputies by reason of their attendance here in the Dáil. The people who may benefit because of that sum are people who do not attend. I have seen it seriously suggested that Deputies should be deprived of their allowance if they do not attend.  My view is that the people who do not attend would be of no benefit in this House if they did attend.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to elaborate what he means by <Col N="989" /> providing travelling facilities in connection with third class.  Is the suggestion made that travelling facilities should be extended beyond coming to attend this House and going back again, or is it to be something in the line of economy that is going to save the House money?  We had a long criticism of the last Vote.  We do not seem to have much to say about this Vote, which is a total expenditure of £82,240.  It seems to me that if there is any claim made on behalf of any members of this House to increase facilities or benefits it ought to be widely known as to what it is that is being put forward.  Deputy Lyons complained about having missed his train.  He did not tell us whether it was at this end or at the other end; if he had told us it might have influence on us in considering his case sympathetically. Although I should not speak upon the subject because, like Deputy Doctor Hennessy, I never have occasion to get money for travelling expenses, it seems to me that if Deputies get the allowance necessary to pay their fares according to the constitutional regulation, this is not the time, at all events, that an application should be made to increase those facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no intention of that.  Really, it is a matter that perhaps is not ripe for discussion in this House.  Discussions have arisen from time to time in the Committee of Procedure and Privileges in regard to travelling facilities, and in regard to the manner in which these facilities were regulated.  Various suggestions have been made, one being that instead of the coupon system there might be one of season tickets.  That was turned down because it would be more expensive.  It was also suggested that it might be worth while considering that instead of giving first-class travelling facilities to a Deputy between his constituency and Dublin it might be better to give only third-class facilities but in addition to give the Deputy facilities in travelling through his constituency. That was merely a question put up for discussion, and it was referred to the Department of Finance for examination, in order that the observations of the Department of Finance <Col N="990" /> might be forwarded to the Committee. It was merely a tentative proposal. Nothing at all may come of it, and certainly it is not a proposal that has reached a stage where any discussion here is necessary or called for.</P>

      <P>As so much has been said on this point I should like to say that I hope in considering the matter of travelling it will be considered entirely from the point of view of how the work of the Oireachtas can best be done by providing travelling facilities. If it can be done by additional expenditure on travelling, then that additional expenditure on travelling should not be avoided.  I think it would be absurd if, after three or four years' experience of the work here, in reviewing the expenditure on travelling we reviewed it from the point of view of expenditure rather than from the point of view of the efficiency of the working of the House and the convenience of Deputies. As one who represents a city constituency and am not bothered with travelling, from what I have seen of constituencies and the various matters that have to be attended to in the country, I think that Deputies who represent large constituencies should have all the assistance that can be given to them to enable them to keep in touch with their constituents and to discharge their duty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Vote is still for a substantial sum, but it is a lesser sum considerably than was required last year.  The expenses in our case perhaps have been high in this matter because we were starting afresh and many matters had to be investigated that would not need to be in older establishments. Some of the Commissions were Commissions arising from the organising and setting up of the State.  For instance, the Dáil Eireann Winding-up Commission, which was a Judicial Commission, and the Boundary Bureau. The Banking Commission is a new one which has been sitting for some months now and is nearing the end of its labours.  The work of the Board of Assessors under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, will continue for some time into this year, but I think that before the end of the present financial year the work will certainly be completed.  The Central Savings Committee is one which is classed amongst the temporary Commissions, but is a committee that will have some permanency.  It certainly will continue until the habit of investing in savings certificates has become more widespread and more firmly established than it is at the present time.  A token figure is put in in connection with the <Col N="992" /> Civil Service Compensation Committee, because it cannot operate until the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Wigg v. Cochrane case has been delivered. The Gaelteacht Committee has practically concluded its work.</P>

    <P>In connection with the Ports and Harbours Tribunal a good deal of travelling will be involved in the work of that particular body, and the expenses will be fairly considerable.  The other Commissions listed in part have ceased to operate.</P>

      <P>I would like to know whether any member of the Board of Assessors is drawing a salary from the Oireachtas as well as being paid as a member of the Board.  I have nothing <Col N="993" /> whatever to say against the Board of Assessors for the work they have done and they certainly must have a very hard and strenuous time.  The Board had about 22,000 applications for pensions before them.  They succeeded in getting through about 17,000 cases, 15,000 of which were rejected.  With all due respect to the Board of Assessors, I do not think they are giving favourable consideration to the claims of men who are entitled to pensions under the Army Service Pensions Act of 1924.  If an applicant can succeed in getting three men to fill up the necessary forms, and if what these men, who may be living twenty miles apart, state agrees, a pension is granted by the Board.  If a man who is really entitled to a pension for active service and who was in the movement since 1916 is not able to do that, or if the forms that he gets filled up do not agree, the application is turned down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that the Board of Assessors have worked hard, but I think that they should take it for granted that the claim is a genuine one where three forms are filled up and where the statements of those who fill them agree. There is a payment of £4,549 for salaries and wages, and £1,325 for travelling expenses.  That is a very nice sum for the Board; simply to turn down a great many genuine applications. I have written letters to the Board of Assessors about cases.  I will not sign any more forms, because the signature of a Deputy is turned down, while the signature of a man who would not be elected to a district council is accepted.  I would like to hear more information as to the work that has been done.  Admittedly the Board has examined 17,000 applications, but the secretary has to do that work. The other members of the Board simply sit in chairs at the meeting and, it has been alleged, and I think it cannot be contradicted, that, in some cases, when men went before the Board only the secretary and one member were present. Applications were turned down because the members of the Board were not present.  Members of the Board cannot be doing two or three duties. That is the reason I am asking if they are in receipt of a salary from other Oireachtas Funds, as well as a salary <Col N="994" /> from the Board of Assessors.  I do not see any payment in the Estimate for the Chairman.  He must be a patriot, acting on the Board for love of the work.  I would like to know if any money is included in any other Vote to cover the further expenses that might be incurred by this Board.</P>
    <P>I am criticising the work of the Board particularly for turning down genuine claims, and for giving pensions to men who are not entitled to them.  That can be proved beyond doubt.  When the Board has finished its work it will be proved that a large number of men are in receipt of pensions to which they were not entitled, while at the same time the claims of men who were entitled to pensions were turned down.  When the Military Service Pensions Act was passed it was never expected that some men who have got pensions would get them. There is too much red-tape attached to the working of the Act.  An applicant would want to have some friends to work influence for him before he could succeed in getting a pension.</P>

      <P>He is a judge.  Very often Deputy Lyons is not quite clear in what he says.  Does he really mean improper influences are used on this Board and that they grant <Col N="995" /> public money under improper influences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>What I do mean is this: that where a genuine application has been submitted to the Board of Assessors that application has been turned down.  I used the word &ldquo;influence.&rdquo; If you are fortunate enough to be able to get twenty or thirty Deputies, or prominent men in the Saorstát, to write letters for you saying that they knew you did this, that, and the other thing, you will have a chance of getting a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I must protest against this.  This Board of Assessors is part of my Department, and I must protest against accusations of that kind being flung at them here.  No amount of letter-writing or anything else will get any man a pension who is not entitled to it, no matter who he is.  A man must prove his case, bring up his witnesses and have it proved on oath, and he must give his own evidence on oath.  If Deputy Lyons thinks that he can influence the Board to give certain decisions by anything he says here I say that he is in the wrong shop.  The Board has done its duty, and it is an onerous duty, to my satisfaction, and, as far as I know, the duty that they have to perform is not the kind that many Deputies would undertake. I want to be fair to the Board, and only fair to them, and it is not fair that a Deputy should stand up here and say that these men are susceptible to influences, no matter from what quarter they may come.  That is not a statement that should be made, and I think the Deputy should withdraw it, and withdraw it unreservedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if the members of the Board were present when these claims were under consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is going a step further now.  He is getting on to a different point.  The Deputy does not always appreciate the meaning of the words he uses.  He means applications which the applicants themselves consider genuine, but it is the members of the Board who decide <Col N="996" /> whether an application is in fact genuine.  What he means by saying that genuine applications had been turned down is that people have made what they consider to be genuine applications, and the Board has turned them down.  He ought to respond to the Minister's request as to whether he does or does not withdraw the statement that undue influence is used on the Board, and that the Board yields to it.  The question of who is present at the Board meetings does not arise at all here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean to accuse the Board of Assessors of acting under influence so far as to grant pensions to people who are not entitled to them.  But I do maintain that pensions have been given to men who are not entitled to them, and whether the Board of Assessors have been led astray or not is their mistake, and not mine. But as soon as the Board has finished its work I will prove it in this House, and will give the names of persons in receipt of pensions who are not entitled to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not do it now? I challenged you before on that point, and you said you would give it to me privately, but you have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I challenged the Minister and he would not reply.  I asked him why did the Board stand so loyally to the words, &ldquo;active service.&rdquo;  The Minister has travelled from the top of the bush right down to the very root, but he forgot to come to the centre. That was the very question I wanted a reply to.  Now I am told by the Minister that if I put forward the names here of course the pensions will be stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I will inquire into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>If you inquire into it you will find what I am stating is correct. I can give you several cases where the full Board of Assessors was not present when the applicant went before the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>This thing has been under discussion before, and I explained that in every case where a pension is granted the full Board is present. <Col N="997" /> The chairman and the secretary of the board take evidence, and make minutes of the evidence.  That is afterwards submitted to the full board when it meets, and it is only the full board that has power to grant a pension to anybody.  The chairman and the secretary do not grant pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that the chairman and the secretary do not grant pensions.  I am quite satisfied that the secretary has done and is doing three men's work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>He ought; he ought to be in the Transport Union.  What I do say is that we are asked to vote practically £6,000 for the salaries and expenses of this board.  I want the Minister for Finance to reply to one question only: Are the Board of Assessors drawing salaries from the Oireachtas as well as the salaries and expenses under this head?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of the Board of Assessors are drawing no salaries as members of that Board. The Chairman of the Board is a District Justice and has his salary as District Justice.  He also has an allowance of £300 a year.  That allowance is only paid on condition that the payment of the locomotion allowance of £200 yearly to which he would be entitled in his district is suspended, and furthermore that when he travels outside Dublin he shall not be paid subsistence allowance.  The £300 is to cover subsistence.  He has with the secretary been in many districts in the country, and during the time he was out he was paid nothing but rail travelling expenses.  That is the only thing in the nature of a salary or allowance paid to any member of the Board.</P>
