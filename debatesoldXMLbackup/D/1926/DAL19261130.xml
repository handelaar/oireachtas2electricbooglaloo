      <P>The Executive Council proposes to circulate as a White Paper at an early date the report of the Imperial Conference.  The Minister for External Affairs will make a statement next week on the work of the Imperial Conference generally and on the work of the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee in particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the President if the Minister will, in his statement, devote some attention to explaining what share, if any, of responsibility for British foreign policy and British military and naval policy is borne by the Saorstát Government, and whether, to take a concrete illustration, the Executive Council accepts any responsibility for British policy in China or for any contemplated military action in that country, apart from the action that may be taken under the Covenant of the League of Nations, and, if so, which Minister will answer to the Dáil?</P>

      <P>The legislation referred to was introduced in consequence of recommendations made by the Council set up by the British Government to investigate food prices.

      <P>asked the President if he has given consideration to the advisability of dealing by means of legislation with the retail sale of merchandise, with a view to securing that food products of foreign origin are not sold as Irish produce; if he is <Col N="319" /> aware that statements were made by witnesses before the Food Prices Tribunal that bacon of Chinese origin is being sold in shops in the Saorstát as Irish bacon, and if in these circumstances he is prepared to take measures to protect the interests of the home producers as well as those of the consumers by introducing a Merchandise Marks Act at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN (replying)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the answer given on the 24th instant in reply to a question by Deputy Byrne, in which it was stated that amendments of the existing Merchandise Marks Act were in contemplation, but that legislation limited to a particular commodity, or class of commodities, would not be desirable.  Among other points which require careful examination is the question of the methods by which it would be possible to procure the marking of many food products.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the answer, I maintain that my question is a general question.  The question put by Deputy A. Byrne dealt with particular items.  The answer of the Minister does not really cover my question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was as to whether the Minister had given consideration to the advisability of dealing, by means of legislation, with the retail sale of merchandise, so that food products of foreign origin might not be sold as Irish commodities in the Free State.  Does he intend to introduce a Merchandise Marks Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHN GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will furnish a return showing the number of cases awaiting trial in the Dublin Circuit Courts (up to say the 1st November last); whether he will state how many of these cases have been over three months awaiting trial and how many over six months; whether he will also state the number of appeals from the Circuit Courts awaiting decision in the High Court on the 1st of November last, and how many of these have been over three months and how many over six months awaiting hearing.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of civil cases awaiting trial in the Dublin Circuit Court on the 1st November last was 352.  Of these, the number awaiting trial for over three months was 98.  The remaining 254 cases were entered for the Sessions that opened on the 1st October, 1926, and I am advised that the oldest undisposed cases were entered for the June Sessions, and that consequently there are no cases which have been awaiting trial for over six months.</P>
      <P>The number of appeals from the Circuit Court awaiting hearing in the High Court on the 1st November last was 603.  Of these, 558 cases have been over three months and 277 cases over six months awaiting hearing.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state why a claim to unemployment benefit made by J.J. O'Sullivan, East Ballinakilla, Bere Island, Co. Cork, has been refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>James J. O'Sullivan, of East Ballinakilla, Bere Island, received unemployment benefit to the amount of £17 5s. in respect of claims made by him on the 22nd February, 1924; 29th August, 1924; 22nd November, 1924; and 2nd December, 1925. Subsequent investigation, however, showed that the conditions for the receipt of benefit were not fulfilled in the case of Mr. O'Sullivan while he was in receipt of this benefit, and the claims were accordingly disallowed by the Insurance Officer on the grounds that the claimant was not unemployed and not unable to obtain suitable employment. Mr. O'Sullivan appealed against the decision, which, however, was confirmed by the Umpire, as already explained to the Deputy in correspondence with the Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the proprietors of MacDonnell's Margarine Factory, Waterford, proposed to close the factory, but on representations being made on behalf of the workers and public of Waterford, agreed to keep the factory running until the end of the year, pending the decision of the Tariff Commission on their application for an import duty on margarine; whether in view of the announcement that the Commission has not yet been formed, he can make any statement which will encourage the proprietors to continue the factory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If the proprietors of this factory are unwilling to continue it unless an import duty is imposed on margarine I am unable to make any statement which would either encourage or discourage them. My Department has undertaken to do its best to secure an early hearing before the Tariff Commission of the application to be made by the margarine industry but a decision on that application rests, not with the Tariff Commission as assumed in the question, but with the Dáil, and I am unable to make any forecast of the Dáil's decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As to how soon it will get to work, I cannot give any forecast.  As to the setting up of the Tariff Commission, the Minister for Finance stated here the other day that the delay was due to the fact that I had not been able to make any appointment. I have recently been enabled to make that appointment, and the Tariff Commission, consisting of Mr. J.J. McElligott, Department of Finance; Dr. Hinchcliff, of the Department of Agriculture; and Professor Whelehan, Controller of the Stationery Office, will be in a position to make arrangements with regard to its sittings and procedure immediately.</P>

      <P>After a further examination of our position with reference to the Court of International Justice it was decided that as the ratification of the late United Kingdom covered the Irish Free State, and as we could be held to be bound by it, the League should be notified that we wished to be placed on the list of States that had accepted the statute.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Hughes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is in course of preparation.  A rough draft had been made and it was found when the draftsman was finished with it that it was not in conformity with the opinions of myself and my advisers, so that it is necessary for the Committee to re-assemble again and go into the matter.  I regret the delay in this matter, but it is unavoidable.  The Bill is rather contentious and will take a good deal of preparation before it can be brought up for Second Reading. I do hope, however, to be able to take the Second Reading on December 16th. I wish further to say that it is possible I may have to ask for leave to withdraw the present Bill and substitute a new one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to make that suggestion myself.  The whole procedure seems to me to be disorderly. Leave was given to introduce a Bill. Presumably the Bill had been submitted and evidence at least given that it was a serious attempt at legislation, and, therefore, a First Reading was conceded.  But the Bill, apparently, does not exist and I would urge as a matter of procedure and order that the Bill ought to be withdrawn until the new Bill is ready.</P>

      <P>As I said, this Bill requires a good deal of thinking out. On the face of it it looks to be a very simple matter, but when the law officers and draftsman came to frame it as sections of an Act of Parliament they found considerable difficulty.  That is the only reason why the Bill is not being taken to-day.  As a matter of fact, the Committee considering it are sitting at the moment in the House, and I hope that there will not be any further delay about it.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The heads of the Bill were got ready and the Bill was introduced before the adjournment in order that it might be taken as first business when the Dáil re-assembled. The holiday period intervened and the draftsman had other work to do, and it was not possible to have the Bill ready at the time.  The Bill was introduced in what might be called dummy form and the draftsman prepared <Col N="331" /> the long title.

One of the sentences in that letter reads: &ldquo;The position for registered nurses is very serious, as it is a requirement in countries outside the Free State that a nurse claiming to be registered should be able to produce a badge in order to substantiate her claim.&rdquo;  They are not able to provide badges at the present time and will not be until this Bill is passed.

      <P>I beg to move Amendment 1.  To insert before Section 5 a new section as follows, viz.:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person residing within a coroner's district shall be liable to serve on the jury at any inquest held in that district whether he is or is not a householder, and whether he is or is not rated to the relief of the poor, save only such persons as are for the time being, for some reason other than lack of rateable qualifications, <Col N="333" /> not liable to, or disqualified for, or exempted from service on juries in the Courts of Justice.</P>
    <P>The explanation of this proposed new section is that in the past the qualification for a juryman under the Act of 1846 was a poor law valuation of £4.  If a sufficient number of such persons was not forthcoming, the police could summon any householder in the county.  Persons exempt from ordinary jury service were also exempt from service on coroners' juries.  The effect of the amendment is to recognise the actual facts of the situation, which are, and I think have always been, that the police frequently summon the first available man, and do not inquire whether he is or not a householder, or whether he is or not rated for the relief of the poor in £4. We propose to continue the exemption of persons such as barristers, doctors, people under twenty-one and over sixty-five, who are exempted from ordinary jury service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The sub-section at present in the Bill means that coroners shall continue to be elected as heretofore, save that the Minister for Justice is to have a veto. The new proposal is that instead of the Minister's veto, the machinery of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, shall apply. That Act applies automatically to every office and employment under a local authority, the qualifications for which are wholly or in part professional or technical.  So that it might well be argued that if nothing were expressly enacted in this Bill on the <Col N="337" /> point the machinery of the Act would apply to the appointment of a coroner, the position being one for which professional qualifications, medical or legal, are required.</P>

      <P>At present, under various Statutes and Orders, which were kept alive by the Act of 1898, the whole of the County Tipperary is one county for coroners' purposes.  That arrangement has proved unsatisfactory.  As an example of that, I may mention that there is one district partly in the North Riding and partly in the South Riding.  The coroner for that district died in 1924. The county councils failed to agree as to a successor, and finally the North Riding appointed a coroner for its part of the district, and the South Riding part remained, and still remains, vacant.  We, in fact, are simply completing the separation which the two Ridings themselves have effected, <i>de facto.</i></P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  This is only a short, temporary Bill, following on the same lines as the Bill of last year or the previous year.  Provision for the cost <Col N="341" /> of medical certification was made in the Vote for the National Health Insurance Commission until the 31st December, 1923, the last year the item was included in the Estimates being the year 1923-24.  A Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance and Medical Services was appointed in May, 1924, to consider, inter alia, whether it is desirable to institute a system of medical treatment on a contributory basis and if so to advise as to the form that such system should take.  As there seemed to be a possibility that medical benefit either under the Health Insurance Acts or otherwise, might be introduced as a result of the Committee's inquiry and that the necessity for separate provision for medical certification would consequently disappear, it was arranged to find the money for the year, 1924, as a temporary measure, out of insurance funds.  This was effected by the National Health Insurance Act, 1924. The issue of the final report of the Committee of Inquiry has been unavoidably delayed and it became necessary to make similar provision for 1925, which was done by the National Health Insurance Act, 1925.</P>
      <P>It is now desired to make provision for the year 1926.  The money is to be found in precisely the same way as in 1925, i.e., debits of the same amount as are laid down in the 1925 Act are again to be made against Approved Societies, the Military Forces (International Arrangements) Insurance Fund, the Deposit Contributors Fund and the Exempt Persons Fund, and the sums so realised are to be carried to medical certification and second medical opinions for 1926 will be made out of that fund and any deficiency will be met by transferring the necessary sum from the Unclaimed Stamps Account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 27 of the National Health Act, 1923, was continued in force until the 31st December, 1925, by Section 6 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1924.  The Minister for Finance has agreed that the provision made in those Sections may now be continued until the 31st December, 1926.  The object of the clause is to provide money out of sums unclaimed <Col N="342" /> in the Stamps Sale Account which can be supplied to recoup societies for continuing in benefit persons who, on account of arrears due to unemployment, would either be suspended from benefit or would have their benefits reduced. There is nothing new in the Act.  Precisely the same method was introduced last year.</P>

    <Title>WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY BILL&mdash;SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="MINISTER for POSTS and TELEGRAPHS (Mr. Walsh) MINISTER for POSTS and TELEGRAPHS (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for POSTS and TELEGRAPHS (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Wireless Telegraphy in Saorstát Eireann is at present controlled by an Act passed in 1904, a temporary measure, and since then it has been changed from year to year by this supplementary Wireless Act and the Act of 1906.  Since the Act of 1904, wireless has developed very rapidly and in particular in respect to the broadcasting field. Because of this development and because of the absence of legislation, covering certain phases and also because of the uncertainty of existing legislation in respect to the issue of a licence fee, we have, for a considerable time past, decided that it was necessary to have it defined and as a consequence the Bill, which we are now reading the Second Time, proposes to repeal the existing Acts and to make <Col N="343" /> full provision for the control of wireless, both broadcasting and wireles telegraphy.  The Bill before the House to-day makes provision for the collection of licences.  That is the main and outstanding provision.  Of course, there are others and in addition to so doing, it purposes to place the necessary machinery in the hands of the State for that enforcement.  It also deals with the question of wireless as applied to ships in and around our coast and to airships.  Except with regard to broadcasting, the Bill is not a very serious departure from existing provisions.  I should like to say at this stage that its provisions have been agreed to by the other departments which are likely to be concerned in the control of wireless generally.  As is usual here, I intend to give a resume of the provisions of the different sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clause 2 gives the definitions of the various expressions contained in the Bill which are necessary to cover the present and probable future development of wireless telegraphy and to remove the ambiguity as regards reception which existed in the Act of 1904. Clause 3 relates to the restriction on the possession of wireless telegraphy apparatus except under licence issued by the Minister.  Exceptions for ships and the Army are covered by Sections 5 and 6.  As to Sections 1 and 2, under the Telegraph Act, 1896, the Minister has already a monopoly of telegraphic communication and is, therefore, entitled to prevent the use of wireless telegraphy except under a license granted by him.  This is merely a continuance of the power already possessed by the Minister under the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1904 which will be repealed.  Wireless on ships is already within the scope of the Act of 1904, and it is proposed to extend control to cover wireless in aircraft.  With regard to Section 3, the maximum penalties of £10, with a further fine not exceeding £1 per day during which the offence continues and forfeiture of apparatus is reasonable compared with the Act of 1904, which prescribed a penalty of £10 and, if <Col N="344" /> convicted on indictment a fine not exceeding £100, or 12 months' imprisonment, and in either case forfeiture of apparatus.  The penalty which we propose to introduce is a big modification of the one already existing.  As to Section 4: in the case of ships to which this Section applies, in the matter of contravention, the apparatus shall be deemed to be kept by the Master of the ship as well as by the owner of such ship.  This is intended to facilitate proof in case of a prosecution.  Clause 4 relates to restrictions on signalling stations.</P>
    <P>As to sub-sections 1 and 2 of Clause 4, signalling stations referred to are such as are capable of communicating with ships by means of semaphores, bells, lamp-signalling or any other device as defined in Clause 2. Communication of such kinds is within the Minister's exclusive privilege and the use of it must, therefore, be licensed.  Sub-section 1 of Clause 5 provides for the issue of licences at a prescribed fee (if any) by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Clause 6 gives the Minister power to make regulations in regard to licences &mdash;their form, duration, renewal, suspension or revocation, the terms and conditions to be observed by the holders, the fees to be paid, and any other matters in respect of which it shall appear necessary to make provision by regulations.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 6 deals with a matter that is of more than passing interest to Deputies who probably intend to speak on this question. As regards traders and dealers in apparatus, retailers, etc., and also as regards institutions, where more than one receiving set is used, it is not intended that licences should be taken out for every set.  One licence will suffice.  I want to explain that the alternative to this course would have been to insist on licences for every set. That would bring in its train an immensity of complications for my Department.  It would mean, in the case of institutions, such as hospitals, where several extensions of a main set or several independent sets may be found necessary, insistence on licences for every set.  Likewise in the case of <Col N="345" /> experimenters who find themselves in possession of one set with many parts, otherwise a set that may be used in its plural form, or a number of part sets, or a number of individual sets, such persons would not have escaped a fee of 10/- for each set or part thereof.  In this proposal we let them off with a single licence.  In the same way it simplifies our position in regard to retailers' broadcasting instruments. Every retailer will, we may reasonably expect, provide himself with a medium of reception for demonstration purposes, and that medium can, and will, be switched on to any particular set. It may be put on to more than one set.  In this case we merely charge for one medium, regardless of the use made of it.  This removes a great difficulty with which we were faced in regard to this matter.  I regard it as removing one of the greatest possible difficulties which a Bill, such as this, could introduce.  In effect, we are asking for one licence for one building&mdash;one licence from one authority.</P>
    <P>While, of course, this matter will be reduced to print through our regulations at a later stage, it would be well to explain here that it is possible for one owner to live in two residences.  In that case, should he be the possessor of two sets, one in each residence, he must, of course, pay two licence fees. Likewise, should he have a set in his residence and another, say, in his motor ear, he must pay two licences, but, generally, in one building, owned by one individual, we intend to seek only one licence fee, regardless of the number of instruments which may be contained in that building.  Sub-section (2) of Section 6 refers to licences for transmission for experimental purposes, which are granted only to persons qualified to carry out experiments and are subject to special conditions. Sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 7 provide for the serving of notices by registered post, requiring any person to furnish information regarding his apparatus. This is a new requirement which is intended to facilitate the administration of the Act.  It is the alternative to taking out a search warrant. It is understood that the Customs and Excise authorities have similar statutory <Col N="346" /> powers in connection with the licences which they control.  Sub-section (3) prescribes a maximum penalty of £5 for failing to furnish the required information or making a false or misleading declaration.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (1) or Section 8 provides for the issue of a search warrant by a District Justice to officers of the Ministry and to members of the Gárda Siochána on sworn information.  A similar provision already exists in the Post Office Act of 1904, authorising officers of the Post Office or police officers to enter and inspect under a search warrant any place or ship where it is suspected that a wireless apparatus is used without a licence, and to seize such apparatus.  A warrant is only granted by a District Justice on sworn information.  He may refuse to grant same if, in his opinion, there is not sufficient ground for granting it.  Sub-section (1) of Section 9 provides for the making of regulations in regard to the efficiency of ship and aircraft operators, the granting, duration and renewal of certificates of competency, regulating and controlling the time and manner of working of apparatus, and observations of the International Convention. The expression &ldquo;or any other person&rdquo; in E (1) means that wireless operators on ships and aircraft may hold certificates granted by the British Postmaster-General, the British Air Ministry or by a Dominion Government. These certificates are recognised here.  I (1) states that the Government of Saorstát is a party to the International Radio Convention under which wireless telegraphy on ships is regulated.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the control of wireless telegraphy by the Government in times of emergency.  The necessity for that section is obvious. In times of crisis it is essential for the safety of the State that the Government should have full control over all wireless apparatus.  Sub-section (2) provides that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs shall make such regulations regarding wireless telegraphy in the emergency as the Executive Council may consider necessary. Sub-section (3) provides the penalties which are a departure from <Col N="347" /> those already referred to and which appear in the early part of the Bill because the situation is different. Under this sub-section it is provided that a maximum of £50 or six months' imprisonment, together with forfeiture of the apparatus, is to be imposed for every breach of the regulations and, in addition, there is a fine of £5 a day for a continuing breach.</P>

      <P>Sub-Section (4) of Section 10 provides that the special regulations continue in force as long as the emergency exists.  Sub-section (7) deals with merchant shipping.  The Merchant Shipping (Wireless Telegraphy) Act, 1919, is administered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and it will be necessary to obtain his sanction to any regulation respecting wireless on ships to which this Act applies.  In other words, any steps which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs desires to take with regard to wireless on board ships can only be taken in collaboration with that Minister.  The Merchant Shipping (Convention) Act of 1914 was passed to give effect to an international convention regarding the safety of life at sea, but it has not, so far, been ratified by some countries.  Because of that the Act has not yet come into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 11 we find prohibition of certain classes of messages of an indecent, obscene, or offensive character, messages or communications subversive of public order, false or misleading signals of distress, or false or misleading messages or signals to a ship or aircraft in distress.  In sub-section (2) we find a regulation for the purpose of maintaining the secrecy of any telegraphic message sent by wireless.  We propose that the Minister should be empowered to prevent the leakage of information from wireless telegraphic stations, and with the necessary penalties to enforce that secrecy.  In this case the offences are of a serious character, and it is necessary to carry with them a serious punishment.  Imprison ment instead of a fine is, therefore. <Col N="348" /> sought for.  Sub-section (4) provides penalties for misdemeanours.  In some cases the facts may mitigate the offence, constitute it of minor importance, and warrant its being dealt with summarily by a District Justice.  In such cases a fine not exceeding £10 or one month's imprisonment is proposed.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with the interference caused by the working of wireless apparatus.  Sub-section (1) applies to the irregular working of apparatus in such a way as to cause interference with the users of wireless sets or any broadcasting station.  The Minister is bound to protect licensees from undue-interference caused by oscillation arising from the improper working of apparatus by other persons.  This is a type of nuisance experienced elsewhere.  In some countries it has been dealt with by enactments and in other cases it has not been dealt with, and is a continuing nuisance.  Sub-section (2) authorises the Minister to serve notice on a person who works his apparatus. irregularly, requiring him to terminate the interference he is causing.  This precaution is similar to that which we have taken in cases where people fail to pay their licence fees.  Instead of invoking the law at first we give them an opportunity of rectifying their ways.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) deals with interference by ships with telegraphy.  Any rectification of an obstruction of this character can, of course, only be approached with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. In sub-section (5) we find that the provisions which already exist in regard to the maintenance of the rights of the-Postmaster-General, in respect to certain powers which enable him to prevent interference from electrical extensions of another character, are being-retained. The Telegraphic Acts, 1863 to 1921, give the Minister power to prevent interference with telegraphs, and it is not proposed to detract from these. The necessity of that power is very obvious.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with the method of instituting prosecutions.  Prosecutions can only be at the suit of the Minister. This section is intended to prevent prosecutions being instituted by the police without the prior knowledge of <Col N="349" /> the Minister, and also prosecutions which might be instituted by private persons for vindictive or other motives. Section 14 deals with the offences committed in ships or aircraft.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 15 provides for the continuance of existing licences until the expiration of the period for which they were issued, and for the protection of the user from being required to take out a new licence. It enables the licensee to get a full run for his money for a full twelve months. Sub-section (3) is to prevent claims for refunds of licence fees already paid, on the grounds that owing to the ambiguity of the Act of 1904 there was no authority requiring licences for a receiving apparatus, or exacting fees for payment thereof.  Because of the uncertainty that prevails as to the powers of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and the necessity of taking out licences, it is only natural to anticipate that certain people who paid for licences may seek a refund.  In this particular case we arc taking steps to prevent that.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the establishment and maintenance of broadcasting stations.  Sub-section (2) deals with the responsibility for the material which passes over the broadcasting station.  Someone must have responsibility for what is proper in broadcast matter, and the Minister of the Department is obviously the person on whom that responsibility should fall.  The Special Committee appointed by the Dáil in 1923 recommended that broadcasting should be a State service, and should be solely in the hands of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The report of the committee was approved by a resolution of the Dáil, and this section proposes to give legislative sanction to the resolution.  Section 18 deals with fees for broadcasting.  It provides for charging fees to persons or firms who make use of broadcasting for advertising purposes, appeals and other causes.  At the present time we are issuing advertisements and charging for them.  That is one of the proposals made by the Broadcasting Committee of 1923.</P>
    <P>Clause 19 provides for the establishment of an Advisory Committee of not <Col N="350" /> less than five, that five to include a representative of the Department of Lands and Agriculture and a representative of the Department of Education. In actual practice we have found it more advisable to extend the number.  As a matter of fact we have a committee of eighteen at present. and it is a good committee, a committee that is likely to carry its weight and to be very helpful in the drawing up of programmes and the general direction of programmes which we hope will satisfy the public, or, at any rate, a majority of them.  The right of nomination to this committee by the Minister may be questioned, but. as far as we can see, there is no alternative to that course.  I have seen it suggested that certain organisations and societies ought to be permitted to nominate their own representatives. That would open up a great many difficulties.  Firstly, there may be duplications of such societies, or societies of a particular type, and secondly, we have no assurance that the rules and regulations governing particular societies are those with which we could find ourselves in full concurrence. There are a great many other reasons.  On the whole, I am satisfied that the method adopted, that of nominating members, is a satisfactory one.  I see no justification for departing from it.</P>
    <P>If this Bill should pass in its present or approximately present form we hope to find ourselves in a strong financial position.  I anticipate&mdash;it is only a guess because we have nothing very clear to guide us&mdash;that fully 40.000 people in the State have broadcasting apparatus at the present time. Up to now, during the current year, only about 4,000 of these have taken out licences.  Therefore, it will be seen that the public are not prepared, in the absence of legislation, to pay for broadcasting, and that once this Bill becomes operative we should be able to secure the greater part of these fees.  It will surprise me if from fees alone we should not reach the sum of £20,000 during the coming financial year.  That sum, plus a lesser sum which we expect to get from import duties, will place us in a sound <Col N="351" /> financial position.  I said in speaking here on the Estimates last year that, once this Bill was in operation and when we had the advantage of the import duties, broadcasting would pay its way.  I am satisfied now that that statement was not wide of the mark, that broadcasting will, during the present year, and, as far as we can see, for the future, clear its own passage. Not only should it meet day to day outgoings but I venture to say we will be in a position to pay back to the State the capital advances which it has been, and will be, called upon to make in regard to the erection of the stations.  In other words, broadcasting will stand on its own legs without any burden on the taxpayer. That, considered from the standpoint of the committee who decided in the first instance to devolve this responsibility on the State, is a prospect which will create great satisfaction. It is all the better that broadcasting ought to be clear of Central Fund Expenditure, that it should be self-supporting. There was no prospect of realising that position in the absence of this Bill, and whilst we have endeavoured to avoid anything in the nature of contentious clauses, we feel that nothing less than what the Bill provides will be satisfactory.  I therefore move the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point on which I would like to get some information from the Minister in addition to what he has already told us.  He has not given us, so far, much indication as to what the policy of the Department is in regard to broadcasting. In Clause 17 of this Bill very wide powers are conferred on the Ministry with regard to broadcasting. Before these powers are conferred one would like to know what exactly is the policy of his Department.  When the Minister was discussing this question of policy not very long ago, in this House, he informed us that he was rather inclined to set up, I think, four stations in different parts of the Saorstát. I do not know whether it is the intention or not to continue that policy. but it does appear to one, in connection <Col N="352" /> with a rapidly changing industry like wireless, that a decision of that character might be reviewed.  The expense of maintaining four stations will be considerable, particularly if they are to be maintained in a state of efficiency comparable with other stations we know of.  It will mean as I said an expenditure of a considerable amount to maintain that state of efficiency.</P>
      <P>It would be well to consider whether in view of the rapid developments that are taking place, it would not be better to concentrate on one station, to make the programmes in that particular station highly attractive, and then to relay from that central station to these other provincial stations.  I suggest that to the Minister as a policy that is pretty largely adopted elsewhere and as one that is likely to make broadcasting much more popular in the Free State than it is to-day.  Of course in addition to that relaying from the central station it would be possible to give additional information from these local stations but I do maintain that it would be preferable as a policy to concentrate on one station and to make that station of the high-class that we would like to see it and then to relay the programmes to the different sub-stations.  That is a point on which one would like to have the views of the Minister.  There was one other point on which I would like to have heard him&mdash;with regard to these charges.  I was glad to hear from the Minister that he does not propose to tax the proprietor of a number of sets for each individual set.  There are other points, however, that are worthy of consideration.</P>
      <P>It has become customary, on this side as well as on the other side, since wireless sets have become much more portable than they were, to move these sets as one moves from one part of the country to another, and I would like the Minister to make it quite clear that if a tax on a set is paid in any portion of the Saorstát that apparatus will be free of tax in any other part.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure from his statement that that is the intention, but he did not make it as clear as it is desirable <Col N="353" /> it should be.  These are the only two points on which I would like information. I would like the Minister, if he possibly could, to consider that question of centralisation of broadcasting. We are all glad to recognise the improvements that have taken place in some departments of what we might call the central station, though all departments have not been improved to the extent that one would like.  I do not know that the announcer in the Dublin station has improved.  However, that is a matter that is capable of consideration in the future.  But one would like to see programmes given in the Dublin station that would be really attractive and comparable with other programmes that one has opportunities of listening to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has made it pretty dear that it is necessary for wireless to have governing it a more recent Act than that of 1904, or even of 1906, because wireless, as we all know, has made vast progress of late years, particularly within the past year.  The Minister said, and I think it is quite true, that the greatest necessity, and the thing, I suppose, that urged him most strongly to bring in the Bill, was the matter of the licences, and the regulations to be made governing them.  I think he is quite correct in that, because I am perfectly certain, from what I see myself, that there is a huge number of people having wireless sets who are not paying the licences for them&mdash;some few out of ignorance, but in a good many cases because they consider that it is more profitable for them to haye ten shillings in their pockets than to pay ten shillings out.  It is necessary, in such cases, to have something to compel people who have the privilege of this wonderful discovery to pay a reasonable amount for its enjoyment.  All classes are now participating in wireless, and I am glad to see that it is going down to the very bottom.  In my district a very considerable number of labourers have sets in their houses, and the amount of enjoyment and pleasure it gives to them, some of them tell me, is beyond description.  But they have all their little grievances <Col N="354" /> about it; a great many of them think that there is a little too much music that is above their comprehension in some cases, and that there might be lectures on subjects that would be useful to them, dealing with matters of agriculture, with which they are in daily contact, and things of that sort, which. no doubt, the Minister may be able to see to in time.</P>
      <P>Another question which is very important to country people is this: At present the time signal and the weather forecast is given very late, at about 10.30.  In the country districts it is the custom for the labouring classes to go to bed at about eight-thirty or nine, because they have to get up early.  It would be a great advantage to them to have the weather forecast, the time signal, and all that kind of thing, given before the ordinary programme commences, instead of at 10.30 or later.  I think it would not cause very much disarrangement or create any difficulty if that were done, and possibly the Minister will be able to see to it.  Another matter to which I would like to refer is this: I think a great many more&mdash;in fact a huge number&mdash;would take to wireless if it was possible to reduce the fee to five shillings, that many would do so who are now hesitating on the brink and trying to decide whether they can afford ten shillings or not.  I am quite certain that there would be no loss to the revenue if the Minister could see his way later to make this change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Good has said about a central station of great power, on the style of the Daventry station, to transmit to other stations. and I think that that would be a good thing.  It would probably make the reception clearer in certain districts where at present they have a difficulty in this respect.  I think that the fines laid down are rather severe.  I do not mean fines for an outside country, for ships, or that sort of thing, but for people in country districts who have not really thoroughly understood all the ins and outs of the matter.  In their case I think a fine of £1 a day would be rather severe.  It may be that there is power in the Bill to reduce that amount, but if such a provision is <Col N="355" /> to be enforced I think it would have a very deterrent effect on anybody proposing to take up wireless if they thought that, through ignorance, they might have to pay such a crushing fine. I am sure it is not the idea of the Minister, or of anybody who has to do with wireless, to put any hindrance in the way of its spread.</P>
    <P>I think there is no discovery that has such possibilities before it as wireless of transmitting knowledge and of making the most wonderful difference to people who live in isolated places, and to young people especially living in districts where they have very little to do at night.  Wireless has a most wonderful educative value, and I hope that everything possible will be done to make it a success.  I think the lower the licence fee is made the greater will be the spread of wireless, and the greater also the amount of revenue the Government will derive from it.  I hope the Minister will look into the matter of the programme and try to suit all classes as far as possible, and that he will be able to give to every class a fair share of the subjects likely to be of interest and value to them. If that can be done it will be the means of opening up vast sources of information to every class in the community, and will pay the country well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether or not I would be justified in giving a very full explanation of the development of policy on the occasion of the Second Reading of this Bill, which really has nothing to do with policy.  I am, however, always prepared to satisfy the curiosity of Deputies. On previous occasions I indicated the course that that policy was likely to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I intervene to point out to the Minister that under Section 17 of the Bill, as I have already mentioned, he gets the right to set up stations.  What I want to know is what use is likely to be made of these stations, and what is to be the policy with regard to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact we have discussed the question of policy <Col N="356" /> here on a number of occasions.  I think I am not exaggerating when I say four or five occasions.  I am prepared to restate briefly why we find it necessary to go ahead with the high power station in the centre of the country.  The technical development of that has not yet gone beyond the stage of a safe radius &mdash;a guaranteed radius of 80 miles.  It may, in certain parts of the circle, extend to 100 miles.  Now, anybody who looks at the map of Ireland will see that there is no spot at which we can place a high power station with a safe radius of 80 miles and an uncertain one of 100 miles that will provide the user of the crystal range, which, after all, is the one that mainly concerns us, with what will be satisfying.  We have in mind Athlone as a centre for this high power station.  Athlone is, I think, about 80 miles from Dublin.  We have a population of about half a million centred in the City of Dublin.  It will be seen at once that a population of half a million on the extreme verge of certainty, and perhaps on the verge of uncertainty, is not a situation that we could face.  Therefore, we find it essential to maintain the Dublin station.  In any case, the original cost of that station was only £5,000 or £6,000.  The expenditure on it will be earned over and over again before the high power station can possibly be in operation.  Similarly, in the case of Cork City.  We have in the vicinity of that city a population of about a quarter of a million.  It is outside the 100 miles radius, and therefore outside the radius of even the best high power station that we could envisage at the moment.  It is clear also in that case that we would require a small transmitting station.  The Dublin station is working, the Cork station is being erected, and we hope to find it working about the end of February or at any rate early in March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. The third station that we intend to provide is the one for the Gaeltacht. I believe it will be agreed that we cannot reconcile ourselves to a programme, largely in English, circulating in that <Col N="357" /> district, seeing that we have set our minds to the maintenance of the Gaeltacht area.  We have, therefore, decided to put up a station for that particular district.  It will not cost a great lot of money, and the intention is that it should provide a programme in keeping with the language of the people.  Now, these are the only small stations that we intend to provide. One is there already, the other will be there within a couple of months, and the third will, I hope, be provided in the forthcoming estimates.  I have explained that it is the intention to go ahead with the high power station, and in all probability the location of that station will be Athlone.  I do not see any better location so far.  The original cost of that station will be anything in the neighbourhood of £60,000. It would perhaps be £20,000 more if we had to erect a power station in addition, but we hope that the Shannon power will be available before the station is complete.  It will take at least eighteen months to complete it. In anticipation of the erection of that station we have made representations to the Department of Industry and Commerce to bear in mind the necessity of an early construction of cables in the Athlone area.  I believe that will be possible.  Now, once we have this high power station and our two smaller stations, because we must exclude from consideration the one in the Gaeltacht, you can take it that the great bulk of the programme will be provided from the high power station.  In other words, we have no intention of providing more than one programme for the country at any one time.  It may happen, and it will happen without a doubt, that the bulk of the programmes will emanate here in Dublin, where the major portion of our material will naturally be derived, but it will also frequently happen that material for a programme will be secured from Cork, Limerick, Galway, and other places.  There will be no duplication of that programme.  There is no intention, for instance, of having a programme originating in Dublin and another in Cork, Limerick, or somewhere else at the same time. There will be one programme at one time, but if we can diversify the programme <Col N="358" /> or pick up material in any part of the country, then, naturally, we intend doing so.  By that means, of course, we will only incur one expense at the one time.</P>

      <P>A further point to be considered in connection with broadcasting is that with the introduction of the beam system I venture to say it will be possible to switch on any foreign station, any station from any part of the world to any other part of the earth, quite as easily and conveniently as one may at present switch on the telephone.  That is, to my view, a certainty, and once that materialises those in charge of broadcasting in this country can vary their programme to any extent, and at very little cost.  The world material will be at the disposal of the world.  Broadcasting is really coming to that.  Deputy Wolfe is rather inclined to think that we could popularise broadcasting by reducing the licensing fee to 5/-.  That fee would not pay us for the cost of collection. and 10/- is the very lowest rate there is anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>But look at the number that would be brought in under the 5/- fee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe you would bring in 5 per cent. extra.  As for the penalties, people incur these with their eyes open.  They have got to face them.  Nobody need pay a £10 penalty if he or she pays the licence. If, on the other hand, if there is a general attempt to evade paying that fee then people have to meet the consequence. We find that in the absence of an Act to enforce the payment of fees, there are very few who are willing to pay anything.  Most people want everything for nothing, and at the same time they want the privilege of abusing the State for not doing more for them. They cannot have it both ways.  The people are called upon to pay a little more than one-third of a penny a day for the best programme we can produce. Under the circumstances, I do not see where the grievance comes in. Generally speaking, our programme is a good programme, and the proof of <Col N="359" /> that is that we have received thousands of commendations in regard to it from people living in Great Britain.  We have proof that a very considerable percentage of the listeners-in in Wales, Cumberland, Westmoreland, Lancashire, Yorkshire, and the South of Scotland are regular listeners-in to the Dublin programme.  Within the last fortnight alone the Director of Broadcasting brought to my notice twelve or fourteen communications of that kind. and it would surprise some of the critics of the Dublin station to read what these people think of our programmes here.  We are very much inclined to depreciate the resources of our own land&mdash;very much inclined to see the long horns of the distant cow. If we had a little more respect for our own country and what it can produce, it would be all to the good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think our programme is generally a good one and that, with the encouragement our artists are receiving, it will improve.  I believe we have every reason to be satisfied that we have done so well in regard to broadcasting. One further point I want to mention is that we invited through broadcasting and the Press comments of any kind, good, bad or indifferent, with regard to our programme.  Thirty replies were received.  Fifty per cent. of these expressed satisfaction, but made some slight suggestions, and the other 15 replies may be included under the category of the dissatisfied-some because we had too much Irish, and some because we had too little Irish, and too much English; some because we taught German; some because we had not enough of jazz, and some because we had too much jazz; and so on.  At any rate, notwithstanding the fact that we must have some 40,000 set holders, and that every possible effort was made, extending over a week, to get suggestions and to rouse up the dissatisfied, we got only 15 of these people to come to the surface.  That does not indicate general dissatisfaction. We can take it the bulk of the people are satisfied that we are doing well, and doing our best, and that the Dublin programme is a good programme. I would be always glad to <Col N="360" /> get suggestions from members of this House with a view to making that programme better.  It is our desire that it should be the best.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to a matter which, I think, is worthy of the attention of Deputies, because it seems to have relation to a set Government policy, or at least a policy of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I will leave the Minister to say whether there is any other responsibility besides his own in this matter.  There appeared some few weeks ago an advertisement for the post of news assistant to the Dublin Broadcasting Station.  The salary, inclusive and non-pensionable, is as follows:&mdash;Married man, £5 to £6 a week; unmarried man or woman, £4 to £5 a week.  Candidates must be not less than 25 and not more than 50 years of age.  Candidates must have a good knowledge of journalistic work, including editing, and experience of reporting is essential.  One would, even with no further information than is contained in the advertisement, realise that a candidate who must have a good knowledge of journalistic work, including editing, must be a person of experience and responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following up the necessity for editorial experience, the qualifications require that he must have had experience in reporting as well.  But when the ap plicants applied for further information they were provided with a list of the proposed duties and conditions of appointment of news assistant in connection with news service for broadcasting. That list is quite a considerable one. But there is one paragraph in it, which is near the end, that I would like to emphasise at the beginning.  It is that the appointment will be a part-time one.  Now, it is a part-time appointment <Col N="361" /> as news assistant of the broadcasting service at a payment of £4 a week if an unmarried man, who must have had a good knowledge of journalistic work, including editing and experience in reporting.  Here is what he has to do in his part time at £4 a week:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  Take record of proceedings in Oireachtas and prepare daily summary.&rdquo; The Dáil and Seanad are meeting together, and this news assistant is to take a record of the proceedings and prepare a daily summary.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.  Obtain reports from Dublin Police and Fire Brigade Stations and Detective Office of important or sensational happenings.&rdquo;  These are to come while he is taking a record of the Dáil proceedings.  I suppose he will whisper round to the Deputies, and tell them of the sensational happenings somewhere in the city to divert their attention from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when he is making a statement regarding the next Wireless Broadcasting Bill.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;3.  He is to obtain particulars of outstanding events from National, Cultural, Musical, and Athletic organisations, e.g., Gaelic League, Feis Ceóil, Royal Irish Academy, Royal Dublin Societies, Chamber of Commerce, Athletic Governing Bodies, etc., etc.&rdquo;  A part-time appointment.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;4.  To obtain results and short descriptions of hurling, football, cricket, etc., matches in which there is general interest.&rdquo;  On Saturday afternoon there may be an Association match in one part of the city and a Rugby match in another part of the city, and on Sunday a hurling match and a Gaelic football championship.  He is to obtain results and write short descriptions of these things for the purpose of submitting them to the public through the wireless apparatus.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;5.  Obtain results of more important races.&rdquo;  There is nothing here about prophecies of the results of future races, but I suppose that will come in his spare time.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;6.  Obtain daily produce market reports from creamery managers, <Col N="362" /> association and kindred bodies.&rdquo;  And then having got all that from all these bodies he is</P>
    <P>&ldquo;7.  To edit and prepare for issue a typed statement of all news obtained from the foregoing sources and incorporate in the report the following particulars which will be supplied by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs:&mdash;(a) Quotations of Stocks and Shares from the Dublin Stock Exchange, (b) Market and Agricultural Reports furnished by the Department of Lands and Agriculture, (c) Foreign news, (d) Provincial news.&rdquo;  Now this part-time officer is to obtain all these reports of the first six items which I read and then to edit and type and prepare for issue. not only these, but these other particulars which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is to obtain by means of some other part-time servant, I suppose. Having accomplished all that in his part-time he is to be subject to the termination of his appointment at one week's notice.  The appointment is to be non-pensionable and will be for one year in the first instance, subject then or thereafter to a week's notice on either side.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The person appointed to the position will be required to furnish a guarantee that there will be no infringement of copyright, and shall provide a bond for £1,000 to be obtained from an approved insurance society or company indemnifying the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as representative of the State against any action, claims or expenses caused to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs by any infringement or alleged infringement of copyright.&rdquo;  Now, on the face of it, to any observer, however casual, it must be evident that that is not a part-time job.  It is probably intended that it shall be a job for a man and his wife and his aunts and uncles, particularly the aunts who can ferret round for information.  And he is to be paid £4 per week!</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I must admit that there is a lapse there.  If he has a <Col N="363" /> wife who is to assist him in this part-time job he will get £5 a week.  To judge by the tendency expressed in this advertisement, the object is to get the cheapest type, the poorest quality of State servant you can get.  Nominally he is to have these duties and serve the interests of broadcasting, but he is to be the cheapest and the shoddiest type of man or woman that could be got, because nobody of quality or experience would pretend to do this work at the salary, and it can only be pretence.  These things cannot be done by any individual person in this country.  But consider what other aspects there are of this rather flagrant attempt at taking in the public, because that is what it means. You cannot get reliable information of this kind.  You will get tittle-tattle, imaginative stories perhaps of a man sitting in his back-room, but you will not get information that is worth putting through the wireless for the public to listen to.  The job, therefore, is not a part-time job.  It is going to mean that this particular appointment will be the subject of complaint in the Dáil at some future time from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs similar to the complaint in regard to the Assistant Director, or Announcer, I think, who nominally was a part-time servant but who was found to be working twelve, thirteen and fourteen hours a day.</P>
      <P>Now, this part-time servant, to whom £4 a week is to be paid if he is unmarried, is to have the particular experience I have set out.  The job is the job of an experienced newspaperman who has knowledge of editing, a knowledge of the gathering of news, together with knowledge of precis writing and typewriting.  Such a person in the employment of a newspaper would be paid probably double the salary, and the effect of this proposition is to do what has been done in other Departments of the public service, generally to depreciate the rates of pay&mdash;in this case for what has been called the black-coated proletariat as distinguished from the manual labourer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only is the salary miserably low <Col N="364" /> for such a responsibility, but the terms of the appointment are unheard of in the modern newspaper world.  The appointment will terminate with a week's notice on either side.  The custom in the Dublin newspaper world, I understand, is a month's notice for reporters, three months for sub-editors, six months for leader writers, and twelve months for editors.  So you are going to take a man with that kind of status in the newspaper world, a man who has experience of editing and news gathering, and bring him to a scale three stages lower than that of a junior reporter.</P>
    <P>Then, to crown all, this person is required to guarantee the Minister in a thousand pound bond against any loss he may suffer in respect to claims or expenses caused to the Department by infringement of copyright.  Such a proposition is unknown in the newspaper world.  The Minister wants to set a new headline to newspaper proprietors, to impose new and difficult conditions upon newspaper men generally, to throw the onus entirely upon the servant&mdash;and the junior servant, the lower paid servant, at that&mdash;and not accept it himself.  But what is the meaning of it?  One would have imagined that if there had not been such a proposition as this the news assistant would be able to gather his news or, shall I say, steal his news, from the newspaper office.  But to guard against such a horrible thought that any person would use for one news agency material gathered by persons in the pay of another news agency&mdash;to prevent the possibility of that idea even being considered for a moment&mdash; this proposition regarding protection against infringement of copyright is imposed.  The news assistant must gather all this information himself.  He must be in all these places at the same time for fear he may be tempted to infringe a copyright.</P>
    <P>I really cannot understand the mentality of the Minister who proposes that a part-time news assistant should be required to fulfil such duties as are outlined in this statement.  The effect of the general proposition is to invite the least competent and the most hard-up newspaper man with editorial experience <Col N="365" /> to take on this particular job. He is going to pretend to the world that he is only a part-time man, but it really means that he is more than a full-time man and he is there at part-time pay.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that is the kind of thing that a State should be content with, or that it is a procedure we should be satisfied to allow to pass without challenge.  Surely we are not out to make the pace for the blackleg employer generally to reduce the standards of professional men?  After all, a junior reporter is one thing; he has difficult tasks to undertake, responsible and adventurous jobs to tackle; but this is not a junior reporter; this is a man with editorial experience as well as experience of reporting work, and he must be capable of doing all these things for the listening-in public.</P>
    <P>It is an impossible proposition, and the only assumption I can draw is that it is intended to set a headline for the reduction of wages and salaries for that particular class of the community following upon the practice of the Government in respect to other classes of the community.  We have seen, although it is not directly appropriate to this particular subject, advertisements for professional men of various types at salaries very much below what would be required to get qualified persons.  That will probably be a subject for discussion on another occasion.</P>
    <P>I am going to content myself with saying that this particular advertisement, with the terms of appointment that are advertised, is entirely unworthy of any State service, and particularly one which is the subject of so much&mdash;I was going to say boastful&mdash; talk from the Minister this afternoon as to its quality, its value, and the kind of service it is rendering.</P>
    <P>I am not going to pass any remarks about the quality of the service, or the entertainment in the past.  I think there must, inevitably, be considerable entertainment derived from the kind of news that will be supplied through the agency if this advertisement is implemented, to use a word that is very common on the other side of the House. I would be very interested to hear what <Col N="366" /> kind of excuse or justification the Minister has for this attempt generally to degrade the newspaper service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>After hearing the list of duties enumerated by Deputy Johnson which the news editor is to perform, I think the House will unanimously come to one conclusion, and that is, that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is at least a good judge of value.  I suggest to the Minister for Finance that if he ever requires an assistant or deputy he can commit his office to the care of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I am sure that that Minister will worthily maintain all the high traditions for tightness in regard to money matters and general cheese-paring which the Minister for Finance has established.  In fact, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs might well satisfy the demand of the Farmers' Party relative to the setting up of a Geddes' Committee.  If one is to take the list of duties and the wages set out as a criterion, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is, in himself, a Geddes' Committee.  In future, instead of having a Geddes' Committee appointed, the Farmers' Party should ask that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs be requested to do all the pruning which they think necessary in Government Departments.</P>
      <P>The most amazing part of this advertisement is the miserably low wage which the Minister proposes to pay for the responsible work expected.  We are told in the advertisement that the person should have a good knowledge of reporting, a good knowledge of journalistic work, as well as a knowledge of editing, and, in addition to that, he is expected to have the added qualification of a knowledge of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister whether he considers that he can get a person who has a good knowledge of journalistic work, including editing and reporting, for a wage of £4 per week?  If the Minister thinks that, I am strongly of the opinion that he is under a serious delusion, because the men or women who would apply for the post at the wage offered are not the best men and women in the journalistic profession.  If they are not the best men and women in the profession, then the type of people who <Col N="367" /> are going to apply for the position at the wage offered are people who will not give satisfaction, and, as Deputy Johnson said, they, generally speaking, will be people who are hard-up and prepared to take the job on that account, even at the wage advertised.  But I put it to the Minister that the duties enumerated here cannot by any stretch of the imagination be regarded as the work of a part-time officer.  I venture to say that the Minister must be well aware that this class of work, this trekking round from one place to another, coming to the Dáil and trekking from one House to the other looking for information, going back and summarising the whole thing and producing a news bulletin, is work that could not be done in three-and-a-half or four hours per day.  If it takes more than that, then it is more than a part-time job.  I am sure that the Minister, even though he may want good value, recognises that this is asking something more than good value.  To ask a person to perform those duties in a part-time post, in my opinion, is asking the impossible.</P>
    <P>The low wage mentioned in this case is not the only instance of an apparent intention on the part of, perhaps in this case, the Minister for Finance, to pay a low rate of wages not merely to manual workers but to clerical, administrative and professional workers as well.  We saw an advertisement recently for a Treasury Solicitor at a rate of wages, perhaps politely called salary, that many skilled workers in industry are getting.  We have the posts of engineers advertised at very low salaries, and we have medical officers advertised for at very low salaries. Taking this advertisement for a news editor or assistant in conjunction with the other instances of low salaries offered, the policy of the Government is not merely to include manual workers in their attack but to extend the attack to clerical, administrative and professional workers as well.  As Deputy Johnson has said, this advertisement has simply set the pace between the Government and the most rapacious private employer.  Dublin newspapers are not by any means philanthropic <Col N="368" /> or generous institutions, and if they value the services of a journalist at as much as twice what the Minister now proposes to give, it is only because they realise that the man is value for the money.  It is an extraordinary thing that the Government should come along and suggest that the man to whom the newspaper office gives £8, £9 or £10 a week is only value to the Government for £4.</P>
    <P>Then, on top of having to perform all the duties enumerated by Deputy Johnson in a part-time appointment, the person appointed is also obliged to enter into a bond to indemnify the Minister to the extent of £1,000 if he infringe any copyright.  In other words, he is obliged to indemnify the Minister to an amount equal to five years' wages.  I suggest to the Minister that on reconsideration he should recognise that it is impossible to perform the duties outlined in a part-time post, and that it should be regarded as a full-time position&mdash;that is, if the person appointed is to perform those duties&mdash;and that being a full-time post the Minister should pay a rate of wages at least not less than that paid by newspapers in Dublin and throughout the country.</P>

      <P>That is something refreshing to hear.  Even if it is, I believe that the salary is inadequate and that the duties that the person appointed will have to perform, though they may be called part-time, will in effect be whole-time.  We know that description of a part-time officer, and from experience we have knowledge of persons supposed to be performing the duties of part-time officers having to work eight and ten hours per day.  My idea is that the Department of Finance has some special grudge against technically trained people and professional people of all classes when <Col N="369" /> it comes to fixing their salaries.  We have had a case recently of a bacteriologist to be appointed under the Dairy Produce Act.  This appointment has been held up for two years, and it was all, I have no doubt, due to the parsimony of some official in the Department of Finance. I know I may not be strictly in order in referring to this, but I refer to it solely for the reason that I believe this is becoming a national danger&mdash; the interference of this official in the Department of Finance.  In the old days we heard of the British Treasury, and the Governor-General, in his Parliamentary days, described the Treasury as a department without a body to be kicked or a soul to be damned.  I fear that the Department of Finance is going pretty much on the same lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson is to be congratulated on the ability with which he black paints his pictures. He certainly has not failed to make the utmost use of his capacity in this particular situation.  One would imagine we had in mind the roping in of some defenceless citizen, some poor reporter out of work and hard hit, to drag the last ounce of life and energy out of him in the interest of the State and that we are, in fact, requiring him to do the job of a superman for a menial wage. We have no such intention.  On the contrary, we are proceeding on the assumption that broadcasting will develop a line of Press dissemination very much wider than we find at present. Already a Press bulletin is being issued nightly.  It includes news from half a dozen foreign capitals and sometimes local doings, and certain local markets.  That bulletin occupies seven or eight minutes of our time.  It is the intention to extend that margin to perhaps fifteen or twenty minutes later <Col N="370" /> on, and this accounts for the introduction of a reporter.  This reporter will be supplementary to the machinery as now utilised for ithe collection and collation of news.</P>
      <P>Now one would imagine we had made up our minds to procure a reporter under the definite heading of part-time and, then, to proceed to exact full-time duty from him.  We have no such intention.  Before we walk we have got to creep, and in employing a reporter on a part-time job we are embarking on the creeping stage.  If we find, after a little experience, that it will be necessary, then we shall walk. In other words, if the responsibilities falling upon this employee of ours are such as to warrant full-time employment I can say here now, we shall have no hesitation in making that employment full-time and, of course, extending the salary.  I wish that to be made very clear.  When we speak of part-time we mean part-time.</P>

      <P>In the service part-time is something on an average of four hours per day.  In my own service we have part-timers who do two hours per day, those who do four hours and, still, others who do six hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it that the person appointed at £4 or £5 a week, as the case may be, is only required to give four hours' service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Roughly four hours' service.  If I find that the service required is anything in the nature of six hours I will feel it incumbent upon me to propose that full duty be accorded. The question of pay appears to be the principal one here to be dealt with.  I wonder if the Deputy is aware that reporters on provincial newspapers receive from £3 to £4 per week and that, in addition to the function of reporting, these reporters have also got to act as sub-editors, and sometimes in the capacity of editors, and all this at a salary of £3 to £4 a week.  We are also aware that on some of the weekly papers here reporters are not better off in that respect, nor are their duties within narrower limitations.  On the other hand we find that reporters on the Dublin papers receive from £5 to £7 a week for full duties, and that, as far as we can ascertain, only one reporter is paid £8 a week.</P>
      <P>Now let us see what we propose to offer here.  For an unmarried man or woman the salary will be for part-time £4 to £5 a week.  For a married man £5 to £6 a week; that is for part-time. Let us assume that we get a married man; his salary will be for part-time £5 to £6 a week as against a salary of £5 to £7 a week for full-time men on the Dublin newspapers.  That surely is not a slave wage.  It has all the appearance of being a more valuable wage when translated into full-time than the newspapers are prepared to offer.  After all, if we are embarking upon this news programme, as we hope to, I do not see how we can justify a higher wage than the highest wage paid by competing institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> We are a State concern and we have the advantage of State finance, and in this respect we propose to compete against private enterprise.  I suggest we have to proceed rather carefully there, and while we have no intention of acting in a niggardly manner in regard to the payment of our employees, we have nevertheless to take into consideration the payment made to employees of competing concerns.</P>
    <P>Capital has been made of the fact that this man may have to act in the capacity of sub-editor.  He may for the time being.  We cannot afford to employ a special sub-editor to edit the news of one part-time reporter.  But assuming that we branch out and find in our employment a number of reporters, then I take it for granted the sphere of sub-editor will appear, and possibly at a later stage of development that of editor also.  But we have to take our time.  That is the big point. We are not going to set up, on the assumption that one man is acting as editor, sub-editor and reporter at the one time, a standard salary which we may have to follow when we are reduced to differentiation, as we possibly will be.  Deputy Johnson refers to the possibility of utilising this official in the manner in which we are utilising our Announcer; in other words, employing him as a part-timer and holding him to that regardless of extended duties and hours.  We have removed that grievance so far as the Announcer is concerned. He is now a full-timer.  We have so allocated the work that he is able to perform his duties within the limits of eight hours.  Remember, we are only beginning and we require to find our feet.  We have no intention of asking a man to do more than regular duties.  He may have to do so for a preliminary period, but beyond that we will find our feet.  I am satisfied that in this case we have proceeded in the right way.  I take full responsibility for the proposed wages.  I am equally satisfied that the material which has offered itself to us is of the right kind. It is quite a suitable kind.  It is not a type that has been forced to throw itself on our mercy because of hard times and hard circumstances.  I am, as a matter of fact, aware that some <Col N="373" /> very capable people have applied for the post, and I have no reason to regret the steps I have taken, either in regard to conditions of employment or in regard to wages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister <Col N="374" /> to take a note that he has made a public compact that, whoever is appointed, it is a part-time post, meaning four hours a day.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.45 p.m. until Wednesday, 1st December.</P>

      <P>The lands referred to are tenanted lands in the townlands of Burgatia and Creggane, held by Mrs. Annie E. Kingston as judicial tenant on the estate of R.F. Starkie, which is being dealt with under the Land Act, 1923.  It is anticipated that the provisional list for this estate will be published at an early date. The question of the retention of Mrs. Kingston's holding, with a view to its resumption, will be considered by the Land Commission in due course.</P>
