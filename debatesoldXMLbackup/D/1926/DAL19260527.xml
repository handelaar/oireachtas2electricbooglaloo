      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the number of drainage schemes which have been recommended by the Leix County Council and by the Commissioner now administering the affairs of the Offaly County Council to the Commissioners of Public Works under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925. and (a) in how many cases have inspections been made, (b) in how many cases after inspections have the Board of Works approved of the proposals and undertaken the preparation of schemes, and (c) in how many cases will works be undertaken during the present financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>To date the Commissioners of Public Works have received five petitions from the Leix County Council, and six from the Commissioner in County Offaly, for schemes in connection with the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925.  Those in respect of County Offaly have been returned to the County Secretary in order that the requirements of the Act as regards petitions may be complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No inspections of proposed schemes have been made so far in these counties, and consequently no schemes have been approved.  Inspections will, it is hoped, be made during the summer in at least two of the Leix cases, Erkina and Eglish, but owing to the limited staff of engineers available and the large total number (383) of petitions to be investigated, it may not be possible to inspect any of the other <Col N="2258" /> cases in Leix and Offaly this year.  It is not expected that any drainage works under the Act will be carried out during the year in any district in Leix or Offaly.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that a decree was granted by the late Recorder at Kanturk in June, 1920, for a sum of about £80 in respect of the destruction of income tax books; that the then income tax collector, Mr. John O'Driscoll, applied for this money to the Revenue Commissioners, and, if so. whether he is in a position to say when this money will be paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>An award was made as stated, but as this claim and a number of similar claims arose out of raids on income tax offices in which the Government was interested, they were of the nature of Government Department claims and did not fall for review in the ordinary course by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission. Consequently the award usual in cases of pre-Truce damage to property was not made by the Commission in the present instance, but the question of discharging this and other claims of like character is at present under consideration, and it is hoped that the matter will be disposed of at an early date.</P>

      <P>The terms of appointment of a Collector of Taxes provide that payment of the whole of the remuneration attaching to his Collection is conditional upon the work being performed in a satisfactory manner, and on the accounts being closed by delivery of final schedules and payment of all outstanding balances of tax being made on or before the prescribed dates.  On Mr. O'Driscoll's resignation as Collector of Taxes in 1923, considerable arrears of tax remained over to be collected by his successors.  He has been paid the full remuneration warranted by the work which he performed, and out of the amount withheld from him must be provided payment for his successors on completion by them of the work of collection.</P>

It included those words: &ldquo;On account of his services having become unnecessary in consequence of a change of administration due directly to the amalgamation or absorption of the company under the Principal Act.&rdquo;  That is the important part of the amendment which Deputy Doyle moved.  My proposal at this stage is not to take that part out, but only to take out the words &ldquo;and not shown by the amalgamated company to have been caused by a decrease of traffic.&rdquo;  It is a much more limited excision than that which Deputy Doyle dealt with.</P>

      <P>It is a somewhat technical matter.  It seems to me Deputy Doyle's position was that he wanted no reason except one connected with amalgamation.  That is to say, Deputy Doyle wanted to delete everything except what referred to amalgamation.  Deputy Doyle's amendment was:&mdash;&ldquo;In sub-section (1) to delete <Col N="2269" /> from and including the word &ldquo;on,&rdquo; line 30, to the word &ldquo;cause,&rdquo; line 38, and substitute the words &ldquo;on account of or by reason of the amalgamation or absorption of companies effected by or under the Principal Act.&rdquo;  I think Deputy Johnson's amendment would have the same effect: it will delete everything except &ldquo;in consequence of a change of administration due directly to the amalgamation or absorption of the Company.&rdquo;</P>

So far, I am not asking the House to deal with those proposals, but I say that the additional reasons that are included in the section as it stands should not be included in the reasons why those persons should receive a gratuity.  There are certain reasons given which I am not seeking to touch by this amendment, but there are other reasons which are additional, which I am seeking to delete.</P>

    <P>It is necessary to refer to other amendments later on the page to explain the full effect of this amendment. Other amendments later on the page are in accordance with the comments I made in the Committee Stage to have the scheme in Section 4 to a certain <Col N="2271" /> extent readjusted.  This amendment is merely to insert the necessary preamble to later amendments.  It will have the effect of cutting out the words in sub-paragraph (a) and insert&mdash; ing the words in the amendment.  The net result is to have sub-paragraph (a) in the amendment as the proper preamble to (a) as it stands and the four sub-paragraphs, with subsequent changes in some of those paragraphs as denoted in the amendments following on the Paper.  It will be necessary to do this for reasons which will be explained when I come to the relevant sub-paragraph.  The main effect that will be noticed here is that there will have to be cut out certain other preambulatory matter to certain other of the paragraphs as they stand, such as lines 26 and 27, which serve, at the moment, as an introduction to sub-paragraph (ab).  This is introduced to regulate the whole run of paragraph (a)  and the four sub-paragraphs.

      <P>If he has twenty or more completed years of service, an addition of ten-sixtieths of his remuneration and emoluments.</P>

    <P>This amendment and the following one, No. 6, carry out what I agreed to do in answer to a demand of Deputy Johnson, but in carrying out that promise certain considerations arose which have led to something of a change. That change is now denoted in this and the following amendments.  This amendment really establishes the position that was affected with regard to those people whose office or situation was abolished, or whose services were dispensed with.  These people no longer remain in the service of the company. This amendment now puts into one section what was previous to this the effect on these people of the old Schedule to the Railways Act of 1924, as amended by the Bill passed in Committee. It carries on everything exactly, <Col N="2273" /> except that it says that the remuneration is to be calculated at the rate of one-sixtieth.  As the Bill passed Committee, the statement in that connection was, &ldquo;at a rate not exceeding one-sixtieth.&rdquo;  I promised with regard to that that the rate should be one-sixtieth, reserving the other portion for another type of railway servant.  Taking the matter which is spaced in a different way in the amendment, it is taken from the old Schedules and reinserted here with regard to this particular type of employee.  The main change from the Bill, as amended in Committee, is that it puts the calculation at one-sixtieth instead of, as previously, &ldquo;not exceeding one-sixtieth.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendments carry out what was understood in Committee, with one very important exception which, I think, is an omission. If the Minister will look at this amendment from sub-paragraph (d) he will notice that it reads thus: &ldquo;To be calculated at the rate of one-sixtieth of his remuneration and emoluments for every completed year of his service with the amalgamated company or any absorbed company.&rdquo;  There is an omission there after the words &ldquo;amalgamated company,&rdquo; of the words &ldquo;amalgamating company,&rdquo; so that it should read &ldquo;or any amalgamating or absorbed company.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 4, Section 4, to delete lines 4 to 28 and substitute the following words, &ldquo;a lump sum, but if an appeal is taken to the standing arbitrator or arbitrators such arbitrator or arbitrators may, if he or they so <Col N="2275" /> think fit on the hearing of such appeal, award as compensation (in lieu of a lump sum) an annual allowance to be paid to the existing officer or servant during his life, not exceeding in any case two-thirds of his remuneration and emoluments and, subject to that over-riding limitation, not exceeding an annual sum calculated at the rate of one-sixtieth of his remuneration and emoluments for every completed year of his service with the amalgamated company or any amalgamating or absorbed company;</P>

    <P>The effect of this amendment is to fulfill a promise to Deputy Johnson.  It is put in the form that, ordinarily speaking, except in cases referred to in (aa) the compensation shall be a lump sum.  There is a provision made for appeal on that point, so that the company would be able to make a case that that lump sum should be substituted by an annual allowance.  Ordinarily, however, there is to be a lump sum payment in the first instance, and the onus is on the company to get that lump sum changed.</P>

      <P>In page 4 to insert before paragraph (d), line 37, a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d) by the deletion of sub-paragraph (b) thereof and the insertion of the following sub-paragraph in lieu of the sub-paragraph so deleted, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of this Schedule an absence from or discontinuance of employment by any amalgamated or absorbed company for a period of less than one year due to the closing or partial closing <Col N="2276" /> of a branch or department by such company in consequence of civil strife in the years 1922, or 1923, shall not be deemed to be an interruption of the period of service but the period of such temporary absence shall not be reckoned for the purpose of compensation unless the officer or servant was during such absence engaged in service in the National Army forces of Saorstát Eireann when the period of such service shall be reckoned and included in the period of service for the purposes of the Schedule.</P>
    <P>This is to substitute an amendment moved in Committee that I obtained the leave of the House to withdraw, as the Minister stated he could not see his way to accept general exceptions and interruptions of service, but he undertook to consider the case if I re-drafted the amendment.  I do not know whether this re-draft will meet with the approval of the Minister or not, but I submit it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>A point arises in this amendment that I am sure was not intended by Deputy Doyle.  He wants to delete sub-paragraph (b) of Section 5 of the Third Schedule of the Act of 1924.  The sub-paragraph that it is proposed to delete has reference to &ldquo;where any existing officer or servant was temporarily absent from his employment as such officer or servant and during the whole of such absence was engaged in the service of the National Forces of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  The Deputy's amendment, if passed, would wipe that out.  Obviously he does not intend that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to amend the Deputy's amendment in this way: the relevant deletion will be by the deletion of sub-paragraph (b) and the insertion of the following sub-paragraph in lieu of the sub-paragraph so deleted&mdash;the lettering and the numbering will be (b) (1)&mdash;&ldquo;Where any existing officer or servant&rdquo; is then re-enacted, and I propose to add then as (b) (2) certain words instead of what Deputy Doyle has proposed.  Before I give them I might say that what Deputy Doyle seeks to provide is that absence <Col N="2277" /> from or discontinuance of employment by any amalgamated or absorbed company for a period of less than one year due to the closing or partial closing of a branch or department by such company in consequence of civil strife in the years 1922 or 1923, shall be reckoned as temporary disturbance, but that period shall not be reckoned for the purposes of compensation.</P>
    <P>What I propose carries out much the same thing, though somewhat differently phrased, and there is one rather important point of difference, but that is in accordance with a remark made to me by the Deputy on the Committee Stage.  (b) (2) will then read: &ldquo;Without prejudice to the provisions of the preceding clause, numbered (b) (1), where any existing officer or servant was absent from his employment as such officer or servant for a period of less than one year on account of the closing or partial closing of a branch or department of any amalgamating or absorbed company in consequence of civil strife in the years 1922 or 1923&rdquo;&mdash;that is the same&mdash;&ldquo;such absence shall not be deemed to have caused an interruption of his service if otherwise continuous as such officer or servant, but the period of such absence shall not be included in his service as such officer or servant unless he was engaged during such period of absence in service in the National Forces of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is an attempt to put in the full effect of what Deputy Doyle has proposed and to save the effect, that he did not intend, of wiping out sub-paragraph (b).  But there is a distinction &ldquo;such service if otherwise continuous.&rdquo; I asked Deputy Doyle on the Committee Stage if the amendment he was moving was to have the effect of counting in men who were ordinarily employed casually or in a temporary way.  He said it was not his intention to have those brought in, so that the phrase &ldquo;shall not be deemed to have caused an interruption of his service if otherwise continuous as such officer or servant&rdquo; would meet the case, I think.  The Deputy has not seen this new form, and it is very difficult to understand these things simply from hearing them read, but this has the <Col N="2278" /> full effect of his sub-paragraph, with that one exception.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    <P>The portion of the sub-section proposed to be struck out would be found to be extremely impracticable in working, and it is exceedingly vague in draughtsmanship, as I think the Minister will admit.  The Minister's amendment <Col N="2279" /> was obviously drafted with an eye to one particular fund only, without taking into consideration the different rules of the three funds.  The Minister made some extraordinary statements on the Second Reading in regard to the position of the different funds.  He stated that the &ldquo;A&rdquo; Fund, that is, the revenue account of the Great Southern Railways Co., was an insolvent fund.  I think he also said that the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund was, in his opinion, also insolvent.  I mention these matters again in order to give the Minister, if he has reconsidered the matter, an opportunity of withdrawing these statements which, in my opinion, are not correct, and which might be prejudicial to the interests of the members of these funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I corrected myself in that.  I said that the word &ldquo;insolvent&rdquo; was not the word to be used, but instead I used the words &ldquo;actuarily unsound.&rdquo;  Does the Deputy object to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would object to that unless the Minister says that that statement is based upon the last actuarial valuation.  I would go so far as to challenge the statement of the Minister as to the insolvency of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; Fund of the Great Southern.  If the Minister insists in making that statement it means that the whole financial position of the railway is in itself unsound.  I fail to see why the Minister should make himself responsible for that statement or for insisting on repeating such a statement.  In this sub-section the arbitrator is instructed to take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, and that should be sufficiently definite for all parties.  Suppose, for instance, a member of the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund governed by a British statute is made redundant and he is fifty-seven years of age, the rules of the fund provide that he shall have from the fund and not from the company a refund of his contributions. Is it proposed that he shall get, in addition, a refund from the company direct?</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Deputy's amendment is merely to delete a provision that was made here on Committee Stage with regard to taking into consideration the amount which an officer or servant would be entitled to get out of the contributory superannuation or benefit fund that was to be taken into account in a particular way as set down in the schedule.  The Dáil agreed to that after a certain amount of discussion, and the Deputy is now moving to delete it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a thing that should be cleared up.  It was for that purpose that I withdrew the word &ldquo;insolvent&rdquo; and said &ldquo;actuarily unsound.&rdquo; I now have to make a further distinction that <i>per se</i> the &ldquo;A&rdquo; Fund is unsound.  The Deputy has made a statement that if it is insolvent the railway company then must be insolvent. That is quite true, because what happened was that the railway company took on itself the burden of seeing that the benefits were not lost. The &ldquo;A&rdquo; Fund was amalgamated with the Railway Clearing House Fund and both rest on the same basis. To say that one is insolvent could be strictly regarded as meaning that the railway company is insolvent.  The meaning I want to convey by that is that there is no fund built up by these contributions from which the men could at present draw benefits.  They will not be deprived of benefits, but that is due to the fact that the railway company's resources are at the back of these two funds.</P>

    <P>No stamp duty shall be payable in respect of any agreement heretofore made under the Third Schedule to the Principal Act or hereafter to be made under the said Third Schedule as amended by this Act or under this <Col N="2282" /> Act between the amalgamated company and any existing officer or servant or any other officer or servant of the amalgamated company nor in respect of any award heretofore made by the standing arbitrator under the said Third Schedule or hereafter to be made by the standing arbitrator or arbitrators under the said Third Schedule as amended by this Act or under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson had moved an amendment of this type and I intimated that I would get the amendment which he put forward looked at from the point of view of drafting and see how it could be fitted in here. I would like to call attention to this, because I am not sure how far Deputy Johnson's amendment is supposed to go.  It may, in its present form, appear to be retrospective, because it talks of &ldquo;any agreement heretofore made,&rdquo; but it is not in fact retrospective except to a very limited extent.  If there has been any agreement stamped there can be no refund of whatever money was expended upon that stamping. If there has been an agreement already come to but not heretofore stamped then this section applies. There is no question of a refund where expenses have been incurred by reason of stamping.  But where there have been agreements and these have not yet been stamped then no stamp duty will arise and the person will not be liable for stamp duty.</P>

    <P>In page 5, Section 6, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;Schedule,&rdquo; line 3, up to and including the word <Col N="2283" />&ldquo;before,&rdquo; line 5, and substitute the words &ldquo;which arises subsequent to.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that we may discuss the issue raised in this amendment with amendments 13 and 18.  That method would save time.  I prefer Amendment 18 as a matter of fact if it can be agreed upon. Amendments 12 and 13 were only put forward as alternatives not quite as satisfactory perhaps as 18.  The question Deputy Hewat has just raised about retrospective legislation is really involved in this question.  The matter was discussed, perhaps not quite intelligently, the other day, when certain points were made that only legal decisions or the arbitrator's actual awards should be free from being affected by any subsequent legislation.  This series of amendments is intended to make secure from the effects of this revised legislation the men who suffered loss and who, under the existing law, were entitled to certain compensations.  If the ordinary processes had been allowed to carry on they would have received compensation on the basis of the existing law.</P>
    <P>To illustrate my point, I have a list of twenty-three cases before me from one association out of three or four associations.  These were men on whose behalf notices were served by the company as far back in some cases as May, 1925, and extending in the case of some to November, 1925.  A notice was served upon the company and claims made in respect to losses, claims according to the then existing law.  Subsequently, the men's solicitor served notice upon the company's solicitor when no satisfaction was received by application direct to the company.  A man, through his solicitor, served notice upon the company's solicitor in December, 1925, and in January and February of this year.  There was no question all this time of any new legislation, and the rights of the railway servant or the ex-employee, as the case might be, were, and should be, secured to him by the law.  If the ordinary processes were being carried out, decisions would have been made by the arbitrator in respect to those cases. The solicitor for the claimants, after <Col N="2284" /> considerable delay waiting for an answer from the company's solicitor, had to serve notice upon the latter in these terms:&mdash;&ldquo;In default of delivery of answers in the foregoing cases within one week from receipt hereof copies of application will be sent to the standing arbitrator, and all such steps as will be necessary will be taken for the purpose of having appeals brought on for hearing without further delay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No result came from that notice. There was, as I think, deliberate delay, having in mind the possibility of future legislation.  Claims were then submitted to the standing arbitrator asking him to have the cases heard, because it was the opinion of the claimants, through their solicitor, that they were being unduly held up.  The reply to that was an intimation that he could take no further steps as he had handed in his resignation.  Now we are asked to legislate in such a way as to make the position of these men under the new legislation worse than under the legislation which covered them up to the date of the introduction of this Bill.  I think that in all equity and reason the cases of railway servants should remain covered by the law that existed up to the time of the passing of this Act or some date, at any rate.  I am not sticking to the phrase &ldquo;the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  I draw attention to what, perhaps, is a very sensible error, if it was an error, in the marginal title of this Bill, which speaks of the 26th May, 1926.  I think that was much more sensible than the section itself.  But let us fix a date which would preclude what the Minister feared, a shoal of applications between now and, say, nine months after the Seanad has held up this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want that.  I do not want the Seanad to hold up the Bill for the purpose of allowing large numbers of people to put in applications.  Let us fix a date, say, 1st May this year, or the date of the passing of the Bill through the Dáil.  That would obviate the risk of a considerable number of new applications being put forward.  In any case, whatever date is fixed.  I ask the House to realise that there is injustice being done if we make this Act retrospective as covering the cases of men <Col N="2285" /> who, if the ordinary processes of the law had proceeded, would have had their claims secured.  But, in addition to this type of man, there has been a considerable number who were put off by the company from any agreement, awaiting the decision of the arbitrator in other cases.  These are claims which were lodged prior to the date of the Second Reading of this Bill.  Those cases, surely, ought to be judged according to the Act which existed at the time and to the law which existed at the time the claims were lodged.  I think that is a very reasonable and equitable proposition, and to do anything different from that would be injustice and entirely outside what the Dáil has declared to be its intention, not to legislate retrospectively.  I move amendment 12.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I missed the portion of the debate on the Committee Stage of this Bill when this particular amendment was carried, because I think if Deputies in the House now will only search their memories they will clearly remember that the Minister, in response to a very definite question put to him by Deputy Cooper, stated that he would move the deletion of the retrospective section that was in the Bill when it came up on the Committee Stage.  The insertion of Section 6, and I say this with due deliberation, is being looked upon by the railway people as a definite and distinct breach of the honourable understanding and undertaking given by the Minister on the Second Reading of the Bill. I notice that Deputy McGoldrick, who is not here now&mdash;judging from the official reports he did not give very much of an explanation in support of his amendment&mdash;stated that &ldquo;if Section 6 is deleted from the Bill it will be necessary to provide a definite date on which the Bill operates.  Otherwise the parties will not know the position that may arise before the Bill becomes law.&rdquo;  It is a most unusual thing, when discussing a measure that is passing through the House, to refer to the date of its coming into operation in language of that kind.  If I understand the procedure correctly, the date on which an Act comes into operation <Col N="2286" /> is that on which it receives the assent of the Governor-General.  I would like to know if that is so.</P>

      <P>We have heard from the Minister for Justice the very distinct and definite declaration that retrospective legislation could not, and cannot, be justified except in case of a great national emergency.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in agreeing to the request of Deputy Cooper on the Second Reading of this Bill admitted that, and therefore I do not think he should have proceeded to give effect in this qualified way to his promise.  The Minister stated that the retrospective side of it is limited to cases where there have not been agreements. If my information is correct, the arbitrator tendered his resignation on or about the date on which this amending Bill was circulated in the public Press.  If, in the ordinary course of events, the arbitrator had continued to serve or if the Chief Justice, on his resignation, had appointed someone in his place, the person acting as arbitrator would have heard the many cases that Deputy Johnson has referred to since the date of the printing of the measure, which was about the date of the arbitrator's resignation.</P>

The number of cases likely to have been dealt with in the intervening period would have been something less than 30.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, and I am in fairly intimate touch with the solicitor of our own organisation, I say, and this list which the Minister has of the biggest organisation of railwaymen is proof, that nothing has been done to rush the hearing of cases since the publication of this measure.  We took the view that if the measure passed in its present form it would be useless for organisations representing railwaymen to spend money in legal costs in bringing forward their cases.  I can give the House an assurance that no attempt whatsoever has been made to rush cases, especially in view of the fact that we were aware that the arbitrator had resigned and no one had been appointed in his place.  I am putting it that genuine cases that would come up in the ordinary way under the old law are the only kind of cases I want protection for under this Bill. There is a list of 23 cases cited by the National Union of Railwaymen, which is the biggest organisation catering for any branch of the Irish railway service. As I have said, there are only a few cases so far as the Railway Clerks' Association is concerned.  I am not in a position to say how many, but I know there are only a few cases concerning the Amalgamated Union of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen.  It is for the House now to say if it will allow the Minister to qualify the undertaking given by him on the Second Reading Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quote to the House a case since the publication of this measure.  The Secretary of the Railway Clerks' Association, Senator O'Farrell, saw the General Manager of the Southern Railways Company for the purpose of securing an agreement.  Senator O'Farrell acted on behalf of the Railway Clerks' Association, and on behalf of a member of the Union who felt he had not been given a position analogous <Col N="2289" /> to the one he held in the old absorbed company.  The General Manager came to an honourable agreement or understanding with Senator O'Farrell, who conveyed the result to the individual concerned, but since the publication of this measure, some time in the middle of April, the General Manager has gone back completely on the understanding arrived at with Senator O'Farrell, simply and solely, in our opinion, because of the wording of this measure.  He thought that the wording of this measure if it were passed into law would deprive the member of rights he was entitled to under the old Act.  I will give the Minister the name of the individual concerned, and a copy of the correspondence that has taken place in regard to that case.  I think the Minister should not bring into the Bill a section of this kind, which would prevent an agreement such as I have referred to being carried out, as it should be, in an honourable way.  I entirely object to, and protest against, the insertion of this section.  I think there is room for compromise in this, but certainly we cannot have any compromise or understanding after the date inserted, namely, the 26th March.</P>
    <P>If I were disposed to consider any amendment that could be moved at this stage, and that would be likely to meet the case in a most reasonable way, I would say Amendment 18 is the only amendment suitable.  Of course, the date would need to be altered.  I will give the Minister credit for giving inspiration to the printer when he placed in the marginal column the 26th May instead of the 26th March, as suggested by Deputy McGoldrick.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin has quoted me once or twice with regard to retrospective legislation.  I should say that my objection to retrospective legislation is an objection to re-opening issues that have been decided either by a court of law, by the Land Commission, or by an arbitrator.  That is my chief objection, because it creates a condition of instability that is completely injurious to all progress and to all security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2290" /> This amendment of Deputy Johnson raises a question, not of principle, but of expediency.  I would like to learn from the Minister why we should take the date of the introduction of the measure as the datum date.  It is the custom&mdash;and very rightly and wisely the custom&mdash;to give every measure that is introduced in the Dáil a First Reading in order that Deputies may see what its contents are.  I suggest the datum date should be on the Second Reading.  It is on the Second Reading that the Dáil adopts the principle of a measure, and in my opinion the Second Reading should be taken as the datum date and the date by which agreements should be determined, unless there is some other consideration.</P>
    <P>On this point I think there is another consideration, and that is the resignation of the arbitrator.  I think it is not unfair to say that disputes which were pending before the old arbitrator should be judged under the old conditions. The Minister has stated that the arbitrator resigned on the 1st May. There is not an enormous difference between the 26th March and the 1st May.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>The Minister will probably deal with that matter in the course of his reply.  Deputy Johnson's offer to accept the 1st May as the datum date seems to me&mdash;not having heard what the Minister has to say&mdash; a fair one and, unless there are very strong considerations opposing it, I would urge the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I clear up a point of doubt?  The issue between the Minister and ourselves is not so much the date; that is capable of adjustment. I cannot imagine that the Minister is insisting that in future agreements that <Col N="2291" /> are made by the company, or decisions made by the arbitrator, shall be under the new provisions where the issue raised, the claim lodged, and the appeal made to the arbitrator were in respect of a dismissal or a reduction of salary or something of that kind long before this Bill was brought forward.  Otherwise you are inviting litigants to hold up the processes of law as long as possible in the hope that they may be able to induce legislators to pass legislation which will prejudice in their favour judges' decisions in the future.</P>
      <P>The case we make here is that the company deliberately held up proposals for agreement and, as a consequence, the arbitrator's hands were tied and his opportunities for arriving at decisions were delayed by the conscious and deliberate action of the railway company.  That being the case, it is no use altering the date, because if the company continue to refuse to come to an agreement, and if the appointment of a new arbitrator is to be delayed, or if his sittings are going to be prolonged, then no change is made.</P>
      <P>My contention is that the date of dismissal, the date of reduction in salary, the date on which a change is made in the railway servants' position &mdash;the date of the happening of the event, as we phrase it in the amendment&mdash;should be the date, and if that date is the 26th March, the 26th May, or the date of the passing of the Act, then I say those dates are comparatively immaterial.  The important date is the date of the event which gave rise to the claim, or, if you like, the date of the lodging of the claim, and not the date of the agreement or the decision of the arbitrator which is deliberately prolonged.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendment moved by Deputy Johnson and supported by Deputy Davin.  It is very unfair that the claims already lodged with the arbitrator should come within the scope of this amending Bill.  When a debate took place on Deputy McGoldrick's proposal on the Committee Stage various points of view were expressed as to the matters involved.  The Minister, <Col N="2292" /> in the course of his statement, said: &ldquo;I think it will be obvious to the Dáil that you cannot possibly have Deputy Doyle's amendment as it stands because it would allow of appeals being lodged any time before the passing of the Act.&rdquo;  The case I wanted to make was that whatever method was arranged for the lodging of claims for compensation, they were taken in such order that, in the case of a number being grouped, only one case was dealt with, although they were all lodged on the one date. Consequently, if the date is now fixed it will naturally affect these applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that what the House is trying to arrive at is some principle on which to act in cases of the kind under discussion.  We have had two or three examples where Ministers brought in legislation, and in one of these cases the Bill was withdrawn by the Minister in recognition of the feeling in the House that retrospective legislation was not desirable if it could at all be avoided.  On the second occasion we had the Rent Restrictions Act. Pretty much the same sort of consideration was put before the House in that matter when it was claimed on behalf of house-owners, and cases were cited that grave injustice had been done.  Still the House in its wisdom would not deal with cases which had occurred before the introduction of the measure.  Following the line that induced the House to come to the decision they did in these two cases, when this Bill was in Committee, it was decided that the operations of the amending Bill should be only retrospective up to the date of the introduction of the Bill.  Deputy Johnson brings forward a case where applications were lodged some considerable time ago to be heard before the arbitrator, and on the ground that there was delay in bringing them before the arbitrator the contention is advanced that they should be included under the operations of the old Act and not under the operations of this amending Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot agree that that is sound.  I can quite follow the arguments that people who lodged their claims, as long <Col N="2293" /> ago as May or November last year, would feel they have a grievance.  But I cannot see that this House, without upsetting all the decisions that have been come to in connection with this matter, can decide that cases that have not been heard must be heard under legislation which is dead.  This amending Bill is brought in to amend the original Act under which, up to a certain point, the decisions were governed. What induced this amending Bill to be brought in?  I take it that the reason for bringing this amending Bill before the House is based on the assumption that the decisions come to by the arbitrator were not such as were originally intended in connection with the Act.</P>
    <P>The House, in passing an amending Bill, rather accepts that position. Therefore, as regards the cases that were heard, we may assume that the decisions had been come to, and that the people concerned got the benefit of them but they are decisions that are contrary to the reading that the House now puts upon the original Act by passing this amending Bill.  Therefore, although there are people whose cases have not been heard who, undoubtedly, will feel they have a grievance, they will eventually get decisions on the basis of what this House says was the intention of the original Act.  I think the amendment proposed by Deputy Johnson would cause as much litigation and difficulty as the state of affairs that arose out of the original Act.  It would have to be decided whether the decision should have been come to before or whether it shall run right up to the time when the new arbitrator is appointed.  I think, broadly speaking, the House must arrive at some fixed principle in this matter.  I submit that the House having come to a decision on the original Act, quite recently, has either got to affirm that decision by making a similar decision in this Bill, or they are going to establish a state of chaos in which every individual case of this kind that might come up is going to be decided on a different basis.  Ultimately that will cause additional chaos and there will be no governing principle whatsoever.</P>

      <P>I want to ask&mdash;I am forced to do so as a result of what Deputy Hewat stated&mdash;was the Minister aware on 25th or 26th March that it was the intention of the arbitrator to resign, and are we to understand that it was only a formal matter, the handing in of this resignation of 1st May? I would also like to ask did the Minister himself, or his Department, take effective steps to get in touch with the Chief Justice to see that a new arbitrator was appointed after the date of 26th March or the 1st May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the last question first.  I cannot say whether the date of the actual resignation was the 1st of May.  It was some time in May, and not later than the 3rd.  Of that there cannot be very much doubt.  It was the 1st, 2nd or 3rd of May that the arbitrator resigned.  I was given to understand that on a date, somewhere about two days from the actual resignation, the company received word from the arbitrator that he was going to proceed to hear cases. I do know, prior to that, certainly not 25th March, but somewhere in the early days of April, the arbitrator had talked of resignation.  As to steps taken by me I have nothing to do with the arbitrator and nothing to do with his appointment. I have not even to initiate anything in connection with his appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that no steps were taken, and that nothing will be done to appoint a new arbitrator until this measure goes through and the cases of men which have been pending for some time will be prejudiced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say anything about that.  I am asked if I had taken any steps in reference to the appointment, and I say, no.  I have no business to take any steps with reference to the appointment.  It was outside my duty to make representations to the Chief Justice or to the railway company or to anybody in connection with the appointment of the arbitrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, on this matter of retrospection and the promises I made I was very glad to get Deputy Cooper's statement <Col N="2295" /> to-day, because Deputy Gorey and Deputy Hewat previously gave their statements about the promise to withdraw Section 6.  Deputy Gorey said the last day what Deputy Cooper said to-day, that his objection was to upsetting cases which were already decided. Deputy Hewat came to the same decision, and said much the same thing. That is all I have to say in regard to retrospection.  I had very clearly before my mind in the original Railways Act that the date of the whole Third Schedule had been put back to the 3rd April, 1924, in a Bill which did not pass the Oireachtas until the end of July of that year.  As regards all the benefits under the Schedule in so far as there was any question of date concerned, the date was put back to the date of the introduction of the Railways Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gorey was speaking on Second Reading.  On the Committee Stage he referred to the objection that he had taken on Second Reading to what was called vaguely retrospective, and he analysed it and gave as his meaning that he would consider it retrospective if the Bill upset decisions then arrived at; that is to say, on the date of Second Reading. If you want the date that Deputy Gorey was obviously referring to, I think Deputy Cooper has spoken distinctly here of the date of Second Reading.  Deputy Cooper makes the distinction that inasmuch as nobody knows anything about a Bill when leave to introduce it is given you could not really be said to have had notice of what is in it.  People do not know <Col N="2296" /> how their rights are going to be affected until the Second Reading comes and until the Bill is produced in public for the first time.  I did consider that this whole retrospective matter had been properly dealt with.  I think Deputy Davin himself has shown how absurd it would be to let this run in the ordinary way, and to have the date of operation be the date of the passing of the Bill.  The Deputy has said that ordinarily speaking the operation of the Bill dates from the date on which it is signed.  In view of the number of cases lodged, if the Bill were to operate from the date of the passing of the Act it would be absurd. You might as well tear up the amending Bill.  Every case that could possibly come on has been listed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to answer is the question of the operation of the amending Bill.  There are three amendments before us.  I want to have them considered in their relation to cases.  Amendment 12, if carried, would have it that the amended schedule would govern claims for compensation under the schedule in cases which arose subsequent to the 26th March.  Any case which has arisen prior to the 26th March would be ruled by the old Third Schedule.  Amendment 13 would read: &ldquo;The Third Schedule to the Principal Act, as amended in this Act, shall govern every claim for compensation under the said Third Schedule in respect of which no claim was submitted to the amalgamated company before 26th March, 1926.&rdquo;  Inasmuch as No. 13 is <Col N="2297" /> something definite and more easily understood, it is a better amendment. Amendment 18 is the one Deputy Johnson states he prefers.  It states: &ldquo;... if the date of the happening of the event giving rise to the claim occurred before the passing of this Act or in accordance with the provisions of the said Third Schedule.&rdquo;  At the moment there are 337 cases lodged with the company.  I am pretty certain that before 22nd April there were 235 applications lodged with the company. If the old schedule, by reason of any of these amendments, is going to be made apply to the 337 cases we have lost so much time in debating this amending Bill, because these 337 cases really do include most of the cases where the reason for dismissal is alleged to be mainly economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason why no arbitrator was appointed.  The cases would not be heard until this Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say, the Chief Justice has been deficient in his duty in not appointing an arbitrator between the 1st May and to-day&mdash; because he wanted to prevent cases being heard.  It lies completely in the hands of the Chief Justice, but the Chief Justice cannot appoint until the resignation has been received.  Deputy Cooper has talked about the date of the Second Reading, or some other date.  Would Deputy Cooper take Section 6 as it stands:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Third Schedule as amended by this Act shall govern every claim for compensation in respect of which the amount of the compensation was not fixed either by agreement or by the standing arbitrator or arbitrators before the 26th day of March.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Really to put into that clause any date beyond 26th March makes no difference whatever.  The last award made by the arbitrator was on the 25th March.  There were certain awards made by the arbitrator on the 26th March, but they were not signed until some date in April.  If the phrase accepted be &ldquo;agreement made&rdquo; or &ldquo;decision of the standing arbitrator pronounced,&rdquo; it really does not matter whether it is the 26th day of March or <Col N="2298" /> any date up to the present day, because it has no effect.  The number of cases is in no way increased.  But for the rest of these amendments the wider of them, particularly No. 18, as it stands, would have the effect of simply tearing up the present Bill.  If that is passed the amending Bill is actually no use, because the old schedule will apply to every case lodged with the company, and those cases at the moment number 337, and that number is believed to include pretty well every case that could come before the company about which any appeal could be taken at all.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey and Deputy Cooper have explained their points of view and really these points of view seem to have met with approval except from the Labour Deputies. With regard to the Bill dating back to the introduction of the measure. <Col N="2299" /> if we accept Deputy Cooper's amendment, to the date of the Second Reading, once you have given notice of the intention to change, nobody can say where he has any rights, that he would have these rights no more.  I am only giving the figures.  Deputy Gorey is quite correct in saying that we ought not to be concerned with these cases. If there were only one or two cases it might be worth while, for the sake of harmony, to move forward, but I am simply pointing out&mdash;I cannot give the cases date by date&mdash;that if Amendment 18 can be carried, the 337 cases will be determined by the old Schedule. I should say in the future there will not be anything like a quarter of that number decided by the new Schedule in the seven year period.  On the 22nd April there were 235 cases.  I could not fit these into Amendments 12 and 13. I think the House should accept the principle which really was accepted on the Committee Stage, that the retrospective idea to which the Dáil objected was really wiped out, that we got away from the point of upsetting decisions, awards or agreements made.  That position will be achieved by Section 6 as amended, by the amendment I have put down here.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, before Section 7, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators shall have power to administer oaths or take the affirmations of the parties and witnesses appearing, to make such interlocutory orders by way of discovery as can be made by a Judge in an action in the High Court, and to award costs in his or their discretion and direct to and by whom and in what manner these costs or any part thereof shall be paid.  All such costs shall at or after the appeal be referred to taxation to the same officers and in the like manner and upon the like scale as the costs of an action tried by a Judge of the High Court.</P>
      <P>(2)  The parties and all persons claiming through them respectively shall, subject to any legal objection, submit to be examined at the appeal on oath or affirmation in relation to the matters at issue and shall, subject as aforesaid, produce before the standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators all books, deeds, papers, accounts, writings, records and documents, within their possession or power respectively which may be required or called for, and do all other things that the standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators may require.</P>
      <P>(3)  The standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators may at any time correct any mistake or error in an award arising from any accidental slip or omission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  The standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators may state an <Col N="2304" /> award, as to the whole or part thereof, in the form of a special case for the opinion of the High Court, and may at any stage of the proceedings state in the form of a special case for the opinion of the High Court any question of law arising in the course of the proceedings and any party may appeal to the High Court from any refusal of the standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators to state a special case.</P>
    <P>(5)  Any party to an appeal before the standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators may sue out a writ of subpoena and testificandum or a writ of subpoena duces tecum, but no person shall be compelled under any such writ to produce any document which he could not be compelled to produce on the trial of an action.</P>
    <P>(6)  Any award of the standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators may, by leave of a Judge of the High Court, be enforced in the same manner as a judgment or order to the same effect.</P>
    <P>(7)  The standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators shall sit in open court; and every appeal shall be entered in the &ldquo;Legal Diary&rdquo; for hearing at such time and place as the standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators may determine.</P>
    <P>This amendment was put down for the Committee Stage, and the Minister promised to give consideration to the idea expressed in it.  He has put forward, in the name of Deputy Dolan, an alternative, seeking to embody most of the propositions contained in my amendment.  But from my point of view, there is one considerable defect. That is, when an award has been made by the arbitrator, if the company are recalcitrant, as judging by their recent action they may well be, it will require that the applicant must go to the courts to get a judgment before the arbitrator's award can be enforced. That is simply adding to the trouble and to the cost laid upon the applicant. My proposal sought to avoid the necessity for such an appeal to the courts. I do not know whether that is possible, within the Minister's idea of what the powers of the arbitrator should be, but I think it is a very grievous defect that <Col N="2305" /> an applicant who has had an award made may be obliged to go to the courts for formal judgment and incur the delay and risk which are always possible under the law and the expense involved, whereas the proposition that I put forward would ensure that the arbitrator's judgment itself would have the effect of a judgment of the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If amendment No. 15 be compared with the amendment now down in the name of Deputy Dolan, the difference can quite easily be seen.  Some points were dropped for one reason, and some for another. Deputy Johnson stated, with regard to Amendment 15, when previously moving it in Committee, that it was to give the arbitrator here such powers as an arbitrator in England would have under the General Arbitration Act of 1894 or 1899.  When that was examined, we found that there were certain things in this amendment about interlocutory actions which, with the whole of Section 5, were not, in fact, given under the General Arbitration Act, to which reference was made.  There was this further consideration given to the matter. The Arbitration Act to which Deputy Johnson had referred was one drawn up to meet all cases of arbitration, and if there were special regulations being made with regard to railway arbitration, viewing the special types of cases that might fall for discussion before such an arbitrator, undoubtedly all the things that were put into the General Arbitration Act would not have been included.  There was then considered what would be necessary in order to leave the arbitrator fully armed with all the powers that seemed requisite for the matters likely to come before him.  The amendment in Deputy Dolan's name seems to meet that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson raises the point&mdash;to put it in another way&mdash;that Section 6 of Amendment 15 has been left out and has been substituted in part only by Section 4 of Amendment 16.  Section 4 seems to be the only material point&mdash; to allow a person who had got an award to have some way of recovering that award if the railway company proved intractable.  In answer to Deputy <Col N="2306" /> Johnson, I may say there has been no case in which the railway company failed to meet an award.  I am afraid Deputy Johnson is still under a misapprehension as to the litigation that took place on one point.  That had not to do with failure to meet an award made by the arbitrator.  It was a mixed question of superannuation and award, and it was the superannuation question that was really litigated.  The Deputy objected to Section 4 of Amendment 16, because it would cause further expense to be incurred by the successful applicant in the case.  But so would Section 6.  Section 6 is not secured without expense, and Section 4 really gives as much as seems to be required by any applicant arising out of any arbitration that may come from the Railways Act of 1924, as amended by this Bill.  The only point in issue is the question of recovering the money. It is set down here that it shall be a simple contract debt, recoverable by action at law, and that covers such matters as costs going against the person unsuccessful, and it covers a further matter.  If we are to take Section 6, the case is thrown definitely into the High Court, whereas if it is dealt with in this way, then according to the amount of the debt the appeal to a different court will lie, and corresponding to whatever court has to be resorted to, will be the question of costs.  This is an attempt to meet any situation that is likely to arise and to minimise the expense.</P>
    <P>There is one change that will have to be made in Amendment 16, if I am at liberty to refer to it on this amendment. At present sub-section (1) refers to &ldquo;the standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators,&rdquo; and then in the last two lines it seems to refer only to &ldquo;the arbitrator,&rdquo; so that a grammatical change will have to be made.  The words will have to be changed to &ldquo;given to his or their satisfaction&rdquo; to cover the case of the arbitrators, and the last words will have to be &ldquo;before him or them.&rdquo;  With that amendment made, I put it to Deputy Johnson that Amendment 16 really meets most of the points he is seeking to deal with without the necessity of Section 6 of Amendment 15, which would not lessen <Col N="2307" /> any expense that might be incurred under Section 4 of Amendment 16.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, I think the amendment in the name of the Minister fairly well meets the demand that was put up, bearing in mind what we had under consideration at the time.  There is one point, however, that I think it is right to draw the Minister's attention to.  It is for him to say whether a change should be made in it or not.  Under the existing conditions, the registrar and officials of the court, or the arbitrator's servants, are composed of officials of the railway company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that anything has happened, or is likely to happen, which will in any way involve the reputation of the officials who are acting up to the present but, like the policeman in the play that we have witnessed at the Abbey Theatre, you might as well say that the official in this case could come along and say: &ldquo;Any statement that you make will be taken down and, if necessary, altered and used in evidence against you.&rdquo;  That could happen so long as the officials of the court are in the service of the company.  I am merely drawing the Minister's attention to this particular flaw both in Amendments 15 and 16, so that if he desires he may rectify it.  So far as I know, the officials who are acting are quite honourable men.  There may not be any necessity to make any alterations in the Minister's amendment, as it appears on the Paper, but it is not usual in a case of this kind to have the registrar of the courts the servant of the plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing one were to accept the position as stated by Deputy Davin, are we to proceed to take steps against any unfair use of the officials of the registrar by the company?  That is not alleged by the Deputy.  I do not think it can be done under an amendment which is really not dealing with the personnel round <Col N="2308" /> the arbitrator but with his award.  The matter should be left as it is, and if it were found afterwards that there was a discrimination against one party in any arbitration it would be a matter to be referred to the Chief Justice and it would be left to the Chief Justice to regulate under the terms of the appointment that a condition should be attached that the officials shall be drawn from a source which the Chief Justice shall designate.  I do not think we could amend an amendment dealing with the arbitrator so as to bring in the question of a staff or a clerk for the arbitrator.  I think the Deputy had better leave it as it stands, and if any obvious unfairness arises later it can be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it your opinion that the Chief Justice would have the power under the amendment to make an appointment of that kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment has nothing to do with it, but if the thing arose, the Chief Justice, acting under sub-section (8) of the old schedule, should be able to make it a condition that the staff should be supplied to the arbitrator.  As it is, the staff is supplied at the railway's expense, and thus it is a saving on the applicant.  I think it had better be left alone until the necessity arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not press the amendment.  I will ask the Minister if he will consider, before this Bill goes to the Seanad, whether it would not be to the general advantage to provide that the hearing of any cases shall be, as they would be, in an open court, and to leave it at that, as provided in the amendment in my name, because I think the proposition will be brought forward, perhaps in a slightly amended form, in the Seanad; I would ask the Minister to consider the question in the meantime.</P>
      <P>Amendment 15, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Amendment 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before Section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators shall have power <Col N="2309" /> to administer oaths, and to award costs in his or their discretion and direct to and by whom and in what manner these costs or any part thereof shall be paid, and to measure the amount of such costs and to require security for costs to be given to his satisfaction by any party at any stage of the proceedings before him.</P>
    <P>(2)  The standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators shall have the like powers of enforcing the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents as are possessed by the High Court.</P>
    <P>(3)  The standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators may at any time correct any clerical mistake or error in an award arising from any accidental slip or omission.</P>
    <P>(4)  Any sum payable under an award made by the standing arbitrator or arbitrators shall be a simple contract debt recoverable by action at law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to make a slight alteration in amendment 16.  Sub-section (1) has reference to the standing arbitrator or Board of Arbitrators.  The last two lines read &ldquo;to his satisfaction by any party at any stage of the proceedings before him.&rdquo;  That should be made to read: &ldquo;to his or their satisfaction by any party at any stage of the proceedings before him or them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendment 16 as, by leave, amended, put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 17:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before Section 7, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person entitled to an annual allowance as compensation under the Third Schedule to the Principal Act shall, so long as such allowance shall not have been wholly commuted, be entitled to receive payment of such compensation at such and the like intervals (calculated from the date of the event giving rise to his claim to compensation) as those at which his salary or wages were payable immediately before the occurrence of that event, and every award of compensation to be made by the standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators, <Col N="2310" /> shall give effect to this provision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought this would be the type of amendment that would be brought in by the Minister in the ordinary way, and certainly it is one which I assume he will have no objection to.  It is the custom in every case I know of for a superannuitant to receive his pension at the same time as he receives his salary.  Under the Bill as it stands the company need only pay the amount annually, that is twelve months after the date of the decision of the arbitrator.  If the Minister leaves the matter as it stands it will mean that considerable hardship will be imposed on the people who will get pensions in the ordinary way, that is provided the company only paid them annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act has reference also to annual allowances, and this amendment is somewhat contradictory in terms.  The big difficulty would be that there always has to be verification in respect of the person in receipt of the annuity being alive.  If there is going to be a weekly payment to a person in receipt of pay by weekly intervals and compensation also on that basis, and if that person went abroad, and certain people in receipt of annuities have gone abroad, inquiries would have to be instituted each week with regard to the existence of the person.  That would throw an enormous extra burden on the railway company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not; but I am informed that there were quite a number.  I also understand that the intervals would vary very much&mdash; weekly, monthly, and so forth.  There seems to me to be no good reason for adopting this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I just desire to say that a case was put up to me in which there was a delay in paying an award, and proceedings were about to be taken in the courts to enforce the payment of that award, but it was found that there was no right until twelve months had elapsed to claim any money, and so the party could not go to the courts to enforce the award until twelve months had elapsed.  What is sought here is, that in making his award the arbitrator shall order that payment shall be made at such intervals as he would decide.  I do not think that the question of period matters very much, that is to say, whether it is weekly, monthly, or quarterly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consult Civil Service precedent on this matter?  When a civil servant gets a pension he is paid either weekly or monthly, and there should be no difficulty in this case.  Perhaps the Minister would look into the matter before the Bill reaches the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the ordinary practice of railway companies in the case of pensioners, apart from the operations of this Bill, to pay such pensions at whatever stated period the <Col N="2312" /> men were in the habit of being paid previous to their retirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right in regard to that, but these are generally old men who are not going to leave the country.  Judging from what has happened already, that is not going to be the case with many of those who get pensions under this measure, and that is going to make a big difference.  The suggestion of weekly or monthly payments is really absurd.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;If any existing officer or servant shall feel aggrieved by the decision of the amalgamated company on any matter to be determined by it under the foregoing rules, or if any dispute or question shall arise between any existing officer or servant and the amalgamated company on any matter arising under this Schedule, such existing officer or servant may appeal to a standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators appointed by the Chief Justice who shall hear and determine such appeal and whose decision thereon shall be final.  The amount of the fee payable to such standing arbitrator or to each member of such board of arbitrators on any such appeal shall be fixed by the Chief Justice and shall be paid by the amalgamated company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That does not state who is to initiate it, but the procedure in the case of the arbitrator who has just resigned was that the interested party, the applicant, took the initiative, and on that the Chief Justice made the appointment.

      <P>We come to the sub-heads now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to some matters under sub-head A.  I notice from the Estimates that there are shown to be borne on the Vote for officers in Classes 2 and 3, 2,377 auxiliary postmen who work not more than 35 hours per week, or, in other words, 2,377 part-time employees.  In addition, I find 987 allowance deliverers, people who work not more than 18 hours per week, making a total of 3,364 part-time employees engaged in the delivery and collection of mails. Side by side with this figure I find that there are only 1,326 established postmen.  I think that this is an opportune time to refer to the Post Office policy in connection with part-time employment. Here we have a statement showing that there are two and a half <Col N="2316" /> part-time employes to every one established officer.  I think that that is a state of affairs that ought not in all equity be allowed to continue.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, as the executive head of the Post Office, is responsible for this, and I would have liked to hear in his speech some reference to the question of abolishing this class of labour.</P>
      <P>Attached to the Head Office in Dublin there are about 250 part-time employees. A considerable number of these do no more than three hours' work per day, during which they handle important registered letters and parcels, and in some cases actual cash, and are paid the munificent wage of 19/6 per week, less Unemployment and National Health Insurance contributions. With such men engaged in handling cash, registered letters and negotiable securities, is it any wonder that we find under another sub-head a provision for £12,000 for losses by default? Surely the Minister cannot expect to get trustworthy, honest men at a wage of 19/6 per week, less certain contributions. I think that that state of affairs ought not to be allowed to continue, and I am going to suggest to the Minister here, as I did in another place, that some of the ardour and enthusiasm he has shown for protection should be devoted to these 3,364 part-time badly-paid employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is time that we had some declaration from the Minister as to what his policy is in this matter, and what he proposes to do to absorb these part-time employees.  I would suggest that if he were to take an interest in the matter he would find it not at all impossible to organise the service in such a way as to provide full-time employment for all these people.  There is another matter to which I want to refer, and that is, the deferment of the increments of post office officials who participated in the strike of September, 1922.  That strike was settled largely on an assurance that there would be no victimisation.  Following the resumption of work we were told that this assurance only meant no dismissals and that the Department was free to impose consequential victimisation. The increments of officers who participated <Col N="2317" /> in the strike were deferred by nineteen days, the period of the strike. That meant that an officer who was due for his increment, say, on the 1st January each year, had the increment deferred until the 19th January.  It was not a loss in the first year only, but a loss that would be suffered by the officer every year until he reached the maximum of his class.</P>
    <P>I say that that is a most ill-considered punishment, and I want the Dáil to observe the incidence of the punishment.  In the case of an officer who was at the minimum of his scale it meant that he would suffer that loss every year until he reached his maximum. In the case of an officer who was half way up the scale, it only meant that he would suffer the loss for half the period, and an officer who was at the maximum got scot free of all punishment.  But there is another aspect of this.  Officers were told that that period would not be counted for pension purposes; that meant that those nineteen days would be deducted from their total services when going on pension.  Now, nineteen days do not seem very much, but as only whole years of service count for pension it might mean that those nineteen days' deduction would break a complete year and that a man going on pension would be pensioned on a year's less service than he actually had.  That punishment is a cause of resentment and, I think, of justifiable resentment.</P>
    <P>I think that punishment has been imposed in the face of a very definite assurance that there would be no victimisation. I think that both on the grounds of honour and on the grounds of equity that the time has arrived when those incremental dates should be restored.  It would take only a very small sum to do it.  I think that the sum which would be expended in the restoration of the incremental dates would be a very small price to pay for the removal of discontent, distrust and resentment which is naturally felt at the imposition of such an ill-considered punishment.  The Minister may tell me that a man who has not rendered services cannot be allowed to calculate days for pension or incremental purposes. I suggest to the Minister that <Col N="2318" /> if he looks at the postman's manual he will find provision for regarding those nineteen days as special leave without pay, and that these need not in consequence affect an officer's increment or his services for pension purposes.  In the years 1920 and 1921 the Post Office workers went on strike for the purpose of associating themselves with a move which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;would have everyone believe then was quite a moral position deserving of whole-hearted support of the people.  The British Government never attempted to allow those two days' absence to interfere with officers' pensions, and I think it does not speak well for the Minister's sense of fair play that he should stoop to do what the British Government in 1920 and 1921 refused to do.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I want to refer to.  That is under sub-head A (3), the classification of the Waterford Post Office.  Waterford is a city of 30,000 inhabitants and there are close on sixty sub-offices under the Waterford head-office.  In 1911 the Waterford Post Office was reduced to a lower class than it occupied up to that date.  That reduction was caused by the very serious blunder made by a Board of Trade official.  Since then there has been re-classification of offices, but Waterford still remains in the lowest category.  There are three classes of post offices in this country&mdash; 1, 2 and 3.  Dublin is in Class 1; Limerick, Cork, Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock, Bré and Cobh are in Class 2, and we find Ballyhaunis, Newbridge, Arklow and and Mountrath in Class 3.  In other words, we find the post office in Waterford, a city with 30,000 inhabitants, in the same category as the post office in Ballyhaunis, Newbridge, Arklow and Mountrath.  That is quite an anomalous position, and the anomaly is more obvious when we see places like Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire and Cobh in a higher classification than Waterford. Now the lower classification affects the rights of pay at Waterford, and it may be interesting to the Dáil to know that a postman at Waterford is only paid the same rate of wages as the postman at Hazlehatch or Celbridge.  Notwithstanding that Waterford is a big city, <Col N="2319" /> the postmen there are only paid the same as at the sub-offices.  I suggest to the Minister that that anomaly should not be allowed to continue, and I suggest that that matter might be considered and that Waterford should be given a classification which its importance in this State would merit.  If there had been no change of administration, Waterford would long since have been placed in Class 2.  I think Waterford should not suffer because there has been a change in the administration.</P>
    <P>In sub-head A I find provision for payment of fees to medical officers and on that matter I want to refer to the position at Limerick.  The post office officials are supposed to have free medical attendance though it only costs the Department 10/- per head per annum.  At Limerick a most primitive system is in existence.  Notwithstanding the fact that Limerick is a big city no medical officer can be got, locally, to look after the Post Office staff.  The post office employs a dispensary medical officer at a place called Patrick's Well, seven miles from Limerick.  Now, an officer may take suddenly ill, as has happened on a few occasions recently, and this medical officer at Patrick's Well has to be telephoned for and asked to come in.  But as he has got a big district to look after it may mean he is seven miles away from the telephone when called. The result is that a local medical officer is called in to attend on the officer who has got ill, and that local officer charges the fee which would be payable to him by any person in a private capacity, but the Post Office Department jibs about paying it.  They ask question upon question about it, and in the end, notwithstanding that the absence of the local medical officer is the fault of the Department the post office very often only pay a fraction of the amount.  There again I suggest to the Minister that he should make some personal inquiry into this matter with a view to bringing that unsatisfactory condition of things to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Under sub-head A (3) a sort of halfhearted attempt was <Col N="2320" /> made yesterday to deal with the question of the charges for the delivery of telegrams.  We find that accounted for in page 251.  There the whole cost of the delivery of telegrams is shown, and the amount collected outside of the limits more than pays for the whole messenger staff in the telegraph service, leaving a profit for the post office.  The attitude of the Minister yesterday evening in promising to review the position was accepted by us as going a considerable way to meet us.  If the promise of the Minister means that the whole position with regard to charges outside a certain limit is going to be reviewed with a view to their abolition we would be inclined to accept that.  The Minister should also consider the question of making a refund to people for overcharges during the last three years.  I imagine, however, that is a question for the Minister for Finance and not for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that as regards income tax, if demands have been made and paid that afterwards cannot be sustained, one can recover over a period of three years.  The charges made here cannot, I suggest, be sustained.  Under the Constitution of the Saorstát every citizen is guaranteed equal rights.  It has been proved now that certain citizens have not been sharing these equal rights of citizenship, but actually have been contributing towards the provision of facilities for other citizens that are not accorded to themselves.  If the Minister's statement means that he is prepared to review the whole position we are prepared to accept it and to allow this Vote to go through without any further criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking previously there was one matter I forgot to refer to.  It deals with the case of what are described as redundant post office assistants, Grade B.  I find a footnote at the end of page 248 which states that &ldquo;there are 101 posts blocked by redundant post office assistants, <Col N="2321" /> Grade B.&rdquo;  I am sorry that the Minister for Finance is not here.  If he were perhaps there would be a little more expedition than there has been in dealing with this problem.  In the post office reorganisation scheme it is provided that a certain class of officer should do a class of work which a higher-grade officer did formerly. There was a proposal made that those higher-class officers should be absorbed into the clerical grades.  Some little thing has been done in that direction, but here we find that there are still 101 such officers employed blocking vacancies for officers of a lower class.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may not have heard before what I am now going to tell him, and I hope he will take an interest in the matter, that those in the redundant post office assistant class are paid at a maximum of 61/- per week basic wages, and the class that it is proposed will do their work in future are paid at a maximum of 48/- per week basic wages.  Taking the present mean of both classes, there is a loss of about 30/- per week on the 101 officers who are retained on that work, notwithstanding the fact that it is provided in the post office reorganisation scheme that the work should be done by a lower-paid class.  30/- per week for 100 of these officers works out at £150 a week or £7,800 per annum.  That is the cost of continuing this idea of allowing redundant officers to block vacancies which ought to be given to another and a lower class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us that the reason these people cannot be absorbed is because the Department of Finance does not, apparently, see the need for dealing expeditiously with this matter. I suggest to the Minister that if he were to point out to the Department of Finance the financial saving which could be effected by dealing expeditiously with this matter that we might be able to get rid of these 101 redundant officers in a much shorter time than we were able to get rid of them in the past.  This is a point that is well worthy of consideration by the Minister, especially in view of the fact that the Civil Service Commissioners are announcing every other day the holding of examinations for outsiders for the <Col N="2322" /> clerical grades.  The Minister might consider the question of placing these 101 well trained post office officials on the clerical grade, and thus avoid the necessity of holding those examinations and save this charge of close on £8,000 per annum incurred while these officers are employed on their present duties.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey's reference to page 251&mdash; delivery messengers&mdash;was dealt with yesterday.  These are regular messengers and not auxiliaries.  It is true that there are 101 assistants Class B, still awaiting promotion, or, at any rate, within that class, and who may, at any time, be considered for promotion.  It is doubtful if all of them will be promoted.  A number of them&mdash; I cannot say offhand what percentage &mdash;will hardly merit promotion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that most of those officers are substituting officers of a higher grade than themselves, and that they are, therefore, eligible for promotion.  How, in view of that, does he contend that they are not suitable for promotion?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>To suggest that the service is losing financially by not promoting these men within the post office is not correct.  If there is no need to promote them then to do so would cost more money and would mean unnecessary payments.  That is obvious.  On the other hand, if the Minister for Finance should decide to waive the holding of open competitive examinations for clerical posts and to select from this particular force, I have no objection.  That is his business.  There has been trouble in Limerick with regard to the provision of medical attendance. That trouble is not confined to the post office.  The medical men down there have, for some reason known to themselves, declined to accept the Government capitation grant and, because of that fact, we have to do in certain circumstances what Deputy Norton has said, go outside the city for consultation. <Col N="2323" /> I do not see much hope of overcoming that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that officers who are obliged to call in the services of a private medical man will not be at any loss because of the fact that the post office is unable to make arrangements such as are made in other offices in the Saorstát?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to give any guarantee on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you look into it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The classification of the Waterford post office was made prior to the Treaty.  Classifications generally were based on the cost of living, as the Deputy is aware.  It appears that the cost of living in Waterford city at that time was such as to justify its inclusion in Class 3. Whether conditions have altered in the interval or not I cannot say.  I have got representations which I am prepared to consider from the staff down there. More than that I cannot promise.  Any favourable recommendation of mine, if such were made, would of course, be subject to Finance approval.  If I find the staff at Waterford is being discriminated against unduly I will take that into consideration.  The stoppage of the incremental period of 19 days arising out of the strike is not traceable to any decision of mine alone.  It is a Governmental decision, and I happen to share in that decision.  Were the Government so inclined I believe it would be very difficult to arrive at any other.  The period of service was definitely broken; no work was performed and no service rendered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if the same thing happened in 1920, when he sympathised with the action taken by the Irish working classes in connection with the Sinn Fein movement, was the period broken there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared for retrospective considerations.  The fact is that the service in this particular case was broken to the extent of 19 days, and the Government that considered the matter decided that it should constitute broken service for <Col N="2324" /> incremental and pension purposes. That decision stands, and I doubt very much whether there is any prospect of altering it.  There is nothing new in the position of unestablished postmen or part-time workers here.  It is a continuation of a system that prevailed in the British time when finances were, I suppose, of less account than they are now.  The same applies to part-time workers, but in their case we have made a very genuine effort within the last year or two to remove them, if they pass an examination, to the plane of appointees.  I think we have lost no time in that direction.  In a service like ours we must necessarily have a floating staff.  Our work is of an erratic character and does not flow evenly at all times.  On the other hand the regular staff, rightly or wrongly, insist that these abnormal flows in traffic must not be permitted to alter their line of living or their hours.  Therefore we are called upon to keep at our disposal a small temporary force to meet emergencies. There is no prospect of dispensing with a force of that kind in its entirely. It will always remain a feature. I have no desire to see it an abnormal feature.  In regard to unestablished postmen this system applies in England to-day as it applies here. Unestablished postmen are in the main part-time.  They entered the service on definite conditions, and no prospect whatever of permanent employment was held out when they entered.  I cannot see how the State could possibly bind itself to any permanency as regards their employment.  Only during the last two years could the hours for these men have been varied.  Much as I sympathise with the principle of permanency for workers, I see no prospect of departing from the set policy in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether he thinks it impossible, or whether he sees any prospect in the idea of amalgamating the two attendances of four hours each into one attendance, and giving one man full-time employment instead of having two men in a state of semistarvation doing each a half-day's work?</P>

I suggest to the Minister he should make a personal inquiry into this whole problem with a view to reducing the proportion in which it exists to-day.  During the past few years an endeavour has been made to do something with regard to two classes, auxiliary postmen and allowance deliverers. The extent of the endeavour so far as these two classes are concerned has been to offer 40 vacancies, although these classes number 3,700. At that rate of 40 in two years by what date will the total number be dealt with?</P>

I am sure it must be within the Minister's recollection that complaints have been made against a particular officer of the Investigation Branch and the methods employed by that officer.  My Union does not stand for condoning theft of any kind and I, as secretary of the Union, have refused to make representations on behalf of any person against whom there was any suspicion of dishonesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If dishonesty is going to be put down, it ought to be put down honestly <Col N="2326" /> and with clean hands.  I suggest that clean methods are not being employed by this particular officer in putting down theft and dishonesty.  It has been brought to my notice that quite a common method of approach adopted by this officer towards people suspected of dishonesty is to play the confidence trick upon them.  He says to those people: &ldquo;I have got to interview you. I am your friend; trust to me and confide in me.  Make that statement and I will see you are all right in the end.&rdquo; The unfortunate person concerned makes a statement only to find himself all wrong in the end.  Here is an extract from a letter I received:&mdash;&ldquo;He told me that as the champion of ex-National Army men he would do all in his power to get me off with a severe reprimand.&rdquo; That is the type of confidence trick that is played on unsuspecting people around the country.  The method of dealing with ex-Army men is: &ldquo;I am an ex-National Army man, and if you make that statement, it does not matter how serious it looks, I will get you off in the end.&rdquo;  In regard to other people the plea is slightly different, but the object is the same&mdash;to ensnare unsuspecting people.</P>
    <P>I do not stand for the condonation of theft, and I am prepared to assist by every means in my power in putting it down and in making the Post Office a worthy servant of the nation.  I suggest to the Minister that these third-degree methods ought not to be employed. I must acknowledge that certain officers of the investigation branch carry out their duties in a most courteous manner and I have no complaint against them.  I venture to say the Minister has never received a complaint against them.  There is, however, one officer in that branch who has such a warped sense of what is honest and what is fair play, that he ought to be put out of the investigation department as soon as possible.  I suggest that a strict watch should be kept upon the reports of this officer, that he should be compelled to do the honest and right thing, and that he should not be allowed to go around the country ensnaring people into making statements for the purpose of hanging themselves, so to speak.</P>

      <P>I do not want to associate myself with Deputy Norton's complaint because I know nothing of it.  As regards losses by default, I would ask the Minister to give us some idea of the machinery adopted to prevent such losses.  Looking through the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General for 1924-25, I see that losses by default are mentioned there, and one item attracted my notice in particular. It refers to the misappropriation of official cash to the extent of £30 by a rural postman in Ballinacarrow. Ballinacarrow is a very small village; I know it well.  I should think the total postal business done there would not reach probably more than £50 a year.  I would like to know how a rural postman operating in such a very limited area as that&mdash;a man who, as Deputy Norton said on sub-head A, does not receive a very considerable salary&mdash;could manage to get £30 of official cash.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that if rural postmen operating in very poor areas&mdash;areas where there is very little postal business&mdash;are placed in the position of handling sums of £30 there are bound to be losses by default.  As a rule, these men are not highly paid.  There is no possibility of selecting them through the medium of a selection board, such as the Civil Service Commission. If you are going to place sums amounting to £30 in the hands of postmen of that kind you are taking great risks.</P>
      <P>Taking the Vote as a whole, I do not know if the losses by default are excessive, but I think the Minister should tell us something in regard to what machinery has been established to prevent such losses and whether it is necessary to adopt machinery such as Deputy Norton has suggested.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister inform the House why it is that provision to the extent of £7,000 is made at this late stage for losses due to fires between July and November, 1922?  The full provision mentioned here is £12,000, but £7,000 is for fires which took place four years ago.  Why was not provision made earlier?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>The postman referred <Col N="2328" /> to by Deputy Cooper would, in all probability have in his possession old age pension moneys.  These are the only moneys which could have amounted to that sum in such a district.</P>
      <P>The £12,000 referred to by Deputy Wilson is divided into two distinct categories.  The sum of £7,000 is inherited from the fire plague period, during which a number of our premises were destroyed.  It should be remembered that a great many documents were burned during these fires.  Savings Bank books, deposit receipts, and valuable documents essential for proof in applications for withdrawals of money were wholly or partly destroyed. These documents are being patched together with very great difficulty, and the resultant finances which we are called upon to meet will go on, perhaps in decreasing quantity, but will last over some years to come.  That is the explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Has that particular reference to the burning of the Rink?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Not merely to the Rink, but to many other buildings destroyed during that time.  The Rink was one of several buildings destroyed. That would leave about £5,000 to meet all kinds of risks.  I cannot say offhand how many millions or tens of millions are handled annually by the Post Office, but there is a considerable sum.  If we take a small margin, say of £5,000 as a contingency, we are not overstepping the mark.  We have to face a number of defaulters through one form or another, as will be observed by those who take the trouble to read the police court proceedings in different parts of the country.  That is not all.  We are also aware that often in the present apparently peaceful state of the country raids on the mails are not unusual, or at least, perhaps I should say, are not unknown.  We have got to meet this.  We have not put this £5,000 aside for the sake of holding it up or of keeping it warm, but because we believe it is a sum that will meet the requirements of the nature I have stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies from time to time have come to me over the failure of the Post Office to make compensation to <Col N="2329" /> people who transmitted money through the post in one form or another.  In some cases I have succeeded in having repayments made in full or in part. In others I have failed to do so.  In nearly all cases the victims were normally poor people.  Perhaps the stolen letters sometimes contained their total savings.  I have had some very sad cases before me, and these cases were undoubtedly very numerous two or three years ago.  Complaints came from different quarters, even from religious societies that had money flowing into them as charity, that a sense of insecurity had crept in.  In that situation I was compelled to take extraordinary steps to purify the service.  I had to get rid of a great many people who were, undoubtedly, helping themselves to public property, and I was very glad to have placed at my disposal the officer to whom the Deputy refers.  Now in the interval this officer has dealt with over 250 cases.  One hundred of these have resulted in the dismissal of the persons concerned, and over 100 in imprisonment.  Of these 250 cases some were of a very bad character, and were particularly difficult for any intelligence officer to investigate.</P>
    <P>There were cases, for instance, where assistants in post offices helped their friends in regard to the timing of betting telegrams&mdash;a very serious crime.  Whether we sympathise with the bookie, or not, we must give him a square deal in matters of this kind. There were cases of that kind, and these were merely typical, and it is extraordinary how people, in such circumstances, are prepared to swear black is white&mdash;it is no trouble to them whatever.  If a case goes against them, then in desperation they fall back on the plea that a trap was laid for them by the Investigating Officer.</P>
    <P>I have had only seven complaints of that character out of these 200 cases. I submit that seven is not a high percentage. Any man doing difficult&mdash; call it, if you like, dirty work&mdash;of this type is open to accusations of unfair dealing.  They have been made, in the past, against people in this position, and they will be made, in the future. I want to assure Deputy Norton that, in every one of these cases, I take the <Col N="2330" /> final responsibility.  No dismissal materialises without my signature.  I read all the papers and I, very often, reverse cases even where that officer is concerned.  In no case can the officer get away with unfairness, even assuming he tries to.  I go so far as to assert that that is true.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this officer has done very good service to the State. I will not absolutely swear that he may not have, at some one time, overstepped the mark.  I am not aware of it, and I say he has rendered very valuable service in clearing up a pretty dirty situation and making the Post Office safe for the transmission of public property.</P>

Deputies might be inclined to take what the Minister said about this officer at its face value.  I do not.  I know the officer and some of the Minister's own officials, in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, know perfectly well the many complaints made against him.  They may not have come to the Minister's ear but they were made.  I could give the Minister a case here and I could bring half-a-dozen of other cases to-morrow to show the methods employed by this officer.  I think they are altogether wrong.  I would like the Minister to take steps to ensure that this officer carries out his duty fairly and squarely and that he should not exploit people and that he should be made to behave as the other investigation officer and to employ clean methods.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not answered my question.  I asked what machinery existed to prevent defalcations by postmen.  He replied by saying that in the particular case I had mentioned the money was old age pension money.  My point is, that if you entrust men paid below the ordinary scale with money amounting, in the case I quoted, to six months' wages, you ought to create some machinery by which you can assure yourself that that man will not make away with that money.  I do not know whether it would be possible in the postal service to introduce fidelity guarantees; in any case great care should be taken in engaging postmen who will have to be entrusted with thirty or forty or fifty pounds in money.  You should not engage any boy of eighteen years of age who applies with no bond to hold him to his work.  It will be better to take a man with a wife and family who will be attached to the place.  It is not fair to make a man who is only getting £1 or £1 10s. a week, responsible for large sums of money unless careful machinery for check and supervision exists.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that in some cases a person was able to get a refund of the money lost while going through the post.  Am I to understand from that that he will consider cases of losses which are not governed by the regulations, such, for instance, as a man posting current notes or a registered letter containing money in the shape of notes and lost in transit.  Would he be prepared to refund in cases of that kind, or what is this £5,000 for?  If it is to meet some <Col N="2332" /> loss, what exactly does that loss consist of?</P>

      <P>Even if it is registered. Even though that seems strange we have simply continued a system which has always prevailed in England, and which the English have stood solidly on and refused to budge, because of the many traps that lay in the way in regard to it.  I have given the matter a good deal of consideration of late, and I have caused a notification to be sent to all departments providing that people desirous of posting registered letters should be requested to utilise the official envelope.  That will not cover all cases.  It has sometimes happened that letters containing coin and notes are posted through the ordinary pillar box, and detected in the course of transmission.  I do not see much hope for a case of that kind.  The fact that they are picked up in the post, registered and transmitted, is a safeguard in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper wants to know why it is not possible to get greater guarantees against defalcations of the character to which he has referred.  The loss of £30 is a comparatively small thing.  Mail car drivers very often&mdash; possibly once a week&mdash;find in their possession, not £30, but perhaps <Col N="2333" /> £30,000, in some cases&mdash;transmitting money from one bank to another for fair purposes.  These officers do not receive even as much pay as postmen. I do not see any possibility of guaranteeing people that we employ for the carriage of mails containing money. Fidelity guarantees are all right for people who earn large salaries, but I doubt if a man earning twenty-five shillings or thirty shillings a week would be inclined to rise to the spirit of the occasion.</P>

      <P>I move to reduce sub-heads I, K and L by £6,000.  Taken together, they are the Engineering Vote for the Post Office.  I would refer Deputies to page 254 of the Estimates where, in Appendix F there is shown the total cost of the Engineering Department under its various heads&mdash;telegraphs, telephones, and so on.  I have moved this amendment in order to obtain an explanation of the increase in this Vote.  In 1924 the actual expenditure on this Vote was £216,842.  That was the year in which there had been great devastations created in the postal service; telegraph poles had been cut down, wires had been destroyed, and so on.  But £216,000 was enough to pay for engineering services.  Last year the Estimate was £260,000, an increase of £44,000, and this year the Estimate is £266,000, a further increase of £6,000. I am moving to take off that £6,000, unless the Minister can show why an increased expenditure under this head is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the Table that I have referred Deputies to, on page 264, you will see that the cost of maintenance of telegraphs and telephones has been considerably reduced.  If Deputies <Col N="2334" /> refer to previous years they will see that the cost of maintenance of telegraphs has been reduced by nearly £2,000, and the cost of maintenance of telephones has been reduced by more than £11,000.  But there is a marked increase under the heading of renewals, re-arrangements, etc., which have swallowed up the saving on maintenance and increased the Estimates. The increase in regard to telephones was £11,400.  It more or less cancels the saving on maintenance.  But in regard to telegraphs the disparity is very much more marked.  The saving on telegraphs was nearly £2,000, but the increase in renewals and re-arrangements was £8,000.  Yet, the Minister told us yesterday that telegraphs were being used very much less than they were.  On renewals and re-arrangements of telegraphs, there is an increase of £6,000.  The Minister told us yesterday that people are sending much fewer telegrams than they used to.  Would he tell us why renewals and re-arrangements on this scale have become necessary?  Would he also tell us if they could possibly be deferred?  I do not doubt that any engineer who had examined the telegraphs of the State would say we want certain renewals.  An engineer looks at the matter from a professional point of view, but we must look at the matter from a business point of view.  I think the Minister, last Sunday, tried to imagine me as the director of a company. The invitations that I have had to become a director of a company have not been alluring ones.  The company has generally been one that I felt no confidence in.  But I will ask the Minister now to look on himself as the Director of the Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones Company, and say whether some of this expenditure on renewals and re-arrangements could not, in view of the financial position, be postponed to another year, and whether we could not save £6,000 on this Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of telephones clearly the greater the expansion the greater the cost of maintenance.  That is accepted.  Our telephone system has expanded very rapidly and with that extended service we have got to face not only increased <Col N="2335" /> expenditure for maintenance but an increased expenditure for renewals.  I trust that that brief explanation is satisfactory as far as telephones are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>In either case, in respect of renewals and re-arrangements, the same argument applies.  That argument applies to telephones clearly.  It does not happen to be compared with last year, but it might conceivably be. As a matter of fact, one would expect it should be, because of the increased service, but in the case of renewals and re-arrangements I am satisfied that our engineering department is not spending money unnecessarily in this direction.  It should be remembered that failure to spend money might often result, not in a saving, but the other way round.  It is very essential in a service like ours to keep the machinery up to a high pitch, and the public are not prepared to have faulty material experimented on.  In the telegraphs, this particular increase might be traced to the introduction of an instrument called the tele-type, a class of time-saving instrument which is very effective in the transmission, not only of news, but of ordinary telegrams. We have introduced it to Waterford, and we intend introducing it elsewhere.  It is an expensive instrument, but it will prove a saving ultimately. On the other hand, as I stated yesterday, we are displacing telegraphs by telephones in a great many instances. I expect that displacement <Col N="2336" /> will come under the heading of telegraphs rather than telephones.</P>
      <P>Where telegraphs touch an office which is a single office, in other words, a lone office on a wire, we are concentrating on developing the telephone system and leaving the telegraphs&mdash; utilising the telephones for the dual purpose of telegrams and public telephones. It should also be remembered that the fact of an item under the engineering section showing an increase in one particular year over a previous year&mdash;at least a section of that item&mdash; merely means that it is quite possible that in one particular year our engineering department may be more free to devote time to, let us say, telegraphic rectification than in another year.  Our technical staff is very limited, and we may find that during a particular year that staff is practically solely engaged on a heavy job. When that job is finished&mdash;it may be a telephone job&mdash;we can, perhaps, switch them on to telegraphs not having another telephone job in readiness. Variations in expenditure of this kind are always taking place, and always will take place.  I am satisfied that there is full justification&mdash;I have gone into these items very fully with the engineering department&mdash;for the Vote set down here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a series of very interesting generalisations, but he has not given any definite or positive reason why the Vote for the engineering department should be £6,000 more than it was last year, and £50,000 more than it was for the year before that.  He says we are introducing new machinery.  The justification he made was that new machinery, in the form of renewals and re-arrangements, was being introduced into the Telegraph Department.  I would suggest to the Dáil that we should not spend money in introducing new machinery into the telegraphs, because I believe that the telegraph, if not obsolete is, at any rate, becoming obsolete. The Minister said that yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Only in certain respects.  I made it very clear that the telegraph is not becoming obsolete <Col N="2337" /> in the case of long distance transmission for Press or private telegrams.  I think it will hold its own for many a day.  Remember we must keep in line with the times in regard to the replacement of instruments and the introduction of the most modern instruments. Take a case in point.  Supposing that the British Post Office desired to introduce the tele-type instrument for intercommunication with Dublin, it would be difficult for us to resist, if a pretty good case was put up, showing economy in time, and economy in money.  We have to march with the times and, generally speaking, any increase that we request in regard to engineering is merely an increase, which we feel justified in calling for, to keep our staff working for that particular period.  We will go on looking for increases year by year.  I anticipate that this increase will expand very much within the next three or four years, and I trust that nobody here will disagree with legitimate development in regard to telephones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not speaking about telephones at all.  I am speaking about telegraphs, and I believe that telegraphs, except for long distance ocean cable, are becoming obsolete. Ten years hence I believe that where there is a telegraph wire hanging on poles along a country road, people will look at it in the same way that they look at a sedan chair moving <Col N="2338" /> down the middle of Grafton Street. The Minister, and everyone else, knows that wireless is supplanting all these forms of communication.  Ten days ago I was able to sit down in County Dublin and hear the British Prime Minister talking very much more clearly than I ever heard him talk in the House of Commons.  The wire is going out of fashion.  It is folly to believe that we are going to send telegrams over a wire when wireless communication is being developed.  I ask Deputies to remember that five years ago we would have thought it insanity to believe that a man talking in London or Paris could be clearly heard in Dublin, and at no excessive cost.  I have only a small wireless set that cost £15 15s. altogether, and I have heard people talking clearly in Paris.  That process is going to be developed, and therefore we should be very slow in sinking money in machines that may be rendered obsolete in a year or two years.  Last year the Minister found £33,000 enough for his renewals and re-arrangement of the telegraph service.  I am not limiting him to £33,000.  I would allow him £35,000, but I say that we should restrict the Minister in respect to these renewals of the telegraph service, because it is a very doubtful matter whether, within the next four or five years, the telegraph will not be superseded altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 2&mdash;to reduce sub-head M by £14,000. Sub-head M represents charges in respect of the debt created under the Telegraphs Act, 1892-1921, and the Telephone Capital Act, 1924.  I should like to remind the Dáil that we stand in a peculiar position in regard to this item. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has really more power than any Minister in the State, except, perhaps, the Minister for Finance, because he has inherited powers under certain British Acts which enable him to pledge the credit of the State.  Those British Acts were based on the assumption, which was usually true, that the Postmaster-General, being one of the minor posts in the Cabinet, would be selected for negative qualities, that he would be what I have heard called a &ldquo;negative slug,&rdquo; a praiseworthy man who always voted right, never had an original idea and contributed to Party funds.  That was the British case.  It is not our case. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has an active and energetic mind.  We have to get up early in the morning to keep track of his arguments and, therefore, the liability imposed upon our revenue is likely to be more serious than if we had a Minister who only did what his permanent officials advised him.</P>
      <P>In respect of Telephone capital, the Minister can borrow money under the British Acts without informing anybody except the Minister for Finance. The Dáil need not be informed.  The Minister has borrowed money and will borrow money and the only opportunity we have of reviewing this expenditure is on this estimate, whereby we pay the interest on the money that he has borrowed.  The annuities incurred in respect of this money that he has borrowed were just over £11,000 in the estimates for 1925.  The actual expenditure in 1924 was £3,200.  Now the figure is £25,490.  Obviously, money is being borrowed at a considerable rate. It may be that that is justifiable, though when one contrasts the amount borrowed since 1922&mdash;£25,000&mdash;with the number of new telephones installed in the State since 1922&mdash;which the Minister said yesterday was approximately four thousand&mdash;it appears that every new telephone is costing £6.  That is probably an average figure.  I do not think you could make out an estimate of the cost of every telephone because much depends on the amount of wire you have to use in connecting it with the exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be worth spending £6 for every telephone&mdash;£25,000 in all&mdash;to connect the remoter parts of Carndonagh and other bailiwicks in Inish-owen with metropolitan civilisation.  It may even cause them to keep in closer touch with the actions of their Deputies in the Dáil.  The money may be well spent, but I should like to hear the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs justify this expenditure.  Two years ago he was spending £11,000.  This year he wants to spend £25,000.  That is an increase of £14,000.  Possibly it is justifiable, but I would like the Minister to tell us what is his programme of telephone expansion, and also what further charges we are likely to incur under this head.  We must, in the long run, cut our coat according to our cloth.  We must ultimately decide how much we can afford to expend on telephone development, and ascertain what return we shall receive by way of guarantees, fees, and so on.  I thought that this was a matter which the Dáil ought to consider, and, therefore, I put down this amendment, not in any hostile spirit, but in order to get information from the Minister as to the policy of his <Col N="2341" /> Department and the programme of telephone development he intends to adopt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In the estimates of receipts and expenditure for the year ending 31st March, 1927, there is down on page 7, section C, for advances under the Telephone Acts to provide telephone capital, £357,000.  That is £147,000 more than last year.  The provision last year was £210,000. That difference in capital is £147,000, and yet the provision in the Estimates reaches £14,000.  It certainly does need explanation as to what is the rate per cent. and what is the Sinking Fund provision.  I support Deputy Cooper in looking for the information sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest paid on the capital is 5 per cent., the capital to be repaid in 15 years.  The reason for the apparently rapid expansion in 1924-25 over 1923-24 is to be found in the fact that 1923-24 was the year in which our engineering staff was largely employed in making good the civil war destruction.  As a matter of fact, the first real departure in telephone extension began in 1924-25.  It extended in 1925-26 to the figure of £357,000, and it is likely to go higher next year.  None of this money is obtained by my Department for the mere asking.  Details of every scheme contemplated have got to be submitted, in the first instance, to the Minister for Finance, examined, re-examined, and, finally, approved or disapproved.  It is not correct to say that I get so many hundreds of thousands of pounds to spend in any way I like.  No such thing applies to this Vote.  Our greatest difficulty is to get the Finance Department to sanction schemes with sufficient rapidity to keep us going.  As a matter of fact, it is rather the other way round.  I can assure the Deputy that in any telephone or telegraph scheme involving any appreciable sum of money, the money is not at my disposal to spend in my own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I indicated that the Minister was controlled by the Finance Department.  The fact remains, however, that except on this particular Vote for interest, the Dáil has no say.  The Department of Finance may have very considerable control, <Col N="2342" /> but the Oireachtas, representing the people, has no say in relation to this creation of debt under the Telephones Act, other than the opportunity that is given on this particular Vote.  Deputy Wilson has very rightly called attention to the considerable increase in debt that has been incurred, and the Minister has not given any general expression of policy to justify that increase of over £100,000 of debt.  I think it was obvious last night that there was a demand for the extension of telephone facilities.  The extension of these facilities must be made a business proposition.  In the present financial position of the State we cannot afford, unless there is some other indirect reason, such as the necessity for giving the Gárda telephones, to provide unremunerative telephone facilities. The Minister has added to the debt under this head upwards of £100,000, and he has added to the interest by upwards of £14,000.  I suggest that he should give us a more detailed description of what the telephone policy of the State is, before we would be justified in voting this amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that when the Minister says that the debt is to be repaid in fifteen years, that that provision plus the interest means 10 per cent. on the capital.  That is what it works out at.  The new capital is £147,000, and 5 per cent. on that would be only about £7,000.  Therefore when you make provision for £14,400 it means that you must put by yearly a sum of £7,000 as Sinking Fund.  The Minister has not explained it, and I would like to hear from him how it works out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Wilson has pretty well explained the matter.  He points out that the increase in this case must involve an increased borrowing expenditure of £147,000, and 5 per cent. on that is £7,000.  There is also the annuity which accounts for the balance.  Deputy Cooper will remember that this telephone capital expenditure was provided for by an Act of this House.  It was duly discussed here, and I do not suppose that he desires that it should be re-enacted <Col N="2343" /> and re-discussed.  If he were in my boots and had to run the numerous and difficult gauntlets which I have to run in getting the sanction of the Finance Department, I think he would conclude very early in his experiences that it would be much better if these difficulties were decreased.  If Deputies want me to go over the whole ground in regard to telephone development again I will be pleased to do so, but I rather thought that I talked too long last night and that I gave some facts and figures which, in the opinion of some Deputies, were bewildering.</P>

      <P>In regard to sub-head N, I want to raise a question of delay in paying superannuation allowances. I have in mind a case of an officer who, before his retirement, was ill for a considerable time, and thereby incurred considerable medical expense.  He has now been superannuated for ten weeks, but yet there is no sign of the amount due to him under the Superannuation Acts being paid.  I know that it is not the fault of the Post Office Department, but I mention the matter simply because the Minister for Finance is here. The Post Office Department prepares the forms and submits them to the Department of Finance.  The amount allowed is calculated in accordance with a formula, and yet it takes ten weeks, and perhaps more, to pay the amount, although it can be calculated in ready-reckoner fashion.  Ten weeks is an unreasonable time to allow to elapse before payment is made, and it imposes considerable hardship on an officer who has had considerable medical expenses already.  I think some efforts ought to be made by the Finance Department to come to a decision in something less than ten weeks, especially when the amount can easily be calculated.</P>

      <P>The question I desire to raise is one affecting the whole system of appointments in the Civil Service.  The Minister has told us he is prepared to go over the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it, or is it not, the desire of the House that we should go into the whole question of policy?  Is it the desire that I should give an explanation covering broadcasting policy, or is the House satisfied that we have already covered sufficiently the grounds in that respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to explain that we have had an explanation of policy within recent months with regard to wireless, and part of that <Col N="2346" /> policy had reference to the appointment of further officials.  It was because of that explanation which was made to the House, and which, I think, generally satisfied the House as to the necessity for having further appointments made, that I am raising the question that I am now about to deal with. The Minister made a very strong case with respect to the demand upon the over-worked staff and the necessity for an addition to the staff.  The House was made fully acquainted with that position. Then, in due course, there appeared an advertisement in the newspapers headed &ldquo;Departments of Posts and Telegraphs Broadcasting&rdquo; announcing that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs invited applications for the position of Assistant Station Director, stating the salary, and a Woman Organiser, also stating the salary.  The advertisement then went on to indicate the qualifications and said &ldquo;the appointments will be made by means of a Selection Board set up by the Civil Service Commission,&rdquo; details, forms, etc., to be had from the Secretary of that Commission.  Applications were sent in, and, as I understand, from question and answer in this House, selections were made and recommendations were submitted by the Commission or by the Selection Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then it was announced that no appointment would be made, and we were promised that those persons who had paid fees for their applications would have these fees returned.  So far as these fees are concerned the reply might be satisfactory.  I question whether other expenses which may have been incurred by the applicants were paid to them.  I do not know whether any applications were made in that respect.  But that is a small matter compared with the issue that is raised by the method of treating this question of appointments.  An advertisement is issued inviting the public to apply for posts; the Civil Service Commission is brought directly into this question of appointments; the Civil Service Commission makes its selection from amongst the applicants, and then suddenly it is decided that no appointments will be made.  It seems to me that that is a distinct <Col N="2347" /> breach of faith with the applicants, and with the Dáil, inasmuch as the Dáil was assured of the necessity for an increased staff.  Following that assurance, and the implied consent of the Dáil, this advertisement appeared, and having gone through the whole machinery, the Selection Board having been brought into operation and having made their choice, for some reason or other unexplained, the Minister decides that he will not make any appointment.</P>
    <P>Are we to understand that it is now found that the staff in existence up to date is sufficient, that there is no longer any need for an Assistant Station Director and a Woman Organiser, that the Minister has, by some method unknown to his colleagues in this work in other countries, found a way of avoiding the necessity for making these appointments?  Is it that the present staff is quite prepared to work these exceedingly long hours?  Or is it that the nominees of the Selection Board did not satisfy the requirements of the Minister?  The prestige of the Civil Service Commission and the confidence that we were asked to place in it will be rudely shaken if this procedure is allowed to pass without protest. In a discussion on a recent Bill it was pointed out how necessary it is to remove all suggestion or trace of favouritism, or any suggestion that favouritism might be alleged against a Minister, and whatever may be the defects of this system of selection boards, it has been found to be the most salutary method of preventing charges of favouritism and nepotism. It will require the Minister's explanation to make it clear that there are really solid and valid reasons why there should be a sudden change of policy in regard to these appointments. The advertisement appeared in January; the Estimates appeared in March.  I do not know when the Estimates were prepared, but the Estimates contain figures of salaries for these two appointments, and it is due to us to have an explanation from the Minister of the reason for this sudden change of policy regarding the working of this broadcasting station.  It is with a view <Col N="2348" /> to extracting that information that I have put down this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion.  I would like to know from the Minister, when he finds it impracticable under the present circumstances to extend the telephone system to my area in Donegal, if he will consider the establishment of a broadcasting station in Carndonagh.  I noticed last night that his first line of defence was to consult maps to ascertain where Carndonagh is.  Cork has a much bigger population than Carndonagh, but I question if it is a much more important place.  If the Minister would consider the establishment of a broadcasting station in our area I would have great pleasure in assisting his officials to find a suitable site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on broadcasting on the occasion referred to by Deputy Johnson, I laid emphasis on the fact that the staff at my disposal was inadequate, and that no time should be lost in supplementing it.  With a view to doing so, steps were taken to secure the appointment of an assistant station director and a woman organiser. The initial papers reached the Minister about the month of January, and in the month of March, when the usual conditions. Press notifications and other essentials had been complied with, the candidates for both posts were examined.  In the case of the assistant station director the Civil Service Commission reported that none of the applicants possessed the necessary qualifications, and that therefore no nomination could be made.  I think that Deputy Johnson will accept a correction in that respect.  In looking over the names of those who applied, I felt that there were some on the list who would be suitable, but I had no say whatever in the matter.  Steps have been taken to re-advertise, and whether the new advertisement will be more fruitful than the initial one, is a matter that time alone will tell.  But in the <Col N="2349" /> meantime, the important key position of assistant station director is unfilled.</P>
      <P>I think that the Dáil ought to take note of the fact that this expedient for the filling of the key positions of this kind, is not working quite smoothly, is not likely to work quite smoothly when it contains a number of draw-backs which will only reveal themselves in time.  It is a matter of very great importance to the Station that an assistant Director should have been secured, but we have not secured one.  Let us assume that the new advertisement brings no suitable candidate, and I cannot foresee very much likelihood of its doing so, how is the conduct of that station to fare?  Are we to re-apply and when are we likely to get the business of broadcasting attended to?  If the Press or the public who, at any rate in the earlier stages of our broadcasting experience were certainly not too reasonable in their demands, were to request an explanation of any deficiency of ours in this respect, what will my explanation be?  I leave it to you to say.  If you expect me to do the business of broadcasting efficiently under conditions of this kind I venture to say that none of you would accept a responsibility of the kind.</P>
      <P>On the other point a number of applications for the post of woman organiser was received.  I do not know what the number was, but in due course the names of two ladies were submitted to me.  I refused to accept either.  I considered that the interests of the Station would not be served by the acceptance of either, and, as the Minister responsible, I must necessarily get an option in this matter.  The alternative to that action on my part was to accept either one or other of these recommendations and to refuse to take the responsibility for the appointment.  I cannot accept a candidate whose qualifications are not in every respect what I require, and at the same time expect to produce results which will justify myself in the eyes of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in the ears of the public in this case.  I put it to Deputies generally that one responsible for a commercial institution like broadcasting, <Col N="2350" /> an institution which is competing against the most highly organised and best financed institutions in the world, deserves every help that the Dáil can give him to make good.  The limitations provided by Government control are already too numerous and they play particularly hard on one whose efforts are measured against unfettered competition elsewhere.  If this Station of ours were a private commercial undertaking, and if I were the director or owner it would be possible for me to employ an official to-night, dispense with that official to-morrow and employ a new one.  I have no such latitude here.  If I employ an official to-night in this case it will be an official recommended to me by people who have no responsibility whatever for the subsequent actions of that official.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They merely make their recommendation. They, no doubt, make them with the best intentions.  They are forgotten. They fade away, they are not even known to me.  I then come into the picture and the subsequent responsibility is mine.  Now I submit that I have to pick my steps very carefully here. Broadcasting is not a thing confined within the four shores of this country. It goes far beyond the confines of the country, and comparisons are frequently and are ever being made, and it is up to me personally and as the responsible Minister to see that nothing but the highest product is made available. Now to secure that maximum product, which is in competition with the product of countries where there is no limitation on the purchase of brains, is a tough proposition.  I think the Dáil will admit that.  To raise broadcasting to the level which I feel it ought to reach requires on the part of everybody concerned a reasonable extension of latitude to the man mainly responsible in the selection of the staff. I could not justify myself by accepting either of the nominations submitted.  I know nothing about the people.  I never heard of them before, I had nobody else in mind to put in their place, but I certainly would not accept them. I may as well state my reasons.  The nominees in both cases were married ladies.  I believe that they both have families.  The fact that their husbands are in good positions is perhaps beside <Col N="2351" /> the point.  But both were married women, and as married women I take it that it is very unlikely unbroken service would be available, in the normal run of life at any rate.  I do not see how I could utilise to my satisfaction a service which is of an in and out, on and off character, here to-day and away to-morrow.  That sort of service is of no use to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have that point in mind and will come to it.  There is nothing new in this attitude of mine from the standpoint of the employment of married women.  They have never been employed in the Civil Service.  Not only are they not employed as such, but the moment a woman marries the State dispenses with her services and takes upon itself the responsibility of giving her a gratuity.  I do not suppose it is desired that I should break that rule, or that the responsibility which I have got to face is anything lighter than the normal run of the Civil Service.  I should say it is very much the other way around; it requires a very much higher and a much more continuous standard of application.  These are the reasons, roughly, why I had to decline the nomination.  I will plead guilty to an oversight in regard to the advertisement. Unfortunately, it escaped my notice.  The fact that it did does not relieve me of responsibility.  That the application should have been so worded as to exclude the possibility of this thing occurring, I readily concede.  I have come to the conclusion that it may not be necessary to pursue the idea of a woman organiser.  In the interval, I have had conversations with the Department of Education in regard to the programme which this lady was intended to fill, that of the provision of a children's hour.  We have come to the conclusion that it may be more satisfactorily provided by the Department of Education than by the broadcasting service.  That is the view we take of this particular item at the moment, and if that view should <Col N="2352" /> materialise, a very different arrangement to that originally contemplated, will eventuate.  We cannot, naturally, advance a cut and dried programme in regard to broadcasting.  For one thing, we are cutting our staff to about fifty per cent. of the strength of staffs in similar stations.  If we were to adopt their full programme of employees, the thing would be quite simple, but we are not doing that.  We have to trim our sails and to make changes, and in making changes we may have to alter pre-conceived ideas.  It may happen that this is not the only alteration of our programme that will take place, and we must be permitted to pick our way and to alter our course, if we consider that necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add a word to what the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has said, but from a different angle and without being at all in agreement with him on the general question.  I take an entirely different view to that of the Minister in regard to the filling of positions in connection with wireless broadcasting.  I see no reason whatever why the ordinary procedure for the filling of positions in connection with wireless broadcasting should not have been followed in this as in the case of other appointments. I see no reason why the Minister should not be able to get good people by means of a selection board and the ordinary machinery of the Civil Service Commission.  The Minister simply states that he does not like that machinery for this particular service. He thinks there are reasons why some different machinery or different procedure should be adopted in connection with this, but a different procedure cannot be adopted.  The provisions in the Civil Service (Regulation) Act are explicit.  The provisions of that Act apply to all appointments other than appointments which are scheduled to the Act or temporary appointments which may be scheduled to the Act by the Civil Service Commissioners.  Consequently, the matter of a different procedure need not be discussed at the moment.  The procedure which must be followed is laid down in the law. <Col N="2353" /> An advertisement was issued for an Assistant Station Director.  None of the applicants who came forward were, in the opinion of the Civil Service Commission, suitable, and no recommendation was made.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has stated the facts fully in that respect.  Correspondence is taking place with the Civil Service Commission with a view to having the position re-advertised.  The Civil Service Commissioners believe that suitable applicants will be got by re-advertising, and the Minister believes differently.  If, however, on the issue of a second advertisement, no suitable applicant can be found, then we will have to consider how, within the corners of the Act, some different procedure for finding applicants can be adopted.  There are other means of finding applicants.  But in the meantime, until the ordinary procedure has been exhausted, there is no reason at all for departing from it.  As far as I am concerned, I believe differently from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. I accept the view of the Civil Service Commissioners that when the post is re-advertised somebody will come forward whom they can recommend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the woman organiser, the position, as the Minister has stated, was one of error in the issue of the advertisement.  As a matter of fact, in view of the state of the law at present, it was fundamentally wrong to advertise for a woman organiser. But when that was departed from and when a woman was advertised for, then something should have been inserted saying that the woman should be a widow or single.  The general rule of the Civil Service is that only women who are widows or single should be employed.  I think that is a necessary and a good rule.  A departure from that rule would involve very serious charges upon the public funds, and would also involve unsatisfactory service owing to the fact that in many cases the amount of sick leave would be very much greater in the case of married women.  I think it is not contended seriously from any angle that I know of that married women should be employed in the Civil Service.  The <Col N="2354" /> position, however, was that there was nothing in the advertisement that would even discourage married women from applying.  Married women did apply.  The two people who were put first by the Civil Service Commissioners were married women.  As a rule only one name is submitted to the Minister, but in this case the Civil Service Commissioners, as they were dealing with a new service, thought it wise to submit two names.  The name that was first on their list and first in their order of preference was that of a lady who had no musical qualifications but who was regarded on the whole by the Civil Service Commissioners as being by far the best candidate. Another lady who was regarded as very good by the Civil Service Commissioners had musical qualifications. She was a lady who had been a gold medallist at Feis Ceoil competitions. The Civil Service Commissioners, in those circumstances, thought it wise to send two names to the Minister instead of one, so that if he thought the possession of musical qualifications outweighed qualifications which in other respects were superior he could make his choice and appoint the second lady on the list.  Now it is a question as to whether, a mistake having been made, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should not have gone on with the appointment in any case.  This was a temporary appointment, remember, and not an established post.  My own view is that if I had been in the Minister's place I would have made the appointment, once the mistake was made in issuing the advertisement.  There certainly were reasonable grounds for saying that an error had been made and that something was being proposed really as a result of an error which is not usual in the Civil Service.  On the general question of the responsibility of the Minister for the wireless broadcasting station, I entirely disagree with his suggestion that the regular procedure of the Civil Service should not be followed.</P>
    <P>I believe that as good candidates, to put it at its lowest, could be nominated for the position by a Selection Board as could be nominated by any other <Col N="2355" /> procedure.  At any rate, if we follow the usual methods we can have no allegations of favouritism or anything of that sort.  These are temporary positions, and if the Minister after a fortnight or a month, found the person unsuitable or unsatisfactory, he could discharge him or her without any further trouble.  In the case of an established civil servant the consent of the Executive Council would be necessary, but in the case of an unestablished civil servant the Minister can proceed summarily to effect his discharge.  The Minister might choose somebody different from the person who would be chosen by the Selection Board.  The Minister might be right and the Selection Board wrong.  Nobody claims that selection boards are omniscient, and the Minister might choose more wisely than the Board, but as a general rule, it is undesirable to make exceptions if they can be avoided.  It is undesirable that appointments should be made by a Minister other than by the regular machinery.  If the person chosen by the Selection Board cannot do the work he can get rid of him and get another and discharge his responsibility to the public in that way.  While I am reinforcing the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in this case, I think it necessary to disagree with him on what he has indicated as the general position in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has been trying to mend a very bad hand, and in trying to mend it he has exposed it.  The position of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is so indefensible that if, as I hope, Deputy Johnson forces this amendment to a division, the Minister for Finance will vote with him.  What is the position? The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs told us three months ago that his staff was inadequate, and that no time should be lost in supplementing it.  As a result, the Civil Service Commissioners issued an advertisement for two vacant posts, the first being for an Assistant Station Director of Wireless Broadcasting.  We are now told, with truth, I am sure, by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, that there were no suitable candidates.  The Commissioners <Col N="2356" /> found there were no suitable candidates.  That is not what the candidates were told.  They were told that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had decided not to fill the post.  I have myself seen a letter to one of the candidates, in which it was stated that it had been decided by the Minister not to fill the post&mdash;not that the candidates were not qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of what letter was sent, but I know one fact that may suggest an explanation. While the Commissioners found that no candidate for the post of assistant director was suitable, they were of opinion that one of the candidates for the post of woman organiser would have been suitable for the other post if she had applied.  I do not know if that does necessarily fully explain why a certain announcement was sent, but she again was a married woman, as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has said.  I do not know whether that is a full explanation of the announcement sent to the candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to compromise myself, but the letter I am speaking of was sent to a lady who was addressed as &ldquo;Miss,&rdquo; and not to a married woman.  She had applied for both posts, and the statement I saw in the letter was that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had decided that the post would not be filled&mdash;not that she was not a suitable candidate.  If, as I believe, there were no suitable candidates, they should have been told they were not qualified, and not have been told that the Minister had decided not to fill the post, although the Minister had already stated that he was understaffed.  I turn from that to the woman organiser.  The Minister rejected two suitable candidates who were approved of by the Civil Service Commission, on the grounds that they were married women.  Is marriage to be a disqualification for employment of this kind?  It is not a disqualification for sitting in the Dáil or Seanad, though it may be for the Civil Service, but these posts are not Civil Service posts.  They are temporary and not pensionable.  A woman organiser in a wireless broadcasting occupation is <Col N="2357" /> much more of a journalist than a civil servant.  What are her duties?  They are to arrange a children's hour.  Are single women better than married women for that?  Another duty would be to give certain cookery recipes.  Is a single woman, living in lodgings, better than the married woman living in her own home, for that?  Cookery is a subject on which the married woman would be better than the single woman, and also with regard to household hints, she would be better.  As the Minister for Finance told us, it is not a pensionable post.  It is a temporary position.  If a married woman, for reasons of health, could not fill the position, she need not be appointed, but I say, broadly speaking, there should be no differentiation as between a married and a single woman for this post.  If there is differentiation, it should be on the side of the married woman, rather than against her.</P>
      <P>We will get away from these comparatively minor points to a bigger issue.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has overruled the Civil Service Commission.  He said, &ldquo;I refuse to accept either of the candidates proposed to me by the Civil Service Commission.&rdquo;  During the last 120 years, as far as I know, there have been only three people who used the &ldquo;I&rdquo; in that manner, Napoleon, the Kaiser, and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;three great men, two of whom fell.  As I say, two of them fell and I hope the Minister will take a friendly warning.  The other two rose to greater heights than the Minister at present occupies, but I do not, of course, want to exclude him from reaching great heights.  That is the attitude of the autocrat, the attitude of the despot&mdash;&ldquo;I am not going to do what the Civil Service Commission tells me.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once one admits that principle&mdash; though I think the Minister admitted it in a spirit of honesty and believed that he was right and that it was the only fair thing to do&mdash;you open the door to every kind of nepotism and jobbery.  I do not suggest that has happened in this case, but I do say that if that precedent is adopted, if that principle is followed, the Civil <Col N="2358" /> Service Commission will be worthless; every safeguard of examination will be worthless if Minister take it upon themselves to over-rule the recommendations of the Civil Service Commission. I have sometimes criticised the Civil Service Commission for not being strong enough; in this case they were strong enough but they were overruled by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I hope the Committee will support Deputy Johnson's amendment.  It is a more moderate amendment than mine. On the whole, I am glad it is more moderate; being more moderate it will rally more general support.  It is not a question of £700 or £10; it is a question of whether Ministers are, on their own initiative, entitled to over-rule the recommendations of the Civil Service Commissioners.  If these posts are found to be necessary later on, then let the Minister bring a supplementary estimate and justify it to us; but at present we would do wrong and we would be taking a backward step if we allowed the Minister this power to make appointments which previously he said he would not make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's statement raises this issue to a height even greater than that which it appeared to me it had reached in the first instance.  I ask the Committee to give little heed to the excuse that is made that the selected persons were married.  That is only an afterthought. Quite obviously it is an afterthought because the Minister said as definitely as he could&mdash;and it ran right through his speech&mdash;&ldquo;I know nothing about the people; I never heard of them before.&rdquo;  It is for that very reason that this method of appointment was decided upon.  Ministers were not intended to know anything about people before they were selected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's own advertisement he made it clear to prospective candidates he was acting as Minister and directly with the authority of the Dáil that the appointment &ldquo;will be made by means of a selection board set up by the Civil Service Commission.&rdquo;  That clearly indicated to the public that the Minister would have nothing to do with it.  It is better that a Minister should <Col N="2359" /> not know anything about candidates.  It raises the position to that of an impersonal choice, a choice of particular persons by means of a selection board such as was advocated here last week &mdash;something which would remove even the possibility of the thought that the Minister was going to have power of choice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Johnson thinks that the mere fact that I said I knew nothing about those people had anything to do with my refusal to accept their nominations, he is making a mistake.  I merely mentioned that in passing, and it has no bearing whatever on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that in passing, but it was in support of a contention that he, as the responsible head of the Department which was running the broadcasting service, must have the power of choice. It was in support of that contention that he used the phrase that he knew nothing about these people, and had never heard about them before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the position we are placing ourselves in.  The Minister says that in this particular service he must not be directed, in respect to appointments, by the Civil Service Commissioners. He is in the same position in respect to appointments in his Department as the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, the Minister for Fisheries, and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  If the Committee allows this to pass without protest, what is to prevent the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Fisheries, and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture refusing to accept appointments made by the selection board of the Civil Service Commissioners unless the persons concerned meet with the approval of these Ministers?  That is the issue that is raised by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  One might say that the Minister for Fisheries, the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, and the Minister for Local Government are to be free, according to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to veto the decision of the Civil Service Commissioners in regard to appointments in their Departments.  That <Col N="2360" /> is a preposterous position to place us in.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the case&mdash;it is quite obvious what his mind is on the matter&mdash;that this service of wireless broadcasting ought not to be in the same category as the rest of the Civil Service; that it is something extern from the general State services; something that we are prepared to hand over to him as an individual to run and to make a success of.  Now, that might be the perfect method of running the broadcasting service, but it was not the method decided upon by the Dáil.  The Minister recommended and the Dáil accepted the recommendation of the original Commission; he personally brought before the Dáil the general scheme that the broadcasting service should be run by the Post Office.  When he did that he knew well that it was to be part of the general system of State service.  He should not have accepted responsibility for running this service unless he was prepared to treat it differently from that of a personal concern, of which he was director, and was personally responsible for the success of, with power to make appointments, to refuse appointments, to remove officers, and so on, just as he considered desirable, in order to have a perfect system.  As I say, that may be the best method in his view of running this service, but it is not the method approved by the Dáil.  It is not the method that the Minister accepted responsibility for.</P>
    <P>Let the Committee remember what is at issue.  It is that in some service, under extern Ministers the powers of the Civil Service Commission may be vetoed by the Ministers.  They may issue advertisements for certain appointments, telling the public that the selection board will make the appointments, and then say the appointments will not be made; that the selection board's choice has not satisfied the Ministers' requirements.  To show how important it is that future applicants shall have reason to be confident in the integrity of the promises made in the public advertisement, applicants receive a notice in these terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been brought to the notice of the Civil Service Commissioners <Col N="2361" /> that attempts have been made to use influence in favour of candidates for examination, or for interview by the selection board set up by the Commission, the Commission desire to give public notice that any attempt to influence any Commissioner, or any member of the selection board set up by the Commission, in favour of any candidate for public appointment, will automatically disqualify the candidate for the position he is seeking,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and that is signed by the Chairman of the Commission.  The effect of that is calculated and intended to let applicants feel that they are all on a level with regard to appointments, that influence is not going to be used by one who has greater access than another to the ears of the selection board, and that all are on a level, and will be chosen according to their merits, and according to the terms of the advertisement issued, the selection board of the Civil Service Commissioners being the deciders in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister asks us to accept an entirely different view, and states that he is not going to run this business except on terms that he has outlined here to-day.  I think the Committee, however it may regard the Minister, must not accept that position from him, and I put this motion down, feeling it was necessary to have the matter explained. I now intend to press it, with a view to asking the Committee to declare itself that the position taken up by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is one which we cannot support and cannot put our signature to.</P>

I think it is going a bit far when the Minister says that if he is to be responsible for the service he must have the selection of the people under him, to carry out that particular service.  In such circumstances, we had better say, at the outset, that we do not want any Civil Service Commission at all.</P>

People would be given certain powers to select certain individuals, and from some experience I have had, I believe that some of the appointments under the Bill would be controlled by medical unions or some similar bodies, I do not care what they are.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs knew, when those two people were recommended to him, that he had power to dismiss them, as the Minister for Finance has told us, and that he was not tied to any particular appointment. He had the power of dismissal, and I think that should have been sufficient, and although he knew he had that power he did not, and would not, make the appointment.  I think the issue is very clear cut, and, if we are to have Civil Service Commissioners at all, and this Dáil has passed an Act appointing them.

      <P>Having made that point, which is a perfectly legitimate point, there is no doubt whatever that the talk that has come from these Benches is absolutely inconsistent with the talk that came from the same Benches when the Local Authorities Bill was under discussion.  I just want to make one further point.  There is no use pettifogging.  I listened to Deputy Johnson very carefully.  I am absolutely in agreement with the procedure laid down by the Civil Service Commission. I probably made more appointments, in the sense of initialling them, than any other Minister.  I found it absolutely satisfactory.  I want to be in the position where my duty ends when my Secretary wants me to note &ldquo;No. 1 approved&rdquo; to write my initials at the end of it.  I suppose my writing approval shows I am absolutely in agreement with it?  I have not thought a lot about this matter, because I have not any views on the question.  I am not quite sure that a Minister would not be entitled on receiving a report of the Civil Service Commission to write to them, and say, &ldquo;While I believe No. 1 is the best qualified of all the applicants, he is not sufficiently well qualified, and I request you to advertise again.&rdquo;  I have not considered it very much, but it is a rather important point.  I can see for myself, in view of the experience I have had, that that right of the Minister would not cut across the powers of the Civil Service Commission in any way.  As some of the things Deputy Johnson said are close to that particular issue, I would like to say, without giving the matter very much thought, that I am not quite sure that the Minister would not be entitled, on receiving a recommendation from the Civil Service Commission, to say, &ldquo;There is no question that your No. 1 is better than your No. 2, but your No. 1 is not sufficiently qualified for this post, and I request further advertisement.&rdquo;<Col N="2366" /> I merely want to leave that issue without prejudice.</P>

Deputy Johnson went on to discuss a most important question; that is to say, the rules and regulations dealing with the procedure of the Civil Service Commission, and while listening to him I wanted just to say that the issue should not be prejudiced.  I am not saying that I have completely made up my mind on the question, but I do think, in certain circumstances, it is at least arguable that the Minister should not be in a position to write to the Civil Service Commissioners and say: &ldquo;Your No. 1 is not sufficiently qualified.  I have arranged with the Minister for Finance that there should be another advertisement issued.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would like to be very clear with regard to your ruling on this matter.  Deputy Johnson has moved the reduction of the Vote as a protest against the policy of the Minister for Posts in the administration of broadcasting.  Deputy Johnson has made a case on that with regard to the making of certain appointments in connection with this service and the policy of the Minister not alone at the time that the appointments were to be made but the policy as announced by the Minister in defence of his action here this evening.  Undoubtedly, until the Minister for Posts himself made a statement, I did not look on this as the serious matter it has grown to be.  Deputy Cooper made reference to three great men.  He suggested that the Minister for Posts was not as great as the other two; that he had not risen to the heights occupied by the others. I suggest that he is very much in the air at the moment, and if we are to judge by the arguments on his policy he is practically blown sky-high.  He has made no attempt to defend his action. An advertisement was issued by the Civil Service Commission.  Are we to accept it that that advertisement was <Col N="2368" /> issued without the knowledge or approval of the Minister or did the Civil Service Commission publish an advertisement not knowing fully what was required?  If they did there is fault somewhere.  If the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs did not make it clear to the Civil Service Commission the fault is with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Civil Service Commission issues advertisements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes it clearer still that the fault is with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs himself.  Did he not know when he was drafting and publishing his advertisement what he wanted?  Did he not know the types of candidates who would probably come forward for examination?  Did he not know what the law was that excluded certain types from filling such posts as he would require to fill?  What is his answer to that then&mdash;knowing what the law was&mdash;issuing an advertisement, and when the recommendations were made by the Civil Service Commission, declaring that the candidates were not capable to discharge the duties he wanted them to perform, and accordingly he would not fill the posts?  He told us further this evening that because a candidate did not reach a certain standard in his estimation, the candidate could not be expected to give the service to this State that the State demands, and that he could not be expected to make these appointments. Is he not then, condemning and passing judgment on the Civil Service Commission, on its Board of Examiners and whoever were responsible for submitting names to him?  Is he not declaring their incapacity and their inability to fulfill the duties for which they were brought into existence by a law of this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister's action, as indicated in his statement here this evening, would be likely, if accepted and approved of by the Dáil, to have far-reaching consequences on the faith and the belief that any type of candidate going before that Civil Service Commission will have.  It will tend so much to weaken their faith and their belief and their sense of justice in what they may except from that Commission that it <Col N="2369" /> will be very difficult to make any applicant for any post in the Civil Service of this State believe that he is going to get fair play.  The Civil Service Commission was established according to a law accepted by the Dáil and by the Minister.  They are either capable or incapable of performing the duties assigned to them.  Is it for the Minister to come here and make a statement that undoubtedly must convey to the Dáil and to the public generally the impression that the selections made by the Civil Service Commission and reported to Ministers are selections of individuals who are not capable of discharging the duties of the particular posts that they have made application to fill?  That is exactly the position the Minister for Lands is in.</P>
    <P>I do not want to enter into a discussion of the Local Officers Bill.  I am sure it is out of order, and I do not think the Minister for Lands and Agriculture should be permitted to have drawn a red herring across the trail. There is no comparison whatever between the two positions, even though he does want to talk about them and even though he does want to make a point about them.  That Bill is not yet law, and we do not know what the attitude of the Dáil or the Minister who introduced it may be, but we say very definitely that if the attitude of any extern Minister in the matter of making appointments under any law passed by this Dáil, is to be the attitude displayed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in his statement here to-night, we do not think any Deputy on any side of the House could defend the policy of the Dáil in passing such legislation that would give this power either to an extern Minister or a member of the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>On this amendment we will be called upon to vote, and I would not like, as far as my small end of the stick is concerned, that a vote would be taken without having an opportunity of expressing my opinions on this matter.  I have listened to the discussion which has grown to be somewhat serious after the disclosure of facts, which we knew nothing about before.  I would like to say that the decision I have come to in this matter <Col N="2370" /> is, that I recognise, and I am quite sure that the decision of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was perfectly bona fide from his point of view.  But as the matter has been raised and discussed, I think that the Dáil, or no Deputy as far as I can see, would not be justified in stultifying the position of the Commissioners to the extent that they would be, in assenting to the proposal that is outlined in the statement of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I do think that if that is a procedure that they accept, it would cut at the root of our confidence in the administration, and would have such far-reaching effects, that I feel I must be compelled to join in the vote in favour of Deputy Johnson's amendment, if it be put to a division.</P>

I supported the introduction of that principle and I still support it.  I have no desire whatever to detract from its advantages, or depart from it, but the case we are discussing was exceptional.

      <P>I do not think it is possible to guarantee that the Bill will be introduced this session.  The probability is that it will, but there is a certain delay in drafting of Bills and I do not want to be held responsible if the Bill is not introduced.  I am prepared to go into any points here but I took it that earlier in the night we agreed to confine ourselves to the items in the estimate and not go into the question of general policy.  Otherwise, I would have opened with a statement covering the whole position.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked to make a statement explaining not only the Estimates for my Department, but also its general policy.  In addition to that there is the consideration that on a few occasions during the last two or three months, when agricultural debates were suggested, I expressed the view, and it was approved by the Dáil, that these matters should be deferred until the Estimates were being considered.  For that reason my statement now will take some time.  The gross vote for the Department of Agriculture is £548,652, and the net, as shown on the Estimate, is £421,164. This latter figure is obtained by deducting all the Appropriations-in-Aid, namely, £127,488 from the gross figure of £548,652.  These Appropriations-in-Aid include receipts from rents, sale of agricultural produce, students' fees, repayment of loans, and fees paid under various Acts, but they also include grants amounting to £58,650 from the Local Taxation Account, the Church Temporalities Fund, and Estate Duties, and this figure of £58,650 should be added to the net Vote of £421,164, <Col N="2377" /> making a total of £479,814 in order to get a correct view of the expenditure provided for on this Vote in respect of the Department of Agriculture.  There should also be added the sum of £40,673 provided for on other Votes to meet rates, provision of office accommodation, stationery and printing, superannuation allowances, and Post Office services. This brings the total net cost of the Department of Agriculture to £520,487.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of a general survey, as well as for analysing expenditure, it will be convenient to consider the true net figure which appears on this Vote, namely, £479,814, and to omit the items for rates, stationery, buildings, etc., which are accounted for on other Votes and which can be dealt with in detail in the course of the discussion.  A general idea as to how this amount of £479,814 is spent may be obtained by grouping certain sub-heads and giving round figures which are approximately accurate, and can be easily remembered. Sub-heads A, B, C and D may be grouped together under the heading of Expenses of Headquarters' Staff.  The Vote under these sub-heads amounts to £125,404 and represents almost entirely salaries and travelling expenses of the Headquarters' Staff, including not only the clerical, but the general inspectorate and technical staff of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-heads E (1) and E (2) Technical, Advisory and Research Work; E (3) Subscriptions to International Research Organisations; E (4) Special Investigations and Reports; F (2) Grants to Private Agricultural Schools; F (3) Veterinary College; F (4) Grants to Universities for Teaching in Agriculture; F (5) Supplementary Scholarships; K (2) Contribution to I.A.O.S.; L, Botanic Gardens; M (1) Miscellaneous Work; M (2) Fees for Reports on Agricultural Conditions; M (3) Special Departmental Publications, Leaflets, etc., may be grouped together under the head of &ldquo;Education,&rdquo; costing £64,964 gross, and about £62,214 net.  To these, however, should be added sub-head F (1)&mdash;being the Six Agricultural Institutes of the Department, costing £46,830 gross, and about £21,630 net, and finally, the new sub-heads P and Q&mdash;being grants <Col N="2378" /> for the establishment of Agricultural Faculties at the University Colleges in Dublin and Cork, and amounting to about £69,822, making a net total for Education of approximately £153,666.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads H (1) and H (2) amounting to £89,200 may be grouped together as grants to County Committees of Agriculture for their educational, livestock, and other schemes.  These sums are paid as grants into a fund called the Joint Fund, which includes not only these grants but the amount raised by rate by the County Councils for agricultural purposes.  Last year the contribution from rates amounted to about £30,000.  This year it will be about £32,000.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads G (1) Improvement of Flax Growing; G (2) Improvement of Milk Production; G (3) Improvement of Live Stock; I, Special Agricultural Schemes in Congested Districts; K (1) Agricultural Societies and Shows; M (4) Loans for Agricultural Purposes, amounting in all to £83,611 gross, or £58,696 net, may be regarded as in respect of work done directly by the Department analogous to that administered by the Department through the County Committees of Agriculture. As will be seen from an examination of the sub-heads, this money is spent mainly on the improvement of live stock and live-stock products, by giving extra premiums for bulls and boars; by leasing bulls and stock pigs; by selling bulls, pigs, and horses at reduced prices for stock purposes; by paying a proportion of the expenses of the Cow Testing Associations, and by lending money for the purchase of stock animals. These schemes are, to a large extent, confined to the congested districts. The work done by the County Committees of Agriculture in connection with live stock is on similar lines, and the position is that, so far as county committee and supplementary schemes are concerned, they are financed out of taxation to the extent of £148,000 and by local rates to the extent of £32,000.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads N (1), N (2), N (3), N (4), O (1), O (2), O (3), O (4), O (5), O (6) and O (7) may be grouped together under the general heading of &ldquo;Control.&rdquo;  They deal with the <Col N="2379" /> Diseases of Animals Acts, Weeds and Seeds Acts, Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Acts, Destructive Insects and Pests Act, Sale of Food and Drugs Act, and, finally, the three new Acts relating to agriculture, viz., Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, the Dairy Produce Act, and the Live Stock Breeding Act.  The cost of these control services is £68,816 gross, or about £53,343 net. Of this £53,343 the three new Acts cost £35,800 gross, or £23,800 net.  The largest deficit is in connection with the Dairy Produce Act.</P>
    <P>Summing up, therefore, the costs of the various departmental services are approximately:&mdash;</P>

    <P>There are a few observations necessary in order to complete the picture. The Headquarters Staff includes not only clerical but technical officers, and in the latter category are included technical officers who spend most of their time in the country.  For instance, under the heading of General and Technical Outdoor Staff there are a number who spend most if not all, of their time in the country, and these alone cost about £28,000.  Secondly, it is extremely difficult to draw a clear distinction between educational and other schemes.  For instance, I have set out as the cost of &ldquo;Direct Educational Schemes&rdquo; administered by the Department the sum of £154,000 and I have grouped separately the work of the County Committees of Agriculture and schemes of a similar nature, which cost approximately £148,000.  I have explained that these county committee and supplementary schemes are, to a considerable extent, concerned with live stock and live-stock products, but they are also to some extent educational. The provision includes part of the cost of the Instructors of the County Committees of Agriculture and <Col N="2380" /> the whole cost of certain of the inspectors and overseers of the Department. The duties of these officers are not only to administer the live stock schemes, but also to carry out experimental work in connection with the cultivation of potatoes, flax, and crops of all other kinds, in addition to conducting manurial experiments, feeding experiments, winter agricultural classes, and to act as advisers of any and every farmer in their districts who wish to requisition their services.</P>
    <P>Again, I have grouped the agricultural institutes as educational.  These institutes are, of course, to a very large extent, educational, but in addition, the live stock bred on the farm attached thereto are used to supplement the live-stock schemes which are provided for under a separate sub-head. It would be easy to make quite reasonable suggestions, tending to show that the grouping which I have adopted might be altered.  It might be said, for instance, that the Botanic Gardens or the contribution to the I.A.O.S. should not be grouped under the heading &ldquo;Educational,&rdquo; and that the services which are paid for out of these sub-heads could be more properly grouped with some other services or as separate services.  This is a matter of opinion.  My concern is, in the first instance, to try and analyse expenditure in a general way and under convenient and easily remembered headings.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture is staffed as follows:&mdash;There are roughly 190 clerical officers, 250 technical officers (including agricultural overseers, assistant overseers, flax instructors, cow-testing instructors and potato demonstrators), about 190 wage-earners &mdash;employed in connection with the various institutions, at the ports, etc. &mdash;making a total of about 630.  In addition to these, not exactly employed by the Department, but to a certain extent controlled by it, there are 144 officers employed by County Committees of Agriculture, and also certain temporary men employed for short periods each year in connection with the operation of Acts, such as the Live Stock Breeding Act, the Weeds and Seeds Act, etc.  Of the 144 County <Col N="2381" /> Committee Officers, about 29 are paid in whole by the Department, and the remainder are paid partly out of grants made by the Department to County Committees, partly from moneys voted by the Dáil on the Department's Estimates for bonus, and partly from moneys raised locally by rate.  New or additional services appear on the Estimates in connection with Sugar Beet, the I.A.O.S., University Education, <Col N="2382" /> Live Stock Breeding Act, the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, the Dairy Produce Act, and Live Stock Schemes, and the total cost of these new or additional schemes is about £130,000.</P>
    <P>The Dáil went out of Committee.</P>
    <P>Progress reported.  Committee to sit again on Friday, 28th May.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.25 p.m.</P>
