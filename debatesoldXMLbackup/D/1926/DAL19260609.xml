      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the delay in the delivery of a parcel addressed to Messrs. Day Bros., Midleton, Co. Cork; that the Customs Authorities notified this firm that duty was payable on it; that the Cork and Midleton Offices, on inquiries being made there, had no information about the parcel; that the Dublin Customs Office was then communicated with, where the parcel was located; that the duty involved was immediately forwarded, but that six days elapsed before the parcel was delivered, and that it took seventeen days, from the date of its despatch, to reach its destination; if he will state the reason for the delay in this case, and whether, in order to facilitate, and to obviate loss to, business people, he will give instructions that in future dutiable parcels be sent direct to the local Customs Office.</P>

      <P>A parcel addressed to Messrs. Day Bros., Midleton, from Basingstoke, presumed to be the parcel to which the Deputy refers, arrived at the Parcel Post Depot, Fowler Hall, Dublin, on 27th April last.  The usual notice of arrival, with a request to make entry and pay duty, was sent to the addresses on the same date, two forms of entry being enclosed for the convenience of the importers, for return to the Depot, when completed. The entry forms, together with the amount of duty, were received back at Fowler Hall on 5th May, and the parcel was examined and released on the 8th May.  The main delay in delivery <Col N="696" /> arises out of the delay on the part of Messrs.  Day Bros. in returning the entries with the duty.  The delay between the receipt of duty at Fowler Hall and delivery was due to the congestion arising out of the abnormal parcel traffic to be dealt with at Fowler Hall in the early days of the General Strike in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>Dutiable goods imported by Parcel Post are dealt with at Parcel Post Depots at which Customs and Postal officials are stationed.  These Depots have been set up, with the concurrence of the Revenue and Post Office authorities, at the chief points at which parcels reaching the Saorstát by post can be dealt with.  It would not be possible, without incurring a considerable expenditure of public money, to arrange that parcels containing dutiable goods arriving by post should be sent direct to the Customs Offices nearest to consignee's address.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move to reduce sub-head F by £10,000.  The Minister gave us a fairly exhaustive account of the present position of the rural industries carried on under his Department. He gave us one or two assurances, which I welcome, but I cannot help thinking that a little more detailed and exhaustive inquiry into the present condition of those industries may be a good thing and may lead to a direction from the Dáil to the Minister as to the policy he is to pursue in connection therewith.  It will not, I think, be in any material degree different from the policy which he intends to pursue, but it may induce him to adopt that policy more quickly and possibly more drastically.  These rural industries are an inheritance from the Congested Districts Board.  I do not quite know why they were transferred to the Minister for Fisheries.  But they were transferred, and it is opportune to look into their history for a few minutes.  Originally, the Congested Districts Board did not run industries of any kind.  Mr. Micks, in his account of the Congested Districts Board, says the principle was laid down that ownership or managership of any industrial enterprise would not be undertaken.  That rule was subsequently departed from, but I believe it was a sound principle.  The object can be attained without the necessity of having a Government Department <Col N="699" /> for rural industries at all.  What the Congested Districts Board did in its early days was to make grants of money to places where they believed industries could be successfully set up. In one case&mdash;that of the tweed manufactory at Foxford&mdash;that policy was eminently successful.  Now, we have the Trade Loans Act, which would provide for that without the need for the Department under the Minister at all.</P>
      <P>Gradually, as time went on, there was a very considerable development of rural industries under the C.D.B. That was almost entirely due to the work of two very remarkable men&mdash;the late Mr. W.J.D. Walker, whose death we all regret, and Mr. Gilbert Phelan, who, in turn, were in special charge of the Industries Department.  Mr. Walker was a man of business knowledge and training and, as Mr. Micks states, the Board very soon discovered that commercial knowledge and training are essential to the success of an undertaking in the hands of the State. He began by organising the industries and by assisting them with loans.  His successor, Mr. Gilbert Phelan, was a man of great enterprise.  He was always watching the markets of the world, and he was accustomed to pay frequent visits to London, Manchester, Paris and other centres where the goods produced by these industries were marketed.  As a result, he was able to attain considerable success, though he had also some failures.  A remarkable instance of his capacity was the way in which&mdash;when the outbreak of the war made many of the goods produced by the rural industries in congested districts quite unsaleable, because they were luxuries&mdash;Mr. Phelan discovered that there was a shortage of buttons for ladies' clothes. There was a shortage of bone and celluloid buttons, and he made an industry by covering little bits of wood and cardboard with various colours of silk and other materials, which filled the want for the time.  That, of course, had to be abandoned at the close of the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can discover, there is nobody in the Minister's Department in the position that Mr. Walker and <Col N="700" /> Mr. Phelan occupied.  There is no directing head or general staff for this work.  The technical and outdoor staff of the Ministry, so far as I can see, is connected entirely with fisheries.  I am very doubtful as to whether a Government Department can carry on industries at all, but I am quite sure that it cannot when it has not what I call a general staff.  The result is that when an industry is established it is regarded as a thing that must be carried on.  Somebody with a salary will naturally carry it on until they are told not to do so.  The result might be that you would have them going on producing goods that would be unsaleable and unsuitable to the times.  Deputy McGoldrick yesterday spoke about lace-making. The people are not wearing lace.  I remember the time when every lady in evening dress wore a large amount of lace.  But lace is not used now with ladies' dresses.  Money spent on lace-making is, to a large extent, money wasted, owing to the change of fashion and also owing to the fact that the Japanese have learned to produce lace and can produce it more cheaply than we can.  They can under-cut us in the markets.  The same thing applies in the case of homespuns and tweeds.  We are going on making our homespuns in the old way, regardless of the fact that nobody in the United States will wear heavy suits, because their houses are all steel-sheeted, and they wear heavy overcoats when they go out.</P>
    <P>Unless you have some directing intelligence&mdash;and it would be unfair to expect the Minister to give up all his directing intelligence to rural industries, when he has to attend to fisheries &mdash;you will lose money on these industries. Look at the accounts and you will see that we are losing money.  One would be glad of more detailed information regarding the position of these industries.  The Minister gave us the number of them yesterday, but I should like to know the number of person employed and the total turnover. Looking at the Estimate, we have, on one side, as an Appropriation in-Aid, &ldquo;Receipts from rural industries, £17,470.&rdquo;  We may put that on the credit side.  On the debit side you have, omitting any item for wages or <Col N="701" /> capital charges&mdash;Purchase of raw material, £16,000; postage for finished articles, £1,000; travelling expenses to markets&mdash;what you might call commercial travelling charges&mdash;£300, and freight and carriage, £100.  That is, £17,400 as against £17,470.</P>
    <P>Therefore the total profit of these industries, so far as can be judged from this Estimate, to meet all items, wages, capital charges, repairs to plant, rents, rates, and so on, is £70 a year. Obviously that is not a business proposition. It could only be justified on the ground either of exceptional need or because of the fact that the industries are being carried through their most difficult and struggling years. But some of these industries have been carried on for nearly ten years.  The Galway toy industry, to which the Minister referred, is one.  That has apparently been run, year after year, at a loss, and it has now been decided to close it down.  If there is no prospect of expansion in that toy factory now, I do not believe that there was any chance two years ago.  I believe it would have been desirable to cut the losses sooner.  But unless you have some directing intelligence applied to this question you will never know what is the right time to cut your losses.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General has commented on some of the glove industries showing certain shortages. One glove industry cost £550, and no sales appear to have been made during the financial year.</P>
    <P>I do not think you are going to get any rural industries of value to the country on those lines.  I think the Minister is partly persuaded to that himself, from what he said yesterday, but I do suggest to the Dáil that if we have this money to spend, it would be better spent for fishery purposes and for purposes allied to fishery purposes, within the congested districts, than in this manner.  The kelp industry is an industry we ought to assist, because it will employ the fishermen on days when they cannot go out to sea or when the fish are not there.  I think if we are going to promote industries they ought to be promoted by one Department, and that is the Department of Industry and Commerce. The present situation is that <Col N="702" /> where there might be trade enough for one industry you might have the Minister for Fisheries subsidising one industry in the congested districts and the Minister for Industry and Commerce giving a Trades Loan guarantee to another industry in another part of the country, with the two industries set up in competition with each other and cutting each others throats.  As a matter of fact, the functions of the Minister for Fisheries, under Section 1 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, is &ldquo;Fisheries and all industries connected with or auxiliary to the same.&rdquo; I do not quite know how, except on the grounds of established practice, the making of toy rocking-horses could be described as auxiliary to fisheries.</P>

      <P>I think they are land horses.  If you put them into the sea I think they would be fish out of water, or <i>vice versa.</i>  I suggest this amendment on two grounds.  One is that I think the sooner the connection of the Minister for Fisheries with these industries is curtailed the better, and the second is that he ought to have all the money we can spare for fishery development, because I believe that will yield very much more profitable and advantageous results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephMcGoldr" hpid="Mr. McGOLDRICK Mr. McGOLDRICK">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest, not unmixed with a considerable amount of amazement, to Deputy Cooper's remarks.  I do not believe for one moment that we can or should take the returns from the Department of Fisheries for last year as any standard by which to measure the wisdom or unwisdom of pursuing this policy.  Some of these industries were established some time ago and were on the road to becoming useful, but after the lapse of a certain period they have fallen away.  The proposal now is to revive them, and the necessity for their revival is obvious to everyone.  I do not for one minute admit that the figures taken from last year's returns are the figures that we should be guided by to any extent.  If they were taken on that basis they would, of course, be figures which obviously no business man could stand over, if what they show was to be taken as the result of continuity in the efforts <Col N="703" /> that are being made towards putting these industries on some kind of proper foundation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooper alleges that these industries are not allied to the fishing industry.  I do not agree.  I think they are very closely allied, and that they are the only industries in the areas where fishing is largely a supplementary industry, that can be properly said to be allied with fishing.  They are a real necessity for the communities that are more or less bound up with the development of fishing, in order that they may be enabled to live at home.  Consequently I believe that the Minister, from the very nature of his duties and the duties of his Department, ought to be more conversant with the circumstances and with the best methods to pursue for the development of these industries to put them on a proper basis.  The very nature of his business brings him into contact with the areas where these industries must of necessity be put in the way of becoming a success, and that they can be a success I have not the slightest doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper talked about lace-making having given way to other forms of rural industries.  I believe that is so to a certain extent, but that is not the only thing that can be done. It is only one of the sidelines, and it is only carried on to a small extent.  The rest of the industries that have already been mentioned are a good deal more important.  The Deputy also condemned the system by which the Minister for Industry and Commerce might give a Trades Loan Guarantee, by means of which a rival society might be set up in competition with that which the Minister for Fisheries is supporting and nurturing.  I do not think that there is any danger or likelihood of such a thing, and I think that that portion of his argument is fantastic.  I believe that the revival of these rural industries should be supported with such funds as can reasonably be placed at the disposal of the Minister, and I think that he will be able to do a good deal in the revival of these industries. He will not be able to do enough with the money he is receiving.  But to take <Col N="704" /> any money away form these industries would be absurd.  If we cannot give the Minister some more money, I think we should on no account take anything from him.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FISHERIES (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the opening remarks of Deputy Cooper I would like to concur, that is, in the tribute he paid to the two former officials of the Congested Districts Board.  I am perhaps more conversant with the work of Mr. Phelan than with that of Mr. Walker. I join with the Deputy in saying that these men did extraordinary work in their day for these industries.  The Deputy made great play, perhaps with a great deal of truth, on the statement that a State Department cannot hope to run industries of this kind from headquarters without a technical head, without a person who has a commercial instinct and the proper commercial training required for these industries. If the Deputy had been present he would have heard me mention in connection with rural industries that I was seeking from the Department of Finance permission to appoint an industrial inspector who would have that technical knowledge, who would have knowledge not only of the changing fashions in the different places where we get our markets, but who would also have the technical knowledge of dyeing and weaving, which is necessary if we are to bring back the Donegal homespuns to the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I remember stating&mdash;if I did not it was an omission, because I had it in my notes&mdash;the number of persons who are employed in these industries. There are, roughly, about 600 girls and 30 men and boys employed in them. They do not earn a livelihood in them, but a partial livelihood, to help to support themselves and their families.  I grant that to a certain extent money is being lost by the State on this matter, but I think that Deputy Cooper's comparison between the Appropriations-in-Aid and the outlay is not quite correct, because even though we buy, say, £16,000 worth of raw material this year, we may not get the money from the products of that until next year, and that will happen year after year. It is hardly fair, therefore, to call that <Col N="705" /> difference a loss.  Deputy Cooper also referred to the glove industry.  Very soon after we took over, and when this business was examined, the industry was immediately closed down.  There was a loss of £550, which was due to the wages of the staff, pending consideration as to what our decision should be.</P>
    <P>As to these industries being under my Department, I need not say, of course, that it was not my seeking; but I think that it was in essence the one Department that could really deal with it.  We were concerned with these areas, and we took over a great many of the staff of the Congested Districts Board, which had been dealing with these industries.  The Secretary of the Department is a man who had been Chief Clerk of the Congested Districts Board for a considerable number of years, and who, I should say, undoubtedly more than any other official in the State, knew the workings of these industries.  That influenced the decision of the Government to put these industries under the Fisheries Department. Deputy Cooper said that it would be well that the money spent on these should be transferred to fisheries, or to industries which were closely allied to fishing, like the kelp industry. The kelp industry does not require any subsidy.  It is growing from private enterprise, and the only way in which we help that private enterprise is to try to convince the people engaged in making the kelp to produce an article that is marketable.  The makers do not ask for a subsidy, and there is no need for a subsidy.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Cooper's reference to the Trade Loans was quite aptly answered by Deputy McGoldrick.  I do not believe that these industries would fulfil the conditions which would enable them to get loans under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, and as for the Department of Industry and Commerce granting loans to competitors in same line, I do not believe that such a thing has arisen or is within the bounds of possibility.</P>
    <P>Although I do not like to be interpreted by other people, I think that he gave a rather fair interpretation of my own particular outlook on this <Col N="706" /> matter.  I said yesterday that if any one of these became absolutely hopeless so that it would at no time become self-supporting, it should be abandoned. We have closed down some of these on that account.  Even though we do lose a little, there are compensating advantages.  I believe that the training that the girls who are engaged in these industries get is of very great value, not only to themselves but to the area in which they live.  I know, as a matter of fact, that many a bleak home has been brightened by the earnings of these girls, which range from ten shillings and fifteen shillings a week to one pound and thirty shillings a week in the case of more competent girls.  These girls are educated technically in the working of the machines, and they are educated generally from the social point of view, and if it happened, as it happened in the last few years, owing to the slump in the market, that they have to emigrate, they emigrate, at least, with advantages which they would not, otherwise, have had.  At this stage I think it would be fantastic to reduce this sum.  I do not ask for an increase as I think it would also be fantastic to ask for an increase, but I think, at least, that it must be given a trial, especially in the light of the hope that I have of centralising the selling here in Dublin, by means of a central depôt, and of being allowed to employ, if I can find such a person, a competent industrial inspector.</P>

      <P>The figures last year were not given in detail but were given under rough headings.  This is the first year that an opportunity has really been given of examining the matter.  It may be and I gather from the Minister that it is the case, that the figures are misleading.  I do not mean misleading in a wrong sense&mdash;in the sense that they do not show the <Col N="707" /> accumulation of raw material to be used up.  I thought that the raw material would go on from year to year and that there would be a certain amount carried over at the end of the year.  The Minister said one thing which I must correct.  He said that he is not asking for an increase in this Vote.  He is asking for what at first sight looks like an increase of £500, but, taking the Appropriation-in-Aid into account, there is a reduction of about £3,000.</P>

      <P>I want it to be clear that this is, in fact, an increasing charge, and, unless steps are taken to give the Minister a staff which will enable him to organise the Department properly, it will continue to be an increasing charge.  We are spending £13,000 to employ 630 people.  You cannot go on doing that on that scale. From the point of view of economic administration, you cannot allow that to go unchecked, but I think if the Minister does what he suggested should be done, namely, to appoint an industrial inspector&mdash;not a man who has been a failure in commerce, but one who is something of a crusader, something of an enthusiast&mdash;he may have reasonable hopes of reducing the charge.  I do not want to weaken his case as against the Minister for Finance, as it was the opinion of the Dáil yesterday that the Minister for Fisheries was the good fairy and the Minister for Finance the bad one.  If we reduce this Vote, the Minister for Finance will say that there is only a small sum available, and, therefore, you cannot appoint an industrial inspector. Therefore, I ask the leave of the Dáil to withdraw my motion.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £94,800 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1927, for Grants in Aid of the Expenses of University Institutions, including Grants under the Irish Universities Act, 1908, and the Land Act, 1923.</P>
      <P>Deputies will notice, as regards sub-head A, that there is no change.  The statutory grants are, for the present, included as they have been in the past. In regard to sub-head B, &ldquo;Additional Grants,&rdquo; there is set down for University College, Dublin, a sum of £34,000, but that only represents part of the year's provision.  The transfer of the functions of the College of Science to University College, Dublin, will not actually take place until 1st October, or thereabouts.  There is a partial provision to the College of Science under its own heading and there is a partial provision here.  The annual sum represented by the £34,000 is £50,000, which is made up of the two parts.  We dissected the expenditure that fell under the heading of the College of Science, and we found that the non-agricultural part of the College of Science cost, annually, £32,000, so that that sum goes to University College, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heretofore, between additional grants of a recurrent character and what was called a non-recurrent grant, though it recurred several times, £20,000 went to University College, Dublin.  That is a total of £52,000, but we are actually reducing that sum to £50,000.  That means that University College, Dublin, including the College of Science, for the future, will get an annual sum less by £2,000 than <Col N="709" /> what has been paid for the work of the two institutions in the past.  On the other hand, we are giving to University College a lump sum of £25,000 to pay off the debt which arose out of the fact that building prices went up during the war and a heavy overdraft remained and interest charged accrued.  We will not, however, lose the whole of the £25,000 because, under the provisions of the Bill which was introduced to-day, certain houses which were bought by the Senate of the University will be sold and the proceeds of the sale will revert to the Exchequer. We are estimating that in that way we will get a sum of £10,000, so that there will be a net advance under this, so far as Dublin is concerned, of something like £15,000, and there is a reduction in the annual grant of £2,000, when we take the College of Science and University College, Dublin, together.</P>
    <P>By reason of the amalgamation it will be possible for the institution to effect some savings at once and effect further savings as vacancies occur and as a certain amount of duplication can be eliminated at no cost to the State a certain substantial sum will ultimately accrue to the University for the development of its work.  In regard to University College, Cork, there is an increase, as compared with last year, of £8,000.  University College, Cork, since the value of money has fallen so sharply, has not been able to carry on on the sums it was receiving from the State.  It is a college, of course, which has developed substantially since the original endowment was fixed.  It had, originally, £20,000, and it was given, in recent years, £12,000 additional, or a total sum of £32,000.  It has not been possible for the College to carry on on that sum and, as a matter of fact, there was a deficit last year of over £4,000.</P>
    <P>Owing to the great increase in the cost of living, the staff had to be given bonuses and the non-salaried staff had very substantial increases in their wages, so that the general costs have gone up, with the result that within the last three years or so the college in Cork accumulated a debt of about £15,000, which we propose to wipe out. That does not represent the entire debt <Col N="710" /> due by the college in Cork.  There is another substantial sum due which arose out of the purchase of playing fields, but our view is that the college itself should find a means of wiping off that debt.  Actually, it requires an increase of something like £5,000 in order to enable the Cork college to pay its way and carry on without being obliged to fall into debt.  There were necessary developments in the work there which required additional sums. Owing to the general State policy with regard to the teaching of Irish and the increased use of the national language, it was necessary that the college should make certain additional provisions for the teaching of Irish and for the teaching of subjects through the medium of Irish, so that the teachers going out, either to primary or secondary schools, should have a command and control of the language which would not be obtained by the mere teaching of Irish, but which necessitated a certain amount of education through Irish. That necessitated an addition of £1,500 or £2,000 to the sum by which it was necessary to increase the annual grant. An additional £1,500 or £2,000 was given for the general purposes of the college and to enable it to develop its work as it was found necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>The colleges in Dublin and Cork have agreed that they will make no further application to the State for increased moneys for a period of at least five years and that they will definitely carry on their work without piling up debts which they might look to the State to liquidate at a later date.  I feel this increase is an increase which is not excessive.  It is an increase which was due, having regard to the development of the colleges, the increase in the number of students, the fall in the value of money, and the consequently increased charges upon the institutions.</P>

      <P>The Committee will notice that there is an increase in this Estimate of £62,000.  As the Estimate shows, and as the Minister's statement indicates, this increase, with a promise of further increases, will go to two of the three constituent colleges of the National University There is no reference in the Minister's <Col N="711" /> statement or in the Estimate to any provision being made for the third college, Galway College.  I think Galway College and those who represent the West of Ireland have a right to make strong complaint relative to the attitude of the Government.  This is not the first time that complaints of this kind have been made, and deservedly made.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of certain developments in regard to Cork College, especially in the matter of Irish, and he gave that as one of the reasons why an increased grant should go to Cork. He spoke of the necessities of the colleges both in Cork and Dublin.  Far be it from me to object to substantial grants being made to Cork or Dublin; but when it is a question of giving grants according to the necessities of the case, there should not be any unfair discrimination against the western college. There is talk of necessity, but surely, if it is a case of necessity, the necessity in the case of Galway College is greater than the necessity of either Cork or Dublin Colleges.  Figures have been submitted to the Minister and members of the Government to show that a necessity does exist in Galway College.  The salaries paid to the professors in Galway are not anything approaching the salaries paid in Dublin or Cork.  They are all connected with the one University and the standard for Dublin, Cork and Galway is the same.  They are expected to do as good work in Galway, yet they pay the smallest salaries to their professors.</P>
      <P>That has an obvious result.  There is always a drag, as it were, on Galway. They cannot afford to keep a good man; they cannot afford to give him a salary which would keep him, and Dublin and Cork will be competing for him.  Then the vicious circle begins. The Minister or the Government will say to Galway: &ldquo;Why do you not do something big or special?&rdquo; They cannot do anything big or special so long as they are starved, and they are starved because they cannot do anything big or special.  You have the thing going in a circle, as it were That is what the Galway people rightly complain of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> This matter was under discussion before and certain proposals were made which have now eventuated. Not alone are substantial grants being given to Cork and Dublin, but a new Faculty of Agriculture is being established in Dublin&mdash;they are taking over the College of Science and the Albert Agricultural College&mdash;and a new Faculty of Science is being established in Cork.  When these proposals were adumbrated some years ago during a debate which occurred in connection with the College of Science, an indication was given of the Government's intention in regard to Galway.  Some time ago they were asked what proposals they were prepared to make and a committee was set up on which the Government appointed a representative and on which there were representatives of the Gaelic League and others.  Certain conclusions were come to by that committee, and the governing body of the college agreed to adopt its report and take whatever steps were necessary to put the recommendations arrived at into operation. But they can only do that if they are financed.  We are now asked to pass this Vote and there is no definite word from the Minister as to what provision, if any, he is going to make in connection with Galway College.</P>
    <P>I believe the people of Galway the governing body of the college and the people all over the province of Connaught are at one in this matter.  They feel the Government has not given a fair deal to the Galway College. There are people who say that this is only one indication of the fact that since this Government came into existence Connaught has been completely forgotten.</P>

Since our own Government came into control that seems to be forgotten, and it seems to be the policy that if Galway College is a poor college, and if its resources are limited, then it must remain so.  It is &ldquo;to those who have much, much shall be given&rdquo;&mdash;that seems to be the policy of the Government with regard to the constituent colleges.  I think it is right that, as representative for the district and as a member of the governing body of the College, I should enter a protest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words in support of the claim put forward by Deputy O'Connell in relation to Galway College.  The Deputy has put forward a very good case for <Col N="714" /> sympathetic consideration of the claim of Galway College.  The college is in the same rank as the colleges at Cork and Dublin and, that being so, surely it is very unfair for the Government to take up the attitude it has assumed towards Galway?  The professors in Dublin are paid a certain amount and the professors in Cork are equally paid, but the scale of pay for the professors in Galway College is much below what I might call the economic level.  It is a matter of public knowledge that these men are not half paid.  That is a very serious position, and I am surprised that the Government does not treat them more generously.  Anyone going to Galway, and seeing the college for themselves and its equipment, can realise in what a poor way it is.  Sympathy for Galway College is not confined to Galway City and the county of Galway.  The entire province of Connaught takes the deepest interest in the welfare of the college.  Students go there from all parts of the province. We think that the future of the college should be secured in some way. Deputy O'Máille suggested that an agricultural faculty might be established there.  I know nothing about that subject, and I do not suggest that, but I think it is up to the Government to find a specialised programme for this college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A future for Galway College was indicated in the Dáil on a previous occasion by a former Minister for Education. If we believe that it is possible to restore the language of the nation, we should at least see that one of our Universities made a special study of the Irish language.  No one can say that the language is getting particular fair play in the two other colleges. In fact, the reverse is the case in at least one of them.  It has been suggested that the college in Galway might be selected for the special teaching of Irish, not for the teaching of other subjects through Irish, but for the study of the living Irish language and for its dialects.  If that were done the college would make a name for itself.  You would have people interested in the Irish language, in Europe and America, coming there to see for themselves what was being done for <Col N="715" /> the language.  Irish as a living language is spoken on the streets of Galway to-day.  Everyone who visits Galway knows that.  We were told also that there might be a future for the college in connection with the training of national teachers.  I only mention that to indicate that in more ways than one work might be found for the college. One might say that the college should be either closed or put on its feet financially.  I would not put it that way because the closing of Galway College is unthinkable.  I hope the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to the many appeals made to him on behalf of Galway College and of the province, and that he will look into this matter.</P>

      <P>As an outsider, and with no particular interest in Galway, I must say that the speeches of the last three Deputies were very convincing. Out of a sum of nearly £170,000 which is being devoted to universities and colleges, little more than 10 per cent., or less than £19,000, is to be spent in the province of Connacht. All the rest is to be spent in Dublin and Cork.  I think the Deputies who have spoken made a very good case in favour of better provision being made for Galway University.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter I would like to draw the Minister's attention to, and that is the absence in Ireland of an adequate University Press.  A University Press is very essential if our universities are to maintain any kind of reputation for scholarship. <Col N="716" /> The reputation of many universities throughout the world is kept up by their University Presses.  Up to fifteen or twenty years ago the University Press of the Queen's College produced very fine books up to the best level of books produced elsewhere.  At present that is no longer the case, and through a lack of funds and of modern appliances there is at the present time no adequate University Press in the Irish Free State.  Irish scholars, as the Minister well knows, have to go abroad in order to get their works properly produced, with the result that other universities and other countries get the benefit of their work and scholarship. I submit to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education that this is a matter of the utmost importance in connection with our universities. I hope that in the course of the next year some effort will be made to see if there is any means whereby at least one proper University Press can be set up in this country.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the appeal that has been made by other Deputies on behalf of Galway University.  For some few years past deputations have been coming up here approaching the Minister for funds to enable the authorities to keep the college open.  As Deputy Esmonde <Col N="717" /> has shown, less than 10 per cent. of the sum to be voted for universities and colleges is to be given to the province of Connaught.  Galway University has turned out men as well qualified as men turned out by the other universities to hold high positions.  I might mention, in connection with the Shannon scheme, that the chief engineer now acting for the Government was one of the professors of Galway University, while several of its engineering students are also engaged on the same scheme.  That is something in favour of Galway University.  I think it is not fair to the people of the province of Connaught that they should have to be coming to the Government every other day in order to get funds to keep the college open.  Certain faculties are given to the other colleges, and I suppose they deserve them, but I think that Galway University deserves more than it is getting from the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not refer to Galway because we have no provision in the Estimate as it stands for any change.  Deputy Sears spoke of a specialised programme for Galway College.  I believe that the college could do work of great national value. If in some respects it has disadvantages from its situation, in other respects it has definite and concrete advantages, and I think that the college and the State ought to avail of those advantages and do the kind of work, especially work in relation to the Irish language, which Galway could do.  But it is not merely a matter for the Government.  It is a matter for the college to think out proposals and to put them up.  There was a Commission, composed mainly of representatives of Galway College, set up.  That Commission presented a report, but I think anybody who read it could not fail to see that it was a disappointing document.  It did not, to my mind, indicate that the authorities of the college were really in earnest about the question.  They are quite in earnest about the question of getting money, but I do not know that they are at all in earnest about the question of doing special work which would entitle them to money.  If they would, perhaps, take <Col N="718" /> that remark to heart we might get somewhere.</P>
      <P>If Galway is not going to do special work, then frankly as far as I am concerned I do not think it would be a wise course&mdash;it might be politically the only possible course to maintain it&mdash;to maintain it as a sort of toy college unless it does special work.  On the other hand, if it does special work, and if the people concerned will give their minds to devising a scheme and the best method for doing this special work that the college can do, I do not think they will find the Government so difficult to deal with.  It was intimated to them a considerable time ago that if something were put up to us which really indicated that the college was going to set about adapting itself to the new conditions and fitting itself to avail of new opportunities that we would meet them. I think some little progress has been made in that way.  No progress had been made at the time these Estimates were being framed.  There was certainly nothing before the Government that would have justified us in making a change in the Estimates so far as Galway was concerned at that time.  I am not sure that there is anything yet, but perhaps there may be when the Estimates for next year come to be framed.  There are certain things that have already been said to the representatives of the college.  These are that the income that it has, and which is partly conditional, would be assured to it, but beyond that I do not think it is at all possible to go at the moment.</P>
      <P>What is being done for Dublin is not costing the Government anything.  Although Dublin is getting the advantage, another institution is being incorporated in the Dublin College, and so far as fresh expenditure is concerned we really are doing nothing for Dublin by paying out money and by making new arrangements.  We are definitely doing something for Cork.  Cork, as a matter of fact, even on the question of Irish, got ahead of Galway.  They actually put proposals up to us before Galway put them up.  Generally, it seemed to me to be rather more alert and rather more in earnest about the business.</P>

That is clear enough.  I am not satisfied that it really cares a great lot about the Irish language at all.  I am not sure, taking the whole body of the authorities of Galway, that they realise that if there is to be a future before that college it must make itself a distinctive and a special institution, and it ought to do work that cannot be done in the same way, or that cannot be done so effectively, elsewhere.</P>

Cold water was thrown on them.  University College, Galway, was told it had no resources and owing to its situation and other reasons there was no use in looking for development along that line.  The Minister spoke of &ldquo;a sort of a Commission&rdquo; that was set up.  If it was &ldquo;a sort of a Commission&rdquo; with all the inferences that <Col N="720" /> might be drawn from it the Government was responsible for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wanted to say that evidently, from the way the Minister spoke of it, he did not think very much of it, but such as it was it was the Government that was responsible for setting it up.  He did not think much of their conclusions either, especially with regard to the matter of Irish.  I gathered that from him.  There were very many prominent members of the Gaelic League and prominent exponents of the language who signed their names to this report.  So far as I would be concerned I would not pretend to question the conclusions, so far as the welfare of the Irish language would be concerned, that would be advocated by those who attached their signatures to it.  That is the position I take up, as it is the position, I am sure, that a great many other people would take up.  They came forward with this scheme and pointed out what they thought should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain expenditure was necessary for various lectureships, increases of salaries to professors and so on.  What the authorities of the college are pleading is: if the Government are not satisfied will they indicate in some way what Galway College ought to do to meet their wishes?  The Minister says it is up to the college, but the college has put forward schemes, as I have indicated, and shown their willingness to fall in with the views of the Government. The only definite suggestion I heard from the Government was that the college should give up their medical school.  They are not prepared to give up their medical school.  They believe there is very good reason for keeping it there.  I think it should be noted that the various county councils in Connaught have taken action in support of university education that the county councils in no other province have taken.  Not only have they granted scholarships that the county councils grant in the ordinary way, <Col N="721" /> but they have struck a special rate for the University College.  That shows the interest that they are taking, and their anxiety to see that this college should get fair treatment from the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he believed that the college authorities did not care a great deal about the question of Irish. Proposals have been put up on their behalf and they have asked for a special training college.  I do not refer to the latest proposal but to one two years ago, when they asked that teachers doing their third year's course of training should do that course in connection with their college, but none of these things has been acceded to by the Government, and it is not fair now to throw all the blame on them.  I maintain that they have done everything that was reasonable and necessary to show that they were anxious and willing, if they were provided with the means, to do special work, especially in connection with the development and teaching of the Irish language.  If there is any suggestion the Government deem necessary to make they should make it.  I am quite sure that Galway College would be quite willing to meet the Government in that regard.  I think it is not fair, when proposals are put up and when they are turned down and no provision made whereby any progress could be reached, to throw all the blame for the alleged want of progress on the University College.</P>

      <P>I do not want to answer Deputy O'Connell at length. In regard to the question of the Agricultural Faculty the economics of farming in Connaught might be different, but the scientific facts that students would have to learn would be the same in Connaught as elsewhere.  In any case it was definitely decided, as a matter of policy, not to go in for duplication in this matter.  Consequently we are not providing for a full Agricultural Faculty in Dublin and a full Agricultural Faculty in Cork.  We are having a Faculty of General Agriculture in Dublin and a Faculty of Dairy Science in Cork.</P>

      <P>Cork is obviously the place for the Faculty of Dairy Science, and Dublin would also be a better place for a general Faculty of Agriculture than Galway.  So I do not think that any complaint can be made because the views put forward on behalf of Galway in that respect were not acceded to. In regard to the other matters, it has been arranged that there shall be further meetings between representatives of the Government and representatives of the College with a view to discussion, and, possibly, we would be able to get progress in that way.  I would remind the Deputy that the conference which sat recently did not refer to the Agricultural Faculty.</P>

      <P>Perhaps that is right. In regard to the other matters, I can only say that if a practicable scheme can be evolved, and a scheme which is good in itself, and which can be satisfactorily worked in the college, there is no &ldquo;down&rdquo; on University College, Galway, but the facts of the situation must be realised.  As it stands, it is not an institution of the importance of University College, Dublin, or University College, Cork.  Even if, as the Deputy himself said, it does labour under certain disadvantages, it has now an opportunity because of the national policy in regard to the Irish language. An opportunity is opening up for it. I think it is along that line that we must seek for special work for that college.  Search is proceeding.  The Deputy could hardly suggest that we had reached a point when this Estimate was being framed when anything could have been done.  The report of the conference is only dated 16th April. Even if we had been prepared to say that the report of the conference was a wholly satisfactory and illuminating document, as far as we are concerned, and on the strength of it we would do so and so, it would not be in these Estimates.  At the very most it would be a question of a Supplementary Estimate.</P>

He does not pretend to have the same control of the expenditure, and the items do not come within his check in the same way in respect of the universities and colleges as in respect of the Department Votes.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me, in moving this Vote, to speak at great length.  Many of the matters which I might, perhaps, have dealt with in moving the Vote were dealt with in very considerable detail last March when the Vote on Account was being moved. Except some fresh points are raised in regard to them, it is unnecessary to repeat them at the present moment.  The Deputies will notice that there is not any great change in the Vote this year. The reduction which appears is mainly due to the reduced amount required for temporary clerical assistance.  The <Col N="724" /> amount under that heading is £5,081 this year, as compared with £11,458 last year.  This reduction in the amount of clerical assistance required practically represents the decrease which has occurred in connection with compensation work.  Work, which was of very considerable volume, in connection with personal injuries compensation is practically at an end.  Work in connection with pre-Truce damage is very largely decreased.  The Wood-Renton Commission is wound up and, while a certain amount of clearance of ordinary awards has to be made, what remains, in the main, to be done is the distribution of moneys to which reinstatement conditions were attached.</P>
    <P>The work of the Department of Finance in the Saorstát was started under very considerable difficulties. There was nothing corresponding to the Department in existence here.  The work of financial control had been done in London.  Our staff had to be brought together from various branches of the Civil Service and set to the work of what I might call Treasury control. While this Department had to be improvised, many new Departments of State had been established and existing Departments of State had to adapt themselves to new conditions.  The work of the Department of Finance was, therefore, done under very great difficulties and under very great pressure. It would have been difficult enough to deal adequately with the ordinary work of financial supervision and control which would have arisen in connection with the Departments in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we had a great volume of work arising out of the disturbed condition of the country.  A great deal of difficult work arose from the military operations and from the building up and demobilisation of a large army.  There was also much work in dealing with the various classes of claims for damage that arose from military operations.  Much work was done under the same heading, in a way, in dealing with the claims under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act. The emergency work, which arose in the beginning, has very largely passed away.  After this year, there will probably <Col N="725" /> be very little to do other than the normal work of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>In other respects, we have made great changes.  There has been a very considerable output of legislation.  New services of various sorts have been undertaken.  Some of these services should have been undertaken a considerable time ago.  They have imposed a heavy strain and will continue to impose a great strain on the Department. The civil servants who came on to the staff of the Department of Finance were, perhaps, in the beginning, largely occupied in getting an adequate knowledge of the ramifications of Government work.  That knowledge, I think, has been very satisfactorily acquired. We are now in the position, I think, that we can claim that proposals involving expenditure are adequately considered and adequately criticised in advance and that the administration of services which have been undertaken is scrutinised and checked in an extremely satisfactory manner.  On the other hand, we have done as much as the most exacting could expect in the way of seeing that public money was not spent wastefully but that full value was got for it in every possible respect. I dealt, as I said, with that aspect of the matter at very considerable length last year, and I do not think it is necessary that I should detain the Dáil by any prolonged reiteration of what I explained then at the present stage.</P>

      <P>There are two questions which I should like to ask the Minister under sub-head A.  The first question is whether he has considered the possibility of making the salaries of the highest paid civil servants inclusive and of wiping out the bonus. On this Vote we may have a somewhat anomalous situation.  The Minister has a salary of £1,700 a year inclusive.  The Secretary of the Department has a salary of £1,500 a year and a bonus of £239 a year, at the present rate.  That is to say, the Secretary of the Department gets £39 a year more than the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Secretary has other advantages.  He is a permanent official and the Minister is not.  He has pensionable rights and the Minister has not.  I do not want to under-value the services of civil servants.  I do not say that you should skimp civil servants or pay them in a niggardly manner.  You must get an exceptionally experienced man as Secretary of the Department of Finance, but it is a little anomalous that the salary he receives is greater than that of the Minister, who has to bear final responsibility for all the actions of the Department.  I should like if the Minister would tell us if any investigations on those lines are being made.</P>
      <P>My second question is: What has happened the Government consulting engineer? He figured on this Estimate last year.  No provision is made for him this year.  Has the office been abolished owing to the reduction in compensation claims?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to refer to the Civil Service Representative Council, which has been described by the Minister as a conciliation scheme and which was promulgated under his authority.  It was promulgated by the Minister last year, but its constitution was so narrow and so limited that it had the effect of shutting out from this so-called conciliation scheme the most important staff-organisation in the Civil Service, the Post Office Workers' Union.  One of the conditions governing the scheme was that an organisation could not be represented by a full-time officer.  In other words, if an organisation was big enough to necessitate the services of a full-time officer&mdash;<Col N="727" /> a man who every day in the week deals with the cases that occupy the attention of the association&mdash;he was not to be allowed to go to this representative council and use his knowledge and ability for the benefit of the members of his organisation.  I should like to hear the Minister justify that attitude. I wonder if the Minister were an employer whether he would adopt that attitude towards full-time officials of outside trade unions?</P>
      <P>The Minister's scheme has another serious defect so far as the Post Office Department is concerned.  The grievances which would arise in the Post Office would be largely departmental grievances.  There was no provision in the scheme formulated by the Minister for the setting up of departmental councils, with the result that so far as the Post Office Department is concerned the staff can have no real benefit from the so-called representative council scheme.  These are two serious defects in the Minister's representative council scheme&mdash;the absence of departmental councils and the limitation of representation on the council so as to exclude full-time officials.  The Post Office Workers' Union, which caters for over 4,000 Post Office employees, should be given some opportunity of coming into this scheme and thereby taking its proper part in any scheme of conciliation which would apply to the Civil Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The present time may be suitable to call the Minister's attention to certain articles which have appeared in the public Press recently with regard to certain companies with which the Minister, in his position as Minister for Finance, is connected.  I think it would be advisable if the Minister would make a statement in explanation of the situation if it is as it is alleged to be.  I refer to an article which appeared in the issue of 29th May of the publication, &ldquo;Irish Truth,&rdquo; which the Minister may have seen.  It is headed &ldquo;The New Finance&mdash;Multiplicity of Functions.&rdquo; A great many of the statements which are made in this article have been the subject of conversation amongest certain members of the public from time to time.  Without a clear <Col N="728" /> and explicit statement by the Minister these rumours might give rise to ideas which would not be favourable to the Minister's Department.  The best way to deal with the matter is probably to raise it on this Vote, and the Minister can then make a statement to the Dáil and, through the Dáil, to the public.</P>
      <P>I do not say that anything exists in connection with this matter that may not be satisfactorily explained.  But I think the matter is of sufficient public importance to warrant its being raised here.  We would, perhaps, be lacking in our duty if we did not call the attention of the Minister to the article in question.  The writer of the article seems to have gone to a good deal of trouble to substantiate his statements, so that they are probably statements of fact which cannot be denied.  Possibly the simplest way for the Dáil to deal with the matter would be for me to read the article in question, but as it is rather a long one I do not propose to do so.  This article refers to the multiplicity of functions of the directors of certain companies with which the Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Finance, is associated.  I refer to the Land Bank and the Trust Company of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Minister himself is a director of the Land Bank. For that reason alone I think I am entitled to raise the matter here.  Not only is he a director, but also the Minister's assistant secretary, Mr. McElligott, is a director of the Land Bank.  The object of the article is to point out that certain gentlemen, while directors of certain financial institutions, are at the same time advancing money to private companies of which they are also directors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>He is responsible in view of the fact that the Government has advanced money to these companies, and that the money advanced to these companies as part of their finances is being used for the <Col N="729" /> purpose of making loans to these private companies to which I have referred. I say that the Minister is responsible to a certain extent in that regard, and I say that this is the proper Vote on which to bring the matter up. If it cannot be brought up on this Vote it cannot be brought up at all.  We have the duplication and triplication of functions in regard to several of these institutions.  Take the case of the National Land Bank, amongst whose directors is Senator J.G. Douglas and Mr. L. Smith-Gordon.  Mr. Smith-Gordon was formerly managing director of the National Land Bank.  He is now managing director of the Industrial Trust Company.  I presume he has retained his position on the directorate of the National Land Bank.  He is also a member of the Advisory Committee which has been set up to advise the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to the functions of Section 2 of the Trade Loans Act, 1924, and in that position Mr. Smith-Gordon will naturally be called upon to advise the Minister in regard to applications which are made for guarantees for loans, and which loans, if guaranteed, will afterwards be advanced, as far as I know, either by the National Land Bank or by the Industrial Trust Company.</P>
      <P>Some of the companies which are applying for loans, or which have got loans, are companies with which Mr. Smith-Gordon is connected in his individual capacity. For instance, Mr. Smith-Gordon is a director of the Kilteragh Development Syndicate.  I believe that the clearest way for me to put this matter is to read portion of the statement in this paper:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. L. Smith-Gordon is, in addition, engaged as director in the business of several companies.  Thus, he is a director of the Kilteragh Development Syndicate, with a capital of £20,000, incorporated 7th January, 1924, which borrowed £10,000 from the Industrial Trust Company; a director of the Irish Glass Bottle Company, Ltd., and, together with Mr. Timothy Caffrey (himself a director of the National Land Bank), <Col N="730" /> is joint trustee for debenture holders in respect of £50,000 charged upon that undertaking.  He is also a director of MacLysaght and Douglas; he is, or was until recently, a director of the Peugeot cars (Ireland), Ltd., and of the Irish and Foreign Trading Corporation, Ltd.</P>
    <P>Senator J.G. Douglas, who until recently was Deputy Chairman of the Senate, is Chairman of the National Land Bank and Deputy Chairman of the Industrial Trust Company, on whose board apparently he represents the Government as its nominee. He is a Director of John Douglas and Sons, Ltd., which was incorporated in May, 1925, with an issued capital of £10,497, and which issued debentures to the amount of £10,000 to the National Land Bank in the same year.  He is a Director of MacLysaght and Douglas, formed in May, 1922, which had a paid-up capital of £1,301, held as to 650 shares by himself, as to 650 shares by Mr. MacLysaght, and as to one share by Mr. Smith-Gordon.  He is a Director of the Irish and Foreign Trading Corporation, Ltd., whose return, dated 3rd July, 1923, of allotments of shares shows that 8,702 preference shares of £1 each had been issued, viz.: 3,602 to Lord ffrench, 4,900 to the National Land Bank, 100 to Major Browne, and 100 to Mr. Smith-Gordon, while 649 fully paid shares each were alloted to Mr. MacLysaght and Senator Douglas in exchange for the same number of fully paid shares in MacLysaght and Douglas, Ltd.  In the latter company, therefore, the documents of record show that towards the close of 1923 the three Directors, viz.: Senator Douglas and Messrs. MacLysaght and Smith-Gordon, were possessed of one share each, and the Irish and Foreign Trading Corporation of 1,298&mdash;and that these 1,298 were re-transferred in December, 1925, to their original owners.</P>
    <P>Of the exact relationship of this company of MacLysaght and Douglas, Ltd., with the Peugeot Cars (Ireland), Ltd., we are not fully informed, but the latter seems to have passed in some way into the ownership <Col N="731" /> or under the control of the former.  The title of the establishment at 40 Dawson Street, where Peugeot and Hupmobile cars are sold is now &ldquo;MacLysaght and Douglas, Ltd.  (Peugeot Cars (Ireland), Ltd.).&rdquo;  Whatever the nature of the transaction has been, any dealing between MacLysaght and Douglas, Ltd., with Senator Douglas and Mr. Smith-Gordon on the Board, and the Peugeot Cars (Ireland), Ltd., with Mr. Smith-Gordon on the Board, must illustrate the difficulties on which we are insisting.  The records of the Peugeot concern will show why.  It was incorporated on the 8th August, 1923, with a fully paid-up capital of £1,000&mdash;of which Mr. Pullar Phibbs owned 998 and Mr. Smith-Gordon and another one apiece.  Debentures were issued to the National Land Bank on the 17th September of the same year by way of a floating charge, and the amount due by the Company up to 30th December, 1924, was stated to be £24,363.  Mr. Pullar Phibbs and Mr. Smith-Gordon were the two Directors. On the 15th November, 1923, Mr. Pullar Phibbs transferred 997 of his shares to Messrs. Smith-Gordon and Caffrey as, presumably, trustees for the Bank.  At the end of 1925 the amount due by the Company was stated at £21,011 18s. 4d. The Bank had, apparently, been carrying on the business as mortgagee in possession, or owner, or both.  Thus, with the exception of £3 of share capital, everything belonged to the Bank, which had also the prior rights of creditor and debenture holder.</P>
    <P>That is the gist of the article.  My reason for raising the matter at all is this, that I think it is well that it should be cleared up.  I do not say nor do I believe that there is anything dishonest in regard to the duplication of functions in the case of some of these directors, but I do say that it is not in the interests of the State that such a state of affairs should exist or should continue to exist.  It will, I believe, give rise to rumours, and these rumours, if not contradicted, will give <Col N="732" /> rise to statements which would imply that these companies which had been subvented by the Government are not being run in the interests of the public but rather in the interests of private individuals.  That, of course, was not the intention of the Dáil in making these subventions.</P>
    <P>The National Land Bank was subvented to the extent of £300,000 from the National Exchequer in 1925, and the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland got a grant, or is entitled to have its shares purchased, to the extent of £50,000 by the Government; the Government are entitled to appoint directors and have apparently appointed them to both these companies.  Apparently Mr. Smith-Gordon and Senator Douglas are the nominees of the Government on the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland, and the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland has been making advances to companies of which both of these gentlemen are directors.  One of these gentlemen, in addition to being the managing director of the Industrial Trust Company and a director in most of these other companies, and associated in his position as director with Senator Douglas and other directors, is also a member of the Advisory Committee appointed to advise the Government in regard to guarantees which they may make under the Trade Loans Act to gentlemen or companies who may apply for such guarantees and who, if they secure them, will go to the Industrial Trust Company or to the National Land Bank for the money.</P>
    <P>I maintain that that is not a desirable state of affairs.  I maintain that some steps ought to be taken, either to get these gentlemen to cease their functions as directors of these companies or else that they should be called upon to sever their connection with those companies which are in receipt of Government subventions and one of which&mdash; the National Land Bank&mdash;is understood to be practically a Government institution. I will not go further into the matter; I think I have outlined the position.  I do not want to elaborate it any more than is necessary but, as I said before, I and certain members of my Party, felt that this was a matter with regard to which we would not be <Col N="733" /> doing our duty to the public if we did not give the Minister an opportunity of making clear that there is nothing in it which is not right.  If there is nothing in those statements that is right and justifiable and if the Minister can show that, he will have done good work, and I am sure that the Dáil will be satisfied with his explanation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper referred to the question of bonus on the salaries of retired civil servants.  I suppose some of the higher paid civil servants were entitled to the bonus they had when we came into control, and I do not think that there can be any question of interfering with the bonus of any civil servant's salary. Deputy Wilson, I think, showed in reality that there is no civil servant receiving a higher salary than a Minister because of the exemption of £360 on a Minister's salary from income tax.  In any case I think the remedy was not indicated by Deputy Cooper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Cooper was really driving at that. Deputy Norton spoke about the Civil Service Representative Council, and he criticised it in certain respects.  We do not allow whole-time representatives who are not civil servants to attend on behalf of any union because we believe that the case of the private employer meeting his own employees is not at all parallel to the case of civil servants meeting another body of civil servants. That was our objection to Whitleyism in the Civil Service.  We believe that Whitleyism has its uses in industry and might, perhaps, serve very important ends in industry, but we believe that it is not suitable to the Civil Service. While the British Government, for their own reasons, thought fit to introduce it, we did not think it wise&mdash;in order to try and give a lead to employers and to industries&mdash;to continue it.  The civil servant of a certain grade who goes, as it were, to represent the State, as against the staff, is not at all in the position of a private employer who is fighting for his own profits.  It is not right to put the civil servant, who is there, as I say, representing the State, <Col N="734" /> up against the sort of opposition against which the private employer, fighting for his own profits and his own interests, may well be expected to contend.</P>
      <P>There are civil servants only on one side and we think that there should be civil servants only on the other side. That is really the reason we imposed the particular restriction to which Deputy Norton first referred.  In the matter of departmental councils, the view we got here was that these councils, at any rate on a Whitley basis, involved a great waste of time, involved even the searching out of grievances, and the results were not commensurate with the loss of time.  They were, in fact, strictly speaking, unworkable, because again you had not employers and employees represented.  You simply had two groups of civil servants and you could not put the representatives of various departments in a position of being able to agree and decide.  A private employer may agree to give away what he likes, but you could not put it in the power of a group of higher civil servants to give away something contended for by another group of civil servants.  The whole position seemed to be unworkable.  It was generally felt, and generally agreed, that the old pre-Whitley conditions in the Civil Service ought not be got back to.  The extreme difficulty of access to the head of the department ought not to be restored, and there ought to be arrangements in all offices whereby representatives of an association, as well as individual officers, who may be aggrieved and who are appealing, should have easy and immediate access to the head of a department so that the matter could be discussed face to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether it is a fact that in a particular department there is not access and that the representatives of the staff cannot, when they have something to put up, meet the head of the department along with whatever higher officials he likes to bring with him to discuss the matter. Remember that although Whitley councils were supposed to decide questions at issue, that was largely a pretence. Higher civil servants representing <Col N="735" /> the State had definitely to be instructed to agree to nothing.  They could not be allowed to agree.  There was not the drive that a private employer feels to save his profits.  You had a pretence that things were being done by agreement, but there was something like a chronic state of stalemate. Without any formal departmental council being in existence, there is personal access, and I think you get all that can be got out of Whitleyism without a great many of the disadvantages which it would have as applied to the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>Might I call attention to what seems to be an anomaly in the Minister's speech?  He talks about the representatives of the staff having the right of access to the head of a department.  That presumably means that the staff can send anybody they wish to the head of the department. Though they can, as they do, send whole-time officers, the Minister says that under no circumstances must that whole-time officer be allowed to go to the Civil Service Council.  If he can see the Minister personally, why cannot he sit as the staff representative on the Council?  I think the Minister's action is inconsistent.  There are not many associations with full-time officers and he ought to remove this restriction which has the effect of keeping out the largest organisation in the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Norton takes a diametrically opposite view to mine and it might be difficult to convince him that the view I was taking was right.  It is not a question of a full-time officer.  You might have any outside officer employed and, if you got away from the position that it is a council of civil servants, there is no reason why a Civil Service association should not employ, say, a fighting attorney as their representative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that I did, but there is really no distinction. Deputy Heffernan referred to an article in &ldquo;Irish Truth.&rdquo;  I saw that article a few days ago for the first time, but <Col N="736" /> I cannot say that I studied it with great care, because it seemed to be an article which was libellous in intention. I am confirmed in that view when I see Deputy Heffernan drawing certain wrong inferences from it.  I heard him say that the Kilteragh Development Company had borrowed from the Industrial Trust Company presumably on a Government guarantee.  Of course there was no question of a Government guarantee, but I have no doubt that this article was written, whomever it was written by, for a certain purpose. I do not know whether I should go into it.  I can hardly go over that article in great detail, but I will take certain points out of it.  I do not know whether some of the statements are facts or not, but others I know are facts.  The Deputy referred to the fact that Mr. Smith-Gordon was a director of the Kilteragh Development Syndicate.  As I understand the position, Mr. Smith-Gordon has no interest in that syndicate which really is, I understand, Sir Horace Plunkett.  Mr. Smith-Gordon has been associated for many years with Sir Horace Plunkett, and when Sir Horace Plunkett, instead of rebuilding his house, which was destroyed by Irregulars, decided to erect substitute buildings and to develop the estate&mdash;his house, for instance, has been turned into a series of flats, and other buildings have been erected on the estate&mdash;certain people were appointed as directors, but they have no interest except a nominal interest in it.  As a mere matter of business, when opening up the place, they approached the Industrial Trust Company, most of the capital of which is put up by private people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government only put up one-third, or less, of the capital because they wished private people to invest money in such institutions.  We saw that there was a need in our system for institutions of that sort, and we put up £50,000 to induce other people to put money in it.  The Government has no control whatever over that company, and it is not responsible in any way. The company lent money to a certain institution as a business proposition. Anybody knows that it is the ordinary arrangement that where directors of <Col N="737" /> either a banking or similar institution are not whole-time officers they are often directors of other businesses. They are generally people engaged in numerous commercial enterprises, but there is no arrangement that the other institutions with which they are connected shall never do business with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Smith-Gordon is not one of them.  Mr. Smith-Gordon, I think, is a director of the Irish Glass Bottle Co., Ltd.  Again, he is appointed because that is an institution that was reconstructed on getting a loan, and he is there, as it were, for the purpose of giving additional security to the Industrial Trust Co., which advanced the money.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to discuss these things, one or two of which I know something about, from the point of view of the National Land Bank.  Some of them arose at a time when I was connected with the National Land Bank.  Ordinary transactions between a bank and its customers are confidential, but there are some of them to which I think I can refer without any breach of trust.  There is a reference here to a loan by the National Land Bank to Messrs. John Douglas and Sons, Ltd.  I believe I have authority to say what I happen to know.  I was appointed by the late General Collins, when the National Land Bank was started, as one of the directors of that bank, and I acted as a director until I became Minister for Finance.  Since I became Minister for Finance I have not done anything in the way of touching the business of the bank.  I have not attended meetings of boards of directors. I have received no information as to the business done at the Boards&mdash; that is, no information as to private cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> At quite an early stage of the work of the National Land Bank the Belfast boycott was instituted.  Mr. Douglas's firm at that time banked with the Ulster Bank.  The late Mr. Childers and myself asked that, when they had, as we believed they would have, to transfer from the Ulster Bank, they should transfer their account to the National Land Bank.  We promised that we would give them, in the National Land Bank, whatever accommodation they had from the Ulster Bank. As many firms did at that time, they transferred their account, and they were given accommodation.  Afterwards, when the Belfast boycott came to an end, I know that many firms reverted to the bank with which they had been doing business before the boycott. Mr. Douglas's firm did not revert, but Mr. Douglas himself had nothing whatever to do with the National Land Bank at that time.  At a later stage, when Mr. James MacNeill went to London as High Commissioner, and the chairmanship of the bank became vacant, Mr. Douglas was asked to join the Board.  The arrangement which his firm had with the National Land Bank remained, although he had joined the Board.  Then at a certain stage it was decided by Mr. Douglas, for his own reasons, to turn his firm into a limited liability company&mdash;into a private company. When that was done, certain arrangements were necessary in regard to the accommodation which the firm had from the bank, and those necessary registering steps were taken.</P>
    <P>There is an attempt in this article, which I say is simply a particular form of libel to which small and moribund papers are very prone to fall, to cast reflections upon the transaction.</P>

      <P>I never read it when I get abuse.  As I was saying, there is an attempt in this article to suggest that Senator Douglas was in a happy position by reason of his connection with the Land Bank in order to get an accommodation from the bank for his private firm.  As a matter of fact, that is entirely a false suggestion.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of Peugeot cars, I think, again, it is very difficult for me to talk, but I might say that originally a certain loan was made and afterwards, as a means of securing repayment, a member of the Land Bank&mdash;Mr. Smith-Gordon&mdash;was asked to associate himself with the Peugeot Company.  In, I think, practically all these cases where there are directorates a person was asked to go on the board of the firm which had got accommodation for the better security of the loan or for the better securing of its repayment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Industrial Trust Company was formed, Mr. Smith-Gordon and Mr. Telford tendered their resignations from the Advisory Committee set up under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  It is an extremely difficult thing to get people to act on that committee. As a matter of fact, we have been trying for some months past to get people and cannot.  The type of business man you want to act on such a committee as a rule says he has not time or that he is not going to act on the committee and be libelled and slandered.  It is almost impossible&mdash;at least extremely difficult&mdash;to get business men to act on a committee such as the Trade Loans Advisory Committee.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, because there were certain half-investigated cases pending, asked Mr. Smith-Gordon and Mr. Telford to remain on as members for some little time further and deal with other cases.  They probably would not have remained any length of time only because of the difficulty of getting people to act&mdash; people of the right knowledge and understanding and people who are willing to give the time and take the risk of the particular sort of slanderous <Col N="740" /> criticism which one must certainly expect, at any rate in this country, and perhaps in other countries, but I think more particularly here where we are new to things and where we are emerging from a particular state.</P>
    <P>It is suggested, too, as I gathered when reading this article, that there was some great anxiety on the part of the Government to have business sent to the National Land Bank.  As a matter of fact, so far as the loans guaranteed under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act are concerned, the position was that the ordinary joint stock banks &mdash;we found out this after certain proposals had been passed&mdash;were not prepared to make the advances.  Where it was recommended by the Committee that a loan could be given to be repaid in ten or fifteen years we found, as a rule, that the ordinary joint stock banks refused to give the loan for any longer period than five years.  That period would have meant that an impossible burden would be cast on the undertakings getting the loans.  In consequence of that, to avoid a complete deadlock, and to prevent the Act being completely inoperative, I came to the Dáil and asked for an advance of £300,000 to enable certain of the loans actually to be made through the Land Bank.  It is because other banks would not take up the loans that certain of them had to be made by the Land Bank.</P>
    <P>I have recognised for a very considerable time that the position of the Land Bank is anomalous.  I have recognised that it is a State-owned bank which is not a State bank.  It was formed to do a certain work at a time of stress; it was formed to prevent the national struggle being changed into a land war during 1919-1920.  Since then it has simply been carrying on as a small bank on very much the same lines as other banks, with this difference, that as the Minister for Finance was the holder of the shares the directors were nominated by the Minister for Finance instead of being elected by a meeting of shareholders.</P>
    <P>When it was determined to set up a Banking Commission it was also determined that no change should be made in regard to the National Land Bank <Col N="741" /> until the Banking Commission had reported. One of the things which the Banking Commission has been specifically asked to report upon is whether the National Land Bank should be continued as a State-owned bank, and, if continued, what functions should be assigned to it.  I think it was presumed that there could be no purpose in continuing it as quite a small bank, doing practically the same business as the other banks and committed with them in a small way.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the difficulty of getting people to act as members of the Advisory Committee under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  It is equally difficult to get people of the stamp that one would like to have acting on a body like the Land Bank.  It is all because the shares are owned by the State and the money is State money.  The most ordinary transaction will be made the subject of libellous and slanderous rumours.  Transactions that nobody would even look at twice if they were done by an ordinary joint stock bank will be passed around from mouth to mouth and twisted and exaggerated in every possible way.</P>
    <P>For a very long time Senator Douglas has been anxious to leave the National Land Bank, but I could not see any possibility of replacing him easily and I had to ask him to remain on and to carry on the work until the time would arrive when some definite decision could be come to in regard to the future of the bank.  If we are to carry on a bank like the Land Bank I do not see any possibility of doing it except by appointing somebody at a salary of, say, £2,500 a year, giving him something approaching judicial tenure and forbidding him to carry on any other functions.  I think in no other way could we possibly carry on a State-owned bank, and, even with that, I believe difficulties and troubles would be encountered that do not exist in respect to ordinary banks.</P>
    <P>The shares of the National Land Bank, by the Dáil Loans and Funds Act, were definitely transferred to the Minister for Finance out of the name of the sort of bogus society which was created at the beginning for the purpose of holding the shares.  When the <Col N="742" /> bank was started it was feared that the British Government might come down on it in some way and the society was started.  The story was prepared that it had collected funds in America as it was feared that the British Government might make an investigation. Nominally that society held the shares, and held them until the Dáil Loans and Funds Act was passed, when they were transferred to the name of the Minister for Finance.  Since that time, because they were the direct property of the State, Mr. McElligott has sat on the Board of the Bank with a sort of watching brief.  The bank was simply carrying on and marking time, and Mr. McElligott sat there with a watching brief.  He has no interest in the bank whatsoever and no interest in getting business for it.  He had no interest in it at all except to see that State property was not frittered away. As I say, you find in this moribund publication an article which, if not libellous because of false statements, is libellous because of presentation and libellous in intent.</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly whom the writer is driving at, but he must be driving at somebody.  There is nothing to conceal about the matter.  It is all open and above board.  I have explained Mr. McElligott's position in regard to the Industrial Trust Company. There is no connection between the Industrial Trust Company and the National Land Bank except that I believe the Industrial Trust Company keeps its accounts with the National Land Bank. Beyond that there is no connection between them.  One is privately owned, but I believe it has made arrangements in cases where it makes advances, that a representative should sit on the Board of the Company getting an advance.  In certain, other cases, at the request of the Government, that has been done by the National Land Bank.  In Ailesbury's case, where an advance was made through the National Land Bank, a representative of the Bank was appointed to sit on the Board of Ailesbury Bros. at the request of the Minister for Industry and Commerce so that he might see that undertakings given were actually carried out, and to ensure that money owned by the State did not go <Col N="743" /> wrong in any way.  The position, as I have pointed out, is an interim one.  For considerably more than a year&mdash;since it was decided first to set up a Banking Commission, and, I think, for some time before that&mdash;the position in regard to the National Land Bank has been that we carried on until we could have advice from expert people as to what should be done in regard to it, whether it should be discontinued, whether it should be disposed of, whether it should be developed, whether it should be given entirely new work or whether it should continue its present work on a much larger scale.  I do not think I need say any more in regard to it.  At the present time I certainly would not call on any of the people mentioned to cease their functions either as directors of any of the companies of which they are directors or as directors of the National Land Bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the raising of this matter has served a useful purpose.  It has given the Minister an opportunity to clear up the rumours which were going around, and would go around, because of this article.  I want to say that personally I have no knowledge of the matter except what I got from the article in the paper.  Any deductions that I arrived at were made from reading that article.  I think the Minister may have been a little bit unfair to the writer of the article because it seems to me quite possible that he did not write the article with a libellous or slanderous intent.  The facts and the figures which he has quoted are taken from the usual books of reference.  It does not necessarily follow that the article was written with a libellous or slanderous intent.  I think the Minister's statement that these gentlemen who are duplicating their positions as directors of the National Land Bank and of the Industrial Trust Company are doing that for the purpose of protecting the position of these institutions, explains their position and clears up the whole situation from my point of view. The statement of the Minister that the present position is an interim one, and that it may change, and probably will change, when the findings of the Banking Commission are published, also <Col N="744" /> makes me realise that it is not necessary at this stage to suggest that the gentlemen who are acting in certain positions should cease to hold those positions now.</P>

I desire to know from the Minister for Finance whether he has considered the question that I then referred to, namely, the superannuation allowances to inspectors of national schools.  The fact is, as I understand it, that the service they have put in as national school teachers does not count in any way for pension.  Many of them will have attained the age of 65 long before they would have qualified for probably more than half of the ordinary pension rate. I know the Minister will say that it will cost money, but that plea should not prevent what is right and fair being paid in pensions.</P>

I would like to take this opportunity of complimenting the Minister, not on what he has done, but on the resistance that he put up against the claims made from all directions on the National Exchequer.  As the watchdog of the national finances he has done, I think, a very good service.  He has been receiving a considerable amount of abuse for his parsimony and his efforts in resisting ambitious claims from various directions.

      <P>This Vote is for a much more substantial amount than the Vote for the Department of Finance.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>They are bracing themselves for that.  The Department administers the Old Age Pensions Act. I might say that a very substantial amount of the Department's expenses in travelling&mdash;about £10,000&mdash;is due to the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act.  The Department has the duty of restricting or preventing the importation of all sorts of things from obscene literature to the plumage of <Col N="746" /> certain birds and shaving brushes manufactured in Japan, as well as all sorts of various undesirable articles. They also do the work of enforcing the Merchandise (Marks) Act.  Where goods are marked, say, in the name of a firm in the Saorstát and are made outside, they have to bear definitely the announcement that they are made elsewhere. The quarantine and health regulations are enforced by the Revenue authorities, and certain duties in connection with alien immigration. They also have to hold inquiries and deal with wreckage, with the registration of ships and fishing boats and the engagement and discharge of seamen. They collect &ldquo;light&rdquo; dues, and, in certain cases, harbour dues.  In the last few years a great increase of work was cast on the Revenue staff by various Customs duties as a result of tariffs which were imposed.</P>
      <P>The Customs and Excise staff has had to be very substantially increased. We were handicapped to some extent in the discharge of Customs duties last year and the year before by the fact that the staff was barely sufficient or was insufficient in numbers, and was moreover a raw staff.  There was practically no Customs service here before the setting up of the Saorstát, and the Customs staff which we got over was very small.  The new men who were added naturally were not able to discharge the duties as fully or as efficiently as more experienced officers would be, and perhaps a certain number of the complaints we hear of were due to that lack of experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We made many investigations from time to time in regard to complaints, and I found on the whole the fact that the public and the importers had not accommodated themselves to the existence of the Customs barrier was more responsible for the delays and difficulties than any failing or rawness on the part of the Customs staff.  We have had these new people working for a fair time, and I think there is very little cause of complaint at present.  I certainly have had no complaint of any consequence, and no substantial number of complaints have reached me for a very long time.  Even with the staff at the highest pitch of efficiency, occasionally <Col N="747" /> there will be something to rouse somebody to utter a complaint.</P>
    <P>The Income Tax staff also has been labouring under great difficulties.  We had a tremendous mass of arrears of income tax, and a great amount of confusion arising from delay in collection, and from the destruction of documents in many cases.  There was a very heavy task on the Revenue staff to collect these arrears.  The main mass of the arrears has now been collected, and I think at the end of the present financial year a very small amount of the old arrears will be outstanding.  The new arrangement in regard to double income tax will, in the first instance, occasion some increase in the work of the Revenue Department, and will occasion some delays.  The mere change over will cause certain problems, and will create certain initial difficulties, but we are satisfied, as a result of the new arrangement, that in a year or so some substantial ease to the Revenue staff will be brought about.</P>
    <P>We will then be in the position to set up the nucleus of a proper investigation staff.  At present we have the bare minimum of tax inspectors necessary for the work.  In fact, we have yet four tax inspectors on loan from the British service.  We are in the position that but for those four inspectors there might have to be amalgamation of districts or something that would make the due collection of tax possible.  We hope in another year to have a number of young men qualified for the position of inspector of taxes.  With the decrease of work that will result when the new double income tax arrangement materialises we will be able to appoint a certain number of inspectors to the work of investigation.  Perhaps I cannot indicate exactly the lines we will take, but they will at any rate deal with cases which at present have to be passed over without the sort of scrutiny we would like.  Our belief is that if there were sufficient tax inspectors, and if there was anybody who could be put on the work of investigation, we would collect the sum of a quarter of a million or perhaps £35,000 more than we are collecting without any increase in rates.</P>

      <P>No, but I hope it will be a more distinguished honour in the future than it has been in the past.  I think also that the position in regard to Customs is that whatever tariffs may be imposed in the future are not likely to necessitate an increase in the Customs staff, such as previous tariffs did. We have now brought our staff up to very considerable numbers, and in respect of some of the tariffed articles the value of imports will fall off&mdash;we hope they will fall off very substantially.  I do not anticipate that any tariff changes we have to make will necessitate an increase in the Customs staff.  Some small increase might be required if tariffs were imposed on articles of which a substantial volume was imported, but no increase compared with the increase when the first tariff was imposed will be necessary.</P>

      <P>I travel almost weekly through districts in which tariffs are enforced, and while I must confess that our efforts in the first instance were very crude, I must pay this compliment to the Commissioners: that their men now are at least equal to the men on the other side.  Within a period of twelve months they have brought up their services to the highest pitch of excellence.  There is, however, something that I would like to say to the Commissioners through the Minister. It is a very serious subject which affects my constituency and probably many others.  It is on the question of income tax.  From 1919 on, when neither law nor order existed in this country and when certain formulas were adopted, no income tax was charged or could possibly be charged. I frankly think that the Commissioners are right in pressing that the incidence of income tax should be spread more largely than it was previously.  I think <Col N="749" /> they are right, but I consider that this must not be done in a stringent way. Very few rural traders paid income tax in any shape or form under the old régime.  I always thought that was an unfair incidence of the taxation.  Our Commissioners are taking that up in a strenuous way, and while I do not complain of the equity of their proceeding, I ask the Commissioners to exercise some discretion in pressing these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;To reduce sub-head C by £2,000.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a comparatively small amendment and it will not be necessary for me to occupy the time of the Dáil for any length of time in speaking to it. It is to reduce the allowance for removal expenses from £3,000 to £1,000. I do so for two reasons.  One is that I want to urge the Minister to establish a definite scale applicable throughout the whole Civil Service for removal expenses, just as is done in the case of subsistence allowance.  In this case the amount for removal expenses to the Revenue Commissioners seems to be out of all proportion to that spent by the Gárda.  I am glad the Minister for Justice is here to be complimented. There are upwards of 7,000 men in the Gárda.  Their removal expenses amount to £3,500 a year, or 10/- a head. There are slightly over 2,100 Revenue officials on the Vote and their removal expenses have been estimated at £3,000 or, roughly speaking, £1 8s. per head.  I do not know if there is any particular reason why the transfers of Revenue officials should be more frequent than the transfers of the Gárda. I do not think it is an unfair comparison to make.  If it is possible to remove the Gárda for that average amount it ought to be possible to do it for the same figure both in the Revenue Department and throughout the Civil Service generally.  Of course, there are some branches of the Civil Service where there are no removal expenses, that I could discover.  I do not think that there are removal expenses granted to officers of the Prisons Board and there do not seem to be any removal expenses in the case of the Army.  Where removal expenses are <Col N="750" /> allowed they ought to be on a more definite scale and they ought not to be more generous in one department than in another.</P>
    <P>My second point is that I want the Minister to diminish the number of these removals as much as possible, because at present they are not conducive to the smooth working or efficiency of the service.  I am one of those people who are hopelessly unable to deal with their own income tax matters.  I have to employ an agent.  I am told&mdash;I have no reason to doubt the fact&mdash;that the whole settlement of my claim is being delayed by the fact that there have been two or three transfers of officers whose duty it was to deal with the case.  Just as one officer is beginning to be conversant with it he is transferred somewhere else and the new officer has to take it up de novo.  It is a difficult claim, and when there are easier claims to be done he may be inclined to postpone it.  These removals are an inconvenience not only to the public but to the Minister.  Therefore, I urge this amendment on the ground that it will check these removals which do not appear to be necessary, and it will compel the Minister to keep his officials in the same place where they are accustomed to the work.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Cooper has chosen the proper sub-head to deal with this question.  We all recognise <Col N="751" /> that income tax is an iniquitous tax. Its removal would be very satisfactory. There has been a considerable improvement in detail in the work of the Income Tax Commissioners and they are straightening out the problems that confronted them.  I appreciate what the Minister said when he indicated that he was marching towards such a standard of organisation as would enable him to collect £250,000.  I presume that will be from people who are to be brought into the net, and that some relief will be forthcoming to the people already in the net.  I asked the Minister for assistance as to getting within the charmed circle but he did not respond.  Thinking of the Minister's betting tax, I thought I might ask him to give me a tip.  It will be a relief to the community, as a whole, when matters reach such a stage that we will be able to find out who is paying income tax and who is not.</P>

      <P>I thought that I would save the House the trouble of listening to me on other occasions if I were allowed to make the few remarks I have to make on this sub-head, which is fairly comprehensive.  As to Deputy Cooper's amendment, I originally interpreted it as referring to the removal of income tax altogether.  I find I was wrong.  It only refers to the removal of members of the staff from place to place.  I fear I will have to oppose Deputy Cooper's amendment on that account.  When we find an income tax collector or inspector unpopular, I think we would all like to have him removed and, in addition, we would be glad to pay his expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be possible to provide for removals <Col N="752" /> at a lesser cost than is shown here.  I do not know, at the moment, how removals are effected in the Gárda Síochána or what distance the members have to go.  In regard to Revenue officials, fairly regular and frequent changes are necessary.  We do not want to make changes any more frequently than is absolutely necessary. I do not know how the difficulty Deputy Cooper referred to arose.  We are extremely short of staff.  We have had officials on loan from Great Britain and, from time to time, they have gone back.  We have not been anxious to put a British official out in a district and, as we were carrying on under difficulties, various changes may have taken place.  In general, it is desirable to remove an income tax inspector once in three years.  Deputies will realise that an income tax inspector cannot do his work efficiently if he has too many friends or too many enemies in a district.  He has a very invidious sort of task and a very difficult task to discharge.  Except for the exceptional man, if an inspector is a long time in a district, it becomes impossible for him to do his duty with full efficiency.  Apart from any question of promotion, changes are necessary.  In an income tax district it is by results that you know the efficiency of an inspector. If the yield of tax in a particular district falls, you try another man at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Mere inspections will not sufficiently test the efficiency of a man.  From every point of view, it is necessary to change men round.  That argument applies with greatest force to inspectors of taxes, but it applies to other Revenue officials to a certain degree.  The task of law-enforcing is difficult, and personal problems arise. A man who, because of over-strictness, becomes very unpopular, may cease to be efficient in his district because of the difficulties that will be put up against him.  You see examples of that in the case of preventive officers in the Customs.  It is necessary, then, to change by way of promotion.  Districts are graded, and if a man is due for <Col N="753" /> promotion he goes up to a district of higher grade.  It may be necessary also to change a man for the purpose of giving him experience&mdash;that is, by way of training.  If a man is in a district where there is one type of work you must, after an interval, remove him to another district, where he will be dealing with another type of work. For example, if an Excise officer were stationed in a district where there was no distillery, he would be removed, after an interval, to a district in which there was a distillery in order that he might gain experience.</P>
      <P>The expenses of removing a single man are not considerable, but in the case of a married man they are considerable. It is not entirely a question of scale.  You can fix limits and all that sort of thing, but, in the case of a married man, you must transport a reasonable amount of furniture, if he is the owner of it, and you must transport himself and his family.  You will find in a case like that that £50 or £60 will not be an excessive sum.  If you have regard to the number of officers in the service, if you remember that we are just getting the service established, that the officers are getting into their stride and that a number of removals are due, I do not think you can contend that the sum set down here is excessive.  As a matter of fact, we are anxious to keep the amount down. The opinion of the Revenue Commissioners is that if they made all the removals that it would be desirable to make, the sum set down here would not be sufficient.  It is only by cutting down and postponing removals that this sum covers the item.  Another reason for postponing removals is the housing difficulty.  Certain removals would be very desirable, in the opinion of the Commissioners, but they find it necessary to postpone them owing to the difficulty of finding house accommodation for officers transferred.</P>

      <P>I must express my obligations to Deputy O'Doherty.  I was not surprised or shocked when he said he was going to vote against this amendment.  I have been in the Dáil for three years.  I do not know how many amendments I moved in that <Col N="754" /> time, but I do not think I ever remember Deputy O'Doherty to have supported one of them.  For the kindly offer of his services, I desire to thank him.  I would thank him more wholeheartedly if he had offered them gratuitously, but as he has only offered me 50 per cent.  I shall have to state how I stand.  My agent, instead of being an old man, is only half Deputy O'Doherty's age.  He happens to be a qualified chartered accountant, and I think I should prefer a qualified expert to an unqualified amateur, however great the good-will of the latter may be.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation.  I still think that the maintenance of an exact rule as to the removal of income tax inspectors every three years may cause a good deal of inconvenience, where these inspectors have uncompleted cases on hands.  It is not as if we were dealing with a time when everything is normal, as from year to year.  We are dealing with cases in which there are considerable arrears.  Owing to the burning of income tax offices and the disappearance of records, whole cases have to be reconstituted. If a case comes, in the course of operations, before three different officers, it is bound to be troublesome and expensive to the claimant. Perhaps I expressed myself badly in the remarks I made.  The point I referred to just now is the point I wished to make.  The Minister has given very substantial reasons for the course adopted and I will deprive Deputy O'Doherty of the pleasure of voting against my amendment by asking the leave of the Committee to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>As regards the question put by Deputy Johnson as to poundage to a distributor of stamps, that is a case where stamps are actually sold for the Revenue Commissioners by the Secretary of the Dublin Stock Exchange.  He is paid at a certain rate.  The scale, which I shall mention, contemplates greater payments than will be necessary.  If he sold up to £24,000 worth of stamps he would be entitled to £180.  On the excess, up to £35,000, he would be allowed 15/- per <Col N="755" /> £100 worth.  On the excess over £35,000 worth and up to £75,000 worth, he would be paid at the rate of 10/- per £100 worth, and on any excess over £75,000 worth he is paid 5/- per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this a personal act of the distributor, or has he to employ a staff for the purpose?  Stock Exchange operations only occupy a few hours per day.  This Estimate contemplates payment of £500 for distribution of stamps which, I assume from the Minister's statement, is the work of one person.  Unless the person concerned has some responsibility as to the amount of the stamps and so on, the sum does not seem to me to be justified in its present form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very old arrangement and it covers the entire expenses.  Salaries would have to be paid and there probably would be other expenses in connection with the distribution of these stamps for Stock Exchange operations if a payment were not made on this basis.  I doubt whether any saving could be effected by a change.  I do not say that it should not be examined, but it is an old-standing arrangement which has been in operation for a very considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>I draw attention to the fact that we have a Director of Stamping and a Deputy Director of Stamping.  Presumably their work is in connection with preparing the stamps.  But we have also appointed a stockbroker, so that we are gradually gathering together a department, one way or another.  It occurred to me that the distribution of these stamps might be done under the direction of the official responsible for the Stock Exchange operations of the Government. I ask the Minister to consider whether this is the most economical and efficient method of carrying out this work?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will examine that, but I might say that the appointment of a stockbroker was made because the Stock Exchange refused to pass a rule which we asked them to pass allowing a stockbroker to do Government work at half rate, but they passed a rule <Col N="756" /> allowing a stockbroker to do Government work on a salary.  We were able to save substantially by paying a stockbroker a salary rather than paying him the ordinary rate of commission.</P>

I certainly did not know that the Stock Exchange had refused to do anything in the matter of meeting the Government.  With reference to sub-head K, perhaps the Minister would give an explanation as to what the small service of £1,000 in connection with the maintenance of boats is for: &ldquo;Construction, purchase and maintenance of vessels, boats and other conveyances.&rdquo;  A thousand pounds will not go very far in the construction and maintenance of any number of boats.</P>

My questions are more for information than with any desire to increase the £1,000 which would, of course, be out of order, but I cannot exactly fit in the sum of £1,000 under the heading and also in relation to the duties that are carried out by Customs officials.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,705,300 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1927, for the payment of Old Age Pensions under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1908 to 1924, for certain Administrative Expenses in connection therewith, and for Pensions under the Blind Persons Act, 1920.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Vote is, practically speaking, for the actual cost of the pensions themselves and also for the fees and expenses of the clerks of local pensions committees.  As I have already stated, the bulk of the administrative duties, including the printing of the old age pensions orders, the investigation of cases, the distribution of books, and so <Col N="758" /> forth, falls on the Revenue Commissioners; payments are made by the Post Office, and appeals are dealt with by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  The peak point in regard to the number of old age pensions paid in the territory that is now the Saorstát was reached in 1912, when the number was 156,000.  On the 31st March, 1926, the number was about 115,000.  The reduction reflected in the Estimate this year is based on the calculation that the number of deaths of pensioners will be greater than the number of new pensioners. That, of course, follows the decline of population which took place all during the last century.  The expenses of pension committees are slightly down. There are twenty-seven local pensions committees and 309 pensions sub-committees in the counties, and fifteen pensions committees and sixteen sub-committees in county boroughs and urban districts.</P>
    <P>The Commission which dealt with the administration of the Old Age Pensions Acts, and which sat last year, presented a report containing a number of recommendations with regard to the administration of the Acts and of old age pensions generally.  We have been considering the report of that Commission in conjunction with the Department of Local Government and Public Health, and we are almost at a stage when we can act on the recommendations.  The great majority of them are of such a character that we have no difficulties at all in accepting them.  The recommendation that it should be compulsory on the pensions officer to attend at the committee meetings is one about which we feel some difficulty in complying with, and we are still examining that.  But in any case, if we do not make it absolutely compulsory on the pensions officer to attend, we are agreed that his actual presence at meetings is most desirable, and it certainly should be a general rule, if not a rule without exception. There were suggestions before the committee to make his attendance compulsory, but they did not weigh with the majority of the committee.  We think, however, that they are of importance. That is one of the matters that has not yet been determined.  In regard to <Col N="759" /> most of the other recommendations, I think that with certain modifications we will be able to comply with them and, even if we do not accept that particular recommendation in the letter, I think we will, at any rate, modify the practice, following consideration of the recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I am rather disappointed that the Minister has not been able now to announce to the Dáil the decision of his Department with regard to the committee's report.  I cannot see why the Minister could not have made up his mind on the matter before this, seeing that he has been in possession of the committee's report since last November.  There is nothing very far-reaching in that report, nothing that would call for a great deal of consideration, mainly because the terms of reference were very restricted.  I trust that the Minister will adopt that portion of the report dealing with the attendance of pension officers at the committee meetings, because the committee of inquiry looked upon that as the most valuable recommendation which they made, and they believed, if it were adopted, that it would make the administration easier and, in fact, less costly.</P>
      <P>At present there is no contact, or very little contact, between the pension officer and the pension committee, and they are continually at loggerheads, so to speak.  The pension committee will not agree with the report of the pension officer, and the pension officer, in most cases, appeals against the decision of the pensions committee.  The committee, which was set up by the Minister, believed that if the pension officer were to attend the committee meetings and explain his reasons for granting, or refusing, a pension, there would not be so many appeals and, consequently, there would not be so much work thrown on the Local Government Department. I hope that the Minister will give his decision on the matter very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask him to give us some information with regard to what saving has been made since the introduction of the 1924 Act, and what saving has been made as a result of the <Col N="760" /> cut, apart from the saving which has been made by tightening up the administration. I do not suppose that I will be allowed, at this stage, to go into the question of the cut, but I want to put it to the Minister that the administration has been tightened too much.  I admit that there was necessity for tightening up the administration.  I am quite prepared to admit that the whole thing was being worked in a very loose fashion prior to the setting up of the Free State and some time afterwards. I am quite prepared to admit that many of the pension committees looked upon it as a rather patriotic thing to grant as many pensions as they possibly could and to get as much money as possible from the British Government in many cases, whether the applicants were qualified or not.</P>
    <P>I am, however, afraid that the Minister has gone to the other extreme and that the administration has been tightened so much that many applicants who were qualified to receive pensions are being squeezed out.  There was cause for complaint with regard to the delay in deciding claims for pensions, both for blind and old age pensions, particularly the former, and also with regard to the delay in having decisions arrived at on appeal, but I think that that matter has been remedied to a large extent, and that they are being dealt with fairly expeditiously at present, but the matter which gives most trouble at the moment is the question of establishing age.  It is well known to the Minister and to most Deputies that very many applicants for old age pensions within the last few years have found it impossible to get any documentary proof of their age, and the Department, by regulation, started the device of affidavits, but, so far as we can see, it is almost impossible to have an affidavit framed which will satisfy the Department.</P>
    <P>This matter was gone into at some length by the Committee, and while we believed that the affidavit method of establishing age is the best method, I must say that I am not satisfied that the Department is dealing with the matter in a fair way.  As I say, it seems to be impossible to have an affidavit framed which will meet the requirements of the Department.  I have <Col N="761" /> seen affidavits made by very respectable people which gave in detail their reasons for knowing that the applicant was seventy years of age or over, and, in most cases, these affidavits have been rejected by the Department, with the result that many people, who are undoubtedly qualified to receive pensions, are still without them.  There is, consequently, a feeling growing up amongst these people that the Government are deliberately trying to deprive them of the pension to which they believe they are justly entitled.  I would be sorry to believe that that is so, but I suggest to the Minister that he ought to go into this matter, and, while doing what he can to prevent people who are not entitled to receive the pension from receiving it, he ought not tighten the administration so much that people entitled to the pension cannot get it. That, I think, will be admitted by most Deputies to be one of the matters which is causing most trouble not only to the applicants, but also, I think, to Deputies.</P>
    <P>The feeling is there amongst the applicants that it is only waste of time to get people to make affidavits as to age, because, in every case in some districts, and in almost every case in other districts, the pension officer appeals on the ground of age, unless the applicant is able to produce a baptismal certificate. I think if the pension officer were to see the applicant and speak to him, that that, together with the affidavit, would put him in a position of being able to say, with a reasonable amount of certainty, whether the person was, or was not, seventy years of age.  I would like the Minister to give some attention to that matter, because it is creating, and has created, a good deal of dissatisfaction and even bitterness amongst many old people.  If the Minister was able to settle the matter in some way so that, without opening the door too wide he would open it wide enough to give people who are qualified a chance of getting pensions, he would be removing a great grievance.</P>

      <P>I notice that there is a sum of £50,000 required this year less than the amount required last year. That, to my mind, is proof of the statement <Col N="762" /> that there is rather a severe tightening up, and I would add further that in many cases injustice is being done to many deserving claimants.  I am aware that there is great difficulty as regards persons who cannot produce their birth certificates.  In many cases these applicants should get the benefit of the doubt, especially when a declaration, or other form of evidence, is given which could reasonably be accepted as proof of age.  Some cases have been brought to my notice within the past twelve months in which very deserving poor people could not get the pension because the records were destroyed in the parishes in which they were born.  They produced, however, declarations and other forms of evidence from the parish priest of the district, and one would imagine that these would be accepted, in accordance with the Act and in accordance with the statements made by the Minister when introducing this Vote on a previous occasion.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to convey the instruction to the authorities dealing with these applications that where there is a doubt, and they are not altogether satisfied they are doing the right thing by disqualifying a poor person, they should give the benefit of that doubt to the claimant as against the Government.  I am sure that many Deputies, at some time or other, have had cases brought to their notice in which, if it were left to them to decide, they would, on the merits, declare the claimant entitled to the pension.  I have known cases where old certificates, old documents and even old school-books which belonged to people when they had reached a certain age, and which were reasonable proof, were turned down.  I am sorry to say I am not altogether as satisfied as Deputy Morrissey is that there is not a desire in order to keep this Estimate as low as possible to overlook hardships that are being inflicted.</P>

I have not the same confidence in those who deal with the application forms that come in.  I am not satisfied that they show the sympathy necessary in dealing with such cases.  I believe they look upon each case from, as it were, within the four walls of the Act, and they will give no benefit of the doubt to claimants. I suggest that the Minister should instruct officials dealing with applications for pensions, or the committees considering those applications, that at all times where there is a doubt in regard to the evidence that is submitted, particularly by means of sworn declarations or marriage certificates, the benefit of that doubt should be given to the applicant.  In the old days a marriage certificate 48 years old would be always accepted as evidence of age and it is not accepted now.</P>

When I was on a pension committee some years ago marriage certificates were always accepted as reasponsible evidence both by the committee and the Government of the time.</P>
      <P>The fact that there is £50,000 less required this year as compared with last year for old age pensions shows that there is a tightening up that might not be forced in the manner in which it is being forced.  I had hopes that the Government would have been in a position to announce that the shilling would be restored this year.</P>

      <P>I would like to bring once more to the Minister's attention a case about which I asked a question yesterday.  I asked for information as to how a pension officer calculated the means of the applicant. The case I had in mind was the case of a woman who was granted a pension of one shilling per week.  Her husband was out of work and was receiving unemployment benefit.  The pension officer calculated that the yearly income from unemployment benefit was £52.  I would like to know if there is any man in the country who receives £52 a year&mdash;£1 a week&mdash;from unemployment benefit, and I would like to know how the pension officer understood that he was receiving £1 a week for 52 weeks.  How long will the unemployment benefit last in this particular case?  Is it fair to calculate unemployment benefit as means?  It does not matter so much about a single case, but if this is general throughout the country I think it is a great hardship on people who are looking for the old age pension.  I ask the Minister to bring that pension officer strictly to account, to review that case, increase the pension, and in future to give instructions to all pension officers that unemployment benefit must not be considered as means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>This year there is a decrease of £50,000 in the amount allocated for pensions.  One must conclude, in view of such a huge reduction, that it is again the desire of the Minister for Finance to economise at the expense of the aged and destitute poor.  It would require a good deal of explanation to show how this reduction has been <Col N="765" /> arrived at.  What has occurred between this time twelve-months and to-day that has brought the Minister to realise the necessity of reducing the amount allocated for pensions by £50,000?  It was not enough to reduce the weekly amount awarded to old age pensioners, but it appears there must be a reduction in the amount that will be available during the coming year for the payment of old age pensions to those who may be applicants.  Every attempt is made to economise at the expense of the destitute poor.  It would take a lot of explanation on the part of the Minister to satisfy the Committee or the people who will be the victims of the reduction.</P>
      <P>The question of establishing age is a very curious one.  It is nearly impossible to know what is required to establish age.  Sworn affidavits apparently are useless to the extent of 90 per cent. Practically every case that came under my notice in which there were sworn affidavits has been turned down.  The evidence of other people is not acceptable. I recollect one case that came to my notice in which a woman who was drawing a pension for something approaching two years made a sworn affidavit to the effect that another woman, who was an applicant for a pension and who was rejected on her first application, carried her to school when she started going to school.  Here was a woman practically 72 years of age swearing that an applicant who was rejected on the grounds of age carried her to school.  Notwithstanding that fact, the applicant was turned down, and up to this she has not got a pension.</P>
      <P>It is a serious thing.  I do not know why people who swear affidavits are treated in this fashion.  Is it the view of those responsible for considering affidavits that everyone who swears an affidavit does so for the purpose of swearing falsehoods?  I think it must be in the mind of the Department that those people are perjuring themselves. There was a plain case of a woman of 72 years of age who was at least four years younger than another woman whose claim was rejected on the grounds of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider the amount of money allocated <Col N="766" /> for the expenses of pension committees is altogether too small.  I consider that the clerks of local pension committees are underpaid.  The remuneration allowed to those clerks is not up to the standard that it should reach. Take the case of a clerk acting for a whole county.  Very often he has to go to different districts to attend meetings of local committees.  His remuneration will not allow him to hire a motor car, and in all kinds of weather he has to push a bicycle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the question of the income of applicants for pensions.  I have known at least one case where an old lady&mdash;there was no question at all about her age as there were certificates to prove it&mdash;was living with a sister and brother-in-law and simply because they gave her the shelter of their house and allowed her participation in whatever meals were going, the pension officer claimed that her maintenance was worth 10/- a week.  They assessed her income at 10/-, and awarded her 6/- instead of 9/-.  That case suggests to me that before a woman who has absolutely no means can establish her claim to the full amount of 9/- her relations must cast her out on the street.  If her relations have anything of the milk of human kindness in them and afford her the shelter of their house, then the State will take advantage of that fact and curtail the woman's allowance.  I suggest that is altogether wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind a case which came to my notice some time ago.  The applicant had been awarded a pension of 6/- a week.  On my advice she made another application.  Her income, with <Col N="767" /> the 6/- a week, was just the same as it was before she got any money from the State, and for this reason, that the kindness of her relations in maintaining her when she had nothing was valued at 10/- a week.  When she got the 6/- a week from the State she gave that to her people for her maintenance, which was still valued at 10/- a week. That meant that there was 4/- worth of support contributed by her relations and that she was entitled to another six if the Pension Act allowed it.  She was actually entitled to and got another 3/-.  The point I want to make is that that person and those interested in the case were put to the trouble of having to make a second application.  If the pension officer had exercised even a small amount of common sense in the first instance he would have given the 9/- originally, and the State would not have lost anything more than the difference between 9/- and 6/- for four or six weeks.  The case goes to prove that in very many instances some of these pension officers are absolutely lacking in plain common-sense, a thing that Ministers tell us so often it is necessary to develop.</P>
    <P>That is an aspect of the question I would ask the Minister to consider.  I would ask him, too, to instruct these pension officers in future that they are to use their common-sense instead of going purely by rote.  It should not be necessary that a man or a woman in fairly good circumstances should be obliged to refuse the shelter of their home to an aged sister in order to enable her to get what is due to her from the State.</P>

      <P>I had not intended intervening in this discussion but for the observations of Deputy Hall, and to some extent, of Deputy Nagle.  Their observations impel me to say that they understand nothing whatsoever of the regulations governing the rates of pension.  I suppose there is no Deputy in the House who has more to do with the carrying out of this Act than I, unfortunately, have, and to that extent I claim some special knowledge on the subject.  If such a case as Deputy Hall instanced occurred <Col N="768" /> it is a scandal, because if evidence were put forward, evidence such as the Act and the regulations prescribe, the case could not have happened.  To some extent the case mentioned by Deputy Nagle is slightly different.  I am always anxious and agreeable to hear arguments put up by the Deputy.  But I say to him in regard to this case that it is about the most inept and stupid one that could be put up.  Why was not the case put before the Department to deal with?  I would like to be very complimentary to the Deputy, but I am afraid I cannot compliment him on this.</P>
      <P>A Commission was appointed to inquire into the working of the Old Age Pensions Act, and it will probably be reporting before the House adjourns. This Vote for old age pensions is an annual one, and I have taken the trouble of acquainting myself with the requirements of the Act.  In the whole congested area of West Donegal in which I live, though I am a representative of the whole county, there is not a case of hardship, that is a case where a person had been harshly dealt with by the pension officer&mdash;cases such as that mentioned by Deputy Nagle&mdash;that we have not composed.  The point I would like to impress on the House is that no matter what you do in this House, unless the administration of the Act is efficiently carried out, the position will be hopeless.  The administration carried out by the pension officers is left in the hands of the local committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is a Deputy who will say that these local committees are doing their duty in that respect. Why then blame the Minister or the pension officers in connection with matters which it is our business to see that they carry out?  If they do not carry out their duty in my section of the country they are soon made to know about it.  You cannot get local committees to do their duty in that respect, but it is our business to see that they do it.  Cases which were turned down by the pension officer and which I investigated myself cost me a good deal of inconvenience as well as expense, but 99 per cent. of them in the last 12 months have been restored because I <Col N="769" /> put evidence up.  Other Deputies, I suggest, could also do that instead of coming here to growl against the Minister for Finance.  I certainly am not very friendly to him in most ways, but in this matter the complaint rests not against the Department, but against Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. MURPHY Mr. T. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the appeal made by Deputy Morrissey to the Minister in regard to the recommendations of the Committee that investigated the Old Age Pensions Act and in particular the recommendation that pension officers should be asked to attend the meetings of the local pensions committees.  My experience as a member of a pensions sub-committee leads me to believe that that would be a very useful provision if put into operation.  I have seen cases come before the local committees, and with the pension officer present satisfactory arrangements were come to as the outcome of a discussion between the members of the committee and the pension officer.  The adoption of the recommendation referred to would, I think, go a long way to remedy the position you have now in which the pension officer usually takes an exactly opposite view to that of the members of the committee, and in which he appeals automatically to the Department of Local Government as it were.  There does not seem to be any definite regard for the decision of the committees, and while there may be justification for that in regard to certain committees and in regard to the manner in which they are inclined to view cases in some places, I do not think that that obtains generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take that matter into consideration and see whether some arrangement could not be made so that the pension officer would measure his views on the merits of the case rather than take an exactly opposite view to that of the committee. The pension officer religiously appeals every single case as far as I know, and I am not at all satisfied that he is acting fairly in doing so.  As regards the calculation of means, I think there is a great hardship in that.  In the case of poor people in the country, of small farmers, the pension officer goes out <Col N="770" /> and examines the place and puts a very high valuation on their means. Fowl and other things are valued at an extremely high rate and out of all proportion to their worth.  I think there ought to be more common-sense and a more reasonable spirit adopted in assessing the means of people who claim the old age pension, people such as small farmers and others in a poor position.  The little worldly goods they have are assessed on a value altogether out of proportion to their real worth. I think there should be more latitude and more reason in that matter.  It presents one of the big difficulties to those who know anything about the administration of the Act, and we are up against it every day.  In the case of old people living with their children a particular difficulty arises.</P>
    <P>In other cases old people down the country give up their farms to their children, reserving £8, £9 or £10 a year for themselves.  In a great many cases the sons or daughters on these small holdings are not able to meet that money; in fact it is never asked for, although it is put in as some sort of protection for the old people when marriage settlements are being drawn up.  Each case should be examined on its merits and some provision should be made for those who live with relatives and for whom some little money is provided in marriage agreements, but who never draw that money.  I know that the attitude of the Department is that a son or daughter is bound to maintain his or her parents.  Very often that leads to a great deal of trouble.  Very often people are being charged with maintenance that they are not able to meet, and old people are credited with having sums of money allotted to them under agreements that they never availed of, for the simple reason that if they asked for it they could not obtain it; if they did they would simply smash the persons responsible.  It seems to me that small farmers particularly are victimised because of their thrift and industry. If a pension officer sees a little farm place tidy, clean and comfortable, he puts a very high valuation on it and reports that the place is worth very much more than it is.</P>
    <P>If it appears that the person who is <Col N="771" /> claiming a pension has been a waster, if he is untidy, miserable and poor-looking, he gains, while the worthy person who has made every effort to pull along decently suffers on account of the thrift and industry he has displayed during his life-time.  I disagree with what Deputy O'Doherty said in regard to the pensions committee.  I know at least one or two committees where the pensions officers come to the meetings and where there never has been any difficulty.  The pension officer places his view before the committee.  Matters are discussed freely, and nearly always a satisfactory arrangement is come to. I do not hold the view that it is the duty of pensions committees to pile up applications and grant claims automatically. I have been a member of a committee and I have seen members of that committee very anxious to reject claims where they thought they were not reasonable.  They were not a bit afraid of any unpopularity that might result.  They simply did their duty and they were glad to have the assistance of the pensions officer.  I think the Minister will find that the attendance of the pensions officers at these meetings will lead to the better working of the Act.  I should also like to refer to the case of pensioners.  Take the case of a person who receives a pension of 10/- a week from the British Government, as a result of somebody being killed in the war.  A deduction of 4/- in the old age pension of that person is made.  It seems to me that that is unfair.  There is no reason why the old age pension should be cut down.</P>

That money is not being contributed by the taxpayer of this country; it is coming from another source and it should not be touched, in my opinion.  I have no complaint to make as regards the manner in which the Local Government Department deals with the claims.  But down the country there ought to be more give and take, and generally the administration of the Act ought to be broadened. It would do no harm to the State nor to the people generally.  I think, on the contrary, it would lead to more confidence in the manner in which the Act is being administered, and I think that would be an object worth attaining even at a little extra expense.</P>

Undoubtedly the basis of assessment of the value of the stock of a small farmer down the country is unfair.  I will only say that if the same value were to be put on all the stock in the Saorstát as is put on what is found on the holding of an applicant for an old age pension, the Saorstát would be about three times as wealthy as it is valued at the present time.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Doherty can be very well satisfied, for I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that about one-third of the money that is voted for old age pensions must be paid into Tirconnaill.  Undoubtedly there is a case for reconsideration of the value that is put on holdings and what they are capable of producing. There is something very wrong about the question of affidavits.  Like other Deputies, I have some experience of this matter.  If a Deputy is particularly active and goes to a lot of trouble with the Appeals Branch there are possibilities that the pensions will be secured to claimants, but that is not as it should be.  The law should operate in such a manner that whether or not anyone intervenes on behalf of these people they would get the pension, if they were entitled to it.  Some <Col N="773" /> Deputies find that a considerable amount of their time and energies are wasted in trying to get pensions for people who they believe are entitled to them.  Even to-day I had the experience of going to this Department.  I must say that anyone who goes to the Department is treated with courtesy and consideration.  He is treated fairly, as far as the Department can do it.</P>
      <P>In the case in question three affidavits were sent to the Department. They were definite and explicit statements as to the age of the individual concerned.  One was a statement by an older sister of the claimant.  She swore that she was seventy-six years of age and that the claimant was seventy-three. She was the next of the family to her.  I know the claimant myself. But these affidavits were not accepted as sufficient evidence that the claimant is the age.  I do say that it is difficult to find out exactly what should be done in the matter of affidavits.  The Department's point of view is that specific evidence must be given of how those who make the affidavits arrive at the conclusion that the claimant is the particular age they state.  It is not an easy matter to get an old person of seventyfive or eighty years of age to come up to the very close reasoning that is required in the affidavit, and I say undoubtedly but for the efforts of the Deputies in this House hundreds of claimants every year would be deprived of their pensions.  Deputies have to write letters, interview claimants, and get affidavits sworn in order to get pensions for people who are entitled to them.  That is not as it ought to be. There should be some system of administration, that while being satisfactory to the Department would at the same time be just to the claimants.  It is up to the Department to find a solution of this difficulty, and not put Deputies to the extraordinary trouble they have to go to.  This should not be part of the duties of a Deputy.  It is, in fact, taking part in the administration for which officials are paid, and I urge very strongly on the Minister that something should be done other than what is being done at the present time to make the working of the Act more satisfactory to everybody.</P>

In this solitary instance that Deputy Baxter raised here had he even used the village idiot to put up an affidavit the Department would have considered it.  I am not a supporter of the Department, the Minister or anybody else, but I must honestly say that the Department that is dealing with old age pensions is one of the finest we have in the Saorstát. They have turned down many of my own recommendations, but when I get the evidence that is necessary under the Act there is no trouble whatsoever. Deputy Baxter instanced the case of an old woman up in Cavan.  In the name of all the eternal verities, why does not Deputy Baxter go down to that old lady and find what evidence she has got?  Instead, he comes to this House and gives vent to that mournful cry, which to me is very objectionable, against a Department in respect of which he has not made a case.  That is not fair.  Most Deputies know pretty well that I am fairly independent.</P>

      <P>If it is the law, then the law ought to be amended and amended instanter.  The State has no right to assess assistance rendered out of human feeling or charity to individuals. If members of a family choose, out of human feeling, to provide for a person who may perhaps not even be related to them, and if this person would otherwise be entitled to an old age pension, then I say that it is wrong that the State should assess this support as an asset of the individual. That is what it amounts to.  It may be the law, but if there is no other means of dealing with the matter it is the duty of the Dáil to amend the law.</P>

    <P>I know of a few cases in which documentary evidence of birth cannot be produced.  I believe there are a good many people in the country who find themselves in a similar difficulty.  Is it absolutely essential that a baptismal certificate should be produced?  Cannot the pension officer and the State exercise their common sense?  Evidence has been produced in several cases to show that the applicant is over 70 years of age, and still we are told that the officers are tied up by statute and cannot do anything.  There are several people unable to produce their baptismal certificates for one reason or other.  It may be that they were never registered.  These omissions occur even now.  In some cases children born within the last two or three years have not been registered.  I am not so sure that, as a parent, I have not been an offender in this respect myself.  If that can happen to-day, it could well occur 70 years ago.  I should like to know from the Minister whether documentary evidence is absolutely essential.  That seems to be the only thing that is holding back pensions in many cases.  Other classes of evidence, however conclusive, do not seem to be acted upon.  The Minister shakes his head and suggests that documentary evidence is not essential. If it is not essential then an explanation <Col N="776" /> is due of the action of some pension officers.</P>

      <P>I support the plea put forward with regard to means.  I can state a case which will show how strictly the law&mdash;if it is the law&mdash;is administered in this regard.  I brought before the House some time ago the case of a widow over 70 years of age without children.  On the point of age there was no doubt whatever.  But this woman was disqualified on the ground of means.  She had been admitted to the house of a friend&mdash;by marriage, not a blood-relative&mdash;and the means coming from that support were valued at £35 a year, which disqualified her for a pension.  As Deputies have said, if that is the law, it ought to be changed, because this person was admitted purely from charity.  There was no obligation whatever to support her, and if State aid is to be extended to persons over 70 years of age certainly this was a case which should have come within the ambit of the Act.</P>

      <P>In several cases in which I was concerned I had the opposite experience.  In a case where a man was looking for an old age pension he had represented himself as ten or fifteen years younger than he was when he was getting married.  That was documentary evidence against him.  The Old Age Pension authorities, however, on sufficient proof being supplied, admitted he was seventy years of age. In a number of other cases, where the applicants were not able to prove documentarily that their father and mother had been married on a certain date, lived in a village in a certain parish, and had a certain number of children, for the purpose of showing that the applicants had attained <Col N="777" /> the proper age, the pensions officer dealt with the proofs adduced very liberally.  He gave applicants in such cases every chance to prove their claims, and they succeeded.  It is only a matter, in my opinion, of helping the authorities along the way.  If you give them all the available assistance, you can practically prove your case.  But if you merely give them an affidavit, in which there is no definite statement, you cannot blame them if they refuse to accept that as conclusive evidence.</P>

      <P>I desire to refer to the case of claimants living on holdings under £10 valuation.  It is generally admitted that these holdings are uneconomic. If you take the case of a man and his wife and four or five children, living on a holding of £5 valuation, he is not able to rear his family in any sort of decency or comfort because of the limited resources of his little farm.  Let us assume that a claim is made for a pension in respect of the father or mother of the holder of that farm.  The pension officer arrives on the scene, and he makes the remarkable discovery that, on account of the father or mother being maintained on that holding, he or she is enjoying means to the amount of 10s. per week.  That is as much as to say that the occupier of that holding, after supporting his family, is able to spend 10s. per week in supporting a parent, or, if the two parents be maintained, that he is able to spend £1 per week in this way.  In that there is contradiction, because we have been told here frequently that those farms are under the economic level, which is to say that the occupiers are living on an inadequate income. If that be the fact, how can the means of these applicants be estimated at 10s. per week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said here that in pre-Treaty times committees were inclined to grant pensions very generously. They did not inquire particularly into means, and for that there was a certain amount of political justification.  At all events, they got into a very bad habit.  Times have changed, and old age pension committees are aware of the change just as well as other people. They are aware that they have to foot the bill for these pensions.  They are <Col N="778" /> not, therefore, as generous as they used to be, and they are inclined to examine cases very carefully.  That being so, I think more attention should be paid to their representations.  In my constituency there is unanimity among old age pension committees that their representations do not receive sufficient consideration.  In one case, a parish priest&mdash;the chairman of a committee&mdash; refused absolutely to act, because, he said, the recommendations made by his committee did not receive consideration. These committees are part and parcel of the machinery for administration of the Old Age Pensions Act, and the Department and the pension officers ought to keep more in touch with them.  If the pension officer attended their meetings, giving the committees the benefit of his knowledge of the law, it would moderate their dissatisfaction to a great extent, and there would be fewer appeals.  It would make, too, for closer relationship between the committees and the Department.</P>
    <P>I would also like to support what has been said about the difficulty of getting evidence.  It is an unfortunate day for some old man or woman when he or she has to commence a pilgrimage all over the country to look for evidence of birth.  Some of them showed a great lack of foresight by being born in parishes where no records were kept, while others were more fortunate.  It is very difficult for some people to prove their ages, as all of us know who have heard stories from claimants, and it is very difficult in a country parish to get affidavits of a satisfactory character.  There may have been no important events at which people were present and from which their ages could be known, and it is therefore very difficult to get these affidavits.  If the committee makes a recommendation that they believe a man is up to the age, a pension officer should not appeal, unless from his own knowledge of the man he thought that that was not the case.  But to appeal because a man fails, through no fault of his own, to get documentary evidence, leads to injustice in a number of cases, and if it does that there is reason for remedying the law.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the plea put forward by my colleague, Deputy Murphy, on behalf of the small farmer.  Both Deputy Murphy and I come from an area which contains a number of small farmers.  I consider that the basis of assessment on valuation in these cases is wrong.  As Deputy Murphy stated, the thrifty farmer and his wife, on reaching the age of 70, are penalised, and the pensions officer over-values their stock because they have been thrifty and because they may have fowl and other little goods and chattels.  The manner in which this valuation is carried out is an incentive to the slovenly farmer and it penalises the thrifty man.  I support the suggestion that the method of making the valuation should be reconsidered.</P>

It is becoming a very difficult problem to get anyone at all to act on these committees owing to the fact that little heed is given to their recommendations.  I also support Deputy Sears' plea for the attendance of the pensions officers at the committee meetings.  It would simplify matters considerably if cases could be discussed between the pensions officers and the committees, and it would lead to more amicable understandings on both sides. I would also like to refer to the question of means.  I have known people who had actually no means, who had practically nothing whatever to live on, and who were taken in by relatives. Applications for pensions were made and were granted, but the pensions officer appealed on the grounds of means, as the people who took them in had some means of their own and kept them, more for humanity sake than anything else.  The committee's recommendations were turned down on appeal.  I have known some of these applicants then to go into lodgings for a short time, and immediately they did so pensions were granted.  I hold that if they were eligible for pensions when living in lodgings they were surely eligible when staying with their friends, and the law at present is depriving these people of the little comfort <Col N="780" /> they would have by staying with their friends.</P>

      <P>I also appeal to the Minister to give a little more consideration to the recommendations of the pensions committees.  At present the committees are treated almost as registering machines, just to receive the recommendations of the pensions officer in connection with claims that are purely non-contentious.  In almost every case in which there is any doubt at all, the Department upholds the decision of the pensions officer, notwithstanding the fact that nowadays committees go to all kinds of trouble in order to investigate claims properly. Like other Deputies, I am prepared to recognise the fact that prior to the establishment of the Free State committees were inclined to be liberal in granting claims at the expense of another Government, but I think that people have now developed sufficient civic spirit to investigate claims properly, knowing that the money which pays these claims comes directly out of the pockets of the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evidence of age is a very difficult problem which confronts every committee and every claimant, and I am inclined to ask: &ldquo;When is an affidavit an affidavit?&rdquo; I happen to be the chairman of a pensions committee, and I know that we go to great pains to find proper, responsible people who are prepared to make an affidavit in favour of a claimant, but in 99 cases out of a 100 what we consider to be proper affidavits are turned down.  The general feeling in the country at present is that the Government are prepared to take advantage of anything and everything in order to deprive the people of their rights to pensions.  I would ask the Government to try to devise some means whereby this affidavit question will be simplified.  So far as means are concerned I, like other Deputies who have spoken, believe that the pensions officers are stretching a little too much what they conceive to be their powers.  I put a question down a fortnight ago somewhat similar to that to which Deputy Conlan has just referred, and the Minister stated that the reason the pension was not allowed to the lady in question was that she <Col N="781" /> was living with her brother-in-law. I do not think anybody will try to make the case that a brother-in-law is under any liability to keep his sister-in-law. Many of these old people would be sent to the nearest county home were it not for the fact that in perhaps twelve or eighteen months' time they would be entitled to the pension, and rather than see them going into the county home or the Union, as the case might be, their friends and relatives take them in, on the understanding that they will get the pension at the end of a certain period.  I do think that the pensions officers and the Department responsible for the administration of the pensions are tightening the strings too much as far as the administration of the Act is concerned, and I ask the Minister to see to it that the people get fair play.  I do believe that things are tightened up too much and that there should be a little more give and take, and I would ask the Minister to pay a little more attention to the recommendations made by the committees.</P>

      <P>On the question of the means of applicants, I wish to make particular reference to means from land, and I think that the only correct valuation is the poor law valuation. When an officer has the poor law valuation and any outside means before him, there ought to be no inquiry with regard to the comfortable appearance of the applicant, or anything of that kind.  A penalty should not be put on thrift, because that is what it amounts to.  People should not be penalised because they were able to make a little more of their facilities than other people.  I think a standard based on the valuation of the holding and other means from outside, such as investments, ought to be the only things that should concern the pensions officer, and whether the home has a comfortable appearance or not should not be taken into consideration.  They should not be penalised because the homes are comfortable, and if these old people keep a few fowl or a pig that should not be taken into consideration.</P>

I am aware of a case that was pending for the past twelve months, and notwithstanding the fact that an affidavit was made by two people who are undoubtedly over seventy-six years of age, the pensions officer has turned down the claim, and the applicant has nowhere to go for redress. It is admitted that he is seventy-three years of age, and in every other way is entitled to a pension. From the means point of view he is practically destitute, but he has no method, except by affidavit, of showing that he is over the age.  We are all aware of the fact that when the Old Age Pensions Act came in a number of these old people were not registered, and that is applicable to this case. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will make it plain what step a man who is undoubtedly over the required age should take to get a pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCULLOUGH</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word also with special reference to Deputy Sears' suggestion that the officer should keep more in touch with the pensions committee.  I think there is no doubt whatever that pensions committees generally have a stronger sense of responsibility than they used to have with regard to the money they recommend to be spent.  I have no desire to see the pension list swelled by any improper claims, but, with special reference to the county of which I am one of the representatives, I know that many of the claimants have no means of proving age from records, due to the fact that no records are available, and that all they can do is to produce affidavits from people who are old enough to testify as to their ages.  I have a case in mind of one claim which has been turned down, although affidavits have shown that the claimant is seventythree years of age.  His sponsor at baptism was unmarried, and yet her eldest son is now receiving a pension. Affidavits have been presented but have not been accepted.  I know that the Department has issued a circular setting out the requirements necessary in connection with affidavits, but on the <Col N="783" /> western seaboard in particular, and in counties like Tirconnaill,. where the language is largely Irish, the people are not always capable of dealing with the legal forms involved, and I think that some effort should be made to give at least favourable consideration to the claims of such people.  I have had conversations with some of the responsible officers in the Department and they assured me that 99 per cent. of the claims that come from my constituency are honest claims.  Yet in a large number of cases they are turned down for lack of documentary evidence.  I believe that if the pensions officer, who, of course, has to carry out his duties strictly in the interest of the State, were more in touch with the committees he would be less drastic in turning down claims.  I would urge the Minister to give the necessary indication to enable claimants to get the necessary information.</P>
      <P>As I say, especially on the Western seaboard, where the people are largely Gaelic speakers, they are not able to deal completely with the forms sent down.  I believe, if that were done, a good deal would be done to do justice to old people who are justly entitled to pensions but who are unable, owing to the fact that no record of age is available, to prove their claims completely.  I confess from personal experience that the Department are not ungenerous in the matter, and I have no doubt that it is not part of the policy of the Ministry to cheat old people out of their pensions when they are justly entitled to them, but I would urge that more favourable consideration be given to cases in which affidavits are sent in in favour of the applicant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with several speakers who said that it is desirable that there should be close contact between pension officers and the committees. I think I can promise that for the future there will be, at any rate as a general rule, attendance of officers at committee meetings so that there may be the personal contact, which may sometimes enable difficulties to be got over and doubts to be cleared up which would be difficult to clear up by <Col N="784" /> correspondence.  I could not say to Deputy Morrissey at the moment what saving has been effected as a result of the cuts, apart from what may have resulted from tightening up the administration. The present Estimate is something like £600,000 less than that for the year 1923-24.  In addition, however, to the cuts, something has been caused by better administration and also by the process of natural decline. The decline in the number of pensioners from the year 1912 to the present reflects the sharp decline in the population of the country from the year 1845.  There would be in any event a reduction each year, apart from the cut or the tightening in the administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that there has been any undue stringency in administration, especially as regards the establishment of age.  When the Bill of 1924 was going through the Dáil many Deputies complained that it was very difficult for people to establish age. As a result of discussions and also as a result of the feeling that the cuts under the Act were a hardship on pensioners, the Minister for Local Government and myself had a conference with the officials who deal with appeals, and we made it quite clear to them that, so far as their duties would permit, we desired that they would take a sympathetic view of cases.  It is not, however, possible to tell officials, and it is not possible for officials, to take up the attitude of giving the benefit of the doubt to the claimants.  The law is not so drawn.  As the law is drawn the onus of proof is on the applicant to prove that he is seventy years of age, and, while it is right, having regard to the difficulties in giving proof in many cases, that the officers dealing with the matter should be sympathetic, it is another matter to say that they should give the benefit of the doubt in every case.  Every time they do so it is equivalent to paying out £120 or more of State money.  If you want your service to be right, you cannot take up an attitude of instructing officials to give the benefit of the doubt in that way.  You must get your officials to administer the law fairly, but strictly. I, for my part, would never give instructions <Col N="785" /> to officials to do other than that.  There has been a good deal of discussion as to the difficulties of proving age.  The Committee of Inquiry referred to that particular question. Here is what they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A very large number of suggestions and complaints were made before the committee in reference to the proof of age, and many of the witnesses referred to instances in which claims were turned down on the question of age, notwithstanding the production of affidavits from old people in the district.  None of the witnesses who made these complaints furnished the Committee with copies of the affidavits which were alleged to have been rejected in the cases referred to, and in most cases their recollection was somewhat hazy as to the averments they actually contained. The Committee suspect that if these affidavits were produced and the case investigated, it would be found that they were rejected on the principle adopted by the Department of Local Government in such cases, viz., that mere bare declarations of belief that a claimant has attained the age of seventy years should not be accepted.  The view of the Department, in which the Committee concur, is that an affidavit as to age should show upon its face by reference to some definite fact or circumstance common to the lives of the deponent and the claimant, or by hitching on the deponent's belief to some outstanding event or otherwise, that the statement is something more than a mere general averment, without tangible support.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot deal with any individual affidavit which a Deputy might mention as I have not got them before me, but I know it is not the policy of the Local Government Department to reject appeals, if they could be rejected. It is simply the duty of the officials to try and ascertain whether or not there is reasonable proof, remembering that the onus of proof lies on the applicant that the applicant is seventy years of age.  We all know that there are fraudulent cases, that there are cases of people making application and claiming to be seventy years of age <Col N="786" /> who are not, in fact, that age.  Some scrutiny must take place as regards claims, and something that could be held to be proof of age must be put up and, certainly, I am convinced that there is no bias against claims at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some pension officers take up the attitude of appealing in every case where there is not documentary evidence, no matter how good may be the affidavits which are furnished? Delay, if nothing else, is thereby caused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether that is so.  The attitude of pension officers must be rather different to the attitude of those officers who act as hearers of appeals.  The pension officer knows, at any rate, that, even if he does appeal, there is still somebody who may give the claimant a pension where he is doubtful, but I think the point of view must be accepted that you cannot expect the attitude of a pension officer to be the same as that of a Local Government official who is hearing the appeal.  The pension officer is there to administer the Act and see that pensions are given, but he is also there to safeguard, to some extent, the interests of the Exchequer.  Some reference has been made to means which consist of the maintenance of the applicant by some relative or friend.  In any case, there is no option to the pension officer as he must take all means into account. That has always been the law and the practice.  I do not know whether appeals were as strictly dealt with according to law in the past as we deal with them, but no change has been made and all means have to be taken into account.  Some Deputies have said that the present system of strictly assessing means is a penalty on thrift. The means limitation is a penalty on thrift to some extent, but if we wanted to penalise thrift we would say that means should not be taken into account.  I think that is the only way of getting over that difficulty, but such arrangement would, I think, double the cost of old age pensions.  The difficulty which Deputies have mentioned cannot be eliminated unless we leave the means disqualification on one side <Col N="787" /> and simply say that all persons, whatever their means, claiming to be seventy years of age shall be entitled to the old age pension.  If we did that, we would have no difficulty, but the cost would be very high.  Unless we do that we will have difficulty in regard to means and in regard to age.  I think that the Act is being fairly and humanely administered.</P>

      <P>I believe that the recommendations of this Committee of Inquiry, which we propose in the main to adopt, will produce certain improvements and, if there are other points which can be met, we are prepared to meet them, but I would like to say that we cannot have pension officers exercising a sort of discretion which they might exercise if they had, for instance, to distribute £10 to any charity they liked.  They are really custodians of public money.  The average old age pensioner lives for six or seven years, so that there is a sum of about £120, or more, paid out of the Exchequer as a result of every pension that is granted. No Deputy would say that an official of the Ministry of Finance should, without the strictest accounting and proof, pay £120 to somebody who claims it, that he should pay out money loosely to people who claim that some debt was due to them.  The officials under the Old Age Pensions Act must really act in some such way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely disagree with the suggestion that they should give the benefit to anybody.  If you put that sort of attitude that is suggested to officials, and if it were accepted by them, you might later on, by a process of progression, have a great deal of looseness in your administration and in the actions of civil servants.  The instruction given by the Minister for Local Government and myself, in the matter of these appeals, to the officials dealing with them was, that so far as their duty permitted, they should deal sympathetically with cases where proof of age was difficult.  I have not, since <Col N="788" /> that time, seen any files because I am not in that Department.  When I was in Local Government, where complaints were made that cases had been turned down on appeal, I got the files in a certain number of cases and examined them, and I must say it is extremely difficult for anybody to be satisfied in many of these cases.</P>
    <P>A person who has to do justice to the general taxpayer and to the applicant is in very great difficulties and sometimes an injustice will be done on either side; that cannot fail to happen. Sometimes an applicant who is not entitled by law will get the pension, and sometimes an applicant who really does come within the Act will fail to prove his case and convince the officer. I do not believe there are many such cases.  There is a certain number of age cases.  I think I once told the Dáil of an instance which came under my own notice where an applicant said he could not get his baptismal certificate and in successive years he presented claims and affidavits alleging that he was seventy years of age.  Then at the end of the third year he produced his baptismal certificate which showed he was then seventy years of age.  That was a case which came under my own notice and it convinced me that the officers cannot simply act on sympathy. They have to scrutinise each affidavit and they have to see if it is not the sort of general belief that the sympathetic person will have that somebody else is seventy years, if that person is claiming a pension.</P>
    <P>Documentary evidence is talked of. We frequently have documentary evidence, adverse to the applicant, in marriage certificates.  Deputy MacBride referred to such cases.  Those certificates contain evidence which, if we cared to stand rigidly on formalities, would be evidence that could not be rebutted because there could be no documentary evidence put up against it.  Yet in such cases the Department is willing to accept the fact that people frequently understate their ages on marriage, and is prepared to disregard that evidence.</P>
    <P>Another year will show what results will come from the adoption of the recommendations of the Committee.  I <Col N="789" /> believe that as a result of that adoption all the troubles that can be got over will be got over.  In this connection I would like to express a word of thanks to the members of the Committee for the painstaking, very fair-minded and reasonable way in which they examined the whole matter and for the practical and reasonable conclusions to which they came.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister considered the question of introducing an amending Bill to the Blind Pensions Act with regard to the degree of blindness? The Minister will remember that the Committee referred to it in their report, and I think an illustration was given.  Under the Act as it stands, if you take the case of a man who was a tailor but who, after reaching the age of 56 years, became so blind that he was no longer able to continue at his trade, but still had sufficient sight to enable him, say, to fork manure into a cart, he would not be allowed to receive a pension.  Has the Minister considered the question of bringing in an amending Bill to deal with that and other matters that require to be remedied in the Act?</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £786,900 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1927, chun capital do sholáthar do Chiste na nIasachtaí Aitiúla, agus chun aisíoc do dhéanamh le Rialtas na Breataine mar gheall ar iasachtaí áitiúla atá gan íoc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £786,900 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1927, to provide capital for the Local Loans Fund and to make <Col N="790" /> repayment to the British Government in respect of local loans outstanding.</P>
    <P>This Vote, as Deputies will see, consists of three sub-heads, but really of two parts; one is the grant-in-aid to the local loans fund, and the other, repayment under two heads to the local loans fund of the British Government. So far we have been paying simply the collection to the British Government, with an arrangement for expenses.  As the result of a recent discussion with the British Government, an arrangement has been come to whereby, instead of payment of the amount collected, an annuity of £600,000 for twenty years will be paid, and the payments falling into the Exchequer after that date will go to the augmentation of our own fund.  That money will accrue to the Saorstát.  It is impossible at the moment, without further examination of very complicated figures, to say exactly what will be the net sum that will accrue to the Saorstát Exchequer as a result of that arrangement, but a very substantial sum will eventually come to us.</P>
    <P>For a considerable time the payments collected by us&mdash;at present the sum estimated is £686,000&mdash;will exceed the amount of the annuities.  In the later part of the twenty-year period the annuity will exceed the annual sum collected, but the collection will continue to be substantial for a very long time after the end of the twenty-years period.  Some of the difficulties in making the calculations are that the loans are for very many different periods, and there will be, of course, a certain number which will prove irrecoverable, but the benefit that will accrue to us will certainly run into seven figures.  I would not like to say an exact sum at the present moment, but it will be at any rate quite substantial. Our claim to an arrangement of that sort arises from the fact that the local loans fund was borrowed at about three per cent. and the money which is now coming back into the fund as a result of repayments by borrowers can be used in such a way as to earn very much more than three per cent.  Of course the money coming back represents a substantially greater capital value.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="791" /> With regard to sub-head A&mdash;£500,000 &mdash;on the 1st of April last there was a balance of approximately £49,000 in the local loans fund.  On the 1st of April, 1925&mdash;a year ago&mdash;there was in the fund £127,000.  In the Vote last year £50,000 was provided, making a total of £177,000.  That means that £132,000 were issued out of the fund during the past twelve months.  This sum was entirely in respect of land loans; that is, loans for fencing, hay sheds, and also loans under the Drainage Maintenance Act of 1924.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>How much did that amount to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was about £70,000.  It was very near that sum. There were no loans under the Dublin Reconstruction (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1916 during that period and, owing to the considerable amount of preliminary investigation that is necessary under the Arterial Drainage Act which was passed lately, no issues were made.  There was, therefore, a sum of £49,000 available in the fund on the 1st of April.  In the current financial year it is proposed to provide the £500,000 set down in the Estimate as a grant-in-aid.  That will make a total of £549,000 available for loans to be sanctioned during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amounts required will be approximately as follows, on the basis of the work which has been done during the past year: £182,000 Land Loans; £97,000 under the Drainage Maintenance Act of 1924; £20,000 under the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925.  Deputies will see that this latter sum is very small, but the difficulty of making schemes, of surveying rivers and districts, and of going through all the formalities are such that the amount which it would be possible to spend in this summer under the Arterial Drainage Act will not be large.  A very substantial sum may be spent the summer after next.  During this summer the necessary preliminary work can be done.  Deputies, I think, should realise that we cannot afford to have unduly extravagant drainage schemes.  The cost of carrying them out will, in the <Col N="792" /> main, be chargeable on the proprietors of the land.  We cannot afford to have schemes done in an expensive manner or schemes that are too dear.  Under the Dublin Reconstruction Act of 1916 there will be £25,000.  Under the new item already mentioned it is proposed to give loans to local authorities which undertake work in the interests of public health, sewage works, water works, and undertakings of that kind.  It is proposed to give loans under that head of about £225,000.  Up to the 31st March last £143,000 had been sanctioned for Land Loans.  Applications for these loans are coming in daily. The average amount of them is about £100.  They are given, as Deputies know, for the purposes I have mentioned&mdash;erection of hay-barns, farm dwellings, out-offices, roads, fences, hedging, etc.  This, I think, provides a very important facility for small farmers who could not otherwise obtain money for the purpose of improving their land.  We anticipate that during the present year about £139,000 for this year and last.  In this respect we are simply asking for sufficient to enable the Fund to meet the liabilities which will be undertaken during the year.  If Deputy Cooper's amendment were to be accepted, a very substantial reduction would have to follow on these particular loans, because we could not manage to provide a sum anywhere like £143,000.  I suggest that they are a very useful thing for farmers.  It is money well and profitably spent from the point of view of the country.  So far as the Drainage Maintenance and Arterial Drainage Acts are concerned, there is a statutory obligation on the State to lend money for these purposes, and unless we were to hold up the schemes which are ready, particularly in regard to the Drainage Maintenance Act, and which will be undertaken or are already in progress, we must provide the money.</P>
    <P>The new departure in regard to the Local Loans Fund is the decision to open it for the purpose of making public health loans.  We are providing £225,000.  Under the old system, loans to local bodies were quite commonly made from this fund, but I think that <Col N="793" /> owing to the attitude of the banks, which I am not criticising in any way, it is particularly necessary at the present time that we should open the fund for this purpose and enable work to be carried out.  The banks are not, I think, willing to go beyond fifteen years in any case.  Very frequently they will only go as far as ten years, and if the loan is to be repaid by a local authority within such a short period as that, it means that the work very often has to be postponed altogether. The alternative is that it can only be done when the particular district can manage to make some sort of a case and get portion of a relief grant to help them along.  That has been known to be done.  For the past ten years the type of work that I mentioned has been very much held up. In view of these circumstances, I do not think that the sum of £225,000 is excessive.  Even now, without any money having been voted, and without any definite announcement having been made to the local authorities that we were prepared to lend to them, we have received a couple of applications for sums totalling £26,500.  I have no doubt that once this Vote is passed and the knowledge reaches local authorities we will have very large numbers of applications.  It is much more desirable that these works should be done and should be made possible by the granting of a loan, than that we should have these local authorities competing for relief grants.  The work will be more satisfactorily done under these grants, and I think it is more desirable in every way.  It may be possible that the fund will not actually require to spend all these sums during the year. But the arrangement in regard to the Local Loans Fund has always been that no sanctions are given beyond the amount that the fund had actually in hand or that was actually available for it for the carrying out of the work. We think that that is a sound principle. If there is any small sum more than is required it may not be paid over to the fund until the end of the year, and it certainly will be used up very early in the beginning of the following year.  There will be no such thing as substantial sums lying in the <Col N="794" /> fund and awaiting disbursement.  As a matter of fact, I think it may cause some difficulty&mdash;in discriminating in regard to the applications&mdash;to carry on with even the sum that has been asked for.  However, we think that, on the whole, this will suffice.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may ask whether we will give loans for houses.  That question has been given a certain amount of consideration, but it has not been decided yet that it would be desirable to give loans for housing.  One of the reasons is that at any rate we will have to be prepared to advance very large sums, very much larger sums than are contemplated at the present time.  I recognise that the question of housing must be faced and faced before very long, and that in addition to anything else that we may do for housing it will be necessary later on to make advances to local authorities, advances for reasonably long terms in order to enable them to pursue the housing programme. I think it is desirable, perhaps, to leave that change in regard to the Local Loans Fund over until we have raised the next loan if we need one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to ask for some information in connection with the amount that is to be paid annually to Great Britain.  The Minister has not given to the House the amount of local loans outstanding when that arrangement was made.  In my opinion, that amount was practically gilt-edged because from my experience these loans in the past have been promptly repaid and the loss on them is practically <Col N="795" /> nil.  I do not think it would be even five per cent.  In order to ascertain whether the £600,000 payable for twenty years is a reasonable amount, we ought, I think, to have the information that I have asked for from the Minister.  If the Minister could tell us the amount that was outstanding at the time that bargain was made we would be able to appreciate its value.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputies will agree with me&mdash;except Deputy Wilson&mdash;that an increase in a Vote from £50,000 to £500,000 requires some explanation, and that on the surface of this Vote no very obvious explanation was available.  I find, however, that on the whole my calculation has agreed very closely with the Minister's.  I had <Col N="797" /> overlooked £25,000 for Dublin reconstruction. I am not sure that I was not right in overlooking it, because it was to be spent last year and it may not be spent this year.  I did not realise that £50,000 last year was a serious under-estimate and that land loans alone came to nearly double that £50,000.  Taking those two factors into account, I go very near the Minister, but when I drafted this amendment there was an unexplained increase, and I thought that unexplained increase was due to the fact of a new introduction, the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, which had to be provided for.  I was very doubtful whether the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, was going to cost an expenditure of £200,000 or £300,000. It is not going to do it.  The Minister's estimate is £20,000 and that is about my estimate, but that Act is not being taken up so universally.  The plans for enforcing it have not been drawn up so promptly that we shall have to provide a very large sum of money for the purpose of enforcing that Act.  So far I go with the Minister; so far I think my amendment, which was put down nearly two months ago, is justified, though I admit the justice of Deputy Wilson's criticism that this money will not be taken from current revenue: it will be a capital charge.  But I put down this amendment before even the Minister made his Budget speech.  I did not know then what he proposed to do, but he has disarmed me completely by his announcement that £225,000 is going to be provided for local authorities for the purpose of drainage, water supply and sanitation, because that is a very great need and there is no doubt that very many of the smaller local authorities in this country are very severely handicapped from the point of view of raising money. They have a treasurer, and that treasurer is the bank.  They go to that bank and ask for a loan.  I am not talking now of Rathmines and Pembroke. I am talking of the small urban councils and, in the County Dublin, of the still surviving district councils. They are absolutely in the hands of that bank who is their treasurer.  They go to that bank and that bank refuses the loan.  The only answer is that they <Col N="798" /> may be able to go to another bank, but the other banks would say: &ldquo;Why do not you go to your own treasurer?&rdquo; If the Government are going to get the smaller local authorities out of that difficulty I am not going to oppose them.  There is a great need for capital funds for water supply and sanitation. I know, at least, three areas in the County Dublin&mdash;Balbriggan, Skerries, and Swords&mdash;where that need is very serious indeed.</P>

      <P>The need there is not so serious.  I do not know what Deputy Wilson knows about my constituency. I might say: &ldquo;What about Newtownmountkennedy?&rdquo; The three most serious claims at present in my constituency are those three areas.  If, as is extremely unlikely, we have a hot summer, I think probably there might be an epidemic in Swords, because the sanitation there is extraordinarily primitive, and it is subjected to an influx of visitors from the City of Dublin every day on which bona fide travellers enjoy certain privileges, which strains its resources.  Balbriggan has some capacity industrially, and Skerries has considerable capacity from the point of view of a seaside resort. All these places need sanitation. If the Minister was really frightened by my amendment, he could not have got a better method of inducing me not to move it, as I am not going to move it, than by suggesting that he was going to put up some money to meet a need that I have recognised for the last two years existed in regard to parts of County Dublin and which I have no doubt exists in many other areas in the Saorstát.  Therefore, I do not move the amendment.</P>

I am not concerned with the desire for reducing the amount in any respect, but I want to draw attention, particularly, to the question of arterial drainage.  I feel that this question of arterial drainage <Col N="799" /> has been held back with some design. It must be that there are not sufficient officials to put the thing into proper operation or that there is some design at the back of it.  Why is it that there should be such a delay when the Bill has been passed and when it has been ordered that it should be given effect to?  When these schemes are sanctioned by county councils and sent forward to the authorities here, why is there such a delay in putting them into effect?  The question at the present time is one of extreme urgency, and the delay in putting the Act into operation is a thing that I cannot, for the life of me, understand.  I am aware of a number of schemes that have been mapped, planned and sent forward after being sanctioned by the county councils, and the promoters have been told that there is no expectation that any of these works will be undertaken during the present year.</P>

I am sure the Minister must be aware that it is well-nigh impossible for local authorities to get loans for houses at the present time and quite impossible for any authority, no matter how efficiently it may manage its business, to get a loan for more than fifteen years.  I am a member of the Rathmines Urban District Council, where <Col N="800" /> the rates are 12/6 and where one penny in the £ raises £800.  We approached a certain bank, which is our treasurer, and asked for a loan of £25,000 for housing, but the most we could get from the bank was £15,000, and that only after very considerable pressure. I think a local authority where the rates are only 12/6 in the £ and where a rate of a penny raises £800, ought to get some better facilities for housing than that.  I would like to ask the Minister for Finance whether he has considered the question of bringing some pressure to bear on the banks with a view to their providing better facilities for housing than they are apparently prepared to provide at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister, in connection with this matter of local loans, what is the basis on which local loans are made.  As I understand it, it is three times the valuation, or three times the annuity, as the case may be.  Even taking that, and it is very small in many cases, the amount that will be made available to any of our smaller farmers is very small, and will do very little indeed. If a small farmer is anxious, at the present time, to improve his buildings, to construct a hay-house or anything like that, the Minister can understand that a man with a valuation of, say, £15 or £20 cannot obtain a loan that will enable him to do what he wants to do.  I think, from that point of view, the Minister should give consideration to the position of the particular individual, the integrity of the man, the possible capacity of the man to repay, and his standing.  Where it is shown clearly that the loan is wanted for a specific purpose and that the amount which the man can obtain under the present arrangement is not sufficient to enable him to carry out this work, there are grounds, and very good grounds, for making a larger advance than is given.  I have some experience of people wanting loans in this respect, and I know that the amount they sought, or the amount they could obtain was not sufficient to enable them to do the constructional work they wanted to carry out.  Many very industrious people are prevented from <Col N="801" /> making improvements for this reason. I do not urge, at all, that the loans should be advanced indiscriminately or advanced to people whose capacity to pay, or whose willingness to pay is questionable.</P>
      <P>Where it comes under the notice of the Department that the individual making application for a loan is thrifty and industrious, I think that ought to be taken into account and that the scheme should be more elastic than it is at present.</P>

      <P>I should like if the Minister would inform us whether he contemplates putting into force the Glebe Loans Act.  That was an Act which was in operation some years ago, but it ceased to operate, for what reason I do not know.  I do not know very much about the working of the Act myself, but clergymen who are anxious to build new houses would like to know if it is the intention to bring the Act into force.</P>

      <P>The Minister told us that under the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1924, a certain sum was advanced. I should like to know if he could give us any indication as to how this money was distributed and whether, in his calculation of £92,000 he has included all the work to be carried out under this sub-head?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the whole amount will be covered during the present year or not under the Act, but the greater part of it will be.  I think the greater number of the districts which had fallen into dilapidation will be restored as a result of this year's work.  I cannot give the Deputy now a list of the districts where work was done, but I could furnish him with that information later. Work was very widely distributed over the country.  Quite a number of counties were served.  I do not know whether any work was done in County Cavan, but there was one district done in County Monaghan.  The limitation that has been in existence was, for a tenant, five times the valuation of the judicial rent and, for a tenant-purchaser, seven times the valuation.  It <Col N="802" /> is the latter, of course, that will apply. We are contemplating some change in these limits.  We think the limits are, as Deputy Baxter said, too restrictive and rigid.  But it will be necessary to have some limit.  We are, as I have said, considering the making of some change.</P>
      <P>I know very little about the Glebe Loans Act.  I understand it was for the purpose of building or repairing houses for clergymen.  In the present estimate we are making no provision for that.  It it a matter about which I must confess complete ignorance at present.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the answer given to Deputy Baxter in connection with the alteration of limits, would the Minister also consider the advisability of reviewing the limitations on local authorities?

      <P>Referring to the answer given to Deputy Baxter, does the Minister's remarks apply to the total valuation of a person's holding or is it only the valuation of the holding on which the building is erected?  I understand that, heretofore, the valuation taken into consideration was only that of the holding on which the building was situate and that, where a person had a second or a third holding, the valuation of these holdings was not taken into consideration at all.  If the Minister could extend the rule to all the holdings in one's possession, I think it would be a great boon to many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, the calculation refers to the benefited holding. The Deputy will see that there would be difficulties in extending that to include all holdings that a particular person might own.  A holding might be sold which would, perhaps, be charged with work done on an entirely different holding.  You would, in that way, arrive at a position which would be very undesirable as regards charges on land.  I do not think it would be at all wise to have the loan secured on land other than the land benefited&mdash;the land on which the building was erected, on <Col N="803" /> which drainage was carried out or roads made.  No change could wisely be made in that direction.</P>
      <P>In regard to the local authorities, I have not examined the position at all. That is a matter that would require investigation.  At present, nothing is contemplated in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephMcGoldr" hpid="Mr. McGOLDRICK Mr. McGOLDRICK">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if he considers it fair to adhere to the £7 valuation, as the Board of Works are doing, before any money will be advanced for drainage in the case of counties like Tirconaill, where the average valuation of holdings is only £8?  Does he not think that this rule is going to prevent the people of counties like Tirconaill from getting any benefit under this drainage scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a holding like that is an uneconomic holding and would not be security for the loan or for any charge other than the charges already on it.  That, at any rate, is the ground on which loans are being refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephMcGoldr" hpid="Mr. McGOLDRICK Mr. McGOLDRICK">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a holding of £7 valuation in Tirconaill is of more real value than a holding of double the size in any other county, on account of the district being so congested?  In fact, when a holding of that sort is sold in Tirconaill, it brings in at least double the amount of money that a holding of similar size would bring in in any other county that I know.  Why, therefore, does the Minister continue to refuse to these small holders the benefit of this scheme?  I contend that these small holdings are absolutely economic. Why does the Minister confine the advantages of this drainage scheme to holdings over £7 and refuse to allow holdings, say, of £5 valuation to derive any benefit, when, so far at least as Tirconaill is concerned, they are economic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will say whether he proposes to do anything in the way of inducing the banks to give greater facilities for housing loans than they are prepared to give at present?</P>

      <P>The only answer I can make is that there is a Banking Commission sitting and it will make various recommendations.  I do not know whether it will make any recommendation on that head or not.  I have already indicated that a time must come&mdash;at no distant date&mdash;when the Local Loans Fund must be opened for housing loans.  I do not know that I could bring any pressure to bear on the banks.</P>
      <P>The question Deputy McGoldrick has raised presents some difficulty.  The cost of administering very small loans is often excessive, and I could not promise to make any change at the moment.  I will, however, look into the matter.  This question has been often before the Board of Works, and the present policy was adopted after a good deal of consideration.  I would be prepared to review the facts, but I do not know that I would be able to agree that a change was desirable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,447,000, be granted to complete <Col N="805" /> the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1927, for payments in respect of destruction of, or injuries to, property within the period 21st January, 1919, to 12th May, 1923, inclusive, under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923 to 1926, and otherwise; and in respect of damage to, or loss of property and payments by way of indemnification or recoupment under the Indemnity Act, 1924, and for payment of grants awarded on the recommendation of the Property Losses (Ireland) Committee, 1916, as compensation for buildings destroyed in Dublin during Easter Week, 1916.</P>
    <P>The first sub-head in this Vote deals with pre-Truce damage.  The Compensation (Ireland) Commission, which issued awards in respect of pre-Truce damage, has now ceased to function. Consequently, there cannot be any further sum of any great magnitude required under this head.  It would be possible for this sub-head to contain the final sum asked for in this regard but for the fact that there is a substantial sum, amounting to £370,000 approximately, which will not be payable until the claimants have complied with reinstatement conditions.  That will mean that the payments under this sub-head may still be spread over a considerable period, though, in most cases, I think, reinstatement has actually commenced.  Under this sub-head, there is a sum of £50,000, as will be seen from Part III of the Estimate, payable to the Commissioners of Public Works for the restoration of barracks and other property owned by the Government or held on repairing leases. In so far as the Compensation (Ireland) Commission's awards are unconditional, it is expected that they will be completely disposed of before the end of the current financial year.  The clearance of awards is proceeding steadily and I think no delays will occur.  Up to the present, the conditional awards have borne interest at the rate of 5 per cent.  This may have been a factor in causing the applicants to defer building operations.  It was <Col N="806" /> decided a considerable time ago, by agreement with the British Government, that as from 1st November next the interest will cease to run.  Therefore, I think it may be expected that those to whom awards have been made will proceed to reinstate and draw their money.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head B provision is made for certain expenses of the Compensation (Ireland) Commission, which concluded its labours before the end of the financial year, but these are expenses which it was not possible to discharge within the past financial year. Sub-head C deals with awards and reports under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923.  The claims under that Act have now been disposed of in court, with the exception of about a thousand cases which are still to be heard.  About 900 reports and decrees have been lodged with the Department of Finance, but they have not yet been discharged.</P>
    <P>The amount required to discharge unconditional awards during the current year is computed at some £320,000.  These are awards, generally speaking, for furniture or property other than buildings destroyed.  About £200,000 of this will be paid in cash, and the remainder will be paid in securities.  The amount earmarked in respect of rebuilding awards already lodged and not yet expended is about £770,000.  A considerable sum of this, probably £500,000, will be paid before the 31st March next.  This sub-head also contains £150,000 for the payment of the cash portion of the 10 per cent. increase authorised by the Damage to Property (Compensation) (Amendment) Act, 1926, and, as will be seen from Part III. of the Estimate, a sum of £100,000 is included for repayment to the Commissioners of Public Works for the restoration of barracks and Government property damaged or destroyed in the post-Truce period.</P>
    <P>There will remain to be expended at the end of the year some small sum, perhaps, in respect of awards not subject to reinstatement conditions, and a more substantial amount in respect of awards subject to reinstatement conditions, which will not by that time have been complied with.  The total number <Col N="807" /> of awards so far discharged is about 16,700.  The total amount paid up to the 31st March last was £1,695,000 in cash and £978,000 in securities.  The amount paid in cash last year was £737,000.</P>
    <P>This fell very much short of the Estimate, which was £1,750,000, and it fell short for various reasons.  In the first place, the claims were not disposed of by the courts as rapidly as might have been expected because rebuilding proceeded more slowly than was anticipated, and the Estimate was prepared in the earlier part of last year and was based on a somewhat higher estimate of the total burden of compensation than the amount is in reality likely to be.  Of the claims not yet heard, the great bulk are in the East and West Ridings of Cork, and in the County of Tirconaill.  In each of these areas some 250 to 300 claims are still outstanding, but it is expected that all, or practically all, of these will have been dealt with by the end of the next month.  There was a great accumulation of arrears in the Midland area, but an assistant circuit judge was appointed and he has practically disposed of all the claims outstanding there.  Some 90 appeals against decrees are outstanding and it is expected that these appeals will also soon be disposed of.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of awards&mdash; some 200&mdash;have been made but have not yet been lodged with the Department of Finance.  In some cases the judges may not have got an opportunity of trying them, and in others the clerks of the peace or the applicants' solicitors may have delayed transmitting them.  Of the awards lodged and not discharged about 100 are decrees and 600 are reports.  The decrees were all lodged quite recently, and I think that there will be very little delay in discharging any of them. The reports are a different matter. These reports are for ex gratia payments. They are cases in which a certain discretionary power is vested in the Minister for Finance, and when the Act was being framed they were recognised as being the kind of cases in which inquiry might be necessary and in which there would be elements of <Col N="808" /> doubt which ought not and could not very well be determined by the courts. That was the reason why we did not, in drawing up the Act, provide for decrees, but provided instead that there should be reports.</P>
    <P>Rebuilding, as I have already stated, has not gone on as rapidly as we had hoped it would.  In the case of O'Connell Street, where there was £285,000 awarded for reinstatement, only about £76,000 worth of reinstatement has as yet actually been carried out, but in recent months there has been a great speeding up, as Deputies may have seen.  On the Gresham Hotel a great deal of work has been done, and when it is completed it will account for £74,000 of the reinstatement awards, and I think the Hammam Hotel is also speeding up.  As regards sub-head D, very little railway compensation is outstanding. Such amounts as are outstanding relate to substantial buildings, like hotels, which were destroyed, or other important works, in regard to the reinstatement of which the companies may have had some difficulty in making up their minds.  We believe that all items of railway compensation will be disposed of before the end of the present financial year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E deals principally with expenses incurred in the course of investigating claims for instalments of rebuilding grants.  Sub-head F provides for awards to be made under the Indemnity Act of 1924.  The Committee set up under the Act are making, I think, very substantial progress with the claims submitted to them.  The total number of claims lodged was approximately 5,000, of which approximately 3,150 have been disposed of, 1,000 being ruled as outside the scope of the terms of reference.  The total amount paid to the end of the last financial year was £38,351.  It is believed that the Committee will have finished this work and that all claims will have been paid by the end of the present year.  In respect to sub-head G, when the Saorstát Government assumed liability for repayment in respect of 1916 property losses, the amount ascertained to be outstanding was approximately £45,000.  That estimate was found to be very high, and <Col N="809" /> to include certain items in respect of which liability could not be proved by the applicants, so that although about £17,900 has been paid, it is estimated that only £5,000, or very little more, is likely to be paid in respect of that. However, a sum of £2,000 will still be required for payments to solicitors for the reconstruction of deeds and other documents destroyed in 1916.  The total of £6,000 which is in the present Estimate will probably almost suffice to meet the last of these claims.  I move to report progress.</P>
