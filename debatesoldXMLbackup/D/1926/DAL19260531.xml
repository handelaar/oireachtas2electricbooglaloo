      <P>I move that the Railways (Existing Officers and Servants) Bill, 1926, do now pass.</P>
      <P>There are two points which need reference. One was raised by Deputy Johnson as to the effect of having the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; where there is reference made to &ldquo;service with the amalgamated company or any amalgamating or absorbed company.&rdquo;  I have taken legal advice on the matter and I am informed that there is no possibility of the phrase being interpreted in the way Deputy Johnson fears and that although the word is used it will definitely include service with the amalgamated company or with an amalgamating or absorbed company.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would give me some indication of where it is in the Bill as amended on Report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>On page 4, line 10.  It came in twice, in connection with amendments Nos. 5 and 6 and the wording is: &ldquo;for every completed year of his service with the amalgamated company or any amalgamating or absorbed company.&rdquo;  The Deputy feared that that might separate these periods of service and that they would not be counted together.  I am informed that that is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a further question as to whether there should not be an amendment in regard to a long amendment proposed by Deputy Johnson on the last section, in lieu of which a certain amendment proposed by myself was accepted and now stands as Section 8. Deputy Johnson asked if there could not be some addition made so as to <Col N="2460" /> ensure that the proceedings before the arbitrator would be open court proceedings. I am told the regulations that were made by the arbitrator prior to his resignation provide, among other things, that there should be requisite notice given to the parties, and any safeguards that might be necessary by having proceedings insisted on as open court proceedings are secured by the regulations.  I cannot say that these regulations will be kept on by whoever is the arbitrator in future, but I presume that either the same or some similar regulations will be made. The point the Deputy set out to secure in having open court proceedings is, in fact, secured by the regulations made by the arbitrator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to register my personal protest on the Final Stage of this reactionary and confiscatory measure.  In the most emphatic manner I protest against this Bill being passed.  Those who voted for the Second Reading voted on the understanding that the Bill would not be applied retrospectively.  At a later stage the Minister, unfortunately, secured the votes of the majority of Deputies for a qualified undertaking on the assurance that he gave on Second Reading.  Various amendments were put forward on this side which, had they been accepted, might improve what appeared to us from the very beginning to be a very bad Bill, a Bill which aimed at confiscating rights given to railway servants who might become redundant under the 1924 Act, and who would be entitled to certain compensation terms.  One amendment was calculated to make possible the payment of pensions at periods similar to periods at which the railway servants, previous to their retirement, were being paid their wages or salaries.  The Minister turned down that amendment on the ground that it would not be convenient for the company. Apparently, the only reason for turning it down was to enable the company to retain, for one year, the sum that would be due to a redundant official in order that they might make use of the money for whatever purpose they considered most convenient and suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2461" /> One Deputy on the Farmers' Benches referred to the fact that the railwaymen had secured, through the original Act, terms which were not justified, and indicated that the only grounds for the retention of terms not justified were that these men had given service during the pre-Truce period and they should not be treated in the manner proposed under the amending Bill.  So far as the railwaymen are concerned they have not claimed, and are not claiming&mdash;I state this emphatically&mdash;anything over and above what they are entitled to; they claim nothing beyond what other servants of the State have claimed as a result of other similar measures.  We passed here a Local Government Act which gave certain compensation terms to redundant poor law officials, provided that no suitable positions could be found for them following their dismissal as a result of Union amalgamation.  No Bill was brought forward to repeal the provisions of the Act giving certain terms to those people.  In the same way terms were given to pre-Truce civil servants who refused to act under this Government, and these terms have not, so far, been repealed.  The only case in which power is sought to repeal the compensation terms given to any servants, public or private, as a result of measures passed here, is this case affecting railway servants.</P>
    <P>I recognise that it is useless, at this stage, to say anything that might tend to alter the mind of the Minister in regard to this measure.  It must be quite obvious to the Minister, if he reads in the Official Report the speeches made on the Second and Third Stages of the Bill, that even he was not quite conversant with the actual meaning of the Bill that he now asks the Dáil to pass. That will be dealt with in another place in a more effective way.  So far as I am concerned, I look forward to the time when the Seanad, treating the whole matter on its merits, will prevent the Minister from securing through this Bill things apparently which he did not himself recognise when he first brought the Bill before this House.  I oppose, in the most emphatic way, the passage of the Bill through its final stage, and I leave it to Deputies who <Col N="2462" /> vote for the final stage of this Bill to justify before their constituency what they have done, especially in giving a vote in favour of retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated he had no responsibility for the appointment of an arbitrator, following on the resignation of the arbitrator who dealt with the cases that came before him, on the basis of the original Act.  It is very significant, whoever is responsible, that no arbitrator has been appointed to decide in such cases as would come before him pending the passage of this measure.  I take it that the failure to appoint an arbitrator is due to the fact that the Government were not anxious to prejudice the position, or allow decisions to be come to under the existing law in the cases listed for hearing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>Does the Deputy realise what his statement means: that the Chief Justice who appoints the arbitrator has not appointed him for some reason connected with the Minister's policy?  I am sure the Deputy does not mean that, and, if he does not mean it, then he ought to make that clear.  The Chief Justice appoints the arbitrator, and the Deputy says it is significant that no arbitrator has been appointed since the first one resigned the position, and that that is because the Government does not want something or other. The meaning of that is quite plain. Perhaps the Deputy would like to reconsider it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to look at it from this point of view: that no decision, under the existing law, has been come to, by the arbitrator, since the 25th March, a date before this particular measure was brought in.  I leave it to whoever is responsible to take upon himself the responsibility for not having appointed somebody, or other, to the position vacated by the arbitrator who resigned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I must interrupt to say that the Government neither directly nor indirectly approached any <Col N="2463" /> member of the Judiciary in connection with this or any other matter touching the office.  I do not know if Deputy Davin quite realises the danger of his statement getting publicity and of being believed by people unacquainted with, or by people who do not wish to acquaint themselves with, the present state of the Government's administration in the country.  It would be a most dangerous thing if any person, outside this House, should get the impression, or if the suspicion were to arise, that such thing, as might be inferred from Deputy Davin's speech, could occur.  I strongly suggest to the Deputy that he should make it perfectly clear that he is not casting any imputation upon the Judiciary.  If he has in mind that any member of the Judiciary would be open to suggestions of that sort, it would be his duty to come here and call public attention to it, and to have a resolution tabled to have that particular member of the Judiciary dismissed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Deputy to understand I do not mind what he says in criticism of the Government, but I do mind what he says in criticism of persons who have not the opportunity of defending themselves, and who, even if they were to defend themselves, would still leave a certain section of the community with the suspicion that there was some under-current or some truth in the inferences that could be drawn from the Deputy's statement.  That is a very grave danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The arbitrator, in the first instance, was appointed as the result of an application made by an individual who was declared a redundant official, and who desired to have his claim dealt with by an arbitrator appointed by the Chief Justice.  The Minister said when the arbitrator resigned, there remained over 180 cases to be heard.  He also made the statement that there were 235 applications submitted for hearing under the existing <Col N="2464" /> law somewhere about the middle of April.  Somebody is responsible for the fact that no arbitrator has been since appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay is about four weeks.  It may seem a strange thing to say, but I am not so much concerned with the unfairness to the Chief Justice or to anybody. The Deputy is being unfair to himself and to the whole system of government in the country when he makes the suggestion that he has made.  The Chief Justice is well able to survive any such statements made about him, but the ideas of government are not able to survive them so well.  If a party on either side asks for the appointment of an arbitrator then, surely, the matter is quite simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>It was assumed, that as a result of the retirement of the arbitrator who was first appointed by the Chief Justice, somebody would be automatically appointed by the Chief Justice to replace the individual first appointed, and that person would be charged with the responsibility under the existing law, not under the terms of this amending Bill, of dealing with the cases that would, in the ordinary course, come before him.  My protest is against the non-appointment of an arbitrator because that failure prejudices the cases that will come before his court from being dealt with under the existing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy realises that he is perfectly entitled to that inference.  The other inference was much more dangerous, that influence came from the Government to prevent the appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>If the President suggests that, then I certainly withdraw <Col N="2465" /> any such statement.  I stated emphatically that the introduction and passing of this measure is nothing short of&mdash;and is calculated to be nothing else&mdash;than a vote of censure on the original arbitrator for giving decisions according to the law passed here in the cases that went before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The arbitrator acted in a judicial capacity. He decided on the law as he found it before him in accordance with rules judges and arbitrators observe, and in accordance with rules that judges and arbitrators must observe.  The Minister is entitled to the opinion that the decisions of the arbitrator, while in accordance with the law as the arbitrator found it, were not in accordance with the intentions of the Oireachtas, or with the intentions of the Minister. These are two completely different things: the law as the judge finds it and the law as we meant to make it. If we come in here and change the law, as we frequently shall&mdash;we may as well clear the position up at this early stage&mdash;because it turned out that the law is something different from what we thought it was, that is no reflection on the judges whatever.  This point has been raised before.  If I remember the Minister's original speech correctly, the words, I think, he used were that the arbitrator was coerced into certain decisions.  That is an exact statement of the case, and it reflects in no way and in no sense on the arbitrator. It simply reflects, if you like, upon the way in which the law was made, and not on the person who interpreted the law in accordance with the rules of interpretation.  The Deputy should disabuse his mind once and for all of any idea that the arbitrator has been censured in debate in this House or that this Bill is intended to be a censure on the arbitrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason that I came to that conclusion was that I asked the Minister during the Second Reading of the Bill what reasons had been put before him by the Railway Company with respect to this amending measure, and he told me that he was only concerned with it from the point of view of the railway users.  When I put before <Col N="2466" /> the House certain salaries of the higher officials, and certain pensions given to certain officials, which were not quite in keeping with the maximum laid down in the measure, the Minister answered&mdash;and I think Deputies will bear me out in this&mdash;that it was no business of his.  But it is his business, apparently, to see that junior or subordinate officials of the Railway Company will be deprived of rights given them under a previous Act.  When attention was drawn to cases of higher officials who were given pension rights by agreement between themselves and the Board, in excess of the maximum laid down, the Minister said it was not his business.  I think the Minister will at least admit that is the case.  On the Second Reading the Minister said that he had got no statement from the Railway Company in support of this measure, but, during the Committee Stage, he trotted out freak cases which must have been given to him by someone &ldquo;in the know&rdquo; in order to justify him in keeping certain clauses in this Bill. That is the reason I made the statement, and, while I recognise that it is no use to proceed any further with protests against this measure, I will have to call upon Deputies to register their opinions on its merits and justify themselves in making it retrospective, when the Minister on the Second Reading said that was not intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I associate myself with the protest against this Bill being passed in a form which has the effect of depriving railway servants of their rights under the last Act.  I do so, particularly, because many of the employees who had rights under the last Act, and who were proceeding in accordance with the law embodied in that Act, have been frustrated by circumstances over which they had no control.  Many of these men were dismissed or reduced during the last year. The cases I read out the other day had reference to men who were dismissed. Claims were made in some cases as early as May of last year following up to December.  Delays in respect to agreement about compensation occurred. In the end those delays resulted in the final appeal to the arbitrator. The non-functioning of the <Col N="2467" /> arbitrator for at least two months has resulted in depriving these men of their rights under the existing law. Whatever may have been the cause of that delay it was not the fault of the men themselves.  They suffered a certain loss as they had certain rights under the existing statute.  They took all the steps it was for them to take and had a decision been given in their cases that decision would have been based on the existing statute.  Now because of the delay and of the action of this House in bringing forward new legislation they are deprived of their rights under this statute which rights in the ordinary course of procedure ought to have been established by judgement given.  I think that is a distinct violation of all equity and the Dáil ought not to give its approval by passing the Third Reading of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have objected already, and I object again, to any phrase being used as to any qualification put upon any pledge I gave with regard to retrospection.  I believe I sensed the opinion of the House correctly. I myself was responsible for only one amendment in that direction &mdash;the amendment deleting the clause. There was another amendment brought forward which I said I liked. I think five amendments were brought forward with regard to the substituted clause and I found, by clear statement from three people, who had spoken definitely against retrospection, that the clause now in the Bill met with their approval and what they had meant when they spoke as they did speak on Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the arbitrator, I would like to clear up that point by a very definite statement.  I have never made the suggestion&mdash;I do not think anybody else made it until Deputy Davin more or less implied it to-day&mdash; that the arbitrator had not discharged his functions as the terms of the original Third Schedule required.  I was always careful, as has been pointed out by the Ceann Comhairle, to use the phrase that the arbitrator was &ldquo;coerced by law&rdquo; into doing certain things.  When Deputy McGoldrick, on Committee Stage, slipped into the use <Col N="2468" /> of another phrase, I stood up at once and corrected him.  I had his assent to the correction that what he meant was&mdash;and what pretty well everybody meant&mdash;not the way the arbitrator made awards, but that the position was such that the arbitrator had to make certain decisions according to the strict terms of the original Third Schedule. Only when the terms of that Third Schedule had been interpreted by a skilled lawyer did it become possible to say that what was set out in the Third Schedule was not what the House intended to pass.  Nobody has ever suggested that the arbitrator in any way failed to discharge his duties as the old Third Schedule required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out, for the information of the Minister, that the original Bill would not have had quite so easy a passage had it not been that we recognised, on this side of the House, that the Schedule did give the rights which the arbitrator decided it gave?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson's followers have gone back even on the demands they made under the old Railways Act, because their latest statement, as circulated to Deputies, was that they only required what was in the Third Schedule to the English Act.  They have got a great deal more than the corresponding schedule in the corresponding English legislation gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what circular the Minister is referring to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>A circular sent out by a great many people who believed they were going to suffer under the amending Bill.  The circular was sent, I think, to every member of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has tied the hands of the arbitrator in a way that the hands of the arbitrator had not been tied in the English Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does not the Deputy follow the argument and try and answer it, if he must interrupt? Deputy Johnson says that the <Col N="2469" /> original Railways Act would not have got the passage it did through this House if it had not been realised by Deputies on the opposite side that it gave the powers which the arbitrator decided it gave.  I say, if that be a fact, that some of those who are interested in the Railways Bill have recently gone back on the Third Schedule of the Railways Act, because they are not claiming now what was in the Third Schedule of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin thinks that I was holding all sorts of meetings with the railway company, while stating that I was acting only in the interest of the railway users.  The astounding proof of that is I was able to bring before the Dáil what the Deputy described as &ldquo;freak cases.&rdquo; Where could I have got those cases except from the railway company? That was how the Deputy put it.  Does the Deputy think that I would bring forward legislation, founded on certain judgments given, without having seen those judgments, or does he suggest that it is not open to me to get those judgments?  I got those judgments where I had a perfect right to get them, and I did not get them in any way through the railway company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a registrar and staff?  Is it possible to apply to the registrar or his staff for information as to the cases pending, as to cases that have been sent in&mdash;cases in which awards have been made, and cases still hanging fire?  Might I not argue in the same way: Deputy Davin has particulars of all these cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of a considerable number of them.  Might it not be suggested that Deputy Davin, who is supposed to represent the interests <Col N="2470" /> of the railwaymen, was hobnobbing with the railway company behind their backs, since he was able to get those particulars?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much more ignorant as regards the cases that have to come before the arbitrator than the Minister.  I pay him that compliment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two ways in which one can be ignorant&mdash; one, not getting information, and the other making wrong use of the information one gets.  Reference has been made to the higher officials.  This amending Bill is designed to deal with the Third Schedule of the Act.  This Third Schedule has nothing to do with the higher officials referred to.  The question of the higher officials is for the proprietors of the railway company. If they, in their judgment, pass censure on the directors for having made those absurd payments&mdash;absurd, as Deputy Davin alleges&mdash;then they will suffer for it in certain ways.  I have indicated that these sums may come before the Tribunal, if they are a proper charge on revenue.  They may be looked into by the Railway Tribunal, and certain facts may be brought out.  But as far as I am concerned, I have very little to do with the higher officials.  I should like if Deputy Davin would get from the railway company some indication of the total sums involved as between those affected by the Third Schedule and those higher officials who are not affected by it.  It might make an interesting comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson has made a statement, without the slightest shred of evidence, regarding delay.  He jumps from that statement of delay to an allegation of either deliberate holding-up by the railway company or else negligence on their part.  I say there are other parties to whom blame may be imputed.  It is not for me to say which of them is blameworthy.  But Deputy Johnson has not completely proved the case he sought to make as regards delay.  There would need to be a great deal more evidence before there could be any acceptance on the part of the House of the inference which Deputy Johnson seeks to make that the railway <Col N="2471" /> company deliberately held up cases from going before the arbitrators.</P>

    <Title>IMMATURE SPIRITS (RESTRICTION) BILL, 1926&mdash;SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The object of the Bill is to amend the Act of 1915 by substituting a period of at least five years.  It means that in future spirits cannot be delivered for ordinary use as beverage unless they are warehoused for at least five years.  There are certain classes of spirits to which the Act of 1915 does not apply and the present Act does not apply either:&mdash;Spirits delivered free of duty for methylation or other uses, for art or manufacture, and spirits used for the composition of mixtures or compounds, that is spirits used for the manufacture of something, for instance, such as spirits used for scientific purposes, imported Geneva and liqueurs.  It is provided in the Bill that this new restriction shall not come into force for at any rate a period of two years.  It is believed, however, that there is not the quantity of the requisite age in the country which would enable the trade to be carried on in the ordinary way, if special arrangements were not made.  Some similar concession was given in the Act of 1915.  For the future, after the passage of this Act, no spirits, subject to the exception I have mentioned, which have not been warehoused for at least five years, can be delivered for use as a beverage.</P>
      <P>At present the greater quantities of the spirits taken out of bond have been warehoused for five years, but something like fifteen and twenty per cent. of the whiskey drawn out of bond is under the five years, some of it even under four years or less.  It is generally felt and certainly this is so in the case of potstill whiskey, that whiskey ought not to go into consumption under five years.  Many believe the age should be still more mature and that it ought not to go into consumption under seven years, but it would be impossible to compel the maturing for a period of seven years at present. Distilling was interrupted during the European War, and it would upset the whole trade if a period longer than five years were to be insisted on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further extension in the period was a matter that might be considered after some years.  The position certainly is that we must, so far as we can, by legislation, see that the reputation of Irish whiskey and its character are maintained.  Competing whiskey is made in the main by a cheaper process. <Col N="2473" /> It is a whiskey consisting mostly of spirit which can be obtained at a cheaper rate and the Irish whiskey cannot compete with it on the mere basis of price.  If it can compete and hold its own, it must do it on the basis of quality and just as we have certain provisions on the Statute Book for the purpose of seeing that Irish butter and eggs are up to a certain quality, it seems to be proper and desirable, that corresponding steps should be insisted upon with regard to Irish whiskey, at any rate as far as consumption here is concerned.  No upset of any kind will be caused by this Bill.  Only some fifteen or twenty per cent. of spirits going into consumption are less than five years of age.  There are quite sufficient quantities of spirit to meet the demand, at least for five years.  At present the issue of spirits out of bond being restricted temporarily owing to the passage of this Act an undue quantity of younger spirit cannot be taken out before the Bill becomes law.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister whether he hopes to give any help to the distilling industry in the Saorstát?  It is at present almost crushed out of existence as the result of the unfair burden of taxation it has to bear.  The Minister ought to give some idea of what the future has in store for this industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the Minister in this Bill is most admirable and excellent and will be received with enthusiasm by that numerous and respectable body, the drinkers of whiskey, but I am afraid his intention is not sufficient and that there is one great obstacle towards his desire, to increase the reputation of Irish whiskey by means of a measure of this character.  The average man, when he goes into a publichouse does not ask for whiskey an t-Saorstáit, or even Saorstát whiskey.  Sometimes he asks for a particular brand, but in general he asks for Irish whiskey, and all Irish whiskey is not manufactured in the Saorstát.  There is a good deal manufactured in Northern Ireland.  Unless a similar measure is passed in Northern Ireland we shall not enhance the reputation of Irish whiskey.  I think <Col N="2474" /> the Minister wants to improve its reputation outside as well as inside Ireland and to build up an export trade.  A customer in Switzerland or France asks for Irish whiskey but does not ask for Jameson, Power or Dunville, as he does not know whether it comes from the Saorstát or from Northern Ireland.  Unless similar steps are taken in Northern Ireland we shall not get the credit we deserve for the improved quality of Irish whiskey.  It seems to me that this measure could be fitted in with the agreement made recently in London for mutual negotiation and common action.  It is our mutual duty to improve the quality of Irish whiskey and to obtain an export market.  I do not want to delay the passage of this Bill, which in its purpose is good, and I do not want to inconvenience the trade.  It is, however, an incomplete measure, and I would suggest that the Minister get in touch with the responsible authorities in Northern Ireland with a view to getting them to adopt a similar measure.  It will help both and cannot injure either.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne's question is one which he might repeat on the Finance Bill, as I do not think that it arises in connection with this Bill.  The question of taking direct action towards increasing the reputation of Irish whiskey outside is a bigger one, and is one which, perhaps, will have to be thought over a good deal.  What we feel we can do is, to increase the reputation here.  We find people complaining of the quality of whiskey here, and we are taking steps to see that there shall be no grounds for such complaint.  The question of going further is a matter that needs to be thought over.  I do not know whether anything could be done in regard to Northern Ireland.  The greater quantity of whiskey made there is patent whiskey.  If that whiskey improves at all during the three years' period, it does not improve to anything like the <Col N="2475" /> same extent as pot-still improves.  It is, in fact, a different article.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that <Col N="2477" /> this Estimate requires very little explanation, and that Deputies understand this subsidy.  The subsidy is payable at the rate of 24/6 per cwt. on sugar manufactured, and it is expected that this will provide the whole subsidy with, I should say, the exception of about £30,000, which will probably need to be voted otherwise.  The sugar company expect between 9,000 and 10,000 acres of beet this year. Deputies will remember that originally it was not expected that more than about 7,000 acres of beet would be grown in the first year, but after some time it became evident that a larger acreage could be obtained, and it was decided as a matter of policy that it would be bad business to discourage anybody in the counties interested from growing beet in the first year. Consequently all contracts were accepted. I need not now go into the prices to be paid to farmers; that has already been explained on the Bill.  The sugar will be manufactured under the supervision of the Revenue authorities, who will certify the polarisation, and suitable arrangements will be made with the sugar company for payment, whether fortnightly or weekly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a point which does not arise, except indirectly, on the Estimate, and that is to say that special arrangements have been made to supply seed to the growers.  All sugar companies insist on the beet they take being grown only from their own seed. That is not peculiar to this country; it is common to all countries, and the Irish sugar manufacturing company are supplying the seed, through retailers and direct, to the growers. They are supplying direct to all farmers who are growing on contract.  In addition, they have supplied a certain amount of seed to retailers, and that will be retailed out to people who have not signed contracts, but who, at the last moment, decided that they would grow beet.  Arrangements have also been made for giving credit to growers for fertilisers.  A complete mixture which will cost, roughly speaking, about £3 5s. per ton, is supplied on request to any farmer, and the price is deducted by the company from the payments to be made to the farmer, <Col N="2478" /> and repaid by the company to the retailer, so that the farmers are getting manures on credit.  The arrangements for payments are something like this: There is a first payment of £3 10s. per acre on singling.  There is another payment of the same amount in August, after inspection of the crop.  Of the balance, half is paid on the 15th of the month for all beets delivered during the previous month, and the final payment must be made on or before 15th February.</P>
    <P>It was found that the experiments, which were very extensively and very carefully made last year, were extremely useful.  There were about 353 centres, and four different varieties of seed were grown in each.  These centres were established in every county.  The results of these experiments have been, I should say, almost invaluable to the farmers who are now growing beet for the factory.  They established that of the four kinds of seed, two were far the best.  That was established firmly in practically every centre.  The result was that the company had the advantage of those experiments and were able to supply growers with the seed which did best. They also gave us much valuable information in connection with sugar content, yield and cultivation.  These experiments are being continued.  Certain points have not yet been fully investigated, points in respect of which sufficient information has not been yielded by the experiments, and in order to cover these points, in order to make the experiments complete, in order to get all the results which we think we ought to get for the purpose of giving advice to the growers, not only in regard to the varieties but in regard to cultivation, singling, sugar content, and a hundred and one other questions, there is a necessity that we should continue these experiments this year.  I think it likely that we will have to continue them next year and the year after, but they will gradually be becoming less expensive.  The results of these experiments will be published in pamphlet form in the course of a couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>One instructor of the Department of Agriculture is set aside for work in <Col N="2479" /> connection with the sugar factory. The company itself has two instructors, and more instructors will be employed by the company if they find it necessary.  The experiment, therefore, is beginning under excellent auspices. Growers have all the advantages of last year's experiments; they are not in the position of knowing nothing whatever about sugar beet, as grown in a new climate and under new conditions. In addition, the factory itself will probably be the most efficient and up-to-date factory in Great Britain or Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not imagine that there will be any opposition to this Vote, inasmuch as it is devoted to an experiment, the bringing into cultivation of a crop that may be remunerative for the farmers.  The Minister, when speaking on the Department's Vote, alluded to the fact that the Irish farmer is not so stupid as not to adopt new methods.  I think there is very good proof of that in the fact that 9,000 or 10,000 acres are being grown this season, although farmers had very little time to prepare for the crop.  Of course we take it that the factory will be run on the very best lines, and that it will be a success if certain conditions which obtain at present with regard to the price of sugar can be overcome. There is one point which I would like to put before the Minister &mdash;that is the necessity of having an analytical chemist to act at the factory on the farmers' behalf.  We do not want to suggest that the company or the management of the company would do anything unfair with regard to the farmers, but at the same time it would give the farmers greater confidence in the management if an official of that sort were appointed to act on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at this estimate as an amount spent on an experiment, we can give it our approval in the hope that it will prove a success. With regard to the actual amount of the estimate I want to know from the Minister on what basis is this amount calculated.  With the information now given, that we are to have between <Col N="2480" /> 9,000 and 10,000 acres of sugar beet grown this year, it seems to me that the sum down in the Vote will not be sufficient to meet the amount that will be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, we will have a supplementary Vote towards the end of the year.  I would like if the Minister would make some statement with regard to the question of freights and the cost of bringing the sugar beet from the different stations.  I know that arrangements have been made by the company with the railways whereby the sugar is being carted at reduced rates.  I would like to know, if these arrangements are permanent, what is the Railway Tribunal going to do about them, and if they are to be embodied in the findings of the Railway Tribunal at a future date.  I think it is important that farmers who are setting about growing beet at places a considerable distance from the factory should have some assurance that, if they continue to grow beet, the railway freights will not be raised on them at a later date.  There are a good many things that could be said on this Vote, but I do not think this is the time.  The matter was pretty well thrashed out when the Act dealing with sugar beet was passed.  Certainly I am inclined to think that this subsidy will have to be continued after the expiration of the period in the Act.  I say that because I cannot see how the manufacture of sugar can be an economic proposition in view of the great depreciation of sugar in the world market, and in view of the over-production of sugar, generally speaking, which has taken place all over the world.  So far has this gone that cane-sugar producers, as in the case of rubber, are restricting their output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the sugar market will improve before the end of the subsidy period, and I believe that the advantages which may be gained for agriculture generally in the way of the improvement in the farmers' methods of tillage and on the opening up and the cultivation of the land, will be a great advantage to agriculture generally.  I <Col N="2481" /> believe the by-products which will be obtained from the manufacture of beet will compensate to a certain extent for the loss the State will have to bear in the payment of the subsidy.  I am not in favour of subsidies at all, and will not support them.  But to the extent that this subsidy is to be regarded as the starting of a new idea among the farming community, I am in favour of it.  I hope that the industry will prove the success which those who are promoting it are forecasting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Minister would give the House some information with regard to the policy of the Executive Council on this question of sugar beet.  Is it proposed to make this one factory an experimental factory, and, until the Government is satisfied or otherwise as to this experiment, to defer encouraging others to embark on the same industry, or is it, on the other hand, the desire of the Government to encourage others at this particular stage to embark on the development of this industry?  That is a matter on which the House would like to have some information if the Minister can see his way to give it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Conlan's point, that an arrangement should be made to have chemists at the factory, I take it that he is thinking of this point that the farmers who are delivering the beet would see that fair samples of their beet are taken.  We have been considering that, and I think that is essentially a matter for the farmers themselves.  It is not a matter for a chemist either.  It is a matter of seeing that fair samples are drawn for the purpose of examination by the chemist.  In other words, that the particular person who draws samples of beet from the farmers, which person is acting on behalf of the sugar manufacturing company, does not go to the worst beet but takes a fair sample of the crop.  That is not a problem for a chemist.  Any grower will know a good beet from a bad beet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely a farmer would not know the sugar content of a particular sample of beet&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2482" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies will allow me finish, perhaps it will shorten matters. Any farmer who has been dealing with this matter for a very short time, and who takes the trouble to make himself up in it&mdash;and it would not take him more than an hour&mdash;would get to know good beet from bad beet, just as he would know good mangolds from bad.  He would know when the beet is not fully matured, and consequently he would know that the sugar content of that beet is not high and that another sample of beet would yield a higher sugar content.  It is for the farmers themselves to appoint a representative who would be present at the factory and who would see when they are drawing samples for examination that fair samples are taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, coming to the other point, this is not a suggestion, for instance, that a chemist should be sent to the factory and that that chemist should then pick out the best-looking sample, with the highest sugar content, and then ask the factory to pay on that sample. That would be absurd.  You must take your chance.  I should say there would not be much difference between the sugar content in a fair average well-grown beet and that the farmer or grower will have to be content that the sample that is taken is a fair sample, and if it should be found that on examination that sample yielded 14, 15, 16 or 17 per cent. of sugar he must accept that as the average.  It would be absolutely unreasonable to expect the company to agree that a chemist would attend there on behalf of the farmers and pick out the beets that, after examination, showed the highest sugar content, that he would then analyse them, and if the samples analysed 18 per cent. of sugar content that he should tell the company: &ldquo;This is the average we require you to take,&rdquo; whereas if they analysed 14 per cent. he would tell the company: &ldquo;You must have another shot.&rdquo;  If that is the point that is being put to me, I say that there is no necessity for a chemist there at all.  As a rule there is a representative of the farmers there to see that the samples of beets, which are drawn for the purposes of examination, are fair samples of the crop.  I <Col N="2483" /> think Deputy Conlan suggested something more than that; that not only should there be fair samples of the crop drawn, but that there should be someone there to see that the chemist carried out his operations honestly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we did not explain sufficiently what we do want.  In England, I understand, the custom is to have a young man appointed in the factory to represent the farmers to see that their interests are looked after generally.  He is usually, I take it, a young man of education with some scientific knowledge, and probably a graduate of an agricultural college.  In Ireland, I expect, such a man would be taken from the College of Science.  He would be there to see that fair samples of the beets were taken, and that when a farmer sent in several tons of beet that the bad ones were not picked.  Our idea is that such a man would be there to see that the farmers got a square deal.  I think the Minister is mistaken in saying that a practical farmer was the kind of man we were thinking of.</P>

      <P>The kind of man we were thinking of was a man with a certain amount of scientific knowledge, a man who would be there to look after the interests of the farmers and to see that they got a square deal, and who, perhaps, at the same time would be acquiring a certain amount of information for himself.  I understand that in England, in the contract between the factory and the farmers, a clause is embodied which makes provision for an arrangement of this kind.  There is a small reduction made from each ton of beet to pay the salary of the officer. I do not know whether or not this is a matter for the Government, but if it is, then I think it is advisable that some such arrangement should be made here. Inasmuch as the Government are responsible for the subsidy which the factory is getting, I think they should see that the interests of the farmers are not overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is, I think, that Deputy Heffernan and Deputy <Col N="2484" /> Conlan are on different points.  Deputy Conlan used the word &ldquo;chemist,&rdquo; but I think we all mean the same thing, that some representative of the farmers should be there to see that fair samples are drawn.  We did discuss that with the company and there would be no difficulty whatever in having such an arrangement as far as the chemical work is concerned.  That would be absolutely routine, and I do not think the Deputy need worry on that point. The next point raised was in connection with rates.  I may say that the railway company and the sugar company have agreed on rates.  For distances between 60 and 70 miles the rate would be in or about 1d. per ton per mile, which I think is a reasonable rate.  Deputy Heffernan says he is inclined to think the subsidy will have to be continued to the end, that he hopes the experiment will be a success and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy always finds it necessary to be desperately cautious.  I hope also it will be a success, but I would not be so pessimistic about it if I were the Deputy.  If we were to go on the line that we would never make an experiment unless we were absolutely certain that it was going to succeed, then we would get nowhere, and really that is the line the Deputy is talking on this matter.  I could be cautions, wise, and profound about this if I wished to, but you cannot afford to be one or the other before the experiment.  An experiment is essentially experimental, and there is no use in mobilising all these magnificent qualities of wisdom, profundity and caution in connection with it, because we have to abide the result.  I think the result will show that Deputy Heffernan is wrong, but he may be right.  It may be necessary to pay some subsidy, even after this experimental stage is over.  I do not think the Deputy means it will be necessary to pay the full subsidy.  As a result of the subsidy farmers are able to get £26 per statute acre for beet. That leaves to the farmer a very fine profit, and if the farmers are asked to take a lot less, as they will be when the business becomes commercialised, I will not have much sympathy with them.  The experiments were begun <Col N="2485" /> not only to show what kind of beets could be grown, but what the sugar content of them would be.</P>
    <P>The experiment is experimental from the point of view as to whether farmers could be got to grow beets at all, or whether you could induce foreign capital to the extent of £400,000 to be put into the industry in this country.  It was necessary to have foreign capital, because there was no sugar beet being grown in Ireland, or in England for that matter, except by continental experts. So far as the point is concerned &mdash;(1) as to whether you could get farmers to grow beets, and (2) whether you could get foreign capital to come in here for the purpose of building and running a factory, it has passed the experimental stage.  In three, four or five years' time we will be able to know exactly what amount of beets can be grown here on a commercial scale, and as to what the sugar content of the beets is likely to be.  As we conduct our experiments we will, perhaps, be able to get a type of seed that will yield a high sugar content, and as we get on with our manurial experiments we will know where we are.  Even up to the present the results of last year and of this spring have shown that the continental procedure of cultivation and of manurial processes cannot be transplanted here without some adaptation. With regard to policy, we have set up this factory as an experiment.  It has cost a big sum of money, and we are not particularly anxious to pay more money for another factory.  We would be foolish if we did.  We hope by the time this Government or any other Government makes up its mind to start a new factory sufficient will be proved by this factory to get better terms.  I may say that it is not generally known that our subsidy for the first three years is less than what the British subsidy is at present.  That is a very striking fact.  Our subsidy amounts to 24/6 for the first three years, and the British to 26/9, and that notwithstanding the fact that they have been growing beet in England since 1912.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal with E 3 and E 4 under sub-head E.  Under E 3 there is down a sum of £600.  Last year it was £380.  It is with regard to &ldquo;other organisations&rdquo; to which the Minister has subscribed or intends to subscribe in the course of this year. We all know the importance of the first item, but we would like to have some information from the Minister as to what are the other organisations to which he has subscribed this year and for which the Vote is increased from last year.  With regard to sub-head E 4, I notice there is still down on the Estimates a charge for tobacco experimenters. I am glad to see that this charge is still retained.  I do not suppose this is the proper time to raise a discussion on the question of tobacco-growing. I understand an amendment will be proposed to the Finance Bill in the course of a week or two on which we will be able to discuss the report of the Tobacco Committee.  I am glad to see that the Minister has not completely stamped out all idea of helping tobacco, and that there is still retained in the Estimates a small sum, much the same as last year, in connection with experiments, although I see a foot-note that this matter may be reviewed. There is one item of £333 for grants to experimenters in the production of tobacco.  Could the Minister give us any information as to what exactly that stands for?  It is a matter of amazement to me that on this day, the one day of the year when the great agricultural estimates are being discussed in the Dáil, there is an extraordinary absence of the members of the Farmers' Party, including the whole Front Bench.</P>

It sometimes takes a year to see whether the regulations are complied with.  It is, as the Deputy says, only a small sum.  The general question with regard to tobacco will come up on another Vote and we will have a debate <Col N="2488" /> on it then.

I know, of course, we get a certain number of publications&mdash;international information with regard to crops and matters of that kind&mdash;but I would like to have a fuller justification for the expenditure.  I also want to know what the Minister proposes to do with regard to sending delegations.  Is there to be an international conference this year?  If so, is there to be a delegation, and if so how is that delegation to be composed?

      <P>Yes, but they would want to send other representatives in this case.  The only representatives sent are the Department's officials. I think you would want to get men outside the Department, men with a wider knowledge of agriculture than officials might have whose views are <Col N="2489" /> apt to be narrowed down to their particular Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The International Institute of Agriculture is, of course, the most important body of its kind.  Not only have you the advantage of its publications but you have no other way of getting international statistics in connection with agriculture, and, as the Deputy will agree, that is invaluable. I put forward no justification for subscribing to it apart from that. With regard to the other point that you should send to the Conferences not only officers of the Department but farmers, we are not tied to any particular delegation.  We would always, of course, send officers of the Department, but possibly an outsider might be sent, a non-civil servant occasionally. There is no reason why that should not be done, but I want to protest against the use of the adjective &ldquo;wider&rdquo; in that connection.  Deputy Heffernan should get out of the habit of contrasting officers and civil servants with other people, and saying that other people as a rule have a &ldquo;wider&rdquo; outlook.  I do not know why other people should have wider knowledge.  It would depend on the farmer and on the officer.  I could get a farmer with a narrow outlook and an officer with a narrow outlook.  You cannot generalise about it.  The International Conference is over, and there was a Dairy Congress at Paris last year at which a technical officer of the Department dealing with that particular section was present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move to reduce sub-head F (1) by £16,108; that is the cost as shown on the Estimate of the Agricultural Stations at Athenry and Ballyhaise. I referred to this matter on the Vote on Account, but I had not an opportunity then of moving an amendment. I am convinced that in this matter of agricultural education we are travelling in an old rut, and the sooner we get out of that rut the better.  The old rut is running stations, which not only do not pay their way, but involve a substantial charge on the taxpayer, and these two stations at Athenry and Ballyhaise are the most striking instances of that situation.  In 1925, according <Col N="2490" /> to the Estimate, £352 was taken as fees in these stations.  Deducting that from the cost shown on the Estimate, they cost £18,063 to run.  For that £18,063, nineteen pupils were educated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy knows that that £18,000 is not entirely for education and that, therefore, putting the whole cost of the institutes against education is a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know whether these institutes were entirely educational or not, but when the matter was last raised, the Minister told us that experimental work was being done at Glasnevin and Clonakilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, the average cost in these institutions was £950 per head; at Glasnevin it was £219, and Clonakilty £323 per head.  As a matter of fact, I saw where a Deputy of the Farmers' Party who, I believe, lives at Clonakilty, and who might know something about it, advocated the abolition of the Clonakilty Station.  I do not go as far as that, but I ask the Deputies to contrast that cost of £950 per head at Athenry and Ballyhaise to train a farmer or an agricultural official&mdash;which is what these agricultural stations do, very much more than they train farmers&mdash;with the cost of training members of highly technical professions elsewhere. A British Naval officer has to be a highly skilled officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Less £252 for pupils' fees.  The figures were all given to me by the Minister.  I may be wrong, but anyway the cost is over £900.  A British naval officer costs £300 a year. An officer in the British Air Force costs £500.  But it costs £950 to train a farmer in Cavan or Galway.  I do not know if the Minister considers that he is getting value for the money. When I raised this matter two months ago the Minister put forward two pleas.  The first was that he was breeding high-class animals that were sold at half-price to deserving farmers. That was his interruption just now. The second was that experimental work was carried on.  There is one thing that is certain about experimental work, and that is, that it ought to be co-ordinated; it ought to be carried on under a single head and the results chronicled in a single sentence.</P>
      <P>Experimental work in Glasnevin is invaluable.  It is very valuable because it can be co-ordinated with the Plant Breeding Section and the various sections still working in the College of Science.  I do not want to touch one penny of the cost of Glasnevin.  The Minister says that experimental work is going on at Clonakilty.  I am not proposing to touch Clonakilty, particularly because I respect the powers of self-defence of County Cork and because I do not want to curtail work of an experimental character.  But you should not mix up experiments and education.  I believe seriously that it is an enormous mistake.  Your courses are not university courses; they are short courses of one or two years at the maximum.  You get boys coming there with no marked provision of education. I think it must be very difficult to teach them to discriminate between the experiments and what they are supposed to learn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us about two months ago about an experiment at Glasnevin where he saw some cattle in magnificent condition, and he said to the official responsible for the experiment: <Col N="2492" />&ldquo;These cattle are very good. You will get such a price for them.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;I would if I sold them now, but for the purposes of the experiment I have got to keep them two months longer and I do not think I will get such a price then.&rdquo;  No doubt there was advantage in that experiment, but to the average student it will produce one of two results.  A very stupid man would say, as a result of the experiment: &ldquo;We always kept these cattle for ten months at the College and I am going to keep my cattle for ten months.&rdquo;  The more intelligent pupil would say: &ldquo;These cattle are not now as good as they were two months ago and the teaching here is all rot.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unless you have pupils who have gone through an elaborate course of education and have learned to discriminate, it is a very dangerous thing to introduce experiments.  I remember when I was learning chemistry my belief in the science of chemistry was shattered when the experiment by which the instructor tried to illustrate the theories he was laying down failed altogether.  You should keep the two things in Departments.  I think Sir James Craig will agree that medical students are only taught along approved lines and that they are not allowed to indulge in any new avenues of experiment.</P>
    <P>As regards selling live stock at half-price, I wonder are we justified in using the public funds to subsidise individuals?  That is what it comes to. Are the people who are getting these cattle at half-price selected by the county committees?  If so, it may easily happen that one county committee is active and another is sluggish, and one part of the country gets help out of the general taxes in opposition to another part who are paying as many taxes.  I do not say that there are not advantages in these stations. There are, but are there sufficient advantages to justify us in running these stations at a loss, because that is what we are doing&mdash;at a substantial loss annually.  Therefore, when the Farmers' Party say that they desire to see a model farm in every county, I say that once you have paid for the establishment and paid the capital charges <Col N="2493" /> the annual running ought not to be a charge on the taxpayer.  If it is, it is of no value to the farmer.  The farmer does not want to be taught to farm at a loss; he wants to be taught to farm at a profit, and he might well quarrel with the present system of agricultural education, as it leaves out the question of profit and of marketing altogether. Glasnevin College does not market its milk on competitive lines; it has a contract, and until you can teach the farmer marketing as well as production you will not be getting full value out of your agricultural education.</P>

      <P>I am not going to support Deputy Cooper in this amendment. At the same time, I think an explanation is due from the Minister as to why the number of pupils at these schools has sunk to such a small number. I think it is an extraordinary thing that these schools, which have, I presume, accommodation for up to 100 students, have such a small number of students.  Could the Minister tell me what the accommodation is at Ballyhaise and Athenry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like if the Minister could tell us why he cannot get the pupils to attend the schools. I believe in provincial agricultural colleges. I think there are reasons which make it useful to have these provincial colleges.  I think it would be the case that students would be more anxious to attend these colleges in their own immediate neighbourhood.  There is one thing I would like to point out to Deputy Cooper with regard to experiments. That is that I think it is possible to carry out experiments on this basis which are more applicable to the district in which the college is situated than in Glasnevin.  In Glasnevin you have one particular type of soil and one particular climate.  The same climate does not prevail all over the country and in these other places you will have different conditions, different soil, different rain conditions and other matters of that kind which make it advisable to have those schools in those other places.  At the same time I realised that as they stand at <Col N="2494" /> present they are not justifying themselves. It is not justifiable to have this expense of over £16,000 and only 19 students attending them.  I presume, if the teaching part were done away with altogether, that the experiments could be carried out on these farms at a much lower cost than that which the schools are conducted at now.  Officials have to be kept as well as superintendents and housekeepers and other people of that kind who would not be required if these places were simply conducted as experimental farms.  Another advantage in connection with these schools&mdash;and I hope they are being used for that purpose&mdash;is that they are demonstrating places where the people of the surrounding counties are invited to go from time to time to see the work that is being done and the experiments that are being carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the advantage a short time ago of going through the Glasnevin Agricultural School and Farm and of seeing the experiments carried out&mdash;experiments in crops, in the rearing of live stock and other things.  I thought it was most instructive.  I think it would be very useful if the people from different counties could be got to visit these institutions in large numbers, if arrangements could be made for delegations from each district and perhaps from farmers' associations of different kinds, and if the superintendent or officials responsible for the establishment were told off to take these people round and to give them all information as to work that is being carried on in these schools.  I think it is along these lines that we must get the people to display an interest in these institutions. We must get them to take an interest in the scientific development of agriculture.  We could advertise by one means or another, not necessarily in the papers, that these places were there for the people, that the people are invited and welcome to come and that they will be received&mdash;I will not say with hospitality&mdash;in a manner which shows that the officials are anxious to give them all possible information. I have seen in other places big field days at agricultural schools where the people of the whole surrounding <Col N="2495" /> districts, from great distances, were invited to come.  Speeches were made, demonstrations were given and all kinds of educational work done, and I think these colleges should be used for the same purpose.  I presume they are used to a certain extent for that purpose, but they are not used to as great an extent as I would like to see them, and some explanation is due from the Minister as to why a greater number of students do not attend.</P>

      <P>In connection with Deputy Cooper's amendment, I would like to call the Minister's attention to a report of a meeting of the members of the Farmers' Union in Cork some time ago, when the Chairman, Mr. O'Gorman, called attention to the extraordinary expenditure in connection with the Department's school at Clonakilty.  In the course of his remarks he said: &ldquo;We would like to hear about the gentleman who is getting a pension of £1,200 after three years' service when he would be only entitled to £800 or £900.  We would also like to get his birth certificate.  The Minister might be also requested to give the names and ages of the six Dáil organisers who are getting £30 per month at the public expense.&rdquo;  Merely for the sake of giving the Minister an opportunity of explaining why there is this apparently extraordinary extravagance that is alleged in connection with this particular institution at Clonakilty I am glad that Deputy Cooper put down this amendment.  In connection with Athenry, I happen to have some experience of the agricultural station there, and I certainly do think that the experimental work carried on there is of first-rate importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, if these stations are to carry on experimental work of this kind, and impart information to the farmers, it is impossible, to my mind, for the farms in connection with these stations to be run at a profit.  Just take one thing.  I remember being a member of a delegation that visited that station three or four years ago.  At that time some very interesting experiments in pig feeding with dry foods <Col N="2496" /> were carried on.  As Deputies know, at that time the practice was to feed pigs on boiled food, and they were not fed very economically on that.</P>
    <P>As a result of the experiments carried out in Athenry it was demonstrated that it was possible to feed pigs on dry food more economically than on boiled foods&mdash;potatoes, meal, etc.&mdash; with the result that a large number of farmers, as a commercial proposition, have adopted dry feeding, and they have found that they are able to feed pigs more economically than by boiling food for them, as was done in the old days.  That is one illustration of the advantages to be derived from the experimental work carried on in these stations.  Many county committees organised deputations to visit these stations annually, and the instructors explained to the various deputations the nature of the experiments they had been carrying on during the year, the results of experiments in cattle rearing, sheep rearing, and pig breeding, and the growing of different varieties of corn, potatoes, etc.  The result is that the farmers take an intelligent interest in these experiments.  The farmers are prepared to take advantage of what they have seen in these institutions, and when they carry out these experiments on their own farms they find that the experiments inevitably mean a saving in their own spheres.  While I would be anxious that the Minister should run these stations on the most economical lines, I fail to see how it is possible to carry out educational work on the same scale as at present, and at the same time run these places at a profit.  There must inevitably be a loss, and my only regret is that the farmers generally and the farmers' sons particularly, do not take proper advantage of these institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not congratulate Deputy Cooper on his speech.  I certainly say it is most ingenious.  He did mix it with a vengeance. He gave us some interesting figures, but I did not think he was quite so naïve.  I know he can read estimates and examine them pretty closely.  He first of all mixed up in a most beautiful fashion&mdash;I do not put it down to stupidity&mdash;<Col N="2497" /> the work of the farmer, not only this educational work but this experimental work and all this work in connection with the breeding of live stock. These farms are fulfilling three functions. They are educational, they are experimental not only for the benefit of the students but for the purposes of the Departmental leaflets, for the purposes of the instructors, to enable them to give up-to-date advice to farmers throughout the country, and in addition they have a third function, the breeding of live stock for resale at a loss.  The Deputy bulked the three together and found that the cost of these two farms last year was £18,000.  The Deputy had not sufficient curiosity, even after bulking the three in order to swell the bill, to turn to the Appropriations-in-Aid and make necessary deductions.  I suspect that Deputy Cooper knows there are such things as Appropriations-in-Aid at the end of each year's Estimates.  Possibly it may be that the procedure of putting the Appropriations-in-Aid at the end of the Estimates has escaped Deputy Cooper's notice up to the present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, something has occurred.  If the Deputy did turn to the Appropriations-in-Aid he would find that he could take £8,000 from £18,000 and that would leave him £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>£8,500 is the figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is right. Anyhow, roughly speaking, £10,000 would be left.  The Deputy after that could explain that this represented the cost to the State of education, experiments and the production of live stock &mdash;high-class breeding stock&mdash;for the purpose of resale, very often at a loss. The Deputy has indulged in figures and I think he has shown that figures can be made extremely illusory.  Perhaps he will allow me to give him a few more figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy stated expressly that the cost of education per pupil is £950. That is the sort of thing that people can remember.  I can hear the changes rung on that figure, regardless of any <Col N="2498" /> correction, for the next three months. Everyone with a bee in his bonnet, everyone who wants to have a shot at the Department of Agriculture in season and out of season, will shout that the cost of education is £950 per pupil; but there will not be a word of explanation that that is the cost of education, plus the cost of all the experimental work done on the farms, plus the cost of raising high-class breeding stock for resale at a loss.  One may be sure these facts will not be added.</P>
    <P>What is the cost of education?  I am sure the Deputy will allow me to examine the Estimates on the same lines as he has done.  I suggest the Deputy ought to put in the housemaster in each case, £200; housekeeper, £50; domestic staff, £82, and a teacher of poultry-keeping, £60, against the educational side.  I know these farms very well, and all these officers are required. They have their hands well filled with experimental work and live stock breeding.  If the Deputy adds all the figures he will get a total of £6,000 for the two instead of £18,000, and the figure for each pupil will work out at £20.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be at least £30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>About £30 a pupil would be more like it.  A moment's consideration will show that it is perfectly incorrect to say it costs £650 to educate a pupil at one of these colleges. It is not a fair statement in view of the uses that can be made of it.  It is obvious the statement will get three times as much publicity as the correction. If we were simply making debating points, I could throw the £30 at his £950.  The fact is that it is quite impossible to disentangle the educational, experimental and live-stock breeding work.  It is when you have people talking about agriculture but meaning something else that these statements are made.  I do not accuse the Deputy of anything like that; but you have people outside making debating points and talking about agriculture when their meaning lies elsewhere, and you get agriculture, experiments and live stock breeding debated in this <Col N="2499" /> fashion.  It is quite impossible to disentangle them.</P>
      <P>If I were to take the same line as the Deputy, I could easily say that the average cost per pupil is about £30 and that it is well worth the money.  The Deputy ought not to say that the university work should not be done there. University work is not done there. Experimental work of this kind is not University work.  There are people who will mix up research and experimental work, but I take it the Deputy knows the distinction.  I am sure the Deputy knows perfectly well that the work of hybridising plants that will be done at a Faculty of Agriculture is not experimental work.  There is no useful purpose served by mixing up matters.</P>
      <P>The functions of these colleges are as follows:&mdash;(1) The training of boys and girls in subjects pertaining to agriculture; (2) experimental work; and (3) the production of pure-bred live stock.  Deputies will notice that the Appropriations-in-Aid each year about balance the particular item, general expenses of management.  I make no point about that.  Next year it might be just as much.  The Appropriations-in-Aid were somewhat less this year and last year as compared with the general expenses of management; in other words, there was a loss.  Perhaps that might change.  It proves nothing. Next year, provided there are more experiments, the general expenses of management might be greater.  As they are being run, the Appropriations-in-Aid practically balance every year the general expenses of management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take the question of the training of boys and girls in subjects pertaining to agriculture.  In reply to Deputy Heffernan, let me say that the numbers at the Albert College remain stationary.  Let me take the agricultural students.  I am dealing with the years 1921 to 1926 in succession, and the figures are as follows:&mdash;18, 20, 25, 21, 12 and 31; that is to say, that in 1925-26 there were 31.  That is a higher figure than in 1920.  As regards farm apprentices, the figures are:&mdash;12, 15. 9 (1923-24), 13, and 17.  The figures there are higher also.  In regard to horticultural students the <Col N="2500" /> figures are:&mdash;7, 8, 8, 6, 4, 9.  There was a drop during 1922 and 1924 for obvious reasons; people were not thinking of education.  As regards Clonakilty, the figures from 1920-1926 were:&mdash;26, 7, 19, 7, 26, 26, 26.  Now, as regards Athenry:&mdash;17, 14, 22, 17, 25.  Here are the numbers as regards Ballyhaise:&mdash; 26, 16, 7.</P>
    <P>Ballyhaise was not open for some time.  The intention is to make Ballyhaise a girls' school&mdash;a school somewhat similar to the Munster Institute. The figures for the Munster Institute are:&mdash;54, 56, 56, 51, and, this year, 53. The Munster Institute is full and cannot take another pupil.  We have a long waiting list, and some have been waiting for a long time.  It is proposed to make Ballyhaise a girls' school and it is proposed to use the farm as a dairy farm for the purpose of supplying milk to the Institute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">

      <P>I could not give the exact number, but I think it is twenty-six to thirty each.  Ballyhaise is not open yet, and, therefore, we are delayed in carying out our intention. The water supply at Athenry went wrong.  We were not prepared to take any risks, and we changed the students to Ballyhaise while the engineers of the Board of Works are investigating the pollution of the water supply.</P>

I am sure there is dissatisfaction, and I am quite sure that there are suggestions made by long-suffering applicants that they might be put higher up on the list. There is a waiting list of 200 for the Munster Institute.  Possibly some of those have been waiting for a long while and you can well imagine that after waiting, possibly, for a year a mother would find some other reason for her son or daughter not being called than their actual place on the list.  I know a little about this subject and it is a sore subject with a lot of people.  People are anxious to get their daughters or sons transferred to higher places and I know it is not an unheard-of thing for suggestions to be made to the Department that people should be called before their time, but I can assure the Deputy that it is the invariable procedure of the Department only to call students according to their order upon the list.</P>

      <P>I remember when I was a Governor of the Munster Institute, there were always applications on the part of some ambitious ladies, especially, to be put ahead of the rank they held, and every excuse was given, but we always treated the matter with absolute silence.  There was no use arguing a question with anybody if they misjudged the work of the Governors of the Institute.  They did misjudge it, and called attention to it in a way that we were determined to treat with contempt.  I think it would be far better, instead of pandering to the erroneous idea of anybody that they are out of their order or that they were not fairly treated, to treat them with the silent contempt which they deserve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course Deputy Nolan did not suggest that there was any favouritism.  I only mention that to show that where the dissatisfaction exists it is due, largely, to the fact that there is always a long waiting list, and people get impatient.  So far as the colleges are concerned, the numbers have increased, and they are practically full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper raised a very big question that it is impossible to discuss without taking a very long time, as to what experiments should or should not be conducted on these farms.  He has got to remember that experiments are not done primarily for the pupils at all. It is quite easy to teach a pupil who comes up for one year's course if he is a good farmer's son who has been at a winter class, and who only comes up for a year or two's course.  There is no real necessity to do experiments in order to teach him.  You teach him ordinary subjects, showing him good cultivation, and the value of seeding and testing.  In the Munster Institute they have to deal with poultry, butter-making, and so on, and it is necessary to show them all processes in connection with butter-making, not only the <Col N="2503" /> good effect but the result of the bad effect as well.  You have to show the varieties of poultry, and that some pay and some do not, and show the effect of wrong treatment on the quality of butter and produce generally, and, in that way, a very large percentage of the material, as, for instance, in the case of butter, goes to the bad.  It is a sacrifice for educational purposes, and that is all that is in it.</P>
    <P>For instance, again, take the question of milking as one single item of the Munster Institute.  Cows have to be milked by different girls, and in such circumstances will not yield their full quantity of milk.  Every farmer knows that a cow must be milked regularly by a fairly experienced milker in order to give the best results.  In the Munster Institute, where the cows are milked by different sets of girls, you have a loss.  These are not the ideal conditions where you want a high yield of milk.  The same applies to other items and to other colleges.</P>
    <P>Now it is useful to have experiments going on under the noses of the students. These students of 18 or 19 years of age have a great deal of practical experience, and a considerable number of feeding experiments are carried out.  I am not a bit afraid that what Deputy Cooper foreshadowed will happen.  He quoted a case that I mentioned, where a certain feeding experiment was carried out on 25 or 30 cattle.  I spoke to the superintendent at the time and said: &ldquo;You are going to get a real good price as cattle are going well.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I would if I had not to hold them over.  But I must hold them over.&rdquo;  Deputy Cooper is afraid, if I may use the word, that a &ldquo;mug&rdquo; would go home and tell his father that in future he is to keep the cattle until the price falls.  There is not the slightest fear of that.  They are not quite as innocent as all that. The experiments are not so terribly complicated that they are likely to disarrange a student's intelligence in that way.  It is useful for the students to see these experiments, manurial experiments, cultivation experiments, and the good students take a real interest in them.  Remember that these experiments <Col N="2504" /> are done for other purposes as well.  I have here a short list of the experiments done on these farms last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Are these at Athenry and Ballyhaise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  These are experiments and not research work.  There were, in addition to the tests on this list, tests in animal nutrition, the value of green food for pigs and dried sugar beet for fattening cattle and milch cows.  A large number of store pigs have to be bought, divided, weighed and kept under conditions that a commercial farmer would not dream of keeping them under.  The greatest care must be taken that no extraneous factor interferes with the experiment. The result of the experiment must go out through the country in leaflet form and we must take care that in feeding experiments the results are not vitiated by extraneous circumstances.  I dare say most Deputies know that pigs are inclined to take the food from one another.  We have to arrange that every pig in the bunch gets the same amount of food.  We have also to arrange for weighing.  We have to secure that the experiment is not destroyed or injured by reason of the fact that one group of pigs have got cold or less light, or is brought up under less ideal conditions than the others.  All that costs money and means capital expenditure.  It means supervision.  In other words, you cannot make education pay, and this education is not only for 15, 20 or 30 pupils, but is education for farmers, as the result of the experiments will be published in pamphlet form.  During the last year experiments were carried out and none of them was in the nature of very abstract research work such as would be done in the plant-breeding laboratory of a university. They were experiments in the interest of the farmers.  They were experiments that will give results and make a difference in the way of increased profits or, if you prefer, less losses.  I have a list of 100 pamphlets.  I do not know if the Deputy reads those pamphlets issued by the Department.  If not, I can recommend them to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You ought to.  Even though I say it, they are very good, very much on the mark, and extremely well written.  I cannot understand why there is not a greater demand for them. An increasing demand is reported during the past year, but I cannot understand why they are not more fully availed of.  Remember that these pamphlets are based on experiments carried out at the farms.  I think the Deputy said that he understood that experiments should be carried out at the Albert College, but that he did not see the necessity for them at the other institutes.  I cannot agree with that.  As Deputy Conlan mentioned, we find it necessary to study the different conditions. If a new breed of oats is brought out at the Albert College, it is tested first in small quantities and then sent to other farms and tested under different conditions.  Before we open our mouths about it, we test it in about 150 places throughout the country.  Otherwise it would be madness to recommend throughout the whole country oats that was grown on a single farm in Dublin.  I need not go into the question of breeding high-class live stock for the purpose of resale, sometimes at a loss&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. CONLAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>These animals are sent mainly to the congested districts.  The immediate district in which the colleges are get no special advantage. For instance, from Clonakilty, boars would be sent to Mayo.  It depends on the needs of the moment.  The other question Deputy Cooper raised will also arise on his next amendment.  He said that we should seriously consider whether it is good business for the State to subsidise the distribution of live stock to small farmers who are not able to pay for high-class animals. <Col N="2506" /> I would like to hear the views of other Deputies on that question.  I regard it as not only good business but absolutely essential to send such animals to these districts.  Remember that the congested districts&mdash;and particularly the western side&mdash;constitute a very big area.  There are very big numbers of live stock bred there, and it would be a very serious thing indeed, not only for the reputation of the stock within the area, but for the reputation of the stock of the country as a whole, if the stock there deteriorated.  There is even a more serious consideration still.  The Deputy will remember that in the poorer areas the dividing-line between just-enough and starvation is not very marked.  How could a small farmer in Mayo, Donegal, Connemara, parts of Kerry, Leitrim, parts of Kildare, and even other districts outside the congested districts, afford to give £50 for an Aberdeen-Angus bull?  And remember that one will only get a third-class Aberdeen-Angus bull, at the moment, for £50.  How could he afford to buy even the last bull that we would pass, costing, say, £30?  How could he afford to pay £12 for a boar or £10 for a sow?</P>
      <P>If we do not continue this policy, especially for the congested districts and the poorer districts, we are going to have deterioration.  This is not a new policy.  We are doing no more here than we have been doing through the county committees of agriculture. The whole premium system, under the county committees, is based on this policy.  That is what has improved our cattle until they are, from the point of view of quality, the best cattle in the world.  We will see what the Scotch farmers will say about them in a year or two years.  They are already beginning to talk.  They already know what difference there is between them and the Canadians.  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that, as a result of these schemes, we have the best live stock, from the point of view of quality, in the world.  If we had not, we would have been driven out of the British market long ago.  Suppose there are a thousand premiums in the country, and three hundred special term animals.  They are all bulls that would average round about £60 or £70 each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2507" /> I want to emphasise that that would be the average price.  If you take certain breeds, the price would be much higher.  You would pay as much as £180 for an Aberdeen-Angus, and you would pay £120 for a middling one. How many people of the 1,300 who keep premium animals could purchase them if they were not helped in this way by the State?  You would have no breeders, and you would have no buyers, and you would have fourth-class bulls, with consequent fourth-class stock.</P>
    <P>What do our live stock schemes cost on the whole?  I suppose about £70,000 a year.  There was never £70,000 better spent.  I think £140,000 would be well spent in the same way.  I say, deliberately, that even if we had to get the money from taxation, and if the country was three times as poor as the most pessimistic person alleges it is, you could not spend money in a better way. When one considers for a moment the amount of money spent on other services, and when one thinks of what has been done at so little cost by the constant introduction into and spreading through the country of first-class breeding stock for the last fifteen years, I marvel that Deputies of all parties, in the House, instead of talking about short cuts to riches in farming, do not press that in future the Estimates of the Department of Agriculture should be increased from £50,000 or £60,000 to something like £100,000 for this work.  As far as I am concerned, my aim and object is to extend this side of the Department's work in the way of introducing high-class stock&mdash;bulls, boars and sheep&mdash;into every county. The Deputy knows what even one good bull will do in a district.  The progeny will leave their mark there for generations. You cannot measure what one good animal will do.  Multiply the number from one thousand to, say, two thousand, and, at the other end, weed out all the bad animals, and you will have stock that will be of creditable quality&mdash;something that you need not be ashamed to market anywhere.  I say we ought to continue that.  We should not be prevented doing that by anybody with an interest in agriculture. <Col N="2508" /> If we continue to do that, the least we might expect&mdash;this may, perhaps, be irrelevant&mdash;would be that the farmers would do their duty by feeding their stock and marketing them properly.</P>
    <P>I have little further to say except to repeat that this fairy tale about £950 per student is not good enough.  It does not cost £950.  It does not cost £30 per pupil.  The number of pupils in these colleges is increasing.  As we get back more and more to normal times, the increase will be greater.  I want to see more of these colleges. They are expensive, but I want to see more of them, nevertheless.  We have five of them at present.  I would be glad to see 30 farmers' sons from each county getting this sort of education.</P>

      <P>Whilst I do not agree with Deputy Cooper's amendment, I am very pleased that he put it down, because it gave the Minister an opportunity of putting before the House an exposition of the different activities of these agricultural schools. I have a good deal of experience of these schools.  I have been through the Athenry, Glasnevin, and Portumna institutions.  In my opinion, the money expended on these institutions has been very usefully expended.  Anybody who desires information as to what the Department actually did in the improvement of live stock should read the evidence given by Mr. T.P. Gill at the inquiry held in London when the Act for removal of the embargo on the importation of Canadian cattle into England was under consideration.  Mr. Gill showed that the value of our cattle had been improved by these live stock schemes from £2 per head to £5 per head in twenty years.  Anybody who has occasion to go to our fairs will easily notice the improvement in all classes of live stock that has taken place during the last 20 or 25 years.  That is due to the work of the department and particularly to the work carried out in those schools.  In saying that, I would like to urge that more could still be done. The pamphlets the Minister referred to are extremely interesting.  Any farmer who applies to the office can get copies of them, but I am sorry to say that, up <Col N="2509" /> to recently, a great number of our farmers were not aware that the results of the research branches of the Department were available in this way.  The English Department of Agriculture is actually carrying out some of the work of which our Department were pioneers. In 1922 I took the following cutting from an English paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Warble Fly.&mdash;A Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture has, for some time past, been considering scientifically the various remedies which have been suggested for checking the damage to skins of cattle made by the warble fly pest.  In the past, the step most favoured in dealing with the pest has been the squeezing out of the maggots from the backs of cattle during the season when they become ripe&mdash;that is, from February to June.  This method, however, although efficacious if persisted in, entails much labour.  The Committee, therefore, directed their attention to observation of the action of washes or smears which can readily be applied to the backs of cattle ... During last spring an experimental dressing of no fewer than 940 cattle was made with this mixture, under the direction of the Irish Department of Agriculture.  Of 4,885 warble maggots found to be present in the cattle 3,990 were destroyed, representing a mortality of over 80 per cent.</P>
      <P>This Committee, appointed by the British Ministry of Agriculture, actually suggested that the recommendation of the Irish Department of Agriculture should be carried out in England. I say that is a great tribute to the work of our Department here.  They have a very able staff of officials in the English Department and they go in for a lot of research work, as we do here. But in the respect I mentioned, we are ahead of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to hear from the Minister that Ballyhaise school is going to be opened as a school for girls.  I was, I think, one of the first Deputies to suggest that something on those lines should be done.  There were a lot of complaints about the difficulty of getting into the Munster Institute, and there was great dissatisfaction in parts <Col N="2510" /> of the country, owing to the length of time young ladies had to wait before gaining admission.  I am sure this departure will relieve the situation a great deal.  I am sorry our boys are not taking as much advantage as they should of schools, like the school at Clonakilty and elsewhere.  I should like to know from the Minister&mdash;perhaps I had better leave it over until the Vote for veterinary grants, as I may be out of order in asking it now&mdash; whether any researches are being carried on in regard to foot and mouth disease at present?</P>

      <P>We all recognise the necessity for agricultural education. Last year both Deputy Gorey and myself referred specially to the necessity for bringing home to the people the result of this education.  With that <Col N="2511" /> idea, we suggested that there should be demonstration farms in the various counties.  What is suitable to one county is not suitable to another. Experiments made in Cork will not be of great value in Limerick, and the same would apply as between Tipperary and Kildare.  I do not refer to an experimental station.  That is quite another matter.  If you had one or two demonstration farms in each county they would be very useful.  At present I think when land is being taken over in various counties, and where you have in each of the large farms taken over a dwelling-house with out-offices, forty or fifty acres of that land should be given to some young man who had been trained in one of the Department's institutes.  That would be better than having an inspector to reside there.  The farms could be given under special conditions as to the payment of rent, etc., and could be used to demonstrate successful work.  You cannot get farmers to go to model farms.  The work must be brought home to them and must be available for the farmers in the various counties.  I think the Minister should take notice of this important matter.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy D'Alton's remarks about demonstration farms, those are becoming, to a certain extent, a hardy annual now.  The suggestion was put forward recently by the Farmers' Party, but we are not asking for a demonstration <Col N="2512" /> farm.  We are asking that, perhaps, more than one farm may be taken up in each county.  An official from the Department should be placed on that farm and asked to work it in the most up-to-date manner so as to demonstrate to the people that an official of the Department can put his theories into practice, and show that a farm can be worked and made to pay according to the ideas of the Department of Agriculture. Many people say instructors are only theoretical farmers.  To a certain extent there is something in that.</P>

      <P>I suggest it may be discussed under this as Deputy D'Alton opened it up again.  A good deal of the work carried out under the agricultural colleges is experimental and non-instructional.  I know there is a dairy at Glasnevin which is used for commercial purposes.  Instructors are really engaged in work not altogether experimental.  Those men must be given a chance to put those theories into practice.  That is somewhat different from Deputy D'Alton's idea.</P>

      <P>I had better explain what I have said again.  This idea was mentioned five or six years ago by some prominent farmers.  Deputy Gorey and I discussed those matters and agreed that it would be better, if possible, not to have an instructor there, because if he carried out certain work, farmers around would say: &ldquo;The Department is doing it.&rdquo;  We consider if such farms were given to a qualified man he could demonstrate there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister stated last year that he intended <Col N="2513" /> to get in touch with practical farmers with a view of seeing that the instructions of the Department were carried out on certain farms in order to prove that the theories propounded by the instructors could be put into practice and made a paying proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Agricultural instructors have been asked to keep in touch with special farms in each district, but it must not be taken for granted that every farmer does what the instructor asks him to do.  The instructors do keep in touch with special farms and advise farmers in connection with certain processes.  Deputy Roddy reminded me of a statement that has recently been made by Mr. O'Gorman, Chairman of the Cork County Council, in connection with Clonakilty. He stated, first of all, that there were twenty-two teachers there, and secondly, that an officer was employed there who got £1,200 a year and that another officer got a pension of something like £900.  That statement is untrue. It is not the first statement of the kind that this particular gentleman has made.  The fact is that there are three teachers and twenty-six pupils there.  No officer of the Department of Agriculture, except the Secretary, gets a salary of £1,200 a year, not to speak of a pension.  I stated here on Friday that owing to the fact that farmers were, to a great extent, unorganised, every mountebank who claimed to be a spokesman for agriculture, got away with it.  In this instance you have an excellent example of that.  Here you have Cork County, one of the best farming counties in Ireland, but you have as Chairman of the County Council and County Committee of Agriculture, Mr. O'Gorman, a man who grows more thistles within his own area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It happens to be true. I cannot understand the point of view that people should be allowed to make untrue statements all over the country, and that no one should be allowed to state the truth, even by way of reply. I did not hear the Deputy getting enthusiastic in his protests when Mr. O'Gorman and others made notoriously false statements about the Department of Agriculture and the Government generally.  He is to be allowed to make these statements and get away with <Col N="2515" /> them, whereas when I endeavour to put the position accurately, I am told that it is in bad taste.  I repeat what I said, and I want the farmers to listen to it.  In a county which is one of the best farming counties in the country, you have as chairman of the county council and county committee of agriculture a gentleman whose one point in agricultural policy was to abolish summer-time.  That was about three or four years ago.  His policy for agriculture now is to abolish the bonus of the instructors&mdash;officers who work from dawn to dark, whose salary is from £150 to £350 per annum, and who spent four years in the College of Science.  After twenty-five years' service they may get £350 with bonus. These statements were made at the behest, apparently, of the county council and committee of agriculture of a county which is a first-class farming county, and whose schemes are always well done.  They were good farmers there, and now there is an attempt to break it up.  By whom?  By probably the very worst farmer between here and where he comes from, who is notorious for the acreage and weight of thistles he can get, and who breeds perhaps the worst bulls in the district.  I want to state that definitely, and I hope every Deputy has heard it, and I make no other claim for it, whether it be in good taste or in bad taste.  The people who are abusing us are not so meticulous. I hope that every Deputy has got that, and I make no other claim for it than that that it happens to be an example&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  My point is this: Mr. O'Gorman has been placed in a certain position by the votes of the people in his county.  Evidently <Col N="2516" /> the people thought Mr. O'Gorman worthy of having that position.  Mr. O'Gorman got up at a public meeting and made these statements, outside of any privilege.  I say that this is not the place where the Minister should get up&mdash;where Mr. O'Gorman is not present and where he could not answer the Minister&mdash;and speak as he has done, protected by the privileges of the House.  Mr. O'Gorman cannot take any legal action against the Minister for what he states here.  I say in all fairness that if the Minister wants to make statements of that kind he ought to do so outside the House on a political platform.  The Minister has information about Mr. O'Gorman having thistles on his farm and having bulls that did not pass.  That is just the Minister's opinion.

I say that they are doing very excellent work, and I think in practically all cases they are not being overpaid.  I say that without hesitation.  I think you will find that the salaries of these officials are probably the lowest, compared with any other staff that appear on the Votes, and they are doing most useful work for the country.

I do not go dragging my red herrings like that. To come back to the Minister, I am glad he enjoyed my speech, because I enjoyed his; I would have enjoyed it more if it had been shorter.  I do know that there are such things as Appropriations-in-Aid, and I am correct as to the average cost of the pupils.  If the Appropriations-in-Aid are calculated, the average cost is £520, but I believe the appropriations account is misleading. I will tell the Minister why I do not believe in his Appropriations-in-Aid. Appropriations-in-Aid of this character are things that vary from year to year.  Athenry was closed last financial year; it is now open, but yet the Appropriations-in-Aid to Athenry both this year and last year are set down as £4,000.

But you can take it as a general principle that the work done by the pupils in any properly conducted agricultural school is of no commercial value, and it would be a very bad day indeed if the aim was to commercialise it.  You would be doing what the schoolmaster did in Dotheboys Hall, who got a boy to spell &ldquo;window&rdquo; and then said: &ldquo;Go and clean it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In Glasnevin there are 50 or 60 dairy cows, 250 pigs, and I should say about 15 or 20 sows.  You can work out the number of pigs there would be per annum from these.  There are also some sheep, a considerable amount of fowl, and some beef shorthorns. What does the Deputy think the receipts from these would be?  We do not keep them in glass cases; we sell them and put them out.  I suppose 400 or 500 pigs per annum are sold, or distributed through the country and certain charges made for them.  Milk would also be part of it.  Obviously the receipts from a huge farm like that would be very big.  They could be taken as something less in Clonakilty and Athenry.</P>

I shall not accept them until I see the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Report for last year.  I am satisfied that this is a book-keeping figure.  The Minister accused me of having bulked all the objects of these colleges together: research, education, and the sale of live stock.  I did not bulk them together; the Minister bulked them together. The Minister shows the cost of these colleges under the one sub-head&mdash; F.  He has sub-head E, Research, and he elects to put all the cost of these colleges under sub-head F.  He has inherited that from the past.  I am not blaming him, but it is extremely misleading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do suggest a change.  The Minister himself classified the cost and showed that the cost of education would work out at £30 a <Col N="2521" /> head.  I suggest that this cost for education should figure under &ldquo;Education.&rdquo; The Minister tried to deal with research by differentiating between research and abstruse research.  I differentiated between research generally and education. Then he justified these colleges being under &ldquo;Education&rdquo; because they were the foundation of certain valuable pamphlets.  I presume they are educational, but then why did they not figure under that sub-head?  Do let us know what we are spending on research, education and the improvement of live-stock. The Minister is one of those who have taunted Deputies who have asked for a Geddes Committee with not criticising the Estimates, but the Estimates themselves are not in a form in which one can criticise them.  He has made a great part of his case as far as the improvement of live stock is concerned, but he has not made a case at all for including both these things under the head of Education.  A great deal that the Minister has told us is absolutely new.</P>

But the area is far and away less than last year.  It is the one crop that has gone down.  On the other hand, the Deputy will understand that that is quite a sudden development.  In any event it was foreseen that the price of flax would be very bad.  I think we would not be justified in discontinuing our schemes because prices fluctuate, and possibly it requires more assistance now than at any other time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have a little more information from the Minister than he gave us in his opening statement on a matter that comes under sub-head G 2.  I attended the annual congress of members of the Dairy Shorthorn Association held at Mallow. Several farmers at that congress put forward the claim that the grant from the Department towards cow-testing associations was not sufficient.  Some of the delegates stated that the Minister had expressed the opinion that he was not prepared to increase this grant.  I would ask him to reconsider it and see whether something could not be done to increase the grant.  In the poorer districts, where the land is not good, the people are not able to maintain good quality cattle, with the result that the milk yield is small.  The Department's annual contribution is 4/- to the 3/- put up by the farmer.  In districts where the land is poor that contribution might be considered inadequate, and while I would be very slow to ask for more money, still I think this is an exceptional case, and perhaps something might be done in the way I have indicated.  The improvement of our dairy herds must be the foundation of our whole agricultural development in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the number of our cow-testing associations is not as great as it ought to be.  I think we should do something to encourage farmers to come forward and join them in greater numbers than they have been doing. What I am anxious about is that the Minister should endeavour to do something to help the people in these backward parts of the country, where they find it very difficult to carry on.  One of the difficulties they are up against is to pay the local supervisor.  As I pointed out to the Minister on a previous occasion, the districts that the local supervisor can work with the <Col N="2525" /> most ease are the prosperous dairy districts. There is a large number of cows in them, and as the area to be covered is not too large, the supervisor is in a position to earn a reasonable salary.</P>
    <P>The position is different altogether in the poorer districts.  There the area to be covered is very large, and the result is that the local supervisor finds it very hard to get any return for his labours.  One of the troubles in connection with this matter is to get good reliable men to carry out the work.  If the men who are appointed local supervisors are not honest and reliable, the whole foundation of the work is sapped, and the results given are not trustworthy.  The results in connection with cow-testing associations, if they are to be of any use at all, must be absolutely reliable.  These supervisors must be honest men, and it is their duty to attend and see the milk weighed.  I have heard it stated that some of them allow the owners of the cows to weigh the milk themselves and put down their own weights.  I do not say many of them do that.  In other cases, it is quite possible that they do not carry out adequately the testing of the milk in regard to better fats.  I understand there has been a check in that respect recently, and that now the inspectors of the Department insist that the milk which is taken for test is retained until examined by themselves.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that something ought to be done in the direction of making the job of local supervisor one worth having.  It is difficult to do that in the poorer districts for the reasons I have stated.  The result is that in these poorer districts men of an inferior type are given the positions. Good men cannot be got to undertake the work because the salary is too small, and they get tired of the work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to this is that here is something which pays the farmer, something that is of vital interest to him, and yet we have to pay him to do it.  We give him 4/- per cow for every 3/- that he puts up. That, I suggest, is a huge subsidy in the circumstances.  It is an extraordinary <Col N="2526" /> thing that in this country, in order to induce farmers to do something that is to their own interest and from which they will make hard cash, we have to give them a subsidy at all. Look at the size of the subsidy we are giving: 4/- for every 3/- that the farmer puts up.  There is a point at which we should stop, and I honestly say that we have reached that point in regard to subsidising cow-testing associations.</P>
      <P>I want to see these associations developed. Everyone wants to see them developed, but in my opinion the State should not go any further in the way of giving them subsidies.  They are getting a very big subsidy as it is.  The Deputy referred to the poorer districts. We need not go to the poorer districts at all.  Take districts like Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford, all of which are well off, where you have really good land, and what do we find? That the cow-testing associations in these districts have not developed to the extent they should have.  With regard to the supervisors, they are a fine lot of young men working for a very small salary.  The position is not a whole-time one, and the salary is a small one.  They are a fine type of young farmers' sons.  I have met many of them, and I have the fullest confidence in the accuracy with which they make their records.  The Deputy did not suggest that the records were not accurate.  I do not think he need feel that there is any danger of the records being cooked.</P>
      <P>I know a lot of these supervisors and I have found them to be very enthusiastic, hard-working young fellows.  I would like very much indeed to have more money to pay them.  We are putting up as much money as we should be asked to put up, 4/- for every 3/- that the farmer puts up, and the people to be blamed if these supervisors are not paid larger salaries are, in the circumstances, the farmers.  We are putting up a big subsidy, and the blame should lie on the farmer and not on the Department if the supervisors are not getting a sufficient salary.  It is not a question of asking the farmers to increase the number of their cows, but rather to get more of them to join these associations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a good deal of what the Minister has said, but he did not deal with one or two points that I had mentioned.  As I pointed out earlier, it is much easier to organise these associations in good dairy districts than in parts of the country where the land is poor.  Cow-testing associations are pretty numerous in the districts where the people go in for dairying on an intensive scale. A supervisor in a district like that would be able to make a fairly good salary. I agree generally with the Minister that most of the supervisors are fine young men, but there are exceptional cases.  I know cases myself where the accuracy of records made by them would be open to doubt.  I have seen records in connection with one association which I believe were not accurate. As a matter of fact, I believe that in that particular case the inspectors of the Department found that the records were not accurate.  I am glad to say, however, that inaccurate records are very rare.  Some of these good young men are really not being paid enough in certain districts to keep the thing going properly.  Their job is only a part-time one, and what they make is really very small.  Perhaps something could be done in the way of increasing the grant per cow that might result in an increase of salary for the supervisors in districts where at present it is impossible for them to make anything like a reasonable salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to sub-head G 3, there is an item there for the purchase of stock bulls.  I am referring to a matter which, I fancy, the Minister anticipates, and that is that <Col N="2528" /> prior to the Royal Dublin Society's sale of bulls the Minister sent over to Scotland and purchased there a number of Aberdeen Angus bulls.  I think on the broad issue there was considerable justification for doing so, as the Minister thereby got fresh blood into the country, and he got these bulls somewhat cheaper than he would have got them here.  The fact remains, however, that the money of the Irish taxpayer, who is in some cases a breeder of bulls, was spent for the benefit of the Scottish breeder of bulls.  I do not say the Minister is not justified in going outside the Saorstát if by doing so he can buy bulls at a price at which he could not get them here.  I suggest that he should first give the Irish breeders a chance, and see whether at Ballsbridge he can get the type of bull he requires and at the price he requires.  There will always be exceptional cases in which the Minister will be justified in bringing in fresh blood.  I know the action of the Minister has caused much criticism and feeling amongst breeders of Aberdeen Angus bulls in the Saorstát. I therefore hope that the Minister will give some indication as to his future intentions.  I think it would be fair that he should have a look at Ballsbridge before going oversea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think breeders should keep quiet about this.  There are 200 premiums going a-begging at the moment, and even the ordinary premium-holder cannot get them.  Any unfortunate countryman who came up to Ballsbridge this spring could not buy a moderately good yearling premium bull for less than £100.  The fact is that breeders are getting really good prices at the moment, so good that while the premium for an Aberdeen Angus is £20, the ordinary farmers cannot touch them, and the result is that in spite of all the bulls we bought in Scotland, there are 200 premiums going a-begging.  There is a very limited number of bulls left of the premium standard, and the prices are so high that they are out of range entirely of the small farmer.  There is no question whatever of attempting to buy our extra premium bulls in Ireland.  We bought, say, 110 Aberdeen Angus bulls <Col N="2529" /> in Scotland.  If we went to the R.D.S. to buy these 110 bulls the price would have gone up from £70 to £170 for yearlings, and we would have a revolution. What would the unfortunate people who want Aberdeen Angus bulls say to it?  If we went to the R.D.S. to buy our extra premium bulls at least £50 apiece extra would have been put on to the price, and that is supposing that we were able to get them, but we could not get them.  There is a tremendously fine price at the moment for Aberdeen Angus bulls.  They are paying really well, better than for a long time&mdash;so well that the unfortunate farmer who has a premium cannot afford to purchase them.  It was pitiful to see farmers with a premium going around the Show trying to make a purchase of one of these bulls.</P>

      <P>I am talking of the time when the Minister bought the bulls.  At that time, at the March Sales in Ballsbridge, bulls fetched on the average £60.  I had five of them, and they averaged £75.  Included in the five were two prize-winners, so I presume these bulls were not worse than the average, but certainly anyone would have got a very good bull for £100.  As a matter of fact, one of my best bulls went for only £50&mdash;a March <Col N="2530" /> calf that went late in the sales.  The Minister should not wait until May to buy bulls.  He should try the March sales, and see whether the prices are what the Department can afford to give, and if he cannot get the bulls at the price he wants, then let him go to Scotland, but on this occasion he went to Scotland first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan asked for an explanation of sub-head K 2.  The Estimate is increased by £6,000 this year.  I think the idea is that the grant should be £10,000 this year and £8,500 for the following four years.  The money appears in my Vote. In that way the question as to how much will be transferred to the I.A.O.S. will rest with the Department of Agriculture, and in that way they will have a check on all the doings of the I.A.O.S., and a certain amount of control will be exercised over them.  On the other hand, I fully recognise that the I.A.O.S. is, and should remain, an independent body.  I do not think the arrangement we have come to should interfere with its independence in the least.  The State is under no obligation to give a grant, but it considers it highly desirable to do so.  It is giving it in this way on the Estimates of the Department of Agriculture, with the result that if at any time during the four or five years the work which the grant is given for is not carried out, there will be a way of dealing with the <Col N="2532" /> situation.  It provides for additional organisers and, above all, for additional accountants who will keep in close touch with the financial side of the work of the creameries, audit accounts, and generally see that the financial side which, to some extent up to the present has been neglected, is properly supervised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to make it clear what he means by keeping control.  Do I understand him to mean that of the £10,000 we are now voting it will be for the Department to pay out so much of that sum as it thinks well according to the conduct of the Society, or is it in regard to subsequent years it is proposing to keep the check?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said in that respect applies not only to the subsequent years but to this year.  I think that was always the position.  I think while the money was voted it was open to the Department to withhold portion of the Grant if they considered it right to do so, for good and sufficient reasons.  I think that is essential.  We are, of course, preserving the point of view that the I.A.O.S. is a body for which we have no responsibility, and over whose operations we have no control. The Deputy will understand if the State is giving a Grant on the Estimates of a certain Department&mdash; though indirectly&mdash;it is possible to see that the work which is being paid for is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but I think the principle has usually been that the Grant was given if the Department were satisfied that the work to be accomplished by the body receiving the Grant was likely to be carried out to its satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is right.  While we transfer the amount of money on these Estimates during the year in which it is voted, it would be open to the Department to reconsider the whole case when it would become necessary to put up a new demand to the Department of Finance.  I think that is the correct view.</P>

      <P>I want to say, on this particular sub-head, that in general while I do not approve, to any great extent, of State contributions to voluntary societies, I think the time has practically come in regard to the I.A.O.S. in which it is necessary to give it a helping hand if it is to continue doing the useful work which it has been doing in the past.  I think when the State starts to subsidise a society of this kind it should keep as much of a check as is possible over it in the circumstances.  While I have a great deal of praise for the work which has been done in the past by the I.A.O.S., I think there were defects in connection with their methods. In view of this fact I think the Dáil, in some way or another, while making this contribution, ought to have some voice, directly or indirectly, in the actual methods of organisation carried out by this organisation.  If I were to criticise the methods of the society I would say that the officials of it were inclined to be theoretical and not sufficiently practical.  I would say what they require in the future is to get men into their organisation and to organise for them, men who have a somewhat more practical turn of mind than some of those who have been working for them in the past; not by any means all, because I know some of their organisers and officials are really practical men.  I think it should come from this Dáil, now that a very generous contribution is going to the society, that we expect results.</P>
      <P>With regard to sub-head M 1 (c)&mdash; Allowances to Farmers and others in connection with keeping agricultural costings accounts&mdash;I would like to know from the Minister what stage these costings accounts have reached, how long has the Department been carrying on this work in connection with these costings accounts.  I know that they carried on that work in the past up to a certain stage.  I would like to have a statement of their work in that regard elaborated somewhat by the Minister, and I would like to know from him when we may expect pamphlets to be published by the Department showing the result of this system of costings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

There is an officer of the Department whose duty it is to collate and digest these costings, and I think it will be possible to issue some publication in connection with them within a short time.  I could not name the exact date. It is going on for two years, and there is a special officer of the Department engaged in collating, analysing, and preparing for publication the results of these costings.</P>

      <P>In the view of the terms of the sub-head, grants may be made, but in fact they are not being made.  I mentioned that a sum of £23,000 is voted this year.  There was a Supplementary Estimate, making £30,000 in all.  There is being used for stallions, bulls and agricultural implements, £10,000.  Then there is an additional £5,000 for implements and an additional £2,000 for stallions, bulls, and sprayers.  While there is the power, it is not the intention of the Department to make any advances for village halls. There are other and more urgent needs. At the same time, I do not think the sub-head should be altered, because with better times and more money we might consider making these grants.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer that quite shortly.  I have a statement here showing the prices in London, Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and Cardiff.  I <Col N="2536" /> have in the columns the prices for Irish, Danish, English, Dutch, French, and Swedish.  I find that for the twenty weeks beginning with the 2nd January the price of Irish eggs was practically the top quotation of the market.  There were only three weeks in which the quotation for Irish eggs was not the top quotation. For seventeen weeks Irish eggs held the top price and for the three weeks commencing 9th January, 27th February, and 26th March, Irish eggs were second best and Danish eggs were first. With these exceptions Irish eggs were consistently at the very top.  The very same thing applies to Manchester; with the exception of four out of twenty weeks Irish eggs were at the top.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir JAMES CRAIG Sir JAMES CRAIG">
      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The best test of all probably was when the London Egg Exchange Company, Limited, acting in conformity with the British Board of Trade during the strike, when fixing the price of eggs, put Irish eggs immediately after English new-laid eggs and before all other imported eggs.  They did that as a result of their experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Doctor HENNESSY Doctor HENNESSY">
      <NameTxt>Doctor HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards sub-head O (2), I would like to draw the attention of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture to the delay in appointing a bacteriologist under the Dairy Produce Act, 1924.  Almost one and a half years have passed and no bacteriologist has been appointed to carry out the very important administrative functions indicated under this Act.  I think the fact that there has been no appointment results in a big loss to the Government. I believe if a bacteriologist were appointed at the commencement there would be a saving of some £5,000 in fees.  As it is, there is a very substantial loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware an advertisement has been issued for a bacteriologist, but the conditions indicated in the advertisement are such that you will scarcely get any man worthy of the name to accept the post.  The salary offered is from £300 to £400, and for that salary a man must have first-class honours, be a Bachelor of Science, and, if he is to know bacteriology, he must have a degree <Col N="2537" /> in medicine, and have practically a veterinary diploma.  No bachelor of science can know bacteriology without having a knowledge of veterinary practice. We all know that milk and butter are the media of conveying the most virulent diseases.  It is bad enough, and unattractive enough, to have this salary ranging from £300 to £400, but there are other conditions. A man to attain the minimum salary must be thirty-five years of age.  A man who possesses all the qualifications set out in this advertisement, and who will accept £300 at thirty-five years of age, will not, I think, be a very desirable acquisition.</P>
    <P>The commencing age is twenty-five years, and if a young man or woman accepts the post at that age, he or she will be penalised.  In the case of a woman, the salary is reduced from £200 to £100 for a person twenty-five years of age.  I do not know why a woman should be penalised in connection with this office.  Her profession costs her as much as it will cost a man.  She is expected to do the work as well as a man, and for that reason she should be paid the same salary.  Why a bachelor cannot do the work as well as a married man, I do not know.  If he is a bachelor and is twenty-five years of age, he commences at a minimum salary of £100.</P>
    <P>This is an important matter, because it affects the whole administration of the Act.  These conditions are imposed in such a way that you will get no first-class, second-class, or third-class man to accept the post.  I do not attribute the fault to the Minister for Finance; I do attribute it to interference by the Department of Finance. An official fixes these salaries in such a way as to become a public danger, especially where professional work is concerned.  I would ask the Committee to consider this matter carefully. One and a half years have passed and we have no bacteriologist. If one is to judge by the advertisement, one does not wonder an appointment has not been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one and a half years since the Act was passed, but Deputy Doctor Hennessy will understand that the five parts of the Act could not be brought into operation <Col N="2538" /> simultaneously.  Three parts are in operation, and the five parts must be brought into operation in sequence.  In any event it would be impossible to bring the fourth part into operation less than a year after the first part.  It would, of course, be useful if we had our bacteriologist, but there are some difficulties in appointing one and fixing up the various details preliminary to filling the position.  Undoubtedly a bacteriologist appointed in connection with the Dairy Produce Act will be a very important officer and his work will be extremely useful, not only to the State but to the creameries.  A really good man can give invaluable service to the creameries by indicating the root causes affecting butter.</P>
      <P>In all these matters we are in a dilemma.  We are expected to do things really well, to tackle a big task and place Irish butter at the top of the English market in competition with Denmark and Canada.  We are in competition with countries where they do things very well, where they pay for their scientists and spare no expense on their controlled schemes.  Undoubtedly they are right in adopting that attitude.  Money saved in a matter like this is not money gained. It might be the very worst form of economy, the biggest extravagance in the long run.  We are expected to do everything as well as our competitors. We are in a dilemma.  On the one side you have people who expect a lot, and people of that type are usually, the most inefficient; the people who expect most will do least themselves, and they are the quickest to blame others.  Here we have these people begrudging anything like a decent recompense to a man who does a decent day's work.</P>

      <P>I say the Minister must give credit where credit is due, and, notwithstanding anything said from the Farmers' benches, in the past, they have now come to the conclusion by their plaudits of that passage in the Minister's speech, that when good work is required, good salaries will have to be paid, and they will no longer in future begrudge high-class salaries for high-class work.  I think that should be recognised, and I hope I have the assent of the farmers to that position.</P>

      <P>I wonder did the Deputy oppose propositions regarding reductions in those Votes on account of salaries?  I think the statement made by Deputy Hennessy rather contradicts the proposition that high-class work can only be called for if fair salaries are paid.  I have it in my mind that the work of the bacteriologist is of a very high-class character, and requires a very considerable amount of ability, and unless it is done very carefully <Col N="2540" /> and unless you have an able man or woman to fill this post, much of the value of the position will be lost.  It surprises me to hear that the Ministry is expecting to get that high-class man, or high-class woman, for the salary mentioned in the statement made by Deputy Doctor Hennessy.  I feel with him that it is unfair to expect the quality and the ability, called for for this purpose, for the salary that is offered.</P>

They have been talking nonsense when they said anything to the contrary all this time.&rdquo;  The Farmers' Party never said that good men did not deserve good salaries, but we do not say that there are not some middling men getting good salaries here, and if we compare some of the salaries given here with the salaries paid in other countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On Sub-head O (3), I put down this motion, &ldquo;To reduce <Col N="2541" /> Sub-head O (3), by £10, in order to extract from the Minister some information regarding his intention in respect to the black scab Order as it affects the North Louth Area.  I am sure the Minister will be able to get first-hand information on this matter from his colleague, the Minister for Defence.  A year ago the question was raised as to the possibility of relieving the potato, growers of this area from restrictions, or alternatively, finding some means of allowing the potato growers there to dispose of their crops.  I realise that there is a difficulty facing the department in view of the very earnest desire to prevent all risks of black scab spreading through the country.  The case as presented to me is like this:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The potato growers there were persuaded to purchase immune varieties, and they had up to a month ago in the case of one district, Bellurgan, five hundred tons of Kerr's pink potatoes for which they could find no sale.  That is to say, while they are free to export to England, as far as the Irish Department is concerned, that particular brand of potato was not in demand and there was practically no sale.  The case that is put up is that there was, at that time, about six thousand tons of potatoes in the area.  Some varieties were being sold for export at fifteen shillings to a pound a ton.  But Bellurgan, where they had these Kerr's pink variety, was practically deprived of a market because that variety was not in demand in Great Britain.  I was asked to put to the Minister that the risk of spreading disease by virtue of the distribution of any variety of potato from that area is nil at this time of the year, that that will be particularly so, if the potatoes are sent for consumption in a city; that there could be freedom with safety for sale in quantities, under some kind of supervision, to a city or even large town.  It has been put to me also that the aim of the Minister is less likely to be achieved if men who are the owners of four, five or six acres find it necessary to dispose of a sack or two for the purpose of exchange, or practically barter them for tea, coffee and sugar in the market.  The risk of the disease spreading is greater if men are tempted <Col N="2542" /> to dispose of their potatoes in that piecemeal fashion.  They get them through and because of that surreptitious method, there is greater danger of the disease spreading.  It is suggested that the Department might well and reasonably make some arrangement, now that the time for sowing has passed, to allow the distribution of immune varieties from this district to the cities and towns.</P>
    <P>The objection is raised that it is not in the potato alone that the risk lies, but also in the earth attached to it. Against that contention, it is pointed out that from the same field, turnips and cabbage may be transferred, and the risk is just as great if such a movement takes place in that way, as it is in the case of potatoes.  It is very strongly urged by the people in that area that their position is a very difficult one, inasmuch as they have grown these potatoes, and have conformed to the advice of the Department with regard to the purchase of immune seed. They have no outlet for their crop.  I do not want to make any proposal which would increase the risk of spreading the disease of black scab to other parts of the country, but on behalf of the people in that area, I plead that the Minister should consider in every possible way how he can meet the needs of that community as regards the disposition of their potatoes.  I suggest that that could be done, taking into account that the sowing season is over, and that the risk of disease spreading is practically nil at this time of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Johnson stated, the position is, that these people can export the potatoes, but they cannot send them from the scheduled area to any other part of the Free State.  That is what they want to do. It is a hard case, and I assure the Deputy that we have examined it carefully from the point of view he has expressed. We have examined it from the point of view whether it would be safe to make some arrangement whereby they could sell the potatoes, say, to the Army, or some institution where you would have control of the potatoes and of the refuse afterwards.  We <Col N="2543" /> decided that it would not be safe to do so.  The Deputy will remember that we are in the fortunate position of having black scab only in Louth and Donegal.  We are unlike Northern Ireland in this respect, and it would certainly be to our vital interest to see that that state of affairs continues.  In Northern Ireland the disease is very widespread.  It is in Down, Armagh, Antrim and Derry.  We are in the happy position that we have only two areas with black scab.  It is undoubtedly to our vital interest to take every precaution, and to see that black scab is controlled.  Having considered the question of letting these potatoes out for special purposes, such as for use by the Army or some institution, we came to the conclusion, after a lot of examination, that we could not do it.  It would be impossible even there to try and control the refuse.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Johnson pointed out, these spores of black scab are taken out not only in the potato&mdash;even in immune varieties&mdash;but also in the soil adhering to the potatoes.  That might get mixed up very easily with manure. It has been known to spread from manure a year afterwards.  That is the real trouble and the real risk.  As the Deputy stated, the planting season is now over, and it was thought that the potatoes could be let out in the certainty that they would not be used for seed, but for table purposes.  The difficulty I have mentioned stands in the way.  The refuse could very easily get mixed up through manure, and could very easily infect land into which it was brought.  The Deputy mentioned the case of mangolds and turnips, and I have no answer.  That was allowed. There is some difficulty in even justifying it.  It was allowed to go on, and has not led to any evil results.  It would certainly be wrong to extend it. When you consider it, there is less danger from mangolds and turnips. The spores are likely to be taken out with the soil as well as with the potatoes, even in immune varieties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we would be justified in making the same regulation for potatoes as is the practice in respect to mangolds and turnips.  If black scab <Col N="2544" /> spread it would be very hard to defend our position as against the hardship that there is in this small area.</P>
    <P>We have done well by Cooley.  We induced them to grow immune varieties there.  That was the best we could have done for them.  We were not able to save them from the fall in prices that has taken place all over Britain and Ireland this year.  The potatoes are, in fact, all cleared except in Bellurgan area.  On the other hand, I want Deputy Johnson to remember that they could have cleared their stocks at a better price.  The price has been falling.  In most instances they were offered a much better price at an earlier stage than the price they actually obtained afterwards.  It is the old story again of people getting into one way of farming.  There are, I know, very special reasons in that district why they should continue that method of farming.  It is peculiarly suited to potatoes.  They got into that method of farming and they refuse to change it.  They adopt the attitude that they must get what they regard as a good price for their potatoes regardless of the state of the market.</P>
    <P>In Cooley district they were undoubtedly unwise.  They refused a far better price than they took later.  In Bellurgan they did that also, and it is the only area where the potatoes are not cleared.  Possibly, they will be able to clear them yet.  Bellurgan is only a small portion of the entire area. In Cooley district we took the risk of arranging the growing of sugar beet. The arrangements that I have mentioned have been made in respect of manures.  We induced the sugar company to give that district special attention. They are getting the full contract price.  Notwithstanding that it is outside the area, the sugar company were able to arrange with the railway company for very special terms.  These terms are quite reasonable.  I think there will be 300 acres of sugar beet grown there, and the growers will be assured of a good price and of cheap transit facilities. In addition, there has been started a credit society.  Already a £600 advance has been made to that credit society.  If ever there was an area where the financing should be <Col N="2545" /> done by a credit society, it is that area. Their operations are small.  They are very small farmers.  They do not require the large amount of money that would be required for live stock.  They require only comparatively small amounts, and a credit society for them is the ideal thing.</P>
    <P>We started such a society, and we put in £600.  Having regard to all the circumstances&mdash;that we have arranged for the growing of sugar beet, that we have arranged a credit society, giving an advance which will probably be followed by more advances one of these days&mdash;I think we have done all that could reasonably be expected of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>On Sub-head O (4), I have on several occasions referred to this question of the Weeds and Seeds Act.  I should like if the Minister would state what in his opinion is the measure of usefulness of this Act or what results are derived from the expenditure <Col N="2547" /> of this £850 in the 26 counties.  My experience of the past three or four years' working of this Act is that it is practically useless in the counties where it has been adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Meath Co. Council adopted it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; practically from its inception.  As County Meath has been mentioned, I may say that there the Act has been of no particular avail. Land-owners who destroyed the weeds on their lands every year have not, since the adoption of this Act by the Meath County Council, seen an inspector. They ask why.  The question can be very simply answered.  There is too large an area under the charge of an inspector for him to give attention to the whole lot.  It is almost impossible for an inspector attending, say, to Dunshaughlin Rural District, to cover the whole of that district during the period that the weeds are supposed to be destroyed under this Act.  There is another point that could be raised in regard to this matter.  The Minister does not state in the Estimate the number of temporary inspectors employed at this work.  He does not state what salary is paid them.  So far as I can gather, the amount paid these inspectors is so small that it does not leave them in a position to be immune from corruption or bribery.  To my mind, the same must be utilised and must be working very strongly in many counties in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I might be able to give proof of it.  The Minister informed me last year, when I tabled a question about a particular estate of some 1,100 acres convinient to the town of Trim, that an inspector had paid a second visit there and had discovered that all the weeds had been destroyed on that estate.  I told the Minister that I could give him quite a contrary statement to that which he had received from his inspector, and I state the same now. The weeds were not destroyed, no matter whether the inspector called there or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2548" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said an inspector called to see whether the weeds were destroyed or not.  The inspector reported to the Minister that the weeds were destroyed.  I deduce from that that if that inspector went there and reported to the Minister that the weeds were destroyed, when they were not, that that inspector received some bribe from the owner of the land, because the report was ridiculous and false.  There was not as much as 200 acres destroyed out of the whole 1,100. That existed last year, and probably will exist this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has his own way of explaining things; in some cases he explains things to such an extent that no one knows what he is talking about at all.  The position is that the money voted under this sub-head had better be withdrawn altogether because no useful purpose is served by it, and I suggest the Minister for Lands and Agriculture should give his consideration to improving the administration of this particular Act by passing it over to the County Committee of Agriculture in the different counties where the Act is adopted and letting the instructors of that Committee do the work, or on the other hand have it passed over to the Gárda Síochána and let them administer the Act, because under the present system there is no administration at all.  The Act is a farce.  It is of no avail and this not alone applies to the County Meath but to other counties I have been through.  Last year when I was travelling with a Deputy on the Farmers' benches I pointed out to him on both sides of the railway approximately two or three hundred acres of thistles.  That proves that this Act is hopeless and of no avail, and I ask the Minister to give his consideration to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked him before to reconsider the advisability of introducing legislation to amend this Act and now I ask him again to do the same thing in connection <Col N="2549" /> with this matter, and see how it may be better administered.  I should like him to give it some consideration with a view to having the Act enforced in the manner in which it should be enforced if it were passed in another Parliament outside this.  Then the very numerous people, the farmers down the country, who evade this Act will be brought to realise their responsibility in the matter.  It is not fair to allow preferential treatment to one as against another.  Take two farmers:&mdash;one goes out and destroys weeds, no matter what the cost may be.  The other, across the mearing, lets all his weeds grow. The blossom flies away; the seed gets in on the tillage of the first farmer who has thereby as much weeds as the other man who lets his grow.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hall has, as far as I gathered from him, given a particular instance of an inspection made, and indicated a particular official, without naming him. The official can easily be identified. Deputy Hall said, that in his judgement, a temporary inspector took a bribe.  I do not know whether Deputy Hall realises what he did say.  I do not know how these inspectors work, but I am very much concerned with the general level of debate here, and with respect for ourselves.  The Deputy, as far as I understand the law in the matter, can say almost anything he pleases in the House with impunity. It is a serious thing, however, to say that a particular person took a bribe and I should like Deputy Hall to withdraw that altogether because it is a statement which he makes under the privilege of the Dáil, and a statement, which, in my judgment, ought not to have been made.</P>

The statement would not be made by me only that the Minister intervened, and I withdraw that portion which refers to the official who took the bribe.  The Minister put that question deliberately to me, and I made that statement.  The Minister informed me last year that an inspector reported to him that the <Col N="2550" /> weeds on that particular farm had been destroyed, and I pointed out to the Minister that the statement was false, and that if he received that statement, it was false.  However, I withdraw the charge of bribery.</P>

      <P>I have come to the conclusion that this Act was administered in a slipshod way.  I am forced to that conclusion, partly by a statement of the Minister himself, who informed the House some time ago that on a particular farm in the County Cork, owned by County Councillor O'Gorman, there were more thistles grown practically than in the rest of the County of Cork.  If we had an active and efficient weeds officer, that would not have occurred, but the Minister would not have been able to get in a word then at County Councillor O'Gorman.  I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Hall said.  The Act is not administered properly, and it ought to be administered properly. Take my own case.  I employ men each year to cut thistles and crop weeds. My next-door neighbour never cuts a thistle, with the result that he destroys my land each year.  I think that ought not to occur.  People, especially with large holdings, ought to be compelled to cut weeds.</P>

I was glad to hear the Minister say that he was consulting the Minister for Justice in regard to this matter, as something will have to be done.  I think there is something in Deputy Doyle's suggestion, and, perhaps, the matter could be met by giving the county instructors supervision over the other officials, as these officials may inspect some districts and ignore others.

      <P>I am concerned rather with the proposal to hand over this work of the agricultural colleges to the university without a clear understanding of what is being done. When it is all thoroughly plain, I may be able to agree with it, but it has not yet been explained.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that he has explained it in detail.  I have not the Official Report by me, but I read the newspaper report, and the clear impression which I got from that report is, that the work of the Department at Glasnevin, and the farm there, will be transferred to the university. &ldquo;With regard to Dublin, it was proposed that all the technical and experimental work should be done at the Albert College, Glasnevin, which, with the farms attached, would be transferred to University College.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not know whether this is a fair report, but perhaps the Minister would excuse me saying that he followed a bad example, and that it was very difficult to understand his statement, which was read very quickly.  But the report is clear&mdash;&ldquo;that all the technical and experimental work should be done at the Albert College, Glasnevin, which, with the farms attached, would be transferred to the University College.&rdquo;  Is that a correct statement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I think I am right in what I said.  If the work of the farms is to be transferred to University College&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended that the University shall carry out research: &ldquo;With regard to the Agricultural Faculty in University College, Dublin: It is proposed that all the technical and experimental work shall be done at the Albert Agricultural College, Glasnevin&mdash;which, with the farms attached, is to be transferred to the University College.  That is to say, practically all the work after First Arts will be done there.  In the nature of the case practically all the work, including chemistry, bacteriology, botany, animal nutrition, plant breeding, animal breeding, plant pathology, forestry, horticulture, zoology, would have to be done within a convenient distance of, or actually on, the farm. Obviously, it would be inconvenient to have laboratory work, say, in plant or animal breeding, plant pathology, in animal nutrition, agricultural chemistry, in the laboratories at one centre, and then be under the necessity of taking the students to another centre at a considerable distance for purposes of actual demonstration.  Moreover, practically all the laboratories required are at present in the Albert College.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture used to do research work in the real sense of the word in two matters, animal nutrition and plant breeding.  These two are being transferred, but so far as the ordinary technical and secondary <Col N="2556" /> education of the Department is concerned, that is not being transferred. The farms and buildings are transferred to the complete control of the College, but the work done on the farms and in the buildings will be research work and education of a university standard.  We have four other institutions, and we can continue our ordinary education in them.  Afterwards it may be found necessary to make arrangements for special courses for particularly advanced students, but that is a matter than can be discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the system should be overhauled in view of these new faculties.  I suggest that in future a scheme should be worked out by the Department under which the larger proportion of these University scholarships should be awarded to the sons and daughters of farmers so that they would be enabled to pursue a University course, both in agriculture and in dairy science.  I agree with the Minister's statement that until we have an educated people both in agricultural and dairy science we need never hope to achieve the great things that might be expected of us as an agricultural country.  Here is a chance for the Department to put into operation a practical scheme which would be of <Col N="2557" /> some reproductive benefit to the country.  We have a plague of B.A.'s, B.Sc.'s and B.Comm.'s, and now we want an army of Bachelors of Agriculture. The farming community is supplying the greater part of the money for these scholarships, and the farmers' sons and daughters should have first call on them.  By the development of these scholarships we expect that something will be done in the remote counties for the scientific and research side of agriculture.  I sincerely hope that the Department will seriously consider the suggestion that I have thrown out.</P>
      <P>I have had considerable experience of very many officials of the Department in various capacities for the past twenty-five years.  I had the honour and distinction of being a member of the Donegal County Council and the Agricultural and Technical Instruction Committee.  In these capacities I have come across a considerable number of the officials and I have always found them to be men who were inclined to do their duty without fear or favour. I am not speaking now as a champion either of the Land Commission or of the Department of Agriculture, but I think Deputy Hall made use of a very unhappy expression when he referred to some of them taking bribes.</P>

The breeding of hunters is one of the best industries we have.  It has not been quite so good for the past few years, but I believe there is a boom coming.  I am sorry to say that there is only £1,000 down for this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Even £2,000 is not enough.  It is a small amount for such an important industry.  I see that the Minister has another scheme for the breeding of agricultural horses, or the Irish draught horse, so-called.  For this scheme he has down a very much larger sum.  That is a class of horse that I think will never make up the country.  It is far less important than the hunter class to Ireland, and the amount of money that is allotted for both schemes does not total more than £4,000, while the administration of these two schemes cost somewhere about £1,200 or £1,300.  That is a rather large amount, considering the total amount to be spent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

I think £1,200 is far too large a sum to be spent on a administering a scheme the total cost of which is only £4,000 or less.  I think the administration is costing too much.  The only fault I have to find is that the Minister is not giving more money for the scheme.  At present the Minister gives nothing for nominations to mares except what he gives to Irish draught mares and except the county committees put up something of their own there is no such thing as nominations of mares to thoroughbred stallions.  I would like the Minister to increase the subsidy to this industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>These sub-heads, I think, explain themselves.  There is only one big increase, and that is I.&mdash; Improvement of Estates.  Last year it was £200,000, and this year it is £300,000.  I explained this point before. Land purchase under the 1923 Act is rather an expensive operation as compared with Land Purchase under the 1903 Act.  Under the 1903 Act interest and sinking fund was 3¼ per cent., whereas under this Act it is 4¾ per cent.  You buy land now for £20 an acre, and you have to pay an annuity of 19/- an acre.  For land bought for the same money under the Act of 1903 you pay only 13/- an acre.  That makes land purchase somewhat expensive, and it makes it very much more difficult to operate than it was under the Act of 1903.</P>
      <P>In addition to buying the land you must remember that there is no use in handing over land to a congest or a labourer without giving him a house and a stable, and possibly you have to help him to put up fences.  He has to buy the stock himself afterwards, and he finds it hard enough to do that.  The least that can be done is to lend him the money for a house or stable on reasonable terms.  The sub-head is increased to a great extent for that purpose. It is used to some extent to give grants and, to some extent, to make loans.  The increase is essential in view of what I have said.  It is essential to give a higher proportion of grants than under the 1903 Act.  When you have to buy land so that the annuity is about 19/- an acre, you will have a pretty stiff rent when you lend £300 for the building of a house.  This comes to £13 or £14 in addition, and increases the rent of the land by 8/- or 9/- or 10/- more per acre.  That is one of the reasons for the complaint one hears that land is being bought too dear now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land might be bought at a price which would work out at an annuity of 15/-.  A rather big grant is being given <Col N="2561" /> and a somewhat smaller loan, in addition, to build houses or make fences, at the rate of 4¾ per cent.  That brings up the annuity to a high figure.  The man who gets land talks about it, but he never says what the real rent is.  He lumps the whole thing&mdash;the rent charge and the interest he has to pay on the money he gets by way of a loan for building a house or making fences.  You will get people to say that it would be better, perhaps, not to make any loan to a man at all, but to let him fend for himself.  It might be more sensible, perhaps, if he were only to put up a small house at the beginning and extend it afterwards.  Others might think it would be better if he did not put up a house at all, but simply started with erecting some stables. There is a lot to be said for that point of view, but it is a procedure that is incapable of anything like wide extension. You could deal with the thing in that way in the case of a man living with his father or some relative near the land that he gets.  It might do him to put up a few stables to meet the requirements of his livestock at the start, and build a house afterwards. But in a case where you are taking a congest or a landless man out, you must find a house for him.  You have either to build a house for him at his own expense or make a loan to him or give him some small grant to supplement the loan.  We find it necessary to give fairly substantial grants because, in view of the high rate of interest and sinking fund at 4¾ per cent., it is impossible to give a larger portion of money on loan in view of the fact that it would put a rather heavy annuity on the land.  Hence, this particular sub-head has to be extended this year.</P>
    <P>Three or four months ago there was a debate on the question of land purchase and the pace at which it should go ahead.  I think I said at the time that there were only a couple of thousand acres of land purchased, and that I hoped to have about 50,000 acres divided by the 31st March.  The position at the moment is that about 60,000 acres of land have been divided under the 1903 Act; about 80,000 acres have been divided since 1923, that is, land purchased previously under the 1903 or 1909 Act, so that I am a little bit <Col N="2562" /> better than my promise.  Supposing, instead of 60,000 acres having been divided, there were 100,000 acres divided, there would still be a Deputy who knew a farm near himself that was not divided and who felt that there was the grossest neglect in not dividing that land.  That will be the way until the last farm is divided.</P>

      <P>I should say, roughly, half temporary and half permanent agreements.  I explained before that the rate at which land can be divided is increasing.  The first two or three years were taken up with preliminary work.  As will be seen from the figures, a considerable amount of preliminary work has been done.  The exact figures as regards the division of lands are: About 60,000 acres have been divided; about 80,000 acres have been priced or vested; there are between 100,000 and 200,000 acres on which a price has been offered; about 250,000 acres have been inspected with a view to offering a price, and there are between three or four hundred thousand acres in regard to which preliminary inquiries are being made for the purposes of inspection.  The first figures are the most important&mdash;that about 60,000 acres have been divided.  In regard to about 80,000 acres priced or gazetted, schemes are being prepared.  In respect to between 150,000 and 200,000 acres, an average price has been accepted. From these figures Deputies can see that as regards a very large area of land the point has been reached where there are only a few steps between, say, gazetting and division.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the <Col N="2563" /> Minister did not make a more comprehensive opening statement on this Vote, but in view of the fact that this matter was fairly fully discussed within the last four or five months, I suppose he can be excused in the circumstances. With regard to the work of the Land Commission there is a good deal of dissatisfaction throughout the country that very little of the tenanted land which comes under the 1923 Land Act has become vested in the tenants.  The Minister did not give any figures to indicate what was the acreage of land vested in the tenants under that Act. He is aware, of course, that in the case of tenants under that Act their payments in lieu of rent only give them a reduction of 25 per cent., and that their payments are not going towards the purchase of their land.  If they held under a different tenure they would be entitled to a reduction of from 35 per cent. to 25 per cent.  As far as I know, one of the obstacles in this connection is that the tenants are not able to pay up their compounded arrears of rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission, as far as I am aware, has demanded one year's compounded arrears of rent.  We have not been informed what percentage of these arrears has been paid up and how-much remains unpaid.  As the Act of 1923 stands, the tenants cannot have the lands vested in them until they have paid arrears of rent up to two and a half years, if such an amount could be due.  I and other Deputies on these benches have pointed out to the Minister that it is a very unwise thing to expect that these tenants could pay up the full compounded arrears of rent. taking into account the time at which the Act was passed, the financial position in which many of the tenants found themselves owing to the fact that they had been paying rents in many cases greatly in excess of the rents paid by purchased tenants, and also owing to the disturbed conditions that prevailed in the country.  Many of the tenants were not in a financial position to come forward and pay the full amount of the compounded arrears of rent.  As the law stands, apparently there is no possibility that the Land Act in so far as purchase is concerned <Col N="2564" /> will be put into force until the full amount of the compounded arrears of rent is paid.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that some perfectly good farmers who are in a position to pay their compound arrears of rent are being held up in regard to purchase owing to the slackness of the Land Commission in completing purchase on an estate where some of the tenants are backward as regards payments. Apparently it is the intention of the Land Commission to deal as far as possible not with individuals but with the estate as a whole, waiting until all the tenants have paid their arrears. There may be two or three bad tenants on the estate who have not paid up their arrears of rent, and who have no intention of paying it, or who may not be able to pay it, and they are holding up the good farmers, men who are in a good financial position and are able and willing to pay the balance of the compound arrears.  I think the Minister should take steps to change this state of affairs.  I believe legislation in that direction is necessary and has been adumbrated.  I think the Minister should expedite legislation in this respect because there is a good deal of dissatisfaction in regard to the slackness of the Land Commission in completing purchase under the 1923 Act. With regard to the division of land, in my county there is fairly general satisfaction with the manner in which the Land Commission is going about its work in dividing the lands.  I am not going to advocate that they should proceed with any greater expedition, because if there is any carelessness or any kind of haphazard method in regard to the division of lands resulting in men being put into possession of land who are not likely to make a success of it that would be a very great mistake.</P>
    <P>I think the first consideration in giving land should be that nobody should get it no matter what his demands or qualifications unless he is likely to make a success of the farming of it. No one wants to see a man getting land who will start to let it out on the 11 months system, and in a short time be asking the Department for permission <Col N="2565" /> to sell it again.  We prefer to see a man getting land who will become a successful farmer and an asset rather than a liability to the farming community. The division of land is a matter that ought to be approached purely from a non-party point of view. It is wrong that party capital should be made out of agitations for the purpose of having lands divided.  In my opinion, each particular case ought to be taken on its merits, and the question of the methods used in farming the lands previous to the application for division ought to be taken into account, and the suitability of the land for cultivation together with the suitability for farming it of those who acquire it should also be considered.  It is very important that land of the proper quality should be acquired.  There may be land which is fulfilling perhaps a useful purpose at present.  There is, in my opinion, a danger that some of the valuable grass land may in certain cases be acquired and divided, and the economic results may not be really advantageous to the agricultural community in general.  I am not ashamed to stand up and say that.  I believe land ought to be divided where the land is suitable for division, but, as I have stated, account should also be taken of the method by which land has been managed in the past, together with the history of the land.  Land from which tenants have been evicted within a reasonable measure of time should certainly be acquired in the first instance.  There may be certain portions of land which are not particularly suitable for division.  Perhaps the land may sometimes be so rich as to be unsuitable for cultivation.</P>
    <P>I maintain there is some land which is necessary for the fattening of cattle which are reared by the smaller farmers on medium land, and perhaps very close to first quality land, but which is not first quality fattening land.  If land of that kind is taken wholesale it will have a detrimental effect on the cattle trade.  There is a question involved of the economics of agriculture here.  It is possible that anything in the nature of unwise or hasty acquisition of land might injure agricultural interests in general.  Apart <Col N="2566" /> from that, I think that the Land Commission ought to advance with reasonable haste and complete the division of suitable land at the earliest possible date.  I inquired from the Minister some time ago as to the qualifications of landless men with regard to their getting land.  I want to know from the Minister are there any arrangements whereby the Government, or the Minister, or his Department or any other Department is in a position to advance capital to those men, so that they could be placed in a position to successfully manage land?</P>
    <P>I know it is a fact that a great many of these landless men who are applicants for land owing to the positions they have occupied as workers on the estate which is to be divided are not in possession of capital to enable them to manage the farms successfully.  At the same time I do not want to stand in their way.  I do not want to say they should not get land when these estates are being divided.  As the administration of the law stands at present, these men do not get land unless they can show that they are in possession of some capital, or that they can get it.  I think some arrangement should be made whereby long-term loans would be advanced to these men so as to place them in a position to carry out successfully the working of the farm. Perhaps sometimes a man might bring forward fictitious statements to prove that he had capital in order that he might get possession of land.  I do not confine that statement to the landless men.  The same thing applies, very often, to uneconomic holders, who are trying to get land and who know that one of the first requirements of the Land Commission is that they must have capital.  That being so, they are anxious to prove that they are in possession of capital, and in their over-anxiety they may bring forward statements that are not absolutely to be relied upon.</P>

      <P>I listened very carefully to Deputy Heffernan to try to ascertain <Col N="2567" /> from him, as the acknowledged spokesman of the Farmers' Party this evening, what the view of the farmers is in regard to the acquisition and division of lands.  Strange as it appeared, the policy he advanced now is that land should not be acquired for division unless it is suitable for division.  In other words, he disregards the number of uneconomic holders and landless men which the Minister gave the Dáil on previous occasions, and which, as far as I could gather, was a justification for the Land Act of 1923.  The Deputy spoke about the history of the ownership of the land, and mentioned that it should have some bearing on the policy of the Commissioners before they put forward proposals for its acquisition.  Roughly, his policy is that nothing should be done that would be detrimental to the interests of the cattle trade.  In other words, we should continue to increase the number of human beings that are being exported from this country rather than restrict the number of cattle that are being exported by the people on whose behalf he spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture last November, when a motion was before tha Dáil urging the Land Commissioners to speed up the acquisition and division of land. The Minister, on that occasion, informed the Dáil that, in order to help him to proceed on the lines that we advocated at the time, he and the Commissioners had to decide to acquire land and to put people in possession under temporary agreements.  So far as I know, wherever that policy has been carried out, and it has been carried out in some cases in my area, it has justified what has happened.  I have had brought under my notice cases where the people put in possession of land were not the most suitable, and certainly were not the most deserving. I think time will prove, when these people are put on temporary agreements, that they were not the most suitable people to be given divisions of land, while other and more deserving cases were overlooked.  I have heard of a case&mdash;and Deputy Dwyer knows of it, too&mdash;where a farm <Col N="2568" /> of 25 or 30 acres of land was given to a man in receipt of a pound per week from the Leix Board of Health.  I understand that the qualification for getting a division of land is, and rightly is, that the applicant should be in a position to work the land, and should have sufficient capital at his disposal to fence and stock it and to buy machinery to till it.  Therefore, so far as putting in people on temporary agreements is concerned, I think the Minister's policy in that respect will be justified by the passage of time.  If it is found in a year or two that people of that kind&mdash;I am sure the case I referred to was an isolated one&mdash;are put into possession of land, and if people are not able to work the land in the first or second years, I think it is good policy under the temporary agreements to remove these people, and to give the land to people who would be more deserving, and who would be able to make better use of it.  To that extent, I think the Minister's policy as indicated last November, was quite justified.</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister would tell us&mdash;if not now, perhaps later&mdash;how many of the 60,000 acres are actually divided at the present time, to what extent, so far as the acreage is concerned, the original landlords refused to accept the offer of the Commissioners on the ground of price, in how many cases were these offers brought before the Judicial Commissioner and what is the average increase put on by the Judicial Commissioner as a result of appeal on the price fixed by the Land Commission Inspector.  That does not apply to the 100,000 acres, because the Minister stated that the prices offered were accepted by the landlords.  I know very little about the value of land, but it has been put to me that in my own area an obstacle has been placed in the way of the Commissioners in acquiring land.  Everything possible has been done by the landlords and ranch-owners to prevent them acquiring the land, except by exercising the powers of compulsion given to them.  I, and other Deputies in my constituency, have been reprimanded and censured for not seeing that the land in the area <Col N="2569" /> is acquired with greater speed than at present.  I know it is because the landlords have put these obstacles in the way of the Commissioners, and I would like to get the figures, if the Minister has them, in regard to the attitude of the Judicial Commissioner in fixing or increasing the prices where appeals have been made.</P>
    <P>I certainly think the Minister is right in increasing the amount under sub-head I from £200,000 to £300,000, whereby he makes provision for grants for fencing and houses.  I think the increase is an indication of the greater speed with which the Commissioners propose to acquire and divide land in the coming year than in the last year. In one county in my own constituency, as far as I can gather from the figures supplied to me, there are about three times as many suitable people looking for land as there is land available, and in another county in the same constituency there is about twice as much land available as is required to meet the demands of suitable people who are looking for it.  Speaking as one who knows nothing about the value of land&mdash;I am a landless man myself and I hope I will always be a landless man &mdash;I certainly say that the land trouble is the greatest trouble that we who represent rural areas have to deal with. As soon as the Minister can get up in this Dáil&mdash;if he can during the life of the present Government&mdash;and announce that all the land that is suitable has been acquired and divided, I think the easier will be the minds of the Deputies in this House who represent rural constituencies.  I merely ask the Minister to give us the figures in regard to the cases where the prices fixed by the land inspectors have been refused by the owners, and to what extent they have been increased by the Judicial Commissioner, and to give us the figures in regard to the land already divided, the land gazetted, and any other figures of that kind that might be available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire also to refer to estates purchased under the 1923 Purchase Act and which still remain to be vested.  This time last year during <Col N="2570" /> the debate on the Land Commission Estimates I drew the attention of the Land Commission officials to the Harvey Estate on which I believe very little progress has yet been made. There are some other estates as well. What I complain about is that the Land Commission has practically done nothing in North-west Donegal under the Purchase Act of 1923.  I understand that considerable progress has been made with some estates in the west of the county, but in the North-west of the county practically nothing has been done.  I have on several occasions called at the Land Commission Offices with regard to estates in which I am interested myself in my own area. I have been approached by the tenants on the Leitrim Estate, one of the largest estates in the country, on which there are over 2,000 tenants.</P>
      <P>There has not been a Land Commission official seen on the Leitrim Estate since the passing of the 1923 Purchase Act. I do not think that is very much to the credit of the Land Commission, a great State Department, that is costing us something like £900,000 a year.  I also believe&mdash;of course I have no means of knowing whether I am right or not&mdash; that the appointed day has not been declared on an estate in the county. The Leitrim Estate is very congested, and at the present time the Earl of. Leitrim's officials are persecuting tenants about bog and seaweed, just as much as they were 50 years ago before the other old fellow was shot.  I will read a notice that has been extensively circulated on the estate and I leave the Dáil to judge if for a good while they have heard a more tyrannical pronouncement:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Notice is hereby given that any person found cutting turf or bog-wood or collecting seaweed on any part of the Earl of Leitrim's Estate who has not first obtained permission in writing to do so, signed by the Earl of Leitrim or his agent, will be prosecuted according to law.  And furthermore, any person who although having obtained such permission cuts turf or bog-wood or collects seaweed in any other place or manner than that pointed out to him by the Estate Bailiff shall be <Col N="2571" /> prosecuted as if he had not obtained such permission.</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Signed), LEITRIM.</P>
    <P>Leitrim Estates Office, Mulroy, Co.</P>
    <P>Donegal.  9th March, 1926.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That notice was sent to me shortly after it was published, and I advised the people to take the seaweed on their own lands.  Of course, I did not tell them what to do with the bailiff when he came to protest.  Another thing I want to know from the Minister is how much untenanted land has been acquired and distributed in the county since the passing of the 1923 Act.  My information is that there has been none. There is no question about it&mdash;there is land in the county that should be acquired at once and distributed among the people.  Even on the Leitrim Estate there is land that should be acquired and distributed to enlarge these congested holdings.  On this Estate of the Earl of Leitrim, where these poor people are still making payments in lieu of rent, it means something to them at the end of three or four years, not having received the full reduction that they are entitled to under the Purchase Act.  There is a considerable number of landowners in the county, and a number of sales of untenanted land to evade the Act has been made. So far as my experience goes, the landlord influence on the Land Commission is still top-dog.  On other estates that have been purchased and on unpurchased estates, there have been disputes over turbary rights where ruinous litigation followed.  The Land Commission could easily have effected an amicable settlement among these people if they had interested themselves. Last year I brought to the notice of the Land Commission officials in this House the case of the Ballyharry tenants, where their bog was taken from them by a neighbouring tenant, and where their case was the subject of an appeal to the Dáil Eireann Winding-up Court.  They were, unfortunately, defeated.  These men were entitled to bog and the bog was conveyed to them when they were purchasing under the 1903 Act.  They are still without bog.  There was a <Col N="2572" /> Land Commission official down amongst them recently endeavouring to transfer them to another bog.  I think that the Land Commission has a right to see that justice ought to be done to these people.</P>

I suppose the 1925 calendar does not hang in his office. It would be a very interesting question to know whether it is new or old time they are working on still.  I suppose that is what the Minister did not want to hear.  Sometime ago I put a question to the Minister about the amount of costs arising out of the collection of Land Commission annuities and arrears in Donegal.  I put the question to the Minister last week with regard to a poor man named McLoughlin.  In his case £2 1s. 11d. were spent in collecting a debt of 12s. 4d.

When you take, in addition, <Col N="2574" /> the amount paid in regard to defaulting tenants in various counties, you realise that this is costing the people an appalling sum.  The method of the collection of Land Commission annuities and the payment in lieu of rent in connection with the administration of the Land Commission in Donegal, is an absolute disgrace.  I told you before that it would disgrace a country auctioneer's office; as it is now, it would disgrace a poor-rate collector's office.

      <P>I do not think there is any necessity for the Minister for Finance to come to the rescue of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture. The Minister for Lands and Agriculture is the noblest Roman of all; he is able to take care of himself and his Department, and the Land Commission, too.  He will defend them, let them be right or wrong.</P>
      <P>In County Donegal thousands of acres could be reclaimed at a very small cost and on the reclaimed land large numbers of men could be placed. In addition to providing land for the very large numbers of people living in congested areas, reproductive work which would give necessary employment would be also provided.  The Minister should give serious consideration to that suggestion.  That is a thing I am perfectly sure would well repay any energy devoted to it.</P>

    <P>In the Inishowen area nothing has been done in relation to the inspection of lands with the object of applying the 1923 Act.  I have drawn the attention of the Land Commission to this <Col N="2575" /> matter on several occasions, but nothing has been done.  Mr. Commissioner O'Shiel was in Donegal last week.  I do not know what he was there for.  He was in my area.  I hope his visit to the Inishowen area will result in speeding up the application of the 1923 Land Act.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, I desire to put him a few questions in regard to County Mayo. What is the Land Commission doing to relieve congestion in County Mayo? Is the Minister aware that only 900 acres were divided under the 1923 Land Act?  There are fully 5,000 tenants in the county under a £5 valuation. I would like to know if the Land Commission has migrated a single tenant from the county under the terms of the 1923 Act?  I have here particulars of estates taken over by the Congested Districts Board 15 years ago; these estates were handed over to the Land Commission, but no effort has been made to divide them.  In the Parish of Castlebar there are over 300 tenants whose valuations are under £5.</P>
      <P>The following details may be of interest to the Minister:&mdash;Parish of Mayo Abbey, 120 tenants under £5; Westport, 350 tenants; Kiltimagh, 290; Achill, 300; Ballindine, 290; Islandady, 300; Balla, 310; Keelogues, 290; Knock, 270; Aghamore, 190; Tourmakeady, 400; Partry, 120; Newport, 210 and Kilmeena, 290.  The Land Commission has done absolutely nothing under the 1923 Act to relieve congestion.  Amongst the estates taken over 15 years ago by the C.D. Board, and that are yet undivided, are the following:&mdash;De Clifford, Lynch Blosse, Palmer, Sligo, Monica Lynch and Clements.  I say it is a disgrace that the Land Commission has not made some effort to remedy matters and the Government should not permit such a state of affairs to exist.  The Land Act has been in operation three years and nothing appreciable has been done in County Mayo.  The Act was passed primarily to relieve congestion, and yet in a county where congestion is most acute no effort has been made to relieve it.  I emphasise that it is a disgraceful state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like if the Minister would make it clear whether it is absolutely essential to have capital to be entitled to some land.  It has been rumoured, in many parts of the country, that tenants of labourers' cottages are not eligible to receive holdings on an estate because of the fact that they are tenants of labourers' cottages.  I am informed that that rumour arose out of a statement made by an Inspector of the Land Commission. With regard to what Deputy Heffernan said as to the sort of land which should or should not be divided I think he had in mind a particular ranch in his constituency.  It might be no harm to explain to the Dáil that the owner of this ranch holds 1,200 acres of land.  He has 600 acres with the house in which he lives, and he has 600 acres, further away, which he uses solely for the purpose of fattening cattle for export.  In and around the parish where he has this 600 acres there are small farmers and landless men who have not as much land as would enable them to grow a head of cabbage.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, that in a case like that, where an individual has 600 acres. with his house, and a further 600 acres of the best land in a county like Tipperary there is no justification for leaving him the whole 1,200 acres when portion of it is so badly needed for distribution.  It all boils down to this: whether it is better business to use the land for the fattening of bullocks or to allow people to live on it.</P>

      <P>As one who took a prominent part in the land struggle and especially in that aspect of it regarding the sub-division of land, I must say I have no complaint, so far as the constituency I represent is concerned, regarding the work done by the Irish Land Commission.  The speed has not been as rapid as the people were led to expect, but anybody who has any knowledge of the question must understand the difficulty the Land Commission has had to contend with, in a lot of these cases, and for that reason I have all along advised the people that the Land Commission could proceed with no greater haste than they are doing.  In the two counties I represent they have gone on well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two or three things that I think the Land Commission could have done better.  I would like the Minister to tell the Committee what is the intention of the Government with regard to these things.  One of these is land bought through the National Land Bank.  I put a question the other day as to the amount of land purchased with money advanced through that Bank and the reply I got was that 17,000 acres had been purchased for £300,000 or thereabouts.  That land was purchased through co-operative societies and other classes who combined together and got the money from the Bank.  They have been working that land since.  They paid down some small sum.  In one particular area in my constituency 215 statute acres was purchased through the Land Bank, at a cost of £9,336.  That is roughly 133 Irish acres.  It was published in the <i>Gazette</i> that since 4th March, 1925, this 133 Irish acres or 215 statute acres, is the property of the Irish Land Commission, and that there is to be an annuity <Col N="2578" /> paid, by the men who purchased, of £403 annually.  That is over £3 an acre these men, have to pay.</P>
    <P>I understand it is the intention of the Government to introduce legislation on this matter.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether his Department will re-value that land, and buy it back at a price, or is the State to suffer a loss?  There are other cases of lots of land bought through the Joint Stock Banks similar to what was bought through the National Land Bank.  I had two men with me to-day that bought the Greville Nugent estate, near Delvin, and gave £22,000 for it.  They paid down £11,000, and borrowed £11,000 from one of the Joint Stock Banks.  That has to be paid yet.  This estate was divided by these men into thirty-two holdings, which were apportioned out, and this £11,000 has to be paid to the bank, and all these men are jointly and severally securities for it.  You cannot make fish of one class of men and flesh of another.  If you bring in legislation to cut the loss for land purchase made through the National Land Bank, what are you going to do for the Joint Stock Banks?  They should be treated similarly, and for this reason I take the opportunity of asking the Minister what the Government intend to do.  Any one can see in these particular cases that speed is necessary.  Why?  Take the case of these men owing £11,000.  They pay 6 per cent., which is £660 a year.  That is accumulating every week.  I have another case of an estate that was bought for £17,000.  The Land Commission sent down an inspector, and the price that he would give was £11,400. This estate was bought through a Joint Stock Bank, and the difference between what the Land Commission would give and what these people paid is the difference between £11,000 and £17,000, with interest accumulating.</P>
    <P>Now with regard to the class of men that are being put on the land, there is very little dissatisfaction with the class of tenants selected in the Midlands. The inspectors are good and efficient, and they have picked out the proper type of people.  And what I like above all is the way that the Government are <Col N="2579" /> dividing the land, which is a much better way than when it was divided under the old British system. Under the British system, small holders got small patches, and the holdings were not consolidated.  Some years afterwards, these men put up the farms for sale.  Now, the Minister's Department is consolidating the holdings of uneconomic holders.  Uneconomic holders are having their holdings made economic by having their farms put in with the land they are getting under the Act.  If they are going to sell, they will have to sell the entire land, which is different from the system that obtained under the British administration.</P>
    <P>As regards the labourers, I must say that the Department has been very fair in my county.  Where there was a labourer living on an estate which was divided, as a result of which this man would be deprived of employment, he got a piece of land there.  As a result, farmers and labourers and uneconomic holders are reasonably satisfied.  But we must realise that there is not sufficient land to go round.  The Government were wise in dealing with the problem as they did.  The question was as to what should be done with migrants from the West of Ireland. That is a problem which puzzled Mr. Birrell and puzzled the old administration at every turn.  This Government set about dealing with it in the proper way.  If you started to shift migrants from the West without relieving the congestion existing locally, you would only start civil war.  I sympathise with the people of the West.  Nobody knows the conditions there better than I do.  I know every stone on the road in the province of Connacht and nothing would please me better than that I should be able to help in remedying the conditions that exist there.  But as I have said, if you shifted migrants without relieving congestion locally, it would only lead to another civil war.</P>
    <P>There is another point on which I would like to get some explanation.  A number of men who hold land under free farm grants are dissatisfied and say they were not fairly treated.  I know there is a section of the Act by which they can redeem.  I would like <Col N="2580" /> to know if any further legislation is projected in connection with those men.</P>

      <P>I think there is a general consensus of opinion amongst Deputies on these benches that the work being done by the Department is fairly satisfactory.  I should like to refer to remarks that are passed sometimes in a jocose way with regard to this Party.  These remarks may be jocose but there is a sting in them. Remarks are sometimes made about members of this Party having ranches, and the suggestion is that that is the type we are associated with.  For the information of the House, I should like to say that the fathers and grandfathers of the men sitting on these benches were in the front rank of the land struggle.  The other evening, in my own house, I read where Mr. Heffernan, father of Deputy Heffernan, was the man who proposed the resolutions at Cahir meeting in 1880, at which Parnell and Davitt were present.  Amongst the series of meetings held about the same time, was a meeting at Ballyconnell, Co. Cavan, and it was the grandfather of Deputy Baxter who proposed the resolutions there.  I should like to remove from the minds of the public the impression that might be given by sarcastic remarks addressed to this Party regarding itself and its followers.  The men who represent the Irish farmers on these benches are the sons and grandsons of the men who were first to drive the nail in the coffin of landlordism. We are here to-night nailing down the lid of that coffin.</P>

      <P>So far as the majority of the people of County Galway are concerned, they are well pleased with the work of the Land Commission.  Numerous complaints have, however, reached me as to the delay in dealing with the division of estates in the Connemara area. Connemara is the poorest part of the county, but, at the same time, they are a thrifty people and they meet their liabilities so far as rents and rates are concerned.  They are, therefore, entitled to fair consideration from the Land Commission.  I should be glad if the Minister would state that it is the intention of the Land Commission to deal immediately with the purchase and distribution of estates in the Connemara area.  He may, perhaps, explain that there is not enough land to go round but a number of land holders in Connemara have expressed their willingness to migrate from the Connemara area and make room for the smaller tenants.  A good deal of land could be obtained in that way.  There is also in the neighbourhood of Clonbur the Iver property and there is other property which could be taken over for distribution amongst a number of congests in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that we had a full discussion on the distribution of land some months ago and that there is now very little to be said in connection with the subject. I am satisfied that since the introduction of the temporary convenience agreements at the beginning of this year land division is now proceeding at a reasonably increased rate. I think it is possible to increase the pace still more.  A fair amount of land has been divided in my constituency during the past two months but, prior to that, practically nothing had been done.  Complaints are very general that when schemes are sent in by the inspectors to the Land Commission there is a very long delay before they are released to the inspectors for sub-division. As far as Co. Sligo and Co. Mayo are concerned I know that there are schemes in the hands of the Land <Col N="2582" /> Commission for three, four, or five months, and that they have not been released for sub-division.  I consider that period too long.  I understand that during the past few weeks the Minister has taken steps to see that schemes are released more rapidly.</P>
      <P>In order to expedite land distribution I would make a few suggestions to the Minister.  The Minister is aware that quite a number of estates are offered for sale to the Land Commission through local inspectors.  I refer to estates subject to Land Commission annuities.  I would suggest that the chief land inspector in the area should be given discretionary powers to arrange the price.  So far as I know, these inspectors are very capable and very shrewd men, who know the value of land and understand local conditions. The Minister could with safety give these men a certain amount of discretionary power in arranging the price.  Another suggestion is, when the Land Commission decide to acquire estates, and such estates have been listed for acquisition, that while negotiations as to price are proceeding, the local inspector might be instructed to prepare a scheme for sub-division.  In that way the sub-division of these estates would be speeded up.  A third suggestion I would make is that the inspectors should be allowed to proceed with the preliminary inspections without waiting for instructions from the Land Commission.  In the country it is customary for T.D.'s, clergymen and others to give a list of estates to the inspectors that are suitable for acquisition. In such cases I would suggest, where the inspector is satisfied that the estates are suitable for sub-division, that he should be allowed to proceed with preliminary inquiries.  In that way I believe a considerable amount of time would be saved.  When the estates are acquired it would mean that they would be distributed two or three months sooner than would be the case in the ordinary way.  I make these suggestions to the Minister for his consideration.</P>

      <P>A great deal has been said about the distribution of land and the vesting of estates where <Col N="2583" /> no difficulties arise.  I think it is a great injustice to tenants that the arrangements in connection with the vesting of land have not been pushed on more quickly.  The delay means that the tenants are losing considerable advantages to which they are entitled. These people were out in the cold for a long time.  They could not purchase their holdings, and up to two or three years ago they were paying rack rents.  The vesting of these estates should be speeded up.  I have not heard during the debate any reference to the claims of the evicted tenants, many of whom have been out of their old homes since the '80's.  Their claims have been considered by the inspectors, and some of them, I am sure, must have received favourable consideration. Through no fault of their own these people were evicted in the '80's. Some of them went out on principle in the early days of the big land war, and others were evicted for non-payment of the rack rents that then prevailed. I have seldom heard any mention, even in the Dáil, of the claims of these people.  The evicted tenants of the '80's were the backbone of the land war and, up to the present, I do not think the Land Commission has given very much consideration to their claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2584" /> It is time that some of these deserving cases received recognition, and were either reinstated in their holdings or provided with land elsewhere.  The Minister I know stated that they were the last to be dealt with under the 1923 Act.  Whether that is so or not I do not know.  I think these people have as good a claim as some of the congests.  The Minister I know stated that the evicted tenants could not be dealt with until the congests were dealt with.  A large portion of the congests have been dealt with, according to the reports we heard to-night, so that the time has arrived when something should be done for the evicted tenants.</P>
