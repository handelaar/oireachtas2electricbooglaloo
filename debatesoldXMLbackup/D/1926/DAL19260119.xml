      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that on 22nd December, 1924, a letter was addressed to the Secretary, Claims Committee, Indemnity Act, Room 7, Government Buildings, Dublin, enclosing details of a claim under the above Act; that this letter was acknowledged on Form M.F.4, Reference 406/95/1417, dated 24th December, 1924; that on 21st March, 1925, claimant's solicitor interviewed the Secretary of this Committee and was informed that this claim would come on for hearing on 26th March, 1925, and that the documents and particulars of claim lodged were in order and that the attendance of counsel or solicitor was unnecessary; and that the result would be notified to him in due course; that the solicitor wrote repeatedly to the Secretary of the Committee at 19 Earlsfort Terrace after 26th March, asking to be informed of the result, but that he has never received a reply; that the solicitor called at the office of the Committee about 27th May, 1925, when he was informed that the claim would be heard on 4th June, 1925; that three letters in June and one in July were written to the Secretary of the Committee by the solicitor without response; that the solicitor again called at the office of the Committee on 3rd September, 1925, when he was informed that the case <Col N="2" /> would be listed for hearing on 20th of that month; that he wrote on 18th September and on 3rd November, asking to be informed of the result, but that he has had no reply; and if the Minister will say whether this Committee is really functioning, and, if so, if this is the normal method of dealing with claims.</P>

      <P>I have caused inquiries to be made in regard to the claim mentioned by the Deputy, which would appear to be that of William McAuliffe, of Abbeyfeale, Co. Limerick, and am informed that the Committee set up under the Indemnity Act, 1924, have not yet found it possible to reach a decision in the matter.  It is by no means certain that the case falls within the scope of the Committee's powers under the Act, and the claimant's solicitor was so informed when the claim was originally made.</P>
      <P>The Committee are disposing of all claims lodged with them with the greatest rapidity possible, and they have already made a very large number of recommendations.  The present case is exceptional in its nature, and I think that it might fairly have been assumed that the delay which has occurred in disposing of it was due to that fact.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware of the numerous complaints from Youghal Urban District Council and from residents of Redbarn, near Youghal, Co. Cork, of the serious erosion along the foreshore at Redbarn; whether he will have investigations and reports made at an early date by the Board of Works into the nature of, the damage caused by, and probable cost of protection of property <Col N="4" /> against this erosion, and whether he will set aside out of the Relief Grant a reasonable sum towards the protection of these lands and property; whether the Board of Works, or other Department have previously investigated the damage caused by this erosion, and whether a loan on reasonable terms to Youghal Urban District Council or Cork County Council to cover the cost of a necessary protection wall or dam would be arranged.</P>

The question to which the Deputy refers, whether steps can be taken to repair the damage is, however, still under consideration by the Land Commission.</P>

The recommendation of the Court of Referees was that benefit be disallowed.

Mr. McCormack did not establish a claim in respect of the necessary pre-Truce service, namely, active military service during the week commencing the 23rd April, 1916, or throughout either the period from the 1st April, 1920, to the 31st March, 1921, or the period from the 1st April, 1921, to the 11th July, 1921.

Kildare, between 12 and 1 a.m. on December 9th, 1925, on pretext of looking for escaped prisoners; that Mr. Murphy, it is stated, was roughly handled and died as a result on December 21st, 1925, and whether he will have an investigation made into the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had careful inquiries instituted into the matters referred to in the question, and I am satisfied that the statements contained therein are inaccurate.  The facts of the case are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A party of detectives, accompanied by a Gárda in uniform from Celbridge Station, arrived at the house of Timothy Murphy between 11.50 p.m. and midnight on the night of the 8th-9th December last to search for prisoners escaped from custody and for arms.  On arrival they demanded admittance, informing the occupants that they were police and had come to search the house and that they were accompanied by a Gárda in uniform from Celbridge known to the occupants. Admittance was refused.  Mr. Murphy was then asked to come to the window to identify the Gárda in uniform. This he refused to do.  Fire was then opened upon the Gárda from a window in the upper portion of the house.  The detectives returned the fire. It is necessary to explain that the Gárda believed that the men whom they were seeking were armed, and naturally the fire from the house had the effect of convincing them that the men they were seeking were in fact in the house.  Eventually some of the detectives forced open the door and entered the house.  A number of doors inside the house, which were locked, were also forced open.  After entering <Col N="10" /> the house, all the rooms, save one, which was locked, were searched.  The party met Mrs. Murphy, wife of Timothy Murphy, who at once identified the Gárda in uniform.  Mrs. Murphy was asked to state who were in the house, and replied that she herself, her husband, and her maid were the only occupants.  She was asked who was in the locked room, and stated that her husband was.  She was asked to request him to stop firing, which she did, stating that there was a Gárda from Celbridge there, whom she knew. Mr. Murphy refused.  He was again asked to go to the window and told that a light would be flashed on the Gárda so that he could identify him and be satisfied the party were police. He refused to go to the window.  The maid was then sent to the door to ask Mr. Murphy to open it.  He again refused, saying &ldquo; You can leave a Guard there until morning.&rdquo;  An employee of Mr. Murphy's, Lawrence Dunne, who slept in a room in a loft outside, was then brought in, and he and the Gárda in uniform went to the door of the locked room, and the Gárda said: &ldquo;Your man, Lawrence Dunne, is here now and recognises me as a Gárda from Celbridge Station.&rdquo;  Mr. Murphy still refused to open the door.  During the colloquy Mr. Murphy had threatened to shoot anyone who entered the room. The door of this room was finally forced and Mr. Murphy was found in the room.  He had a revolver containing six spent cartridges, of which some were on the floor.  He apologised to the Gárda for the trouble given, and said that he believed them to be robbers. The detectives were in the room for a period of from seven to ten minutes.  During this time they searched the room.  No detective laid hands on Mr. Murphy.  When leaving they took with them the revolver.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Murphy has made and signed a statement concerning the search in which the following passage occurs:&mdash;&ldquo;They remained in the room with my husband for about seven minutes. They were kind to my husband and were a very nice crowd of chaps.  I am positive they did not interfere with my husband in any way, and they did not pull him about or touch him at all. <Col N="11" /> I liked the boys who called.  They took the revolver and shot-gun with them and departed on friendly terms with my husband, and when they were leaving I thanked them for their courtesy under the circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know if the pneumonia which Mr. Murphy subsequently contracted was in any way due to the events of the night in question, but if it were I am satisfied that Mr. Murphy was not roughly handled, and that any exposure suffered by him was attributable solely to his own action in refusing to admit the Gárda after every opportunity was afforded him of satisfying himself as to their identity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister has said, may I ask if there is any way of satisfying householders that people stating they are detectives demanding admittance are what they represent themselves to be?  I ask that because of the fact that the people about the neighbourhood are quite satisfied that Mr. Murphy did not understand that the men seeking admittance to his house on the 9th January were Gárdaí.  It would mean that a repetition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We all know that people come to men's houses in the middle of the night demanding admittance, who have no right to be there at all, and who are not Gárdaí.</P>

      <P>I do not know what more could have been done by the party of Gárdaí than was, in fact, done on the occasion.  Members of the Detective Branch carry identification cards, and these could have been produced to Mr. Murphy if he had asked for them.  He did not ask for them, and he refused to come to the window to identify the uniformed man from the Celbridge Station.  When his wife and his employee assured him that the men were Gárdaí, and that there was a Gárda in uniform from the Celbridge <Col N="12" /> Station with them, it did not seem to bring about any particular improvement in the position.  Looking at the matter from the facts as reported to me, I cannot see that any further step could have been taken to satisfy Mr. Murphy as to the identity of the party or to allay his fears that they were other than what they represented themselves to be.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that on December 22nd, 1925, a general raid was made on the persons and premises of railwaymen of all grades in different parts of the Saorstát, by men in plain clothes claiming to be detectives, but producing no warrants; whether he is aware that in some cases engine drivers and firemen were, it is alleged, taken from their engines in the presence of the passengers, subjected to a rigorous search, and in certain instances compelled to remove part of their clothing, including their boots; whether in some instances it is stated the search party indulged in party expressions and jeers at the expense of the men they were searching; and whether simultaneously and on previous dates it is alleged the homes of these men, as well as the homes of station-masters and other railway employees, were also raided by plain clothes men and ransacked; if the Minister will inform the Dáil of the reason for this search of railwaymen, and if he will give an assurance that in any similar circumstances in the future, the identity of the search party as officers of the State will be fully established before the search takes place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need not be unduly alarmed.  The action was taken as a result of certain documents found in the office of the person who acted as Director of Intelligence for the Irregular Organisation.  The names of certain railway employees were found listed there as friendly persons <Col N="14" /> who could be relied upon to do service.  As a result of that, this simultaneous hold-up throughout the country, and a search of men whom we had good reason to suspect, was undertaken last month.  If it can be shown that any improper conduct on the part of the Gárdaí took place on the occasion we can deal with it.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister issue general, but definite, instructions that searches on no account shall be undertaken by Guards in plain clothes &mdash;at any rate unless they show some authority?

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, persons who are detectives cannot go around wearing some open insignia to show that they are detectives.  That would defeat the end in view.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am open to consider any suggestions that Deputy Redmond or Deputy Johnson may care to make in the matter.  I know of no more satisfactory safeguard than the one that exists, that these officers carry an identification card.  It should be produced whenever there is the slightest need for its production.  A plain-clothes officer proceeding to do some official act such as the making of an arrest or search should, in the first instance, state his authority for that. The next is the supporting evidence. If it is not sufficient, there is then the identification card to be produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the case of some raids referred to in this question the houses of station-masters and clerks were entered without the production of that card?  Will he, in view of the fact that these people hold the keys of safes containing money and valuables, insist that documentary evidence must be produced before they enter the house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Their cards should be produced if any real question of their identity is raised, but they need not be produced if they are accepted as being what they represent themselves to be.  A man says: &ldquo;I am going to search this house.  I am a member of the Civic Guard.&rdquo;  If that is accepted the production of the identification card is unnecessary, but all those officers carry means of establishing <Col N="16" /> themselves, and should produce it when necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister deal with the question from this point of view: that if the onus of producing the identification is placed on officers in the first instance, then a great deal of trouble will be avoided. As it is at present, there is a conflict between the two persons, and it is only after a good deal of barging, to use a slang word, that the officer produces his identification.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Police Forces Amalgamation Bill (Amendment), 1925.  I explained, I think, on First Reading what the chief object of this Bill is. Last year we passed a Bill amalgamating the Metropolitan Police with the <Col N="31" /> Gárda Síochána, and by the provisions of that Bill we decided to reduce the amount of the rate which is struck in Dublin in aid of the police force.  There was an eightpenny rate struck annually in Dublin, and it was decided by the Dáil that that should disappear over a period of eight years, being reduced each year by one penny in the pound.</P>
      <P>The Bill was introduced here in November, 1924.  It had passed through all its stages by the middle of February, 1925.  It passed its fourth stage in the Seanad on the 18th March, and then, contrary to my anticipations, the Seanad adjourned that evening for a week, and the final stage was not taken until 25th March.  The seven days ran to the 2nd April before the Bill was signed, and unless we pass this small amending Bill, the effect of that accident would be that because the Bill overlapped by two days into another financial year, that relief of one penny in the £ for the rates in Dublin would not be forthcoming in this financial year, and would not arise until the financial year 1927-8.  We think it would be scarcely fair to take advantage of a mere accident of that kind, and the only effect of this Bill is to carry out the original intention, namely, that the relief for the Dublin rates would come in as from this forthcoming financial year.  The proposed reduction to 7d. for the coming year will mean a relief to the ratepayers of about £6,500.  Deputies will remember that that means a corresponding increase in the Gárda Síochána estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the main purpose of the Bill, but simply because we are legislating and amending the main Act which was passed last year.  I am asking further for power to make regulations for the formation of amalgamated representative bodies.  It is permissive rather than mandatory.  The position at the moment with regard to representative bodies in the police is that outside the metropolitan area there are two representative bodies, one for officers and one for the lower ranks; and inside the metropolitan area five representative bodies, one for the members of each rank serving in the area.  So that altogether <Col N="32" /> we have no less than seven representative bodies to deal with, while we have only a single police force. Clearly, if it can be brought about, it is desirable to have simply amalgamated representative bodies dealing with the needs of the entire force, and because statutory power is still lacking for that, there is inserted in this Bill a provision giving permissive power to make regulations for the existence of such bodies.  These regulations would, of course, under Section 14 of the main Act, need to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for approval.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="STREET TRADING BILL," RHead="1925&mdash;SECOND STAGE">
    <Title>STREET TRADING BILL, 1925&mdash;SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Street Trading Bill, 1925.  This is a Bill not for the abolition of what is known as street trading, but for its better regulation and control.  For some time back&mdash;a year or two&mdash;I have had complaints from two sources with regard to abuses arising from the practice of street trading in Dublin.  The police complain that the matter was an abuse in that the existing legislation was inadequate to deal with it, and merchants and shopkeepers in certain streets in the city complain that the paths outside their premises were blocked by street traders in such a way that people could not conveniently secure access to their premises.  Looking into that, we find that the position is pretty much as represented, both by the business people of the city and by the police; that an abuse undoubtedly exists, and no existing legislation is sufficient to meet the situation fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Police Act of 1842 and the Summary Jurisdiction Act of 1851 make it an offence to obstruct the public in their use of a highway, but actual obstruction by some one or more individuals must be proved before a conviction can be obtained, and in practice a conviction under one or other of those Acts is a matter of considerable difficulty.  The police find it difficult to deal with cases of obstruction by street traders.  The ordinary individual will naturally put up with a <Col N="33" /> considerable amount of inconvenience in passing through a street or along a path before he will put himself in the position practically of a plaintiff or State witness in a prosecution.  Street traders have for the last few years been establishing themselves in many streets throughout the city where trading of that kind was not previously carried on, with the result that where proceedings have been instituted against them for obstruction, the argument has been advanced that a conviction would have the effect of depriving the traders of their means of livelihood.  District Justices in Dublin have been impressed with that argument, and have indicated that in their opinion this practice of street trading, which is of comparatively recent growth, cannot be satisfactorily dealt with under the Acts of 1842 or 1851.  We were convinced, therefore, that further legislation was necessary&mdash;legislation which, while permitting street trading and thus preserving the means of livelihood for the persons engaged therein, would regulate and control traders, so that there would be no undue interference with traffic on the highway or with those engaged in carrying on business in shops and premises throughout the city.  That is the object of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The class of persons affected by the Bill may be roughly described as those who carry on their business otherwise than in shops or places of business, and there are really three distinct classes of traders of that kind who have been subject to legislative control under legislation of the past.  There is an old Act of 1871 called the Pedlars Act.  A pedlar was defined as a person who, without a beast of burden, travels from town to town or to other men's houses carrying or exposing for sale any goods or merchandise.  A pedlar had to obtain a yearly certificate in respect of which a fee of 5/- was payable to the police yearly.  Then there was an Act of 1888&mdash;the Hawkers Act&mdash;and a hawker.  I find, is a person who travels with a beast of burden and goes from place to place selling goods or merchandise, or who travels by any means of locomotion to any place in which he does not usually reside or carry on business, and who sells, or exposes for sale any goods or merchandise.  The <Col N="34" /> hawker had to obtain a yearly certificate in respect of which an Excise fee of £2 was payable to the Revenue Commissioners. So you have there a distinction between a pedlar, who went without a beast of burden, and a hawker who had his beast of burden. It was probably the first act of a prosperous pedlar to become a hawker by securing a beast of burden.</P>
    <P>There are other classes of traders, such as persons selling vegetables or coal, who were exempted from the obtaining of a hawker's certificate.  The street trader, over whom it is sought to have control under this Bill, will not, as a general rule, come within the definition of either a pedlar or a hawker. Street traders reside in the city of Dublin and, for the most part, sell their wares on the street, either on a pitch taken up there or by moving from street to street, carrying their wares in their hands or in small receptacles.  Where in any case, owing to the nature of the trading carried on by any street trader, he may be deemed to fall within the definition of either a hawker or pedlar, the obtaining of a street trader's certificate under this Bill will relieve him of the necessity of obtaining a certificate under either the Pedlars Act or the Hawkers Act of 1888.</P>
    <P>The object of the Bill, therefore, is not to abolish street trading, but control and regulate it, and provision is made by which any person desirous of engaging in street trading must first obtain an annual certificate from the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána, for which a fee of 5/- will be payable. The fee is charged simply in consideration of the amount of work involved in the registration and control of street traders.  That police certificate will entitle a person who is content with carrying his wares through the street in his hands, or in a small receptacle, to carry on his business.  Street traders who have obtained that certificate from the Commissioner of Police and who are desirous of setting up a stall in the street for the purpose of their trade must obtain a further annual stall trader's licence from the Corporation, for which an additional fee of 5/- will be payable.  That 5/- fee will to some extent, recoup the Corporation for the additional expense incurred by <Col N="35" /> them in registering and controlling stall traders and removing from the streets the refuse left by them around their stalls.  Power is reserved to the Corporation to make by-laws to prohibit stall trading, or any particular class of stall trading, in any specified street in the city, and generally regulating the business of stall trading with the view to ensuring the utmost cleanliness where articles of food are sold on stalls, and to prevent an undue accumulation of refuse as a result of that trading.  Power is given to the Minister for Justice to make regulations prescribing the form of street traders' certificates and licences, the limits of the sizes of the receptacles to be carried by the street traders moving through the streets, the form of register to be kept, and the prohibition of stall trading in any particular street in the city.  That power will be exercised only with a view to removing any undue interference with traffic through the streets.</P>
    <P>Certain offences are created by the Bill and penalties prescribed for breaches of its provisions.  Power is given to Justices of the District Court to revoke a street trader's licence if, in any case, they should think fit to do so. Certain necessary powers of seizure and sale are vested in the members of the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    <P>This Bill is introduced primarily to deal with the situation which, undoubtedly, has arisen here in the city of Dublin, but it is thought wise to leave it open to any Corporation or Council of any city or town in the Saorstát which has a population exceeding 5,000, and which thinks in the interests of the people living in or having recourse to such city or town that regulations of this kind are required, to adopt the Bill, so that it would be open to Cork, Waterford, Wexford, or any other city in the Saorstát, which considers that the Bill would be an advantage, to do so.</P>

      <P>No, it simply seems the commonsense provision.  I doubt if the necessity for the Bill would be found to exist in any small towns through the country, but that is a matter we could consider in Committee. I would not have any very fixed views about that.  The Bill is based on representations which reached us and which we found to be sound with regard to Dublin, and it will be open then to Corporations or Town Councils elsewhere in the cities or larger towns to adopt its provisions, if they think fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>As it strikes me, the Bill in its intentions is good, but its methods seem to be difficult to understand. That is to say you are legislating to give authority to the police to do certain things regarding local trading, and in the same Bill you are legislating to give the Corporation power to make by-laws.  The police who are under a central authority must make themselves conversant with all the by-laws which the Corporation may make, and in a general way there is a kind of cross reference right through the Bill which strikes one as being rather odd and not very satisfactory.  I hoped that we would have gone towards the ideal of making the local authority the body which would be responsible for the conduct of affairs relating to street trading and like matters, but we are emphasising the centralisation idea by legislating in respect to Dublin and giving the police of Dublin those powers whether the Corporation&mdash;as it may be some day&mdash;or whatever the local authority may be, desire such powers to be enforced or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point of immediate criticism to which I want to draw the Minister's attention is Section 10.  It seems to me the powers granted are too drastic. &ldquo;Any member of the Gárda Síochána may, without warrant, arrest any person whom he believes to be selling, or offering, exposing, or carrying for sale, any goods in contravention of this Act, or of any regulation or by-law made thereunder.&rdquo;  Now, by-laws may be very trifling things in matters of ordinary detail.  In matters of administrative detail they usually are, and to give power to a policeman to arrest a person <Col N="37" /> for a breach of a by-law, which may be quite trifling in its incidence, is quite too drastic, and puts too much power into the hands of a policeman. I think, on that point, there should be an alteration made in the Bill.  That is the only point of criticism I want to make at this stage.</P>

I think it would be well if the Minister considered the advisability of giving such powers under the Bill to urban districts with a population of less than 5,000.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that I welcome this Bill.  Numerous complaints have reached me from all parts of my constituency in connection with this matter of street trading.  For some years past we have had a lot of visitors from the other side&mdash;people coming to these towns and selling drapery and goods of that kind to the great detriment of the local shopkeepers and the residents who, of course, have to pay heavy rates and taxes for the upkeep of their town. With regard to the points raised by Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Conlan, I think the Minister ought to give due consideration to the representations that they have made.  There are two towns in my constituency which have a population of under 5,000, and it is from these that I have received most representations asking that something should be done in order to minimise this trouble.  I would appeal to the Minister to give serious consideration to the matter.  I welcome the Bill, and hope it will have a speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is the intention, in the Bill or in the mind of the Minister, that the Bill should apply to such traders as farmers who come into towns on fair days to sell their stock.

      <P>I desire to draw the Minister's attention to the practice, still prevalent in many parts of the country, of holding fairs on the public streets of towns.  I think it is a practice which, if possible, should be done away with as being both unhygienic and as not being suitable for the object for which the fair is being held. In some towns special places are set apart for the holding of fairs, such as fair greens or market squares, but in the majority of cases&mdash;certainly throughout the South in the Saorstát&mdash; I am afraid the fairs are held all over the towns.  That is not to the benefit of the farmer who is selling his stock or of those who are buying, and is certainly not to the benefit of the residents of the towns where fairs are held on the streets.  As the Minister stated, this Bill deals more widely with pedlars on the one hand or hawkers on the other, than with street traders, but I would suggest to him that if under it he could in any way make a provision to regulate, or give powers to regulate, where and how these fairs should be held in the various towns&mdash;certainly in towns with a population of less than 5,000&mdash;he would be doing a good thing for the benefit of the country and of the towns concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to the Bill is that it does not go far enough. A large number of the people described as pedlars or hawkers are people who carry on what is called &ldquo;moctioneering.&rdquo; It is certainly very unfair that these people should be allowed to set up movable establishments on the public streets and opposite the houses of traders who have to pay heavy rates and taxes.  These people who go around the country have to pay no rates or taxes of any kind, except merely a fee for registration.  I do not know if it would be possible for the Minister to <Col N="39" /> so extend the definition of pedlar or hawker as to hit in some way the semipermanent establishments of &ldquo;moctioneers,&rdquo; particularly in this city.</P>
      <P>While they may not actually do the things which they are required to do in order to be a pedlar or a hawker, still they seem to do most things and to do most people, and although they are to a certain extent stationary, they are at the same time mobile and always moving from place to place.  I do not know if the Minister would be willing &mdash;I do not suppose he is&mdash;to extend the scope of the Bill so as to put some check upon the abuses which these people have brought in, particularly in towns like Dublin and Cork.  The Bill is all right as far as it goes, but I think that, far from repressing, it rather fosters and establishes the trade of these hawkers and pedlars.  While many of them are respectable citizens, many others are what are described in the Press as &ldquo;moctioneers.&rdquo;  I wonder if the Minister would be willing to consider, not perhaps in this Bill, but in another, an extension of the powers for dealing with this particular abuse?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for raising the question of towns with a population of less than 5,000 was that representations have been made to me from most towns in my constituency that on market and fair days quite a large number of these people&mdash;I do not know what you would call them, whether hawkers or pedlars&mdash;come into these towns and sell anything from a packet of pins to a suit of clothes.  I have seen them myself do that on fair days and on market days.  It is no unusual thing to see seven or eight of them set up in different parts of a town.  Their presence tends to hold up the traffic, and I might mention that some of them have gone to the extent of defying the local urban authorities when an effort was made to get them removed.  The urban authority, when it brought the matter to the notice of the Civic Guard, was informed by the Guards that they had no authority to remove these people.  Now this evil is very prevalent in the smaller towns. These people come to these towns on <Col N="40" /> market and fair days when, of course, a large number of people are in from the country.  They try to catch the people from the country with suits of clothes, boots and other things at small prices.  I think the Minister would be well advised to make inquiries with regard to this.  Perhaps he would agree to insert an amendment himself, or he might be disposed to accept an amendment to that particular section when the Committee Stage of the Bill is reached.</P>

      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is very badly needed.  For some considerable time past practically every town in the Saorstát has been visited by these heavy motor lorries, loaded with every article that you could possibly think of.  All these goods, as a rule, are imported from Germany.  Most of the stuff offered is shoddy and is presented in such a way to catch the eye.  If an amendment were introduced to have towns with a population of less than 5,000 included in the Bill, I certainly would support it.  These people come into the towns to sell the goods they bring with them on their motor lorries, while at the same time the local shopkeepers are burdened with heavy rates and taxes.  The latter have to meet this unfair competition from people who pay nothing towards the local rates or taxes.  Many of them, as a result, are doing very little business, and in some cases cannot keep on their assistants. I would appeal to the Minister to have included in the Bill towns with a population of less than 5,000.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a word or two in reference to what Deputy Morrissey has stated.  My point of view is not so much the interest of any particular section of persons, engaged in business or otherwise, but I know that in Munster&mdash;not so much in my own county&mdash;but in Tipperary and other counties, the number of people engaged, and, apparently, doing a lively business in the streets on fair days, is an obstruction of the traffic.  It is really extraordinary, and the explanation is that there must be a tremendous amount of funny people in these particular areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> Deputy Shaw made a very serious complaint, and possibly we are to measure the class of people living in the county Deputy Shaw represents by the fact that such people are able to trade in the district.  But be that as it may, these people are certainly a public nuisance.  I am not overstating the case when I say that those people who go round from fair day to fair day are a public nuisance.  The origin of these people doing this kind of trade dates from the years of the Great War.  In those years we had a lot of people coming over here to avoid military service in England and setting up business of one kind or another that kept them going for the time being, and that class of trade has remained since.  They became jacks-of-all-trades, taking up the work of photographers and going in for photographic enlargements and so on, and they have remained with us still I think it is time that some real restriction was put upon those people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Redmond raises a question which I would like the Minister to deal with.  It is, perhaps, more properly a question for the Minister for Lands and Agriculture in conjunction with the Minister for Justice.  That is with regard to cattle fairs in the public streets. I think the Minister for Agriculture would agree that there is more injury done to our cattle by holding fairs on the streets in towns than by holding them on the fair greens.  Lots of cattle have to be continuously passing each other, at particular points, in these narrow streets, and they come in for a lot of punishment both in going to the fair and, afterwards, in going to the railway stations.  I have seen it time and time again.  The reason, I understand, why these fairs are held in the streets of some towns that have fair greens, and will not use them, is that objection is raised to the fair greens by some traders engaged in the licensed trade in these towns.  Probably we will have the licensed trade up against us because we want to have things done right in this matter.  It is a matter, however, that deserves very great attention, and as one who knows, I say that twice more injury is done by holding fairs in the streets of our towns where ordinary <Col N="42" /> fair greens are available than if such fairs were held in the fair greens.</P>
    <P>If it is possible for the Minister for Justice to bring these matters within the purview of this Bill, I think it ought to be done, and I, for one, would support it.  We are aware that we will have the opposition of the licensed trade, but, whether or not, I say it is a disgrace to the country that the only argument put up in favour of retaining the fairs in the streets is the benefit that they are to the licensed trade.  That the matter should be viewed solely from that point of view is a deplorable state of affairs.</P>

      <P>Practically the only angle from which this Bill was approached by my Department was the angle of the obstruction of the traffic and abuses in the public streets.  These other questions, whether the tendency of the times is that the travelling shop will replace the stationary shop, and so on, are matters rather outside the scope of the Bill, and remembering that this Bill arises, chiefly from representation by the police, and complaints from business people in cities, Deputies will understand the scope and object of the Bill.  Deputy Johnson said that this kind of cross reference as between the public or the central government on the one side, and the Corporation on the other, is objectionable.  Perhaps it may be explained on the basis that the general public are interested in the traffic point of view, and the police are necessarily interested from the point of view of keeping the streets clear for traffic and pedestrians, and the Corporation comes in rather on the public health side of matters&mdash;cleanliness and so on&mdash;to see that these stalls and street trading generally do not lead to insanitary conditions.  Now, the objection to Section 10, while apparently sound&mdash;that is the matter of arrest without warrant and so on&mdash;is not, I think, too well founded in fact because it is a question of abuse, of the correction of abuse, which exists, and the Bill proposes to take no more power of dealing with it than exists in the case of a man who is drunk or is a nuisance or obstruction in the streets and the power will be used naturally in <Col N="43" /> a rather conservative way.  But if a person comes along and takes his stand at a busy point and is a considerable obstruction, and refuses to move on, there should lie in the police a power of arrest there and then and without the delay involved by securing a warrant because the obstruction and the abuse is a continuing offence and can only be dealt with by a summary arrest.  That would apply, of course, more to sub-section (2) than to sub-section (1), but I would undertake to consider any amendments that Deputies might care to put up on the matter, with this reservation, that where there is an actual obstruction and where accompanied by a refusal to move on, the police would not be cumbered by a statutory provision making the securing of a warrant necessary.  As to extending the Bill to towns with a smaller population than five thousand, that, too, is something that could be considered. I will undertake to look into it between this and the Committee Stage.  Possibly in the case of any town with an urban council, assuming that the urban council are desirous of having the Bill extended to it, the population provision is unnecessary and might be waived.</P>

      <P>I would prefer to believe that if the necessity exists or arises in the future the local authorities will take appropriate action.  The question of fairs which Deputy Redmond raised is a somewhat bigger question, and I have the impression that urban councils under the Towns Improvement Act, 1854, have all the necessary powers if they care to exercise them.  If the Deputy's point is that there is a laxity in the exercise of those powers, that is something of course I can scarcely deal with at the moment, and certainly I cannot deal with it under the provisions of this Bill.  There is a lot in what Deputy Gorey says.  When the Gárda Síochána up and down the country have attempted to restrict the operations of fairs to a reasonable space in the centre of the town they have met with considerable protest and indignation from shopkeepers who prefer that the fairs should streel over the main street of the town.  It is a very difficult matter for the police alone to deal with if the local authority, the urban council, does not exercise such statutory power as exists at the moment. I would have that point looked into between this stage of the Bill and the next stage, but I rather doubt if anything satisfactory to the Deputy's point of view can be introduced into <Col N="45" /> this present Bill.  Deputy Esmonde raised a point about people carrying on auctions, cheap auctions.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that that class of business is generally carried on in shops or in some kind of premises that would bring them outside the scope of this Bill.  The Bill purports only to deal with obstruction of pedestrian traffic and the complaints of traders in the city that people cannot get free access to their premises.  It does not attempt further to restrict business of any kind, even of such a kind as the Deputy has mentioned, so that I think we cannot deal with that particular matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the Dáil long with the presentation of this Bill for Second Reading, mainly for this reason, that the Bill is one which has been demanded on a score of occasions by members of the House, and I think its provisions meet or seem to me to meet, in so far as they can be met, most of the arguments put forward by outsiders for the compilation of statistics in greater detail, covering a greater variety of subjects and under the control, as far as that can be economically and efficiently achieved, of one Department of Government.  It has been a serious source of objection for many years in this country that there has not been sufficient provision of statistical material of what are described as informative statistics rather than the ordinary administrative type, and it has often been said that the remarks applied to statistics in the whole of the late United Kingdom applied with even greater force here, that there was hardly any reform of any type, social, commercial, banking or otherwise, which could be properly achieved simply because there was not at hand the necessary information to direct those who sought a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is simple enough in its terms and it is certainly decidedly simple in its aim.  It sets out in Section 2 the points on which statistical information may be collected and for a series of clauses after that it shows distinctly its tendency, which is that the compilation and the publication of statistical matters should be centralised in so far as that is possible.  If I were going into details to explain any delay that there has been in introducing the Bill I would stress very definitely the difficulties that have been met in seeking to get assent to the general proposition that the collection and publication of statistics should be centralised and should be placed under one Department of Government.  The arguments and objections that have been used against that have not been raised simply for the sake of objection. <Col N="47" /> There are a variety of matters that have to be dealt with: the particular seasons of the year in which one Department requires information to be collected, as distinct from another; the form in which information has to be published, different forms required by different Departments; and while this does not specially and rigidly set up a centralised Department it, as I say, shows this tendency, that while allowing, as it does, under Section 3, the collection of different statistics to individual Ministers or heads of Departments, nevertheless there is allowance also under Section 6 for consultation, and in fact an insistence on consultation as between Ministers, leaving it to be recognised right through that the Minister named in the Bill as the Minister for the purpose of its execution shall have certain coordinating power, and that it is incumbent on him as far as possible to co-ordinate all statistics, no matter by whom they may be collected.</P>
    <P>One of the points ordinarily urged with regard to the collection of statictics is that whatever inquiries are necessary to their collection must not be such as to excite irritation or resentment amongst those from whom the information has been obtained, and fears have been expressed on a good many occasions by those who have to give the information required for statistical purposes that the returns may be disclosed in such a way as to give information relating to individuals or individual firms or corporations.  Sections 13 and 14 give as much protection as reasonably can be expected so as to appease those who may have fears with regard to the disclosure of information. Section 15, of course, also has a repercussion on that point.  Sections 14 and 15 go together, the officers being commanded not to disclose the information. A penalty has been set up to punish any officer for an abuse of his office.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill, therefore, is to have statistics collected on a greater variety of matters, and possibly in greater detail, than has hitherto been the case.  The tendency of the Bill is to have that centralised as far as possible <Col N="48" /> in one Department of Government, but it recognises than an allowance has to be made, and that that cannot at the start be rigidly insisted upon.  Hence the allowance made in Section 3.  As far as it is reasonably possible it will be the aim of my Department to urge upon the Executive Council that the centralising process should go on as quickly as possible, and that we should arrive in the shortest possible time at the position where a single Department of Government shall compile and publish all the statistics relating to the points set out in Section 2, and matters incidental thereto.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome this Bill and to express my satisfaction on its introduction.  I hope that it will lead to quick results.  If I may be allowed to make a suggestion, even before the Bill becomes effective as an Act, it would be that the Statistics Department will revert to the practice of printing rather than neostyling, as in the case of the statistics they issue at present.  They are very much easier to read when they are printed, and I think whatever saving there may be as between neostyling and printing is more than offset by the cost to the eyesight and the patience of the reader.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible under this Bill to make arrangements to compile statistics in connection with the matter about which I made inquiries some time ago&mdash;that is, the comparative cost of certain articles in this country and in England? In view of the arguments and discussions there have been with regard to the imposition of protective tariffs I think it is very important that we should have all the information.  I think also that all the information we get should be thoroughly reliable&mdash;that is, that it should not come from interested quarters or sources.  In that connection I would hope that information we get from this Government Department would be above suspicion in every way, and that the fact that the Government have made themselves the champions of protective tariffs will not in any way cast suspicion on the accuracy of the information.  But the information I want is this: I want comparative <Col N="49" /> statements with regard to the prices which prevail in England for certain articles in common use, as, for instance, a pair of boots manufactured in England compared with a pair of boots, of similar quality and type, in so far as type can be exactly determined, manufactured in Ireland.  The same thing might apply to any of the articles that are protected&mdash;clothes and articles of furniture, for instance.  The Minister, in his reply to my question, stated that it would not be worth the expense involved to get this information, but my opinion is that it would be worth it, and I would ask him to state if it would be possible for him to send his officials to England to get this information.</P>

Deputy Heffernan has asked me if it would be possible to compile statistics on certain points.  If he reads Section 2 I think he will see that it is almost possible to have statistics compiled on anything, but it is not mandatory that statistics should be compiled on all such points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the Department is to get statistics on the matters referred to in Section 2&mdash; Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, among other matters, and at the beginning it states: &ldquo;Statistics relating to any matter affecting the general economic <Col N="50" /> and other activities and conditions in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, how far that programme can be carried out at once is not a matter that I can state here; how far even the further point the Deputy urged could ever be gone into, that of getting the statistical officers of a Government Department to&mdash;they never could have powers&mdash;get certain rights with regard to the production of statistics for their inspection from England, so that a comparison might be made here, would be a matter of arrangement, I presume, between the two Governments.  Assurances might have to be given as to the use of the information, assurances greater than those given with regard to the use and non-disclosure of the matters dealt with here.  I cannot say, however, how that is going to get away from the doubt that is apparently in the Deputy's mind.  If the Government is the champion of protective tariffs, and if any information coming from that Governmental source is to be suspect, how is the Deputy's mind going to be cleared of suspicion with regard to statistics to be got out by arrangement between that suspect Government and, I presume, an equally suspect Government on the other side, since it is also indulging in certain tariff experiments?</P>

      <P>I am alluding to the impossibility of clearing the mind of a certain Farmer Deputy of suspicion with regard to the production of certain information.  The matters to which the Deputy referred would, I <Col N="51" /> think, form the subject of inquiries immediately if this Bill were to become law.  I think, when asked for information by Deputy Heffernan some time last year, I referred to the weakness of our powers with regard to the getting of information, and said that we were dependent entirely on what they choose to give us.  If we seek under this to make certain inquiries in the interests of the State, then we will have compulsory powers.  To that extent the Deputy's point is met, and I think the Deputy can, by virtue of questioning, if he finds the matter is not being carried out, urge on the Department having charge of the collection of statistics to secure all information required to give the people in this country a proper view of how the tariff experiment is working.  In so far as we have now changed from the position of being dependent upon what certain people liked to give us, and are now in a position to demand that from them, we are going along the same road as the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I would like here to make one statement which I should have made at the opening.  I spoke, I think, when my own Estimates were being considered last year, of the intention to have a census of industrial production this year.  When I mentioned that I did not know it was intended to have a census of population this year.  As the census of population has been decided upon this year, and as it will involve a tremendous strain on the statistical officers of my Department, it would not be possible to have both going together; it will therefore be necessary to have the census of industrial production postponed and give the census of population priority.  To that extent I relieve myself of the promise I made.</P>

      <P>I think this is hardly the time for the Deputy to put that point, inasmuch as I am now announcing the postponement of the taking of a census of industrial production. If the Deputy wants agricultural production investigated, we can announce, in indicating the postponement of a census of industrial production, the postponement also of an inquiry into whatever the Deputy has in mind with regard to agriculture.  The census of population has to take priority this year over anything else, except the returns which will be published in the ordinary way.  No new venture, no new collection of statistics, will be entered upon this year prior to the taking of the census of population.  Anything else beyond what is being done in the ordinary way will be postponed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Stage of this Bill I said that I looked on it as a method whereby the Government could take a positive part in the development of industrial activity through holding shares in such a company to which this Bill refers were placed in the Library.  Yesterday I had an opportunity of looking through these Articles of Association, and I must say that, having read them, they modified somewhat my view of the wisdom of this Bill.  The idea that was suggested to me on reading the Bill and hearing the President's speech&mdash; and I do not know whether other Deputies got the same suggestion&mdash;was that there was a clear control in some way or other, a check or some kind of a veto exercisable by the Government by virtue of the holding of one-third of the share capital.  But I find that that is very far from being the fact.  I want <Col N="54" /> to suggest that the Bill in its present form is somewhat dangerous, and that it can only be made safe and really and permanently valuable if the provisions of the Bill were enforced to this effect, that the share capital held by the Government should be, say, 50 per cent. of the total capital invested.</P>
      <P>The company takes power under the Articles of Association to enter into any industrial undertaking, certainly almost any financial undertaking connected with industry except the conduct of the business of insurance.  Practically everything else is covered.  The capital is £250,000, and £150,000 appear to have been subscribed, one-third in the United States, one-third by the banks in Ireland, and one-third by the Government.  The Bill speaks of the Ministry having power to nominate two directors out of a minimum of five, I think, but a possible ten.  There is nothing, of course, in the Articles of Association that gives any authority to the Ministry, by virtue of the shares held, to have any control over the directorate, but it appears by the Bill that there has been an agreement entered into between the company on the one hand and the Ministry on the other hand for that Ministry to have a right to nominate two directors.  The two directors that have been nominated by the Ministry are already directors of the company with whom the agreement was made, so that the nomination of these two directors is really not a nomination of outside directors to enter into a board but is simply indicating that two persons who are already on the board are satisfactory to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, my criticism of this position does not want to reflect at all upon the purpose, intentions or desires of the present board, and if we could be sure that the Board of this company in the future would be animated solely with the purpose of promoting the general well-being, then my criticism would fall. But expressions, and desires and intentions of good-will in January, 1926, as I have so often said, do not ensure that in 1936 the same intentions and purposes will prevail among the directorate of that time.  There is no limitation in these Articles of the dividends <Col N="55" /> or profits.  It may be that a company of this kind will be very successful, and the extent of its success will measure its power over the economic future of the country.  One can see possibilities that a company of this kind may extend so rapidly and so greatly as, actually, to control the country.  It is starting, as the President says, with the added credit that a Government backing and share capital would give.  When it gets on its feet and is actually successful the Government is free to get rid of its share capital, and, presumably, of its partial control and influence upon the policy of the company through its nominated directors.</P>
    <P>There is nothing whatever to prevent the control of this company being secured by American shareholders through an increase in their holding, or, on the other hand, through an increase in the holding of Irish banks.  I think that there is a distinct danger in floating this company in its present form with a limit to the holding by the Government of £50,000.  I believe that the right policy for the Government to adopt in this matter would be either to have no holding in the company at all, or to have a controlling interest.  I think the latter would be very much preferable.  I think if the Government maintained a controlling interest so that there would be an assurance that the public well-being would be the primary consideration, everything would be satisfactory, and the future of the country would be saved from the possibility of finance sharks. whether in Ireland, England or America, getting control of a company of this kind and running it, and, through it, the industries of the country, for purposes which are not of the highest character.  I am speaking now from the point of view of social well-being.</P>
    <P>It is set out that the holders of three-fourths of the shares, if they agree, may commute or abrogate the rights or privileges of the other shareholders.  I take it that it is under that section the company is able to enter into an agreement with the Ministry so that the Ministry should nominate two of the <Col N="56" /> directors out of five.  That may or may not be; I do not know.  It is clear, however, that if, for any reason whatever, the Government disposes of one-twelfth of its present holding, if one could conceive a combination of the remaining shareholders, then the Government's power, rights and authority in the company would go to the wall.  I do not think that that is at all a satisfactory position for the Government of the country to allow itself to be in.  I have no reason at all to fear that anything of this kind will take place; but I see the possibility, when one knows from public notoriety that financial interests in all parts of the world are very glad to get hold of a good thing, or to get control of a country which may offer good things of a financial character, and use them not in the interests of the country, but in the interests of whatever financial control is at stake.</P>
    <P>I see that dividends may be paid wholly or in part by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, could be paid by the shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company. That may be just a safeguard, one of the regular provisions in such companies, but one can see in it possibility of a company of this kind getting control of the stock of a variety of industrial undertakings and, by market manipulations of one kind or another, redistributing the stock of this company by way of dividend, and that the Government would become part holders of all kinds of stock of all kinds of companies.</P>
    <P>The general purposes and intentions of the promoters of the company, I have no doubt whatever, are good and in good faith, but we know that trust companies have been known to get control of the economic keys in different countries and use those powers not always for the best interests of the country which they, in effect, own.  We read a good deal about American investments in oil and British investments in ore and oil and manures and such like things, and we know how the country, to which the investors and stockholders belong, becomes closely interested in the affairs of the country where undertakings are carried on, <Col N="57" /> and I fear that there are possibilities within this scheme of outside interests getting control to an unreasonable extent through financial manipulation of big industrial undertakings in the future that may develop in Ireland.  A check upon that, and I think an effective check which would remove all my fears, would be that the Government should secure a controlling interest in such a trust company&mdash;that it should have half the shares.  That has been done by other Governments in other matters, and it does not involve an active and direct share in the management or directorate, but it does involve a veto upon what may be an undesirable development of a financial character in the future industrial affairs of the country.</P>
    <P>As I said, on the Second Reading, I thought the general intention and purpose of this are very good and satisfactory and I thought it was also intended to supplant the liability that the Government at present undertakes in respect of loans under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  That, as was explained, was not the case and we have this position: that the new company is to make loans for a long term; the Government is to be a shareholder to the extent of one-third of the holdings and the share capital of this Trust Company, but the Government is to be finally responsible for the repayment of all the loans, that is to say, for the main immediate purpose of the Trust Company, which is to make loans under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  That puts this company in the very advantageous position of making a start with its financial operations and, as I say, if the Government is to take the risk of those loans it should also take the larger share and then one-third of the profits would accrue to this company.  I think the general proposition I make is sufficient to cover my objection, that is to say, when you have only fifty thousand pounds worth of the share capital you have no guarantee that the Government's partial control of the directorships shall remain in their hands. Therefore you are assisting in the formation of a company which you really do not and cannot control, which <Col N="58" /> is illimitable almost in its possibilities, and which will wield a power which should, to a very great extent, be retained in the hands of the Government. I make the definite proposition to the Ministry that instead of limiting their holdings to fifty thousand pounds' worth they should enter into this, if they enter into it at all, with the idea of obtaining half the share capital of the company so as to have always a controlling interest in the operations of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not really in favour of the Government having a controlling interest in such a company as this because I think it is difficult to have a controlling interest and not to be forced into participation in the active management of the particular body.  I know it is practically impossible for the Government to deal with such and to deal with business propositions relating to loans or advances which should be dealt with solely as business propositions without a certain vitiating political element being allowed to enter.  There is no doubt at all that the financial machinery of this country, as it stands at present, does show one great lack.  We have our ordinary banks which in their own way are extremely good, stable, safe and very satisfactory to the depositors, but they are banks which, in spite of what the directors may wish, have to pursue a very conservative policy in regard to loans and advances.  I am not to be taken as expressing any opinion as to the precise policy that banks have pursued here, but there is no doubt that a bank with depositors' money must pursue a very conservative policy.  It must be ready if there is a demand for the money deposited to pay it out and no person who has an account with the bank who wants his money will be satisfied if he is told that he cannot get it as the bank is making good use of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other countries there are banks which operate on their own capital or on money which is not deposited with them at call or short notice but which they have on some sort of long loan which they can use freely in any sort of investment or advance they think fit to make.  The matter was brought very <Col N="59" /> prominently into public notice here when the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act was passed.  The banks then refused to make advances, although the loans would have a Government guarantee under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, for a period greater than five years.  Five years was a period far too short to serve the purposes of the companies or concerns that were asking for the loans.  An emergency provision had to be made so as not to allow the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act to become a dead letter, to enable the Land Bank to make advances.  I do not think that is a satisfactory arrangement, and we are looking in the setting-up of this Industrial Trust Company to get some more satisfactory basis for dealing with the whole matter.  We are now providing the sum of fifty thousand pounds capital for the Industrial Trust Company.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I understand the Industrial Trust Company has already taken up this fifty thousand pounds worth of a loan guaranteed under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, and actually to that extent it will relieve the demand which is being made on the specified advance we made to the National Land Bank in order to undertake these loans.  We know the Industrial Trust Company will take up more of these loans and we know it will make advances or take up shares which are not guaranteed by the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not think that, for the moment, we need concern ourselves with fears that a company such as this may get some sort of economic control of the country.  If we see the company extending or advancing money on long terms, or taking shares in all sorts of industrial enterprises, we could consider whether the infant is growing too strong and fast and whether we ought not to take precautions.  At present, however, what we ought to concern ourselves with is the question whether this seed will grow, whether something bigger will grow out of it, whether we are only going to have a company with £150,000 capital, or whether we should go further.  We must hope that new capital will be put into it, and when the present Trade Loans Act expires <Col N="60" /> we will consider using this company, or a similar organisation, so that we could make better arrangements. If the banks maintain their present attitude, we could consider in August next the question of extending this Act for a further year, and then we will be up against the question of making provision for further advances under the Act where guarantees are given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it would be satisfactory for us simply to make further advances to the National Land Bank to enable them to make these advances. I think it might be a great deal better if we guarantee, for instance, debentures issued by the company to the extent of the capital, or to a specified amount, so that the entire burden and loss, if there was a loss, would not fall on the Exchequer.  I believe that the arrangements in regard to the Trade Loans Act are not satisfactory, and, moreover, I believe that we will probably have to enter into further bargains with the Industrial Trust Company, or give some sort of further assistance, or fillip, if it is to grow in the way we would like.  It may quite possibly be that, without any such assistance, the results will be so satisfactory further capital will be put up and new spheres of work entered upon.  I am inclined to think that, when meeting the situation which will arise when the Act expires, we will have to consider whether we cannot use some such organisation as this, with the co-operation of private capitalists, to do the work which is now being done under the Act.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give any explanation as to why the general public, when this company's shares were on the market, refused to contribute anything towards the capital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the reason is that the general public will hardly subscribe at present to any Irish company or Irish enterprise.  It is with great difficulty that they can be induced to touch anything.  I believe, if many people interested in advancement were wise, it would have been possible to get all the capital without Government assistance, but, as things were, a <Col N="61" /> start could not be made, and even the £100,000 now available would not have been available if we had not promised to put up £50,000.  Unlike Deputy Johnson, I would be satisfied to see this go along as a private enterprise of a special sort which has not existed here. If it became big, and if dangers appeared, it would always be possible to take steps to guard against those dangers.  It is fairly easy for the Government to put pressure on any enterprise such as this.  There are very many weapons to its hand if the enterprise became very strong.</P>

So far as I know, there is no company in existence here for doing that kind of work, unless the Land Bank does it, and I do not think it does.  There is necessity for a source from which people could get money on long term loans on a mortgage of land. Is it the intention of the company to engage in that kind of work?  I would say, if it is not, it is a matter which might be considered by the new committee which is being set up to deal with banking questions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> I am moving this motion under the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act of 1921, as I did the resolution dealing with the establishment of the Food Tribunal. I should like at the outset to call attention to a certain phrase in the motion.  It reads:</P>
    <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance, that is to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise what follows:</P>
    <P>the present position of the several ports and harbours in Saorstát Eireann specified in the schedule to this resolution...</P>
    <P>In the schedule there is a complete list of the harbour undertakings built and operated under statutory authority.  I am not including any port which does not fall into that category.  I am not setting up a tribunal to inquire into whether any new ports and harbours should be built and operated, but simply with regard to those which are, in that particular way, operated&mdash; whether the legislation setting them up, and the method of administration is suitable, and to make a report upon the matter set out in the four subheads. I bring it forward as a matter of urgent public importance, even although limited to the harbours identified, as I have identified them.  It has long been a matter of concern to my Department to have the existing con stitution, powers and methods of administering those authorities inquired into.  It is a matter that we had thought necessary to have inquired into ourselves, and a matter on which we had received an amount of correspondence which almost equals that sent in on any other subject.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a general concensus of opinion through the country that the method of administration of the authorities controlling harbours of this type is not all that it might be. There has been pretty well the same type of complaint sent forward with regard to the harbours mentioned.  In some cases, on the information at the Department's disposal, it seems that complaints were justified, and in some cases even on the material on which the complaint was based.  In other cases, <Col N="65" /> it does not seem that there is any ground for complaint at all, but complaints have been made and it seems desirable and urgent, and a matter of public importance, that those complaints should be sifted; that the whole matter should be subjected to review and, if the tribunal likes to bring in recommendations with regard to improvements that might easily be affected in the way in which the harbours are administered, it will be then for the Dáil later to consider whether they should be followed up.</P>
    <P>May I again emphasise what appears to have been misunderstood with regard to this Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act on the last occasion.  This is a resolution which, if passed by the Dáil and Seanad, allows an instrument of appointment of a tribunal, and that instrument appointing a tribunal referring to the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act of 1921 gives the tribunal pretty well the fullest possible compulsory powers with regard to the calling of evidence, the taking of evidence on oath, the inspection of books, and the bringing of witnesses before them. I stated that, as I thought quite specifically and clearly, in regard to the last inquiry, and it was stated afterwards in one of the newspapers that the matter had been left vague.  I do not want there to be any appearance even of leaving anything vague this time.  If this resolution be passed by both Houses&mdash;if it seems to both Houses that it is a matter requiring an inquiry of this sort&mdash;then that instrument referring to this particular Act empowers the tribunal to take evidence on oath, sets up certain penalties, and gives all the powers of the High Court with regard to the production of evidence under compulsion.</P>
    <P>The motion is sufficiently detailed not to require any great explanation from me.  I should like merely to emphasise the negative side of it&mdash;what it is not intended to do.  This is not an inquiry into the opening up of new ports or harbours; it is an inquiry into that group of harbours, as I have limited this, operating under statutory authority. That seems to be a special compartment which can be inquired into by itself, has no repercussion on the <Col N="66" /> other question, and is not bound up with the question of development of new harbours or with the question of transport in its entirety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to dispute with the Minister that there may be some necessity for the setting up of this tribunal, but I would like to make one or two remarks on the motion.  As the Minister states, the Tribunal, under the Act of 1921, is to have full compulsory powers.  Of course, I take it that is only in regard to evidence, and I presume the evidence will be on oath.  It also follows, I understand, that any findings of this tribunal will have to come before the Oireachtas before becoming law.  The list of harbours in the schedule is a very formidable one, and the Minister has stated that these harbours are chosen because they have statutory powers attached to them.  This will be a very serious and, judging from the list of harbours, I should say, a very lengthy operation.  As we all know, every one of these harbours is governed by different statutes.  Is it the intention or the idea that the tribunal shall consider the possibility of codifying or, in any way subjecting to uniform methods, the control and administration of all these harbours?  Of course, that in itself is a matter which is debatable. Each of these harbours is individual in its conditions, in its locality and, certainly, in the present statutes that govern it.  I think to set out with the idea that it is right that all harbours on the coast-line of Saorstát Eireann should be governed by a uniform method, both in regard to constitution and in regard to powers of administration, would be wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know when the Minister will be able to inform the Dáil of the composition of this tribunal; how he proposes to constitute the tribunal; whether it is to be representative of various interests, or whether it is to be a completely independent tribunal: that is, independent of harbour interests. A great deal will depend upon whether the tribunal is composed of those who are acquainted with and interested in the development and the progress of the ports, or whether it is <Col N="67" /> to be viewed entirely from an outside point of view.</P>
    <P>I do not say it would be a completely wrong thing to have an independent tribunal, because this is, of course, naturally, a national question, but, at the same time, I think it would be unwise, to say the least of it, to have the tribunal composed entirely of members who have never had any previous experience of the working of harbour boards or who might not be in the least interested in their progress.</P>
    <P>The present state of the laws which, according to paragraph (d), is to be inquired into, relating to the ports and harbours, is certainly very varied and intricate and if the tribunal is going to go into the various statutes governing each and every one of these harbours mentioned in the schedule, and if they are going to pronounce definitely upon each of them in turn, it will certainly take a considerable time. It would be well if the Minister explained if that is the intention or if the intention is that there should be some method of uniformity arrived at for the control of all the harbours along the coastline.  I do not say that that would be either a wise or an expedient course to adopt.</P>
    <P>I notice that what were known as &ldquo;Royal harbours&rdquo; have been omitted from the list.  I do not know why that is so, but perhaps the Minister will be able to explain.  I understand the harbour at Dun Laoghaire is a Royal harbour and I think there are one or two others.  Whether their position is fixed so that no inquiry could, by any of its findings, alter the conditions which obtain is a matter upon which, I think, the Minister might be able to enlighten the Dáil.  Otherwise I think it is a good thing to have this inquiry.  I do not say that I see the necessity for its immediate urgency.  I have not heard very great complaints about the management and conduct of harbours but probably the Minister knows better.  If inquiry is to be made and if a tribunal is to be set up I think it would be wise to inform the Dáil at the earliest possible moment as to its composition and, if possible, the actual names of those who will be upon it.</P>

      <P>From my knowledge of these harbours I should say that, outside the Fishery Laws, I know of nothing that is more chaotic than the regulations under which they are controlled.  Each of these bodies is a law unto itself and each is absolutely incompetent.</P>
      <P>I may say at once, therefore, that I am not in favour of the resolution.  I was rather surprised to find that this Tribunal is only to deal with statutory harbours.  At the moment I have not had access to all the information on the subject, but I certainly think that at least 30 per cent. of the harbours which are really more important than the statutory harbours are not dealt with by this Tribunal at all.  Most of these have been built by public money&mdash;some of them from Free State money since it came into existence.  They are dealt with by the county councils or by some other body that really does not function at all, and the only objection that I have to the Minister's resolution is that all these harbours do not come under this tribunal.  If all of them did come under the Tribunal, then perhaps we could set up a proper Harbour Board which would be directly responsible to the State.  If the Minister desires to have it, I could give him a list of those harbours which are much more important than the statutory harbours that he has named in his resolution.  I would appeal to him to see that this matter is dealt with in a more comprehensive way than is proposed under this resolution.  I think that all harbours which have been built by public money should come under this Tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I have some knowledge of ports, but even after the explanation of the Minister I am afraid I do not follow what this Tribunal is going to do.  The resolution before us states &ldquo;That it is expedient that a Tribunal be established for inquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance&rdquo; and so on.  One would have expected a little more light from the Minister as to the urgent public importance that is outlined there.  If we go on to paragraphs A.  B and C of the resolution to find out what is the urgent <Col N="69" /> public importance for the setting up of this Tribunal, we are told what the Tribunal is to do.  Paragraph A states that the Tribunal is to make inquiries as to &ldquo;the constitution, powers and methods of administration of the authorities controlling or managing such ports and harbours.&rdquo;  Bear in mind that the harbours referred to are also statutory bodies.  Therefore, to set up a Tribunal to find out the powers of these statutory authorities seems to me to be rather an absurdity.  All these particulars are available for anybody at any time, and why therefore should we at this hour of the day set up a Tribunal to find out what the Minister or indeed anyone interested in the matter could find out at very short notice? Paragraph B refers to &ldquo;the charging powers, financial position and resources of such authorities.&rdquo;  That too, I think, is information that could be found out by anyone at very short notice.  These are statutory authorities, and I daresay they publish balance sheets and accounts.  Paragraph C refers to &ldquo;the facilities provided for trade and commerce in such ports and harbours&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in explaining the powers of the tribunal, said that it was going to have mandatory powers for the production of books and all the rest of it.  Whom is all this information to be got from?  The statutory authority. Does the Minister require all this to get the books of a statutory authority? I think not.  Many of them have a public audit, and their accounts are published.  As regards facilities at the ports, is the tribunal going to go into the very large question of adequate facilities or otherwise at all the ports mentioned in the schedule to this resolution? If the Minister finds out that the facilities are inadequate, is he going to couple up the various ports into one administration?  What does he anticipate can be the result of an inquiry into this matter in a wholesale fashion? The requirements of a port like Kilrush or some one such as Foynes harbour are really governed by the local conditions.  The same conditions could not possibly apply to any two harbours for the purposes of comparison.  Railway facilities enter into the question <Col N="70" /> as well as berthing facilities, the cost of dredging, the cost of maintenance, the volume of business done, and a hundred and one other things.</P>
    <P>Is it proposed that legislation should be introduced to deal with the different harbours on the same lines?  Take the case of the port of Dublin.  Several Acts of Parliament have been passed to meet the needs of this port.  Whether they are right or wrong, at any rate they were arrived at after very full consideration, and the needs of the port are, as I have said, embodied in several Acts of Parliament.  Is it the proposal here that all the ports and harbours, administrative or statutory bodies, could be dealt with in an Omnibus Bill, their borrowing powers and all the rest, and that you could deal with all these different harbours on the same lines?  Frankly, I am not opposed to the tribunal, except on this ground: We have a very active Government which has been inquiring into a great many things.  They have set up a great many tribunals, practically every one of which has led to a state of affairs which was referred to to-day by the Minister for Finance as a general unsettlement, a general doubt, a general want of confidence.  The Minister for Finance said to-day that the reason why the Government were advancing £50,000 to an Industrial Trust Company &mdash;he said this in answer to Deputy Wilson&mdash;was that the people of the country would not take up the shares.  He went further than that and said that the people of the country were not very keen on taking up any shares in any industrial undertaking in the country at the present time.  I can endorse that. It is unfortunate, but it is so.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce passed a Bill through this House which met with great enthusiasm, but the immediate effect of that Bill was to bring a certain industry into a state of stagnation. The Minister for Industry and Commerce now comes forward with this tribunal.  I have no objection to the tribunal, but its effect on the country will be to accentuate the distrust, and what is going to happen?  Are you going to question the administration of every organisation that you have got to-day?  Are you going to upset the <Col N="71" /> order of things that is there without knowing what you are going to put in its place?</P>

      <P>Very well.  If you are satisfied, I am.  Now, I think all those tribunals at the present time should have a very definite aim in view, and my objection to this tribunal, if you call it an objection, is that I do not see any need for it.  None whatsoever.  If tribunals are set up calling in question everything that everybody is doing in the country, then it is hardly surprising that those who have money are chary, and very chary, of investing in the various enterprises.  I only throw out that note of warning.  I think, in the present position of things, we ought to look to people having confidence in the future so that they may be prepared to take shares in industrial undertakings.  I deprecate, as much as I can, the interference, or the necessity for interference if you like, of the Government in the industrial undertakings of the country.  I recognise, also, that the very thing that the Minister for Finance stated to-day makes it necessary for somebody to do acts of this sort, but I none the less deplore it, and in so far as this tribunal will have an unsettling effect I think we would be better without it.  If it has a definite object in view, which is not very clear from the references given here, I would like the Minister to state what it is.</P>

      <P>Deputy Redmond elevated one point to the region of fear.  He hoped that the recommendations made by the Committee would not become law or operative unless the Oireachtas approved. Obviously that is the position.  This is simply an inquiry.  The tribunal may make recommendations, but if they involve any change in the existing legislation they will have to be considered in the form of new legislation by this Dáil and Seanad.  The Deputy further asked, inasmuch as these authorities are all governed by different statutes, was there any idea of codification.  I cannot say.  I think that, generally speaking, <Col N="72" /> people seeing certain harbours which are not very distinctive in regard to any special type of work, or in their local situation, might say these should be governed by some code which would be more uniform than the present system which Deputy O'Doherty described as chaotic.  The Deputy went on, later, to ask me to indicate what was my intention with regard to the recommendations which the tribunal might make.  I have no intentions with regard to the recommendations that the tribunal might make.  It can make whatever recommendations seem good. Possibly they would have their own minds aiming, in the abstract, at some sort of uniformity, at least to some better approach to uniformity than exists at the moment, but what that will be I cannot say.  It is not going to be my intention to give them any directions that they should set out with any idea of codification.  The whole matter will be left to themselves.</P>
      <P>I intend as early as possible to indicate, to the Dáil and the Seanad, the personnel of the Tribunal, but I am not so far advanced as I was with the other tribunal for which the House authorised a resolution of this sort.  I cannot even indicate those interested which it may seem desirable to have represented on the Committee.  I have not even come to a decision on the matter as to whether interests should be represented or whether it would not be better to leave people who could be described as interested, in the more technical meaning of the word, to come before the Tribunal and to give evidence and to have people who, in the Deputy's later phrase, are acquainted with the ports and interested in their development. Obviously that is the sort of man to look for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Redmond is in some conflict with Deputy Hewat when he stated it would take time if it is incumbent upon the Tribunal to consider all the statutes.  Deputy Hewat's attitude is that the statutes were there and everybody knows all about them, and that there is nothing to inquire into.  I rather agree with Deputy Redmond that there is a considerable amount hidden in these statutes that might very well be brought to the light of day <Col N="73" /> for the purposes of information, not that I believe there is anything irregular going on under cover of these statutes, but that simply people should know what is the law with regard to particular places.  The time of the Tribunal could be saved, in this matter, by having the statutory law relating to the harbours brought before it in the form of a digest.  That, presumably, would be the business of a secretary, or those who were attending to the Tribunal. The question of State harbours, or what are known as Crown harbours, was not included because of the very small extent to which they are trading ports, and, so far, we have no complaints from agricultural or trade interests with regard to them.  There was an inquiry in connection with a State Harbours Bill last year, and when that Bill was before the Private Bill Committee an appearance was made by one interested objector.  The objections made were considered by the Committee, and we have considered with regard to them (1) that there was no necessity to have them dealt with here, (2) that no serious complaints had been received about them, and (3) that the matter had been the subject, incidentally, of an inquiry when the State Harbours Bill was under consideration.</P>
    <P>Some sympathy may be felt with Deputy O'Doherty's plea that this should not be confined to harbours as I have defined them, but that other harbours should be included.  That, then, comes to the varied point of view as to whether the work that is going to be put before this committee is going to be heavy or a very slight matter, as Deputy Hewat seemed to imagine.  I would imagine that it is going to be very heavy and difficult, and I did not think it right to add on, in these special terms of reference, all harbours, whether under statutory control or privately developed and owned at the moment.  The deliberations of the committee and the report of the tribunal on these particular harbours will throw a certain light on the necessity for the development of other harbours in a particular area, and they can be dealt with later on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hewat has queried the whole purpose of the tribunal.  He began with <Col N="74" /> sub-heads A, B, C, and D, but there is the general phrase governing the whole matter &ldquo;the present position of the several ports and harbours in the Saorstát,&rdquo; with special reference to certain things.  It is possibly quite right to say that it is easy for members of the Dáil or Seanad to arrive by examination of the various statutes at what is the present position of the ports specified here, with regard to the &ldquo;constitution, powers and methods of administration of the authorities controlling them&rdquo; but not with regard to their methods. It is very difficult, even for individual members of the Dáil or Seanad, to discover what are the financial resources of the authorities from time to time governing these harbours.  It would involve an amount of examination that I think the ordinary Deputy or Senator has not time for, and even if there was nothing more to be done than simply to have that in a comparative form and put in a handy way for members to have here for their information, then, the tribunal would do some good.</P>
    <P>Even I noticed that Deputy Hewat weakened in what I thought was his opposition to the Tribunal when he came to C and D&mdash;the facilities provided for trade and commerce.  I wonder does Deputy Hewat really believe in his heart that everybody, in Dublin say, is quite satisfied with regard to the facilities provided for trade and commerce by the Dublin Port and Docks Board?  I am not saying that the dissatisfaction is proper. I am not saying that anything has been proved, but just simply is he or is he not aware that there is some expression of dissatisfaction with regard to the facilities provided?  If the facilities are as good as can be provided that fact should be established, and it is a thing that will redound to the credit of the Port Authority if the fact is established.  If it is not, then I am sure that that authority would be glad to see what a body set up for this purpose, chosen in a deliberate and reasoned way, would put up to them for better facilities, and they could then come for examination before the authority itself.  Deputy Hewat also seems to have fixed in his mind that an Omnibus Bill will be introduced codifying <Col N="75" /> all the laws relating to these scattered harbours and making one rigid law for the whole country.  I would refer him to the terms of paragraph D: &ldquo;The present statute laws relating to such ports and harbours and any changes therein of a general or a particular nature which appear necessary or desirable in order to promote the trade or commerce of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  The terms of reference have to be somewhat wide, and I think that it is sufficient to leave the members of the Tribunal free to bring in amendments with regard to the particular laws applicable to individual harbours and not to confine them to making recommendations merely of an omnibus type.  Again I cannot say in answer to Deputy Hewat what I might indicate as the result of the inquiry.  I am simply throwing this open for inquiry and leaving it to the Tribunal to make their recommendations.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the full force of the point that inquiries of this sort inevitably lead to unsettlement, doubt and want of confidence.  I can imagine a person interested in the development of a particular harbour saying to himself &mdash;let me make it absolutely particular &mdash;that the Dublin Port and Docks Board is in its particular Heaven and all's well with the world.  There may be people who have not that view, or there may be people who ought to be convinced that that is the right view.  But simply to say that there should be an inquiry into certain law which has come down to us over a period of time and which the mere process of time might lead one to believe required some change&mdash;I cannot see that people should reasonably get unsettled or get grave doubts as to the setting up of an inquiry because of that.</P>

      <P>I should certainly say it should if the result of the inquiry shows that the authority controlling the Port and Docks Board has nothing upon which it may be criticised after an inquiry has been held.  It is <Col N="76" /> the intention and the aim to get people appointed on this tribunal who will confine themselves to the terms of reference and who will bring in no critical comments on any authority unless there is evidence put before them which shows that such criticism is justified. I can definitely see the type of mind which would prefer to leave everything in the way in which we have been going along for a certain number of years, but even those people should wait until the result of the inquiry reveals something deplorable before they get into that state of unsettlement and doubt.  If that is to be the plea, and if it is to be insisted upon, then, of course, the sooner this House shuts up shop and dissolves itself the better.  We would find ourselves confined simply and entirely to the existing legislation and carrying it on as it was.</P>

I am not at all satisfied that there are not things of very much greater and more urgent public importance that should be considered by the Dáil instead of matters of this kind.  It does not appear to me that this inquiry <Col N="77" /> is going to lead anywhere.  There are inquiries in connection with harbours in the Free State that would serve a useful purpose, but I am not at all satisfied that this inquiry will serve such a purpose.

I did think, when the Deputy raised the point, that what might happen was this: If the Deputy had any arguments to bring forward to show that it was not expedient that the tribunal should be set up he should be allowed to make these, with anyone else who liked to join with him on the point, and that I could have the right to reply.

But supposing special leave were granted in this particular case to adopt that special procedure, that would give Deputy Heffernan the right in a future case to argue that the same right should be given to him, but it would not give him any right to demand the same right.

      <P>It is not many weeks ago since Deputies were brought up from the country to meet and then to adjourn for a week.  We raised a protest, first against the expenditure of public money, and second, against the <Col N="81" /> expenditure of the Deputies' time and interest on something that was not forthcoming, but, notwithstanding that, the same procedure is to be repeated. Deputies are brought from the country to do business; by some process the newspapers are informed of all the great programme of legislation that is to be provided; we find that we have an afternoon's work that is finished at 6.20 p.m., and we adjourn for a week. I do not know whether the President considers that that is the way that the conduct of the first House of the Legislature should be proceeded with.  It seems to me that we ought to have had a sufficient amount of business to carry us on from now to next week, and then that there should be such an accumulation of business as would allow the whole session to be proceeded with regularly.  I think it is not right and proper that the business of the House should be dealt with in this manner, and it is not fair to Deputies that they should be asked to come from the country just for one day's business.  People will think that we are emulating the Seanad.  Perhaps I should not say that, but I honestly feel that it is not fair and that it is not a proper treatment of the business of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that it was not anticipated that the House would work so hard this afternoon that the Order Paper, which was very considerable, would have been concluded this evening.  It was certainly my impression that there was sufficient business for two days, and that the Estimates under Item 4 would occupy our attention on Thursday.  However, as the very considerable amount of business has been finished at an early hour I think the best course to adopt would be to adjourn until Wednesday next, when we will have a week's business ready.</P>

      <P>I think it is most unfortunate that we should adjourn for a week after such a long adjournment, and I protest against it for one reason. Practically for the last twelve months, we have been promised by the Minister for Defence, or by those speaking for him, an amendment to the Army Pensions Act, and there is yet no sign of <Col N="82" /> that amending Bill.  I think if Ministers are short of business there is nothing more important at present that they could bring before the Dáil than the Army Pensions Amending Bill. There are many ex-Army men who met with accidents while in the Army, and there are many others in sanatoria without a penny piece coming to them and without anything to help them except what they get through charity. That is not the way to treat ex-Army men in this country.  This is a matter that ought to be brought to the notice of the Dáil at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>The debate on that matter has concluded. The adjournment is now being moved until to-morrow week.  Deputy Morrissey gave notice of his intention to raise a matter for discussion on the motion for the adjournment, but as to that I was asked whether such discussion would be in order.  The Executive Council that answers here is not responsible for the detention of Deputy MacCurtain and certain other prisoners who are detained under the jurisdiction of the Government of Northern Ireland.  Ordinarily, therefore, in such a case no question such as the question Deputy Morrissey has given notice of&mdash;the question of the continued detention of Deputy MacCurtain and other prisoners by the Government of Northern Ireland &mdash;could be raised here.  However, I have come to the conclusion that the surrounding circumstance in this particular <Col N="83" /> case make it impossible rigidly to adhere to the very sound rule that we cannot discuss affairs that do not absolutely come within our jurisdiction. I would be prepared, however, to allow Deputy Morrissey, not to raise the question of which he has given notice, but to ask the President what he has done to procure the release of Deputy MacCurtain and the other prisoners.  In any debate that might ensue, the only Government that could be criticised here is the Government that is answerable here, that is the Executive Council. I shall rigidly adhere to that rule.</P>

      <P>In view of the conditions existing in the country, the bringing of Deputies here is no small matter. They travel first class, and I dare say the Government will have to pay first class fares to the full 100 per cent. Possibly a few hundred pounds will be involved, and maybe more.  I think it is not good enough, in view of the economic situation of the country, that Deputies should be summoned here for one day's work.  The Government should make up their mind either to have a full week's work or let the adjournment carry to a later date.  This has occurred more than once, and the money could be devoted to more useful purposes than spending it in this way.</P>
