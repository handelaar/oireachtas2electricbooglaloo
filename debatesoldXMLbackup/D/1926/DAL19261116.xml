      <NameTxt>Mr. P. DOYLE (for Máighréad Ní Choileáin Bean Uí Dhrisceóil)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been called to a letter of the Manager of the Great Northern Railway Company to the Meath Farmers' Union, stating in reply to the request in their letter of the 17th August that his Company was reducing the charge for the transit of cattle from Beauparc and Navan to Belfast, to a lower figure than the charge operating in Great Northern stations generally; whether the effect of that decision was not to prejudice the Port of Dublin by diverting to Belfast traffic that in the natural order of things would come to Dublin, and whether he has any statement to make regarding the allegation often made that a large part of the live stock and other traffic from the Saorstát across the Border is not credited to Saorstát exports, but helps to swell the total of the exports from Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Great Northern Railway that the reduction in the railway rates for the conveyance of cattle from Beauparc and Navan to Belfast, referred to in the Deputy's question, was made in consequence <Col N="4" /> of representations put forward by, amongst others, the County Meath Association of the Irish Farmers' Union.</P>
      <P>The rates per wagon from both Beaupare and Navan are now £4 5s. to Belfast and £1 14s. 5d. to Dublin.  By comparison with the respective lengths of haul these figures give Dublin an advantage, but they are stated by the Company to have been adopted with a view to bringing the rates to the two ports into closer relation.  That is to say, the County Meath Association of the Irish Farmers' Union has been instrumental in obtaining an improvement of the Belfast position in the direction of the standard hitherto enjoyed by Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that any part of the live stock or other traffic from the Saorstát across the Border is not duly credited to Saorstát's exports though it is understood that the official figures of exports from Northern Ireland are swollen by the inclusion of figures relating to traffic which merely passes through Northern Ireland on its way from the Saorstát to another country.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the number of fatal accidents which occurred in connection with the Shannon scheme since its inception; the number resulting in complete incapacity; and if he is in a position to indicate what compensation has been given either to the dependents or the sufferers themselves.</P>

Compensation varying according to the nature of the injury has been fixed by agreement or award in 12 cases.  The remainder will be duly dealt with under the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Acts.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="5" /> for Industry and Commerce if it is the intention of the Executive Council to promote legislation to amend the Unemployment Insurance Acts, so as to extend the period of benefit; and, if so, if he will state when the Bill will be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Unemployment Fund has at present a deficit to the amount of £1,515,000.  Assuming that the revenue of the Fund and the expenditure on benefit remain at their present annual levels it will take some 15 years to discharge this debt.  In the circumstances I cannot recommend to the Executive Council any legislation which would have the effect of still further increasing the deficit.</P>

      <P>The weekly consumption of flour in the Saorstát is estimated at from 52,000 to 58,000 sacks of 280 Ibs.; 55,000 sacks may be taken as a fair average.  Particulars of wheat and flour stocks at the periods mentioned are not available.

      <P>I am not informed of the day-to-day prices realised for the various kinds of fish landed at the different fishing ports of An Saorstát.  The returns received by my Department of the quantities of fish received in the Dublin market during the week, including the date mentioned in the question show that 65 hampers of fish came from Galway, each weighing 2 cwt.; of these 18 hampers were hake.  The average price of hake in that market for the week was 75/-.  I have no knowledge <Col N="12" /> of the retail prices at which fish in its various forms is sold in Dublin.</P>
      <P>During the week ended 30th October last the Dublin market was more or less glutted by heavy consignments of herrings of a quality too poor for curing. being mostly what are known in the fish trade as &ldquo;spents.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The usual facilities exist for sending fish by rail from Galway to Dublin or other centres.  The fish landed from Galway Bay up to noon can be on sale in Dublin next morning.  The fact that the catches referred to in the question were landed on a Saturday explains very largely the rather low prices realised.</P>
      <P>Adequate facilities for curing herrings exist in Galway.  The Department holds stocks of salt and barrels on the spot.  There are several herring curers in Galway, and herrings were cured early in the autumn season by these. I have no doubt that if the quality of the herrings landed by the boats on the date referred to by the Deputy had been such as to render them fit for curing, these curers would have been ready to deal with them.</P>

      <P>With regard to the first part of the question, the great majority, particularly of the small farmers, are paying their annuities regularly. The Deputy's proposal in the second part of the question applied to a concrete case amounts to this: a farmer with twenty acres of land paying an annuity of £20 for 68 years would, instead, be paying £18 10s. for 100 years; in other words, he would be relieved to the extent of £1 10s. per annum for 68 years, and would be penalised to the extent of £18 10s. per annum during the balance of the term of 100 years, namely, for 32 years.  The relief is not sufficiently apparent to justify us in repudiating our financial obligations and thus making it impossible to borrow money for any other purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will remember that on the Second Reading of the Land Bill suggestions were made by various parties dealing with matters that were not included by me in the Bill which I brought before the Dáil. In my reply I indicated that possibly these points could be dealt with in Committee.  That decision should, of course, have been as obvious to deputies as to myself.  I said on Second Reading that the various points mentioned, notably those by Deputy Gorey and some deputies on the Labour Benches, could be dealt with in Committee. I did not realise at the time that in dealing with some of these points amendments would have to be introduced which, in effect, would not be in order.  The points raised were mainly in connection with fee farm grants, residential holdings, building grounds, fisheries, and other matters which I need not mention at the moment.  I thought that we might be able to deal with some of these by way of introducing amendments to the Bill, that is to say, that deputies who are interested in getting a decision on these points could introduce amendments and have them discussed.  I indicated at the time that I would oppose them, but I stated that they could be discussed in Committee.  Now I find that a number of them cannot be discussed, as they would be out of order. Not that that would make any difference as, with great respect, I think I would have got Second Reading, and I do not think that my statement made any difference to getting Second Reading at the time.  I only made the statement very casually.  I do not say that my statement in introducing the Bill was very casual, and I <Col N="18" /> do not say that it had any profound-effect on deputies, or that they did not realise that it was a very important Bill.  I only mentioned casually, as I say, that certain points in which certain deputies were interested could be brought forward by way of amendment, but now I find that they are out of order.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that I indicated that these amendments could be brought forward, I suggest, with the leave of the House, that the Bill be referred to a Special Committee.  If the Money Resolution is passed it obviously will rule out some of these points, such as that in regard to fee farm grants, as it makes it impossible to increase the cost of service outside what is contemplated in the resolution. I suggest to adjourn the Money Resolution&mdash;at least, not to take it to-day&mdash; and I suggest also that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee of nine members, to be appointed by the body constituted for the purpose of appointing Select Committees.  We could deal then with these points that have been raised.  I think that there should be some sort of agreement that in Committee we will not roam too far afield and, generally speaking, deal only with the points raised on Second Reading, and which now would be out of order.  In addition to the amendments that would be in order, these should only be dealt with by the Committee.  Land law is a very wide and extensive subject, and a great many people have different views on almost every problem that arises, so that it could easily happen that a large number of amendments of all kinds could bo introduced in Committee.  I think there should be some sort of general understanding that only amendments indicated by deputies on Second Reading should be introduced, as well as whatever amendments I may find it necessary to introduce myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The real difficulty is that the Minister made certain suggestions without adverting to whether these suggestions were feasible from the point of view of procedure. He desires to be in the position of keeping his promises to deputies, and the procedure which he is now putting forward is one that has been suggested by the Chair.  When an amending Bill, a Bill to amend a principal Act, is introduced, all kinds of amendments to the principal Act are not in order.  Amendments, to be in order, must be relevant to something contained in the amending Bill.  That is one restriction.  There is a second restriction, namely, that when a Bill needs a Money Resolution, before the Committee Stage, deputies in Committee may be, and must be, precluded from proposing amendments for which no provision has been made in the Money Resolution.  On both these counts, certain amendments, which Deputy Gorey and other deputies desire to move, could not be moved if we took this Bill in a Committee of the whole Dáil or in a Special Committee.  The suggestion now is that the Bill should be sent to a Select Committee which would consider the Bill and make certain recommendations. In that Committee, amendments, such as those in regard to fee farm grants and other matters, could be discussed, and the report of the Committee to the House would enable the House itself to discuss these particular questions and give an opportunity to Deputy Gorey, and other deputies who are interested in these matters, to raise them in the House, not merely by way of discussion, but with a view to getting a decision on them. The Select Committee will be free to take into consideration any recommen- <Col N="21" /> dation it pleases.  The Minister, in suggesting that there should be some restrictions on the number of matters to be considered, made the suggestion on his own account.</P>
      <P>Of course if there is any haste for getting this Bill through at any time the Committee could be instructed to report back on a particular day.  I think that in itself will be sufficient to prevent the Select Committee roving too far from the principal Act.  If the Minister accepted any of the suggestions or recommendations of the Select Committee about fee farm grants, or any other matter, he would need to discharge the Order for the present Bill and bring in a new Bill, and a new Money Resolution.  What is being done is an endeavour to meet deputies and in no way to circumvent them.</P>

      <P>I agree that every point the Minister said he would embody he has embodied in the Bill, but it does not meet our view.  The Minister has done so in certain specific matters. What he has done is all right, but he does not propose to go to the extent that we want to go.  On the other <Col N="22" /> matters we were promised liberty to introduce amendments on the Second Reading.  Now we are debarred, and I think what the Ceann Comhairle has suggested is a way out, to let a Select Committee deal with the matter and report.  You will then have a new Bill and we agree.</P>

      <P>I am one of those who suggested certain amendments to the Land Bill, amongst others the amendment regarding fee farm grants.  I am perfectly prepared to accept the Minister's suggestion, which I think is a fair one and made in good faith, in order that he should endeavour to carry out his previous undertaking to set up a Select Committee.  I am anxious to know at this stage whether the report of the Select Committee will be presented to the Dáil before any subsequent Bill is proceeded with embodying any of the suggestions of the Committee, because we have had experience in other matters, where Select Committees were appointed, and the report was not published or furnished to the Dáil when Bills were about to be proposed, embodying certain procedure.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding with the business on the Orders of the Day, I desire, with the leave of the House, to refer to a matter affecting the privileges of the Dáil and involving the position of the Governor-General in respect to Deputies.  I refer to a speech made by the Governor-General at the Dublin Chamber of Commerce dinner on November 6th and reported in the newspapers on November 8th.  For the purposes of record I propose to read some extracts from the speech.  It will be recollected that the toast of Saorstát Eireann had been proposed, and the Governor-General, in responding, in the course of his speech gave expression to the following views:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Barry also referred to the courage and competence of Ministers, and I should like, being independent in this matter, because I hold office during the pleasure of his Majesty the King&mdash;I am not standing for any constituency.  I do not even desire to be a member of the Senate.  I should like to say that you have in these men as determined, as patriotic, as useful men as any country is likely to obtain.  I believe that in a year's time there is to be a General Election and, of course, on the eve of a General Election the Opposition makes tremendous promises.  That is all right in England, where you have successive Governments coming into power, each with a programme; but there is no practical Opposition in this country, and I should like to know on what grounds the members of the Government are being told that if a number of persons, whom we never heard of before, except in connection with explosions and assassinations, were put into power, they would have a regular transformation scene, and that this country would enter upon a terrestrial paradise, <Col N="25" /> without even the presence of the serpent.  Some of these so-called extremists talk about what is called principle, and I should like to give my opinion&mdash;it may be a very daring opinion&mdash;that outside religious subjects and beliefs, there is no such thing as principle.  There are only matters of opinion.  To these gentlemen who say that they will not enter into the legislature of their country because their principle forbids them to take the oath to His Majesty, I would say, in the words of Gilbert and Sullivan: `You are curious optimists; you never would be missed.' They are quite welcome to stay out, and the further out they stay the better some of us will be pleased.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, sir, is the speech of a political partisan.  But it was uttered by one who is required by the character of his office to stand apart, from political controversy; to be unbiased as between the rival parties that constitute the Parliamentary Assembly.  It was a speech made in public, referring specifically to the coming General Election, and its purpose was to glorify the party in power and to malign their opponents. It may have been unpremeditated&mdash;there is evidence of that in the speech itself&mdash;but the speaker was fully conscious that he was treading on forbidden ground.  It is important that, as members of the Dáil, we should know where we stand in relation to the office of the Governor-General.  If a nominated officer of State is free to enter the arena of political party conflict, to denounce deputies and parties who have been elected by the citizens, then the nature of his office is different from what has been the general belief, and the attitude of the public towards the office must accordingly change.</P>
    <P>When the views of the Governor-General on a matter of public policy differ from those of the Executive Council, is he not bound by any rule of usage or convention which would prevent him from taking the platform in opposition to the policy of the Ministry? Action such as that would, unquestionably, make the position of the Ministers untenable.  Either they or he would be obliged to vacate office.  On the other hand, when the Governor-General <Col N="26" /> approves of the political policy or activities of Ministers and desires that they should be re-elected and that their political opponents should be defeated at the poll, is the representative of the Crown free to proclaim aloud his hopes and desires and to follow the partisan course of ridiculing or decrying the opposition?  It appears to me that, having regard to the expressed desire of Ministers for progress towards democracy by evolutionary processes, and in justice to their own position as a Government responsible to the Dáil, it is incumbent upon them to express disapproval of the action of the Governor-General on the occasion in question.</P>
    <P>The illogical compromise between monarchical government and democratic government which characterises the British system, and is reflected in our Constitution, succeeds mainly because of the fact that the King in Great Britain, or the representative of the Crown in the Dominions, denies himself the privilege of interfering with the free judgment of the people and the people's representatives.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution, there has been established a legislature consisting of the King and two Houses&mdash;the Dáil and the Seanad.  Executive authority is exercisable by the representative of the Crown, acting on the advice of the Executive Council who, in turn, are responsible to the Dáil for all acts of government.  The position is that, in respect to all matters of State, the Governor-General is the instrument of the Executive Council, who are the servants of, and responsible to, the Dáil.  But, outside the sphere of Executive State action, there are political agitations, party controversies, public discussions, discussions which, under the parliamentary system, influence and determine legislation and executive action.  Upon political issues the electorate is divided, and the response made by the electorate to the appeals of rival parties decides who shall take over the responsibilities of &ldquo;advising&rdquo; (as it is called) the nominal Head of the State in matters of Government. It requires no abnormal insight into political affairs to see that the nature of his office requires of the Governor-General <Col N="27" /> that he should refrain strictly from expressing his personal views on controversial subjects.</P>
    <P>The practice and usage of strict abstention from the public expression of his political opinions by the King, or the representative of the Crown, is well established in Great Britain, in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.  Any departure from the practice in those countries would certainly entail serious consequences.  So well established is the rule that the Cabinet or Executive is held to be responsible for every public statement made by the King, or representative of the Crown, in reference to current political questions, and such practice and usage ought unquestionably to govern the conduct of the holder of the parallel office in Saorstát Eireann. But no formal rule appears to have been evolved, or has been required, in respect to party speeches of the kind which is devoted to advertising the virtues of one party and denouncing the vices or incompetence of their opponents.  The descent by the representative of the Crown to that level is, so far as I can find, unprecedented.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that at a time when our Ministers are in conference with the Ministers of Great Britain and the Dominions, with the object we have been assured, of clarifying the constitutional position of the Free State and establishing its claim to equality with those countries, that the representative of the Crown in the Saorstát should act in a manner so prejudicial to the position taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>All parties in this House are, I believe, in agreement that the Governor-General must be a citizen of the Saorstát. That fact emphasises the importance of making clear the rule for future guidance that the occupant of the office must forget his political affiliations and forego for a period some of the privileges of citizenship.  I venture to say that there is no one who has taken any interest in modern Irish political history but has watched with admiration the conflict between the Governor-General and <Col N="28" /> Mr. Tim Healy&mdash;the internal struggle between the State official and the fighting politician.  It has required the exercise of great self-restraint for Mr. T.M. Healy to deny himself the joy of wielding the tomahawk.  I had thought that the Impartial Official had succeeded in subduing the Partisan&mdash;but it appears the processes of evolution are not rapid enough to enable the leopard to change his spots within one generation.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this incident is but a trifling indiscretion and should be passed over lightly.  We cannot regard it lightly.  The Dáil ought not allow to pass without strenuous protest a constitutional impropriety which, if condoned, would imply a willingness to accept as nominal head of the State a political partisan, responsible to no one in this country for his actions, but free to use his privileged position to promote certain political ends.</P>
    <P>However difficult it may be to repress one's impulses, this House is bound to require that whosoever may hold the office of Governor-General, or any equivalent office in this country, shall not use his position to prejudice the electorate against any member of the Dáil or the claim to unbiased treatment of any party or deputy who, following the verdict of the poll, may be called upon to form a Government, and I trust the general sense of the Dáil will find expression on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I much regret that an occasion has arisen which necessitates reference in the Dáil to a speech of the Governor-General.  The speech of the Governor-General at the dinner of the Chamber of Commerce was not made on the advice of the Executive Council and, therefore, the Executive Council cannot accept any responsibility for that pronouncement.</P>
      <P>May I be permitted to quote from Mr. O'Higgins' speech, delivered here in the Dáil on 7th July, 1925, dealing with the official actions of the Governor-General:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;... The official actions of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State are, of course, as the Deputy (Deputy Johnson) has pointed out, governed by Article 51 of the <Col N="29" /> Constitution.  The Executive acts performed by him are done on the advice of the Executive Council, and not otherwise.  There has been no departure from the spirit or the letter of that Article of the Constitution, and I can safely guarantee, on behalf of the Executive Council, that there will be no such departure...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And later:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... the word `advice' used in Article 51 of the Constitution has a different meaning when it is used in the sense of the Executive Council `advising' His Excellency.  In that case the word `advice' is a signification of the decision of the Council in matters of policy....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The office of Governor-General is, in essence, an office of a non-partisan character. The duties of that office are clearly defined.  The persons to advise the Governor-General are set out in the Constitution as the Executive Council. The Executive Council is elected by the Dáil and it is conceivable, and will sooner or later arise, that on a given day certain persons may comprise the Executive Council.  To put it shortly, the Government in office to-day may be the Opposition to-morrow.  To-day, the Governor-General receives and acts on the advice from the Government in office; to-morrow the Opposition may comprise the Executive Council and the Governor-General, in turn, will receive and act on their advice.  It is, therefore, plain that the office of Governor-General must be of a non-partisan character, ready to receive advice, as provided in the Constitution, from any deputy of this House, duly nominated by the House as President.  It is a matter for regret that such a speech as that referred to by Deputy Johnson should have been published.</P>

      <P>May I be permitted to speak without interruption. Deputy Johnson was given that courtesy.  I said &ldquo;published&rdquo; and I am adhering to that word.  I understand from His Excellency that it is, not a correct report of the speech that he made on the occasion of the dinner at the Chamber of Commerce, that a full and complete report would not <Col N="30" /> have occasioned any objection.  I may say that the Executive Council could not approve of such a speech as was reported.</P>

      <P>This is a very serious matter, and it is, I think, in essence a non-controversial matter.  It has been dealt with in a serious, noncontroversial way.  There has been no allusion to the personality of the Governor-General by Deputy Johnson or the President.  If other deputies desire to speak on the question, I think, in justice to the dignity of this House and the high constitutional issues involved, they should speak in exactly the same tone.</P>

      <P>Unlike the President and the Deputy who has spoken, I did not know this speech was made until to-day, and I have not an elaborate, typed copy of what I desire to say.  It has been stated by Deputy Johnson and adopted by the President that the Governor-General has been guilty of a very improper pronouncement, or, rather, an indiscretion.  Reading down the speech, I do not think we ought to attach too much importance to it.  He talked about other Parties and the Opposition whom they did not know anything about.  He referred to one particular Party.  I daresay he includes in his meaning the alleged Opposition, as he is pleased to regard it. Further down in his speech he refers to the Dublin Corporation and the good work done there by three men who were unknown and ignorant. After describing those people as &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; and &ldquo;ignorant&rdquo; he proceeds to speak of the good work they have done.  I think that is a pretty fair indication of what other &ldquo;unknown men&rdquo;&mdash;unknown to His Excellency&mdash; might do, if they got the same opportunity as the Government have.  I shall not indulge in any personal references. I say the Governor-General has been guilty of a grave indiscretion, and I hope, for the dignity of the Saorstát and his high office, that such will not be repeated.</P>

      <P>I am sure the President's disclaimer, in the name of His Excellency the Governor-General, <Col N="31" /> will give profound relief to deputies, and to the public also.  Without your interposition, sir, I, at any rate, would have spoken precisely in the spirit recommended by you.  We have no concern in this matter with the personality, the private individuality, of the Governor-General, but we have very much, indeed, to do with the office and the discharge of the office.  One of the great claims made here in this House in defence of the selection of the present Governor-General was that we alone, of all the components of the Commonwealth of Nations, had been permitted the privilege of having a citizen of the State appointed Governor-General. The claim had been made repeatedly by Canada and by Australia that they should be accorded that privilege. Saorstát Eireann was the first, on being afforded Dominion status, to be allowed that selection.  Deputy Johnson rightly emphasised the significance of that fact.  If it be, as on all hands it is admitted that it must be, the duty of a Governor-General to behave as a constitutional sovereign is pledged to behave, it is all the more necessary, where that office is filled by a citizen of the State, that he should become absolutely one divorced from all political connections, impartial and indifferent to all the movements of political policy, and knowing no difference between the adherents of one policy and that of another.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gorey thinks that this is of little consequence.  We do not know who may succeed to the office in the course of time.  It may be someone with flagrant propensity to constitutional impropriety, and it is well that the doctrine should be laid down here, and assented to generally, before an evil appointment of that kind comes above the horizon.  Later than this would be too late.  We should be grateful for the happy chance that has afforded us the opportunity of declaring our minds upon the intervention of the Governor-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the disclaimer given by the President in the name of the Governor-General, and I say that even the very rumour of a performance, such as was credited to him, is an advantage as <Col N="32" /> affording us the opportunity here of declaring our position in these matters. The Governor-General is not only the representative of the Crown; he is more.  Under Article 2 of the Treaty our position in regard to the Imperial Crown and the Imperial Government is declared to be that of Canada and other nations of Dominion status.  Now, one of the grievances particularly dwelt upon by General Smuts, and repeatedly referred to by the greatest of our living constitutionalists &mdash; Sir Robert Borden, so long Prime Minister of Canada&mdash;was that their Governor-General was not a Viceroy, and one of the reasons actuating us here during the days of the Provisional Parliament in objecting to the selection of the title &ldquo;Governor-General&rdquo; for this State&mdash; a State which never grew from the position of a colony into a nation, but had ever been ranked in Europe among the oldest of the nations, an ancient kingdom&mdash;was that we objected to the title of Governor-General because it was a step back from Viceroy position to representative of the Crown, to mere Governor-Generalship.  I remember well&mdash;I am sure it is in the recollection of many Deputies&mdash;that grave censure was passed upon the present Governor-General because one of the very first official acts of his was to go to London and visit the Duke of Devonshire, who was at that time Colonial Secretary.  As a matter of fact, it was his duty to do so, because Governor-Generals hold under the Colonial Secretary and are obliged to make official communication through the Colonial Secretary.  That fact and that relation stamps the Governor-General with the character of being not only a representative of the Crown but, what is mentioned in Article 2 of the Treaty, he is also a representative of the Imperial Government. It is one of the respects in which we require to have the position of the Saorstát more clearly defined with a view to what the Minister for External Affairs called &ldquo;the implementation of co-equality in the Commonwealth.&rdquo; Until we have an Agent-General, representing the Imperial Government&mdash;I am using this as an illustration&mdash;in this State, the Governor-General has that function as well as representative of <Col N="33" /> the Crown, and pending, therefore, the implementation of co-equality, it is incumbent upon whoever fills the office that he should not refer to English politics that he should not go out of his way to refer to a grave crisis in the affairs of a neighbouring State, any more than he should meddle with the question of partisan politics in the State over which he himself is Governor-General.  The question is an important constitutional question.  It involves, as a collateral issue, the whole position of the Saorstát in the Commonwealth of Nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>

      <P>However regrettable this matter may be&mdash;it is regrettable as we all recognise&mdash;I think it is a matter for congratulation that it is brought forward as a Constitutional question of grave importance, and in the manner in which it was brought forward by Deputy Johnson.  Further, it was treated by the President as a grave and important matter, and is being treated generally as such.  I rejoice indeed at the disclaimer which the President was able to give.  I only rise really to make one remark, and I make it as one who did, at one time, hold different political opinions from those held by the majority here and, therefore, as one whose attitude with regard to the Governor-General might be regarded as perhaps different.  It is not so.  I wish to record my feeling also, that just as it would be unthinkable almost for the King of England to take part in any way in party politics, and not to be entirely above party politics, so I think it is a matter of Constitutional importance here, and will, I trust, be equally unthinkable in the future, that the Governor-General should not be entirely above the plane of party politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to raise a question of procedure.  There are here four distinct Bills.  Yet they refer to changes in the Constitution which may possibly have relationship one to the other and which, I think, certainly, will involve, if they are passed, some changes in the electoral law and, perhaps, other consequential changes.  I think it would be difficult to discuss those Bills independently of each other.  I suggest there ought to be a Committee of the House set up to inquire into their effect before we give them a Second Reading or, certainly, immediately after Second Reading is given, if it is given.  I would rather desire that before any Bills of this kind were introduced there should be a Committee of the House, or a joint committee of the two Houses, set up to consider what necessary changes are required in respect of the Constitution due to the little experience we have had of the working of its machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I desire now to ask if the President has any suggestions to make regarding the reference of these Bills, as a whole, <Col N="35" /> to a Committee, or whether it is intended that they should be taken independently and separately and, therefore, that the discussion be confined to the particular Bill under discussion.  I do not think it is possible to disentangle one Bill from the other entirely.  Therefore, I think there ought to be opportunity provided whereby the effect of the changes, as a whole, may be discussed and the necessary consequential changes in the electoral law may also be discussed.</P>

      <P>I would have no objection to having the four Bills put to a special committee of the House.  I do not think they affect so much the Seanad as the Dáil.  I think a Committee of this House would suffice. These four measures are considered necessary in the light of our experience. There were other matters dealt with by the Committee appointed, but it is not proposed to publish the report of that Committee.  There are many reasons for that.  The report will be there for our successors when they come to discharge the duties of the Executive Council, and they can benefit by whatever information is embodied in it.  I would be prepared to meet Deputy Johnson's point to have those four measures, after Second Reading, referred to a special committee of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I feel that if Second Reading is assented to we are more or less committed to the Bills, and I cannot see how we are to discuss the Second Reading of the first Bill without referring to the effect of No. 2, 3 and 4 Bills.  I think, even before we arrive at Second Reading, there ought to be an opportunity for representatives of the different parties in the House to discuss the Bills in the light of what the Government has to say following the inquiry which their Departmental Committee has informed them on.  It is certainly not in accordance with any procedure that I am aware of.  But I do not see why we should not have a Committee of the Dáil set up before we arrive at the Second Reading stage.  When we have the views of the Government put before us, in print, <Col N="36" /> then let the Committee be set up to consider the proposals of the Bills and the effect of those Bills upon the constitutional position and the electoral laws.</P>

      <P>Before leave is given to introduce the Bill, is it not desirable that the House should be put in possession of the reasons for the desire to legislate in this way?  We all understand that a Committee has been sitting to investigate the changes required in the Constitution in the light of the experience of its work.  Rumours have been circulated as to what items of the Constitution came under review and as to the suggestions of change.  We are all aware that there is one particular item in the Constitution which requires revision, if not recision.  Are we not to have an opportunity of reviewing the Constitution as reviewed by that Committee?  Are we not to be put in possession of their findings, if, as might be presumed, these are the outcome of it; and the fruits of the advice tendered to the Executive Council? After all, it will be admitted, I think, that the public is very much concerned in certain articles of the Constitution, and if it is the case that the Committee did not investigate selected articles of the Constitution, but the Constitution in its entirety, why should we not have the advantage of their inquiry?  Why should it be a secret piece of enlightenment merely for the Executive Council to deal out portion of it by instalments, not in the direct form of advice but in legislative results?  Without expressing any opinion whatever, favourable or unfavourable, I think, if only as a matter of courtesy to the House, one is entitled to ask what reasons prompted these particular revisions.</P>

      <P>I must say I am not at all satisfied with the President's explanation as to why the findings of this Committee should be kept secret.  What was there secret about the Constitution or that should not be made public?  Why is it that the people of this State who are intimately associated and bound up with the Constitution, should not have the right to discuss in public, and to go into freely, the whole question of the Constitution on the finding of a Commitee set up by <Col N="37" /> the Executive Council.  Is there anything in this report which the Executive Council does not want to be disclosed and, if not, why not disclose it?  Why not have the report published for the benefit of the public at large?  I suppose, like Deputy Magennis, that these proposals are based upon some of the findings of this Committee.  If they are, why not say so?  Why place this veil and cloak of secrecy around an investigation into a matter that is of the deepest and of the utmost concern for every citizen in the community?  I must say that the President's explanation in no way satisfies me.  I cannot, by any stretch of imagination, see why the Committee appointed to investigate a matter of such importance and public concern as this should be private and secret and that their findings should not be made public and be broadcast to the country.</P>

      <P>We will, of course, have to take motions for the introduction of these particular Bills. Two questions have been raised, one of which I might express an opinion upon myself; that is, the question of procedure on constitutional amendments. Deputy Johnson suggests that constitutional amendments before they go to Second Reading, or Bills introduced in this way for constitutional amendments, should go to a Committee even before the Second Reading.  The President has agreed to that, and I think it is very sound procedure.  At any rate, it is perfectly clear that a Bill amending the Constitution should, if possible, be submitted to some special kind of procedure.  The other question raised about the report of the Committee is, of course, a different question altogether &mdash; one simply between the Executive Council itself, the Committee which reported, and anyone who wants the report. I presume the suggestion now is that these Bills should be introduced when they have been printed; a motion to be introduced by the President <Col N="38" /> submitting these four Bills under new Standing Order 65 to a Select Committee, that Committee to make its report, and then whatever action is considered suitable to be taken immediately.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing to ask the Dáil for leave to introduce this Bill and to make it an Act this week.  I suppose every member of the Dáil is in possession of the information which has been published concerning the attacks made in five counties in the Saorstát on members of the Gárda Síochána, and in one case here in Dublin on some soldiers.  As a result of these attacks one officer of the Gárda was killed, almost at once, and in the case of the other Guard he died sometime this morning.  There is little doubt but that a conspiracy has been formed for the purpose of subverting order in the State.  The attacks made upon those unarmed peace officers in many places indicate that there must be some centre from which instructions are issued in order to bring about a series of raids almost at the same time on a particular day.  In addition to making attacks upon the peace officers of the State, who function by the authority and with the consent of this House and who are paid out of moneys levied and collected by the representatives of the people and with their sanction, the telegraph wires were cut, trees were cut down and roads were blocked and an attempt was made to terrorise the people of the country.  This conspiracy must be met and dealt with, and the purpose of this measure is to give the Executive such powers as it may require in order to deal with this menace.  We had hoped that such incidents as have happened within the last few days would not recur.  We believe that the force which is behind them and the genius which is directing them will be unable to make any sustained attack upon the liberty, the order and the peace of the State, but we do ask and believe that we are entitled to ask for such powers for the Executive as will enable it to deal with such murderous attacks upon unarmed men as have occurred in these instances.  I will be in a better position on the Second Reading to give the chain of circumstances which go to show that this particular incident <Col N="41" /> which has happened within the last few days has been, and must have been, the result of a considered conspiracy. I need not tell the Dáil at any great length that it is rather difficult, to get evidence of such a character as would lead to the conviction of persons for these crimes which have been committed.  But I do hope, and I am confident, that the good sense of this House will readily give the powers that are asked, and that it will be shown we have behind us in dealing with a conspiracy of this sort the goodwill and co-operation of every citizen who abhors murder, who objects to robbery, and who insists that law and order as established by this Dáil and the institutions of the people of this country must be maintained at whatever cost.  In one of the cases in which these outrages was committed a member of the Gárda Síochána was robbed of either £15 or £30.  Well, political movements have certainly degenerated if idealists of to-day in furtherance of their policy in carrying out their intent have to stoop to such a proceeding as robbing an unarmed Civic Guard of his wages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for objecting to the introduction of this Bill is that the Executive Council have at present ample power under legislation to put down disturbances, murder or robbery committed in the Saorstát. No doubt from the President's speech any Deputy who stands up here and goes against the introduction of legislation of this kind will be branded as being an associate of murderers and <Col N="42" /> robbers outside the House.  I know that I am not an associate of either one or the other.  If the President has information that would lead to the arrest of those who committed the crimes on last Sunday evening he has ample power to deal with them under the law as it stands at present.  This Dáil has to its credit the execution of 67 Irishmen.  Is the Dáil going to give power to the Executive Council to take more innocent men, or men who have been led astray by some person who had been a great advocate from a national point of view in years gone by, or who will be led astray by some such person in the coming year, and give the Executive Council power to take up another 67 and execute them?  I appeal to the Dáil not to vote in favour of the introduction of this measure as the Government has sufficient power already to deal with the situation without giving them more power so that they may be able to arrest men if they could find out what their thoughts are and cast them into prison &mdash;that is if they thought a person was thinking of something against the State.  No doubt if these raids had not taken place on Sunday night last the President would still have come forward to-day and asked for permission to introduce this Bill.  He has very good grounds to-day because the raids took place on Sunday night, but it is not since Sunday the Executive Council made up their minds to introduce this Bill.  Surely it must have been under discussion by the Executive Council before that?</P>

      <P>Then the President confesses it is simply and solely on account of the raids on Sunday night that he has asked for leave to introduce this Bill.  In my opinion no member of the Dáil should vote in favour of this Bill, for to do so would be to vote for further disturbance in the country.  We do not want drastic legislation now, but should instead appeal to outsiders to come in and to take their places here and act as representatives of the people in this House.  We should try and prove that all the old enmity is forgotten, and that we are prepared to <Col N="43" /> shake hands with those who have been opposed to us, and to carry on with the free goodwill of the people instead of saying, &ldquo;if you commit this offence or that offence we will lock you up without trial or charge made, and if necessary execute you.&rdquo;  I certainly oppose giving leave to introduce this Bill.</P>

      <P>As one Deputy I am fully prepared to agree to any proposal put before this House for giving to the Government any powers they may require to ensure that the civil power will rule in this country.  I do not care what that civil power is, or to what party it belongs, once it has a mandate for its political doctrines the only way to deal with it is in a constitutional manner.  Any power that is required to put a term to the operations of the blackguard and the coward I am prepared to give.  It may be held in some places that what occurred on Sunday were acts of bravery.  I say it was no bravery, and that the Irish name for bravery has been tarnished and brought down to the dust.  It is no bravery for armed men to come in among unarmed people.  They would not have come at all, in my opinion, had they known the other people were armed.  As an Irishman, I feel insulted by what has happened.</P>
      <P>This is an effort to play at bravery, but what in effect has been done is that the Irish name has been disgraced and has been made a by-word of.  Instead of bravery we have evidence of the most arrant cowardice, that any man calling himself an Irishman should be ashamed of.

      <P>I am very pleased to hear that expression of opinion from Deputy Mulcahy.  I had intended to be in a better position to-morrow to deal with the history of the two Guards in question.  I had hoped then to make a reference to it.  I believe Deputy Mulcahy has given expression to an opinion which is in every citizen's mind, that is every citizen except those who took part in the occurrences in which the Guards lost their lives.  I think every citizen feels a pride in the way in which these young men do their duty and in the splendid tradition under which the Gárda Síochána have carried on in spite of extraordinary difficulties during the last four or five years.  Every citizen, I think, feels confident in appealing to any one of them in any matter connected with his duty.  Personally I would like to pay a tribute to the extraordinary courage of these men.</P>
      <P>On the morning following these outrages, the Commissioner was out from 2 a.m. to 5 a.m.  He had issued instructions that motors were to be stopped all over the country and in the short distance of twenty miles he himself was held up eight times.  It takes considerable courage on the part of men to stop a car when perhaps they know full well that some of the passengers are armed.  One of the incidents which I had intended to describe to-morrow occurred in Midleton last week, where four men passing in a motor car were held up.  They refused to halt and drove on.  Fortunately the railway gates were closed against them and they turned back.  An unarmed Civic Guard then mounted the footboard and held on until the driver pulled up.  In that car a revolver was found under the seat.  I do not think too much can be said of the great courage and the great devotion to duty which have been shown by these men and I am very glad of the opportunity which Deputy Mulcahy has given to us of expressing to the relatives of the deceased men our very sincere regret that such valuable lives have been lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has, in fact, had its Second Reading, and the remark which has been publicly made recently that the old Bill had been entirely scrapped and that this is a completely new piece of legislation is quite inaccurate.  The old Bill has been scrapped in certain respects, mainly in accordance with the Report which is in the hands of every Deputy. Instead, therefore, of discussing any principle which may be in a technical Bill of this sort, I propose mainly to indicate the two points upon which the Report of the Committee has not been followed, and to give an indication of what has been done on the four points stated at the end of the Report to <Col N="48" /> have been left over for further consideration. I may remark, however, that there has been considerable regrouping of clauses and that the amendments as they appear in the Report do not appear in the Bill literally in the form in which they are presented from the Select Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two important changes, however.  The Report under heading A. indicates that searches for prior publication are recommended in the London records up to the 6th December, 1921, for so much of the fifty years' period as Ireland was part of the United Kingdom.  Of course there will be a search made for the remainder of the period, as from the date of the commencement of the Act down to any application, but there is a gap between these two periods&mdash;from 6th December to the date of the commencement of the Act&mdash;and for that gap no searches are recommended.  It is logically correct, of course, that a disclosure by way of a specification made in Great Britain during that period should not count against an invention which was first published in that short period of years, but the principle has been adopted in the Bill, as one of the changes recommended by the Committee, that all patents up to the date of the commencement of the Act published in Great Britain, for which application has been made and a specification lodged, should be taken over, subject to the power of revocation, and it might happen, if it were not adverted to and an appeal for revocation were made, that two patents would be running concurrently in this State, held by different people.  It is accordingly proposed that the gap should be closed and that a search would be made not merely for the period down to 6th December, 1921, and further searches for the period beginning with the date of the commencement of the Act and ending on the date of the application, but also that the search should cover the period that is otherwise left out. That, in fact, is one of the departures from the Report of the Committee. Section 19 sets out what I have been speaking of, and the right of an applicant in this country is safeguarded <Col N="49" /> by Section 12, giving him his power to apply for revocation.</P>
    <P>In Part E, Section 52 of the Report, there is a recommendation as to the deletion of a paragraph, the paragraph referring to the provision that the publication of any specification more than 50 years before the date of the application should not invalidate a patent.  It has, however, been thought well to retain that provision.  All British pre-Treaty patents will be valid in that way, and British patents granted between the Treaty and the commencement of this Act will also be valid in this country, subject to revocation. The point with regard to publication prior to the fifty years' period is not an important one, but if we did not keep this provision it would mean a considerable change in the law between the two countries, and it is not thought worth while to have that change for the very small difference that would be made.</P>
    <P>Four matters were left over by the Select Committee for consideration, and these were referred to in the last page of the Report.  The first is:&mdash;&ldquo;The provision in Section 164 restricting copyright in Government publications to 50 years, and relating to the ownership of copyright in works published under the control of the British Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are really two points in that, one of which is the point as to the time, and we are keeping the provision with regard to the 50 years' period.  It seems to be a reasonable period, and it is, in fact, the one that was in the old Copyright Act of 1911.  We have, however, deleted sub-section (3) of Section 164 as it was.  It is now Section 167. Sub-section (3) has been deleted because it is considered that the right of the Government of Saorstát Eireann to a share in the ownership of pre-Treaty publications rests, and will continue to rest, on the ordinary law, and in fact, will not be questioned.  The second point is &ldquo;provision for relief from renewal fees in the case of `provisional' and foreign applicants.&rdquo;  The word in the Report is &ldquo;removal.&rdquo;  That has been adverted to and the relief has been effected by sub-sections (5) and (6) of Section 12, which provide that in the <Col N="50" /> case of provisional and foreign applicants, they shall only begin to run from the date of the commencement of the Act.  Consequently, we are removing the injustice that was spoken of, that we were making people pay for a patent during a period in which no protection was given.</P>
    <P>The possibility of using Iris Oifigiúil as the official journal was definitely brought under review and the decision is that it is not possible to make use of it.  Under the International Convention we are bound to issue an official journal.  It has to be of a highly technical nature, and has to print illustrations of all inventions.  For this purpose Iris Oifigiúil as at present issued would have to undergo considerable change.  It would have to be issued more frequently, it would be very bulky, and it would prove a much more costly expedient than having Iris Oifigiúil issued as at present, and a separate patents journal issued when required.</P>
    <P>The fourth point is definitely provided for in Section 19, sub-section (3), which now indicates that searches may be made not only in London but in the National Library of Ireland and elsewhere, subject to regulations to be issued by the Minister.  It may easily happen that particular types of searches may be made in other centres than the Patent Office in London or in the National Library in Dublin.  There are other registers which may be used for different types of applications. There are, however, two further points I would like to refer to, outside the Report.  In the old Bill there was a Section 61 and a Section 81, which were rather novel, in regard to designs and trade marks suggestive of Irish origin. Section 61 dealt with designs suggestive of Irish origin, and Section 81 dealt with trade marks indicative of Irish origin, and special provisions had been laid down with regard to these.  These two clauses have now been deleted from the Bill.  They may be reinserted if Deputies think it is right and proper, but the argument against them is that what they sought to effect seems possible of effecting only by an amendment in the Merchandise Marks Act, and not by what was set out in <Col N="51" /> these two sections.  In addition to that there is the further point that the Comptroller may, even with these two sections, refuse designs or trade marks, where he considers that they would be contrary to morality, national interest, or a few general things of that sort.  I cannot locate the section at the moment.  It is considered that the Comptroller will have as much power under the general section as would be given to him under these Sections 61 and 81 if they were retained.  However, that is for the consideration of Deputies, and if they see any value in these two sections they may again be put into the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will call the attention of the Dáil to the provisions with regard to the supply of books to libraries.  It is somewhat changed in this Bill from the Bill that was previously before the Dáil. The changes now made are in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee.  It may be thought that these changes are undesirable, or it may be thought that neither the provisions in the earlier Bill nor in the Bill as it now stands, meet the case.  Amendments even for the purpose of a discussion on that point will be welcome. The rest of the Bill was mainly as it came from this House many months ago, and I do not propose to deal with it any further.</P>

As is clear to Deputies who have any experience at all of this matter, these <Col N="52" /> are very difficult and complicated questions and they naturally take some time to elucidate.

      <P>This is a Bill which was first introduced in the Seanad by Senator de Loughrey.  It was afterwards considerably enlarged on being considered by a Select Committee before which Mr. J.J. Horgan, the Coroner for Cork, gave evidence. The object of the Bill is to bring certain points in the law relating to Coroners and Coroners' inquests up-to-date. As it stands, the code is very antiquated.  It is over eighty years old.  It was considered that a proper codification of the law was desirable and the present Bill is useful.  It suggests changes which are desirable and it is by no means controversial. This Bill recommends certain changes and I think the Dáil ought to give it a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>There is one point with regard to what I think is an omission in the Bill, and I put it to the Minister that he might consider the advisability of adding certain powers which would enable the Coroner to treat in a punitive fashion the prejudicing of an inquiry by the publication of details of, may be, the murder or manslaughter of the person in respect to whose death the inquiry is to be made.  I refer to this because <Col N="53" /> it has occasioned certain references in Great Britain recently, and I think it is quite a reasonable proposition that the action of newspapers in making their own particular inquiries and disclosing all kinds of morbid details should be treated in a somewhat similar fashion as the action of newspapers touching ordinary criminal prosecutions.  I throw out the suggestion and I hope the Minister will give some consideration to the desirability of making an addition to the Bill in that respect.</P>

Of late we have been reading particulars in the newspapers of cases in Great Britain where very harrowing accounts of post-mortem examinations and exhumations, which it is highly undesirable that the public should be made acquainted with, were set out in detail.  Therefore, I think the suggestion made to the Minister by Deputy Johnson is worthy of consideration.  I am very much in favour of the rest of the Bill, because it is introducing a great many of the things we have been seeking for years in the way of reform in connection with the Coroner's Court.</P>

We know, unfortunately, that there have been cases where Gardái lost their lives in the execution of their duty, and there were no public demonstrations of the sympathy of the people, and yet the sympathy was just as great and our feeling of abhorrence at the crimes just as intense as in these cases.  I, think it is not at all fitting that there should be official State action taken in the form of a demonstration of sympathy in respect to these particular Gardái, when there were not similar demonstrations of sympathy in respect to the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope it will be understood that I am not less sympathetic or have less kindlier feelings in this matter because I say these things, but I do feel it is undesirable that the practice should go on, or that we should make a precedent of demonstrating in this public fashion our feelings of sympathy with particular men who have lost their lives in the execution of their duty, or our abhorrence of the crimes through which they have so lost their lives.  I am very <Col N="55" /> doubtful as to the discretion that has led to this decision.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this matter of the fuel situation and the acute position which developed for a certain period, I am afraid I will have to go back somewhat into the past in order to show what the activities of my own Department were in the matter of seeing that coal and fuel generally were coming into the country in sufficient supplies to warrant the emergency regulations which were referred to in the Dáil not being moved.</P>
      <P>During the week immediately preceding the coal strike and the general strike in Great Britain a general stocktaking was undertaken by my Department in regard to supplies of wheat, flour, coal, petrol and paraffin in the area of the Irish Free State. The figures when they were gathered were very reassuring as it developed that there were many months' stocks of wheat and flour and many months' stocks of petrol and paraffin, and even if the general strike had extended to this country there would have been abundant supplies of these essentials for a much longer period than a general strike could in all probability have lasted.  As the general strike did not extend to this country, sources of supply were, of course, always open. In addition to this the special matter of yeast was investigated, as none of it is now manufactured in the Saorstát. Arrangements were made to ensure the maintenance of supplies to all districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the special matter of coal the position varied largely according to the district, but in all districts the position was such as to give no immediate cause for anxiety.  Public utility services carried large stocks.  I am speaking now of the period about the 30th April.  The flour millers, bakers and industrialists generally were very well supplied.  The more important, but, at a time of crisis, nonessential <Col N="56" /> industries carried fairly heavy stocks.  It is to the credit of private firms that at that time no hesitancy was shown in supplying exact information.  In addition to the stocks held by consumers the coal merchants in the larger centres were well supplied.  The Dublin Coal Merchants' Association in particular carried stocks which, it was stated, would suffice for six weeks under normal conditions.</P>
    <P>Early in May&mdash;about 3rd May&mdash; there was a general meeting of the Dublin Coal Merchants' Association at which a resolution was passed&mdash;it was afterwards communicated to me&mdash; appointing a Committee &ldquo;to consider the situation that has arisen owing to the strike of miners in Great Britain, and to take such steps as may be necessary: (a) to ascertain the stocks of coal held by merchants and industries; (b) to protect the public interest and (c) to give all information possible to the Government.&rdquo;  At this time the main complaints received came from importers of coal to the effect that cargoes loading at ports in Great Britain were being held up.  About a fortnight later The Protection of the Community (Special Powers) Act, 1926, was passed and draft regulations under that Act for the control of coal supplies were prepared immediately in my Department.</P>
    <P>About this time, and up to the 2nd of June, I had very many interviews with representatives of the Dublin Coal Merchants' Association.  Mr. Morrison, who was the British Coal Controller in Ireland at one time, was present.  As a result of these interviews the Association undertook to work in co-operation with me and to maintain supplies.  In view of these undertakings it was decided that it was unnecessary at that moment to declare a state of national emergency or to issue the regulations prepared.</P>
    <P>On 2nd June Deputy Major Bryan Cooper put a question in the Dáil as to whether it was proposed either to reduce the number of railway services in the Saorstát or to limit the consumption of coal in any other way.  My reply was:&mdash;&ldquo;The action referred to in the question could only be taken <Col N="57" /> under regulations made in accordance with the Protection of the Community (Special Powers) Act.  According to my information such action is not necessary at the moment, though the situation may change so rapidly as to render it soon advisable.  Since only one of many available sources of coal supply is at present closed, I would expect coal merchants to maintain supplies without any serious difficulty and without the need of cumbersome and drastic regulations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was public notice given in that of my intentions as they were at that time, and of the view-point which we had on the whole situation.  From that date on my Department was in the closest possible touch and in constant communication with the Coal Merchants' Association.  All applications for assistance in obtaining supplies of coal received by my Department were referred to the Association.  They were not in any great numbers around about this time.  As I have stated, they were referred to the Association.  Applications were from time to time received from districts as far apart as Cavan, Monaghan, Athlone, Killarney, Castlebar, Cobh, Enniscorthy, Bagnalstown, Athy, Trim, Limerick and Drogheda.</P>
    <P>Without exception these applications were duly met&mdash;until the middle of October.  At that time an extreme shortage of supplies in Dublin and an almost complete lack of cargoes due, was suddenly disclosed.  No warning, nor indeed hint of any kind, as to this situation impending was given to my Department by the Coal Merchants' Association, although my Department was in frequent communication with the Association during the period when this situation was impending.  It appears that about the middle of September, with prices rising and some expectation of an early settlement of the dispute in England, many of the merchants decided to stop further orders. When the emergency arose in October, I was told that only five firms out of the nineteen in the Association had any orders outstanding.  The prime cause of the emergency was therefore the failure of the Association, which had been meeting readily all requisitions <Col N="58" /> from my Department for supplies, to give any information whatever as to the drastic change in its arrangements. This is all the more surprising in view of the assurances readily given to me personally by the Association, when I met its representatives in June.</P>
    <P>I can understand the reluctance of the Association, or, at least, the members with restricted resources, to incur large commitments in an uncertain market, but no reason has yet been given to me why the position in which they then found themselves was not frankly anticipated, so that we might consult as to the best measures to be taken.  It is remarkable that the merchants in other cities and towns, with resources less than are available to the large Dublin Association, have, notwithstanding serious difficulties, been able to maintain sufficient supplies to prevent local emergencies of the extent of that which arose in Dublin.  The first hint of an acute shortage impending came from some of the smaller gas undertakings, which advised the Department early in October that they were running out of supplies.  The matter was taken up with the local Merchants' Association, which considered that the position could not be-so serious as represented, since recently-arrived cargoes of coal suitable for the making of gas, had been offered to but refused by gas undertakings. Some commercial undertakings had, it was evident, taken no special trouble to secure that the supplies of coal on which they depended, would be forthcoming, and, even at a later date, they had no realisation of the position, while others had made careful and full provision for their needs for a considerable period.  While admitting that supplies were short for the immediate future, large private orders were stated by the Association to have been placed. Further investigation showed the necessity for special measures.  Arrangements were made to issue coal from the stocks held by Government Departments to the City Commissioners, and to suitable authorities elsewhere, with a view to making provision for the poor.  The City Commissioners were provided with information as to the sources of turf supply, and put into <Col N="59" /> communication with the Coal Merchants' Association in order to secure a proportion of cargoes of briquettes which the Association had on order.</P>
    <P>The Association was pressed to place further orders.  I met the Association on the 26th October and explored the position fully with them.  It became evident that the difficulties due to so many firms having ceased to place orders for coal had been aggravated by the putting, about the time I met the Association, of an unexpected embargo on the export of Continental coal.  This meant that much of what was on order by firms who were continuing business was not being delivered when expected. Some of it has not, in fact, yet been loaded.  Further, exports from America were being subjected to sudden very long delays and freights from America were rising with great rapidity.  No definite forecast could be made as to deliveries for some weeks ahead, and those firms which had forward orders were not anxious to incur new commitments in a situation which in respect of prices, delivery dates and the strike position in England, were so full of uncertainties.  It was on that date that the first suggestion was made by the Association that, if further orders were to be placed, the Government must assist financially.</P>
    <P>I readily agreed to give such assistance, and after discussion it was arranged that the Association should purchase coal to a quantity which I would prescribe as the necessities of the case warranted, that the coal so purchased would be distributed through the members of the Association at a price based on the cost of the coal delivered at Dublin, plus an agreed amount to cover the Association's services and expenses, and that I would take over for Government purposes any of this coal which on arrival at Dublin the members of the Association were not prepared to handle.  At the same time it was agreed that such members of the Association as had their own orders placed would maintain such supplies. As a result, orders for some 25,000 tons of coal to be delivered in November were placed on this basis, to be available in addition to some <Col N="60" /> 100,000 tons on private order for delivery in November and December. Subsequently I procured a special offer of 20,000 tons of high grade Continental coal, of which some 4,000 tons have been ordered up to date.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell the House something about prices; the margin between import and selling prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to prices, and if they are not clear the Deputy can put another question. Deliveries reached a considerable total towards the end of the first week in November and, unless some unforeseen event occurs, I have no doubt that adequate supplies will be forthcoming throughout November and December. Prices are high, though on private orders placed in September and October, of which dilatory delivery is now taking place, they are substantially less than the best prices which could be obtained when the need for placing special orders was disclosed at the end of October.  International competition for coal, both Continental and American, was intense, and the prices reflect this competition.  The prices I have fixed for coal imported under my direction range from 86s. c.i.f.  Dublin in the case of screened coal, down to 60s. c.i.f. for briquettes and brown coal.  The controlled prices for delivery of that coal to the consumer in Dublin range from 108s. to 82s. per ton, or from 6s. 9d. to 5s. 1½d. per bag of 10 stone.  It was simply not possible to obtain on orders placed for delivery in November lower prices, though, as I have said, prices are lower on private orders placed some time ago which are only now being delivered.  American prices are lower than Continental prices, but orders for American coal could not be placed at the time of the emergency with any hope of delivery in November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole, the situation is now as satisfactory in the country as a world shortage of coal allows.  Until the emergency in Dublin towards the end of October prices here were substantially less than in England.  In most places the coal supply has been well maintained under serious difficulties and much credit is due to merchants <Col N="61" /> who have taken considerable risks. Had the Dublin merchants informed me in time of the restriction of their forward orders the position in Dublin could have been considerably relieved and coal would be delivered at Dublin to-day at lower prices.  But it is only fair to say that the sudden Continental embargo on export and the chaos into which American supplies fell during October must have made much confusion in the best laid plans, and involved inevitably a shortage until deliveries improved.  Those Dublin firms who did place large forward orders certainly deserve full credit for their action.  As it was, the emergency in Dublin was kept within reasonable dimensions and the acute period was comparatively short.  Thanks to the energetic action of the City Commissioners, to the valuable services rendered by the Irish Motorists' Union and by the <i>Irish Times</i> Fund, and to the steps taken by such bodies as the Transport Union to meet the needs of their members, adequate provision for the poor was made.  Lorries from the Department of Defence were used to collect and distribute fuel.  A debt is due to Messrs.  Guinness for having placed at my disposal to meet emergencies a substantial portion of their stocks.  No industry had to close down; the worst being a temporary short stoppage in one or two places.  Reasonable supplies of coal are now available, the only difficulty being that of price. But with many countries competing for limited supplies, that difficulty cannot be relieved.  It has been suggested that control should have been instituted or should be instituted even now.  I do not think that would have been or would now be of any benefit.  It might have prevented so acute a situation arising in Dublin.  But at what cost?</P>
    <P>Control would have had to apply to the whole country and its immediate effect would have been to curtail private orders which, except for a brief period of shortage in Dublin, have kept up supplies remarkably well at reasonable prices.  Government orders on a large scale, much larger than is now required, would have been necessary if the same supplies were to be maintained under control, and I need <Col N="62" /> hardly say that Government incursions with large orders into an agitated and highly speculative market, needing agents familiar with the Continental and American coal trades, would have meant a very doubtful venture.  Control in England and in Northern Ireland has not resulted in any better situation than there is in the Free State; indeed we have been considerably better off.  The positive achievements of control it would need considerable ingenuity to establish.  Prices here in Dublin are higher at the moment, but they have been lower for a long time and prices in England and Northern Ireland will rise, at least, to the level of prices in Dublin as soon as the coal ordered in September and early October is exhausted, unless there is a very early resumption of exports from England.</P>
    <P>In some cases prices in Dublin have recently been raised to a point very difficult to justify, but it must be realised that those with forward commitments risk heavy losses for which it is not unreasonable that they should seek cover.  The whole situation was one in which someone had to speculate as to when supplies from England would be resumed, what course Continental and American markets would take, what would happen to prices, and what would be the real effective demand here, allowing for the pressure of necessary economies and the measures taken by large consumers to meet their own requirements.  I considered it most undesirable that it should be the Government on which all the risks of so hazardous a trading enterprise should fall and that it was for every reason preferable to leave the business to those experienced in it until they notified me, as they had undertaken to do, that it was proving too much for them.  Unfortunately that notification was left in Dublin until almost too late and in consequence prices this month will be higher than they need have been.  But that the procedure adopted, in spite of that one lapse, has proved much less costly to the public than any attempt at Government control, involving, as it must have done, Government buying, would have been in the actual circumstances <Col N="63" /> of the case I have no doubt whatever. There has never been a &ldquo;national emergency&rdquo; as contemplated by the Emergency Provisions Act.  As it is, the orders placed at my instance by way of insurance against any general failure of supplies may, though they are not large, involve a substantial liability should the normal sources of supply become available at a date earlier than could, with any confidence, have been anticipated.</P>
    <P>Complaint was made of prices for turf and wood and certainly there were glaring cases of profiteering in both. But after a short period supplies at reasonable prices were made available for the poor, and if others had often to pay heavily for substituted fuel it must be remembered that much of such fuel was drawn from stocks accumulated for other purposes which the owners may find it difficult to replace cheaply and that except at high prices supplies might not have been forthcoming in any sufficient quantity.  They could not have reasonably been commandeered to any large extent without creating a new distress.  The position is being carefully watched.  Subject to the fact that coal is at present a scarce international commodity available only at high prices, which is nobody's fault, I think provision has been made for supplies sufficient for a period of two months with due economy.  Briquettes which have proved suitable for domestic purposes are available at prices substantially lower than coal. Unforeseen contingencies may arise. Cargoes may be cancelled, prices may go higher.  On the other hand, there may be an early termination of the strike, a consequent fall in prices, and, perhaps, early deliveries from the English mines.  Exact anticipations are impossible and neither merchants nor industrialists should allow themselves to suppose that the worst is necessarily over.  I invite anyone anxious as to his situation to communicate promptly with my Department which only requires to know in sufficient time what supplies are essential in order to provide for them. In respect to the poor I can still supply small quantities of coal and <Col N="64" /> slack at relatively low prices from Government stocks, as I have already done to various places in the country. But such procedure has its obvious limits and organisations concerned in assisting the poor should, so far as possible, depend on fuel other than coal.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw attention to the latter part of the Minister's statement, in which he said that there was no national emergency. Anyone residing in Dublin will remember the second week in October, especially the second Sunday, when children of the working classes and the poor had to use ordinary table knives to cut down branches of trees on the banks of the canals around Dublin. What further proof of national emergency does the Minister require?  The trees to which I refer are very well pruned to-day, and the homes of the working classes and the very poor are without fuel of any sort.  It is all very fine to say that the poor were offered, and got, coal through charitable institutions, but offering an unemployed man with five or six children in a tenement house in Henrietta Street, Gardiner Street, or Gloucester Street a bag of coal at five shillings, which was the reduced price, was by no means an indication to him that the Government was looking after his interests.  I cannot sit down without making my protest against the inactivity of the Government and those responsible for the plight in which they left Dublin in the first and second week of October.  The position is slightly relieved at present, and now the main difficulty, so far as the poor and working classes are concerned, is the question of price.  We all can see large quantities of turf along the canal banks, but it is at such a high price that those who used turf in the past cannot afford to buy it. Within a stone's throw of where I live there is a canal bank where a large <Col N="65" /> supply of turf was placed a week ago, and it is still there, because those who were in the habit of using turf for cooking purposes now find it impossible to purchase it at the price demanded.  I think there is some more work for the Government to do.  They have responsibility in this matter.  It is not right or fair to see poor people going indoors early at night, closing their windows and herding themselves together in small rooms to try and keep warm. Something should be done for that class.  I had the experience of visiting some of those houses and I can assure those who are fairly comfortable to-day that the poverty and destitution of the poor were never worse.  In addition to being cold, they are almost hungry. That position exists within a stone's throw of our brightly lighted streets. Some further efforts ought to be made, no matter who has to pay, to provide fuel for the classes about which I have spoken.  There is a coal shortage in every home.  Fairly well-to-do people who ran short of supplies found difficulty in October in meeting their needs. Many comfortable houses were left without coal or fuel of any sort, but the residents were, at least, comfortably dressed, and their plight does not deserve the same sympathy as that of unfortunate people living in the slum areas.  The Government cannot say that they were not cautioned about the possibility of an emergency, or of prices going up, or of people even with decent salaries being unable to get in supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is elaborate in showing what the Government did I hold they did not do enough, and I hold as the emergency is not over that they ought to do a little more.  I am informed that only to-day a small works had to give notice to their employees that the kind of coal available was not suitable, and that unless another coal supply was forthcoming their employees would be working only on half-time during the next few weeks. Our small industries are suffering and I earnestly hope that the Minister and his Department will proceed to deal with the emergency.  I think the occasion for control of prices has arisen and <Col N="66" /> I hope he will give the matter some further consideration.</P>

      <P>I do not think we can consider the coal situation in the light of supplies existing to-day.  I think we have to get back to October and consider what the situation was then.  If we do consider it, having regard to the meagre supplies available, then I think everyone has good reason to be thoroughly dissatisfied with the inaction of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  In May last we were told it was necessary, in the interests of the community, that a certain Bill should be passed into law, and that the Government should be armed with certain powers in certain emergencies.  The Government got those powers and considered that regulations were necessary in pursuance of the powers they received, but the Minister tells us now that he did not put those regulations into operation because they were cumbersome and drastic.  Simply because they had that appearance Dublin was to be without its supply of fuel and profiteers were to be allowed to stalk around the streets demanding any prices they could get for a commodity which poor people were needing.</P>

I think the Dáil is entitled to say that it is not very much concerned whether the regulations are drastic or cumbersome.  It is much more concerned in ensuring that an adequate supply of coal is available for the people.  In May last you got all the power you required to supply coal. <Col N="67" /> You did not do it in May and you have not done it yet.  We are told the coal merchants gave certain assurances that they were meeting the demand, but apparently they were not subject to any supervision.  They could do anything they liked when they came away from the Minister and his advisers.  How was it possible for the merchants to tell the Minister that they were ordering supplies when, in fact, only five out of nineteen were ordering supplies?</P>

      <P>The Minister told us, notwithstanding what he said now, that certain coal merchants apparently believed, on information they got from somewhere, that the coal strike in Britain was likely to conclude and consequently did not desire to place orders at prices which would be high. They were allowed to get off with that attitude until the Minister discovered that they were up against a serious position.  Then he tells us in extenuation of the attitude of those people that the thing proved too much for them.  It did not prove too much for them at all.  These people were not prepared to take the risk of ordering supplies at high prices and the Minister was not prepared to guarantee, in the early stages of this coal shortage, that supplies would have to be made available and that his Department or the Government as a whole would take the responsibility of guaranteeing people against loss in ordering supplies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to suggest that the merchants did not get afraid in a hurry that they were going to lose. There must have been a suspicion all along in their minds.  I am sure the Minister must have discerned the fear on the part of the coal merchants. The fact of the matter is the Minister has made an elaborate statement, by way of apology, for the inaction of his Department and for the definite refusal to use the powers which were given to him in May last.  I shall quote some astonishing prices.  He says that briquettes in Dublin were 60/- per ton. I can give the Minister a postcard sent out by a member of the Dublin Coal Merchants' Association offering briquettes at £5 per ton and yet the Minister tells us that briquettes are 60/- per ton at the port.  They are £5 per ton to persons who desire to buy them.  I do not think the Minister has given any adequate explanation of his failure to curb the profiteering.  In Dublin I made inquiries as to the prices of turf and found that miserable sods of turf were sold at 1/6, 1/9 and 2/- per dozen.  That was allowed to go on. If the price has since fallen it is not because of any action on the part of the Minister and his Department.  It is because of the fact that more supplies are coming in.  The Minister could have secured a better organisation in the early stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Better than the coal merchants! The coal merchants were supplying turf.  Could the Government Department ensure better supplies of fuel than the people in the business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that the Minister has got all the machinery to ensure a better supply of fuel than was available, and the Minister has not used those powers.  Turf was sold at 1/6, 1/9 and 2/- per dozen.  I asked people what the price was, and it was 2/- per dozen.  The Minister has nothing to say about his failure to deal with profiteering.  He allowed that kind of thing to go on until the supplies <Col N="69" /> were sufficient to force down the prices.  Coal has been sold at 1/- and 1/2 per stone in Dublin and still no action was taken by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister has described the situation, in certain cases, as one of gross profiteering.  It was a case of widespread profiteering and the Minister did absolutely nothing to curb it.  Now, we are told, when the supplies are somewhat better, that we have reason to feel fairly satisfied with the position. I do not think that we gave any reason to feel satisfied with the position as it was in October and as it is to-day. Prices are still high and I should like the Minister to explain how men working on the Shannon scheme, at 32/- per week, can provide fuel of any class and maintain a wife and family out of that wage.  We have widespread unemployment, with depression in wages, and, yet, according to the Minister, we shall have to &ldquo;put up with it.&rdquo;  In other words, those who have money can buy coal, while those who have not money are to continue to suffer, not because of lack of supply of fuel, but for want of the means to buy it.  I suggest that something should be done to reduce the price of fuel, in addition to the measures forecasted.  If something is not done, then tens of thousands of people throughout the country will be unable to pay the high price demanded.  There are tens of Thousands of unemployed.  Something should be done in their case.  It ought to be possible to reduce the price of coal, even if a levy be put on coal import afterwards in order to make good the loss of public money.  If the Minister feels satisfied with the statement that he has done everything possible to meet the situation, then I can assure him that he is the only one who is satisfied.  Nobody in touch with the situation in Dublin is satisfied.  He did nothing and his Department did nothing. He had all the powers he desired to ensure that a fairly adequate supply of coal would be available.  He had all the powers necessary to ensure that there would be no profiteering, and he refused to exercise his powers in any direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to think in terms other than <Col N="70" /> Dublin.  I recognise that the situation in Dublin is appalling.  At the same time, one is forced to infer from what appeared in the papers during the last few months that the activities of the Minister's Department are directed towards getting supplies into Dublin. The Minister has said very little about any other place in the Saorstát.  I am loth to draw any comparison as between one part of the State and another, but I represent here a certain constituency and I think I am entitled to claim that other parts of the Saorstát than Dublin are entitled to consideration by the Minister and his Department.  He has stated that certain things have been done for Dublin.  The broad fact emerges from his statement that his Department seem content that a certain quantity of coal is brought in, regardless of the destination of that coal or whether the people who ought to get it get any portion of the supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people referred to by Deputy A. Byrne and Deputy Norton will gain no advantage from those supplies.  They are in such a position that they are not able to buy any coal.  It is peculiar that the Minister, armed with the powers he got here as far back as May, did not see fit to take advantage of them.  He says he was in touch with the merchants as far back as June, but it is apparent that he lost touch with the merchants between that date and the end of October and that nothing was done during that time by his Department to ease the situation.  Take the case of turf, referred to by Deputy Norton.  Is there any reason why a higher price should be charged for turf this year than last year?  For any excess charges in that respect, the Minister and his Department must take responsibility. There is no justification for profiteering so far as turf and timber are concerned.  It may take somewhat more to get fuel in here on account of the situation that exists, but I think the Minister is to blame for failing to prevent profiteering.  I should like to ask the Minister what his Department is doing for other areas.  I have written several times to the Department and got very little satisfaction.  There was not an ounce of coal in Wexford town on Saturday last.  The merchants there were in <Col N="71" /> touch with the Department, but they got very little satisfaction.  I think the Minister should direct his attention to other parts of the country which have been fireless for some time.  When coal was comparatively cheap a great many people were practically unable to buy it.  Now, that it has reached fabulous prices, the lot of these people is much worse.  I ask the Minister to take other parts of the country, than Dublin, into consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that this question has come up.  It may give the Government an opportunity of introducing some scheme that would be instrumental in giving employment to a large number of people in the Saorstát.  I refer to the development of the turbary lands of the country. You have thousands of acres of turbary capable of supplying thousands of tons of fuel.  Still the Government ignores the appeals from the people to have this bogland drained.  Profiteering in coal is not confined to Dublin.  It is general throughout the country.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has done nothing whatever to prevent that profiteering.  In fact, he has encouraged it.  The daily papers have encouraged it.  They have published the price of turf in Dublin, with the result that in the smaller towns the price went up four and five hundred per cent.  In Athlone, where a load of turf could be purchased six weeks ago for five shillings, it is now 24/-.  The same applies in Mullingar and Longford. If it is necessary to charge a higher price in Dublin for turf owing to the cost of carriage, why is it necessary to raise the price in the country districts?  Why does not the Minister prevent this profiteering?  A workingman cannot afford to pay 24/- for two and a half boxes of turf which fit in a crate.  The unemployed man cannot possibly afford to buy any fuel.  The scanty allowance he is entitled to from the Labour Exchange would not enable him to purchase one load of turf in twelve months at that price.  Still the Minister will not interfere and put an end to this profiteering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is up to the Government to use <Col N="72" /> their powers even now at the eleventh hour, so that profiteering may be put an end to.  We have been told a great deal about what the Government intends to do, but that can be described as election propaganda.  On every occasion on which Ministers have spoken in the last two or three months they have made glowing promises.  Are they serious in the promises they have made? I am glad to see the Minister for Education shaking his head, because the country knows that they are not serious.  If they are serious, now is the opportune time to fulfil these promises. Let the Minister use his powers and put an end to this profiteering and see that turf that cost nothing extra to cut this year is sold at the same price as last year.  People come from the city to the country districts with lorries and purchase turf from the bogs and then charge four or five hundred per cent. more than they paid for it.  That gives an opportunity to those people who have turf to sell to increase their price.  Surely the least the Government can do is to see that prices are not increased.  The Minister should handle this question properly in the interests of the masses of the people, and not in the interests of the coal-owners or others who have purchased large quantities of fuel for sale.  It is time that something should be done to put an end to this wholesale profiteering at the expense of the working people, who are being fleeced and robbed wholesale by the Minister and his associates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the representatives of the business party were not present during the Minister's speech, because, as far as I can understand it, it was an attempt to throw responsibility for the evils which fell upon the city of Dublin and district from his own shoulders on to those of the Dublin coal merchants.  He went so far as practically to charge them with having entered into a compact with him to ensure supplies of coal for the community, and then deliberately refusing to fulfil that compact.  That is a very serious statement and one which, I think, almost would require the coal merchants of Dublin to be placed in the dock, if it can be proved.  The <Col N="73" /> position seems to me to be that on and after the passing of the Protection of the Community (Special Powers) Act and the consultation between the Minister and the merchants, and the notification to these merchants that he was preparing certain regulations for ensuring the supply of fuel, they were then at least, if never before, placed in the position of trustees for the supply of fuel to the community.  They recognised what should be their normal position, and by implication, I think, they entered into a special contract and understanding with the Minister that they would ensure that fuel supplies would be available.  The Minister charges them by inference with having broken that compact, and apparently they are to be allowed to get off with a mere recital of the indictment in this House, and no further consequences are to ensue.  I have no doubt that the coal merchants will have a reply to make to that charge, but whether they have or not, however completely they may reply, or however utterly they may fail to reply, it does not relieve the Minister of his responsibility.  He came to the Dáil for special powers and received special powers to make such regulations as would ensure the due supply and distribution of the essentials of life to the community, including fuel.  He had prepared all the regulations necessary and he had practically appointed the coal merchants as his agents in this matter.  I say it was his duty to get himself informed, not merely to rely upon the voluntary statement of the merchants as to the maintenance of supplies, but to satisfy himself that the supplies were being maintained.  It is not enough for the principal to say that his agents failed him and that, therefore, he should be relieved of all responsibility.  The principal is surely bound to bear responsibility for the failure of his agents.  So that the Minister, when he took powers to ensure a supply of fuel for the community and failed to apply those powers, leaves himself open to the charge, which he practically admits here to-day, that he failed in his responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The coal merchants had, at one point, reversed their line.  Up to a point they <Col N="74" /> had kept the Minister informed and he was satisfied that between stocks in hand and orders and expectations of delivery the supply of fuel for the community would, at least, be sufficient to enable the people to carry on.  Then they reversed their course and the Minister found, to his surprise, at one point that they had ceased to order coal: in fact, I think he said, had cancelled orders; at least he had not been informed. If he was satisfied with the methods whereby he was to insure the supply, and these methods failed, I do not think he can relieve himself of responsibility.</P>
    <P>But the question of responsibility for the past is one thing.  The other question, which at this moment is important, is the maintenance of supply and the regulation of prices.  He may take powers under this Act to regulate and control the prices charged by traders, wholesale or retail.  We have been told of the probability that the supplies will not be over-abundant probably for a month or two.  We must not take it as certain that the crisis or difficulties have passed away.  We are told that contracts have been entered into for the delivery of coal, at different times, and at greatly varying prices.  I think it is a fairly common and general experience, as a matter of fact, that when supplies of any commodity are short in relation to demand, the price of the poorer qualities and the more cheaply bought articles will approximate to the price of the highest quality and the most dearly bought articles.  That is to say, that prices which can be obtained in the market for short supplies will govern the prices of the whole supplies no matter what price those supplies may have been bought at.  So that we are likely to experience this: That the poor coal cheaply bought at comparatively low rates will be sold at the price of the best quality to cover the price which was paid at the highest point of the market.  I think that is not satisfactory. Whosoever may be guilty, whether the coal merchants or Ministers, the position of the merchants ought not to be left in such a way that they can charge the highest possible price, or any price, to the community for the coal that they have to sell.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> I think that the requirements of the case are that there should be, even at this stage, an order regulating maximum prices.  It might be found necessary to go beyond that.  I do not know enough about the facts and circumstances to make this statement as a definite positive statement, but it seems to me from the knowledge I have in this matter that the case requires that the Government should take control of supplies coming in, pool them with regard to prices and charge only such prices for the coal they have in their possession as would cover the pooled cost, even if they will not agree to the better proposal of Deputy Norton to charge a lower price and to let the loss be borne out of future purchases.  But whatever scheme or method the Government themselves may devise I urge upon them that it is desirable that there should be a regulation of prices; that the failure to fulfil their obligations by the coal merchants or by the Minister, as may be decided between them, should not be a cause of making the poor and those who are less poor, but who, to some extent, have been greater sufferers, pay abnormal prices for their coal for the next two or three months.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with those who say that the Government has done nothing or that they made no attempt to meet this difficulty.  I think when they woke up they made kinds of attempts and I admit freely that they were able to tide over many difficulties and to avoid the possibility, even the probability, of much greater trouble coming upon the community through the disemployment that would have been caused had several of the works that threatened to close down been allowed to do so.  But I believe they are at fault and that they have failed lamentably in not carrying out the obligations which they took upon themselves when they asked the Dáil to pass this Special Powers Act, and that it is still necessary they should make regulations within the powers they have to control prices and to insure that the people shall get fuel for the next few weeks at prices that they can reasonably afford to pay.  I think the Minister's case has been one <Col N="76" /> intended rather as an indictment of the coal merchants.  It was very weak indeed as a defence of his own failure and I shall await with interest, if not pleasure, the answer that will be made by the coal merchants to his attack.</P>

      <P>I will give the report over to the Deputy and he can quote anything he pleases.  He also said, and it was to that I was referring when I talked of a national emergency in the sense referred to in the Dáil when the special legislation was under consideration: &ldquo;It seems to me that if you are going to legislate for the purpose of meeting difficulties in two or three places in the country you cannot do so on the plea that a national emergency has arisen.&rdquo;  I have not had any indication from Deputy Johnson as to whether the localities were so numerous now or a month ago as to show that a national emergency could be said to have arisen.  Neither do I admit his interpretation or distortion&mdash;I do not say wilful distortion&mdash;of what I said to-night in regard to the Coal Merchants' Association as representing in any degree what I did say. <Col N="77" /> I stated frankly what I thought was the cause of the trouble, and I gave certain things that justified the Coal Merchants' Association in being a little bit averse to placing orders ahead. Similarly in regard to Deputy Norton. He made a certain amount of cumbersome play with the phrase I used about cumbersome and drastic regulations.</P>

      <P>I read what I have here on record.  It was previously given in the Dáil as an answer to a question when I was asked if I was going to restrict train services.  I then said that the action referred to in the question could only be effected under special powers of legislation.  I said &ldquo;according to my information such action is not necessary at the moment. though the situation may change so rapidly as to render it soon advisable. Since only one of many available sources of coal supply is at present closed, I would expect coal merchants to maintain supplies without any serious difficulty and without the need of cumbersome and drastic regulations.&rdquo; Is that a description of the regulations I had made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Decidedly no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I see, but it leaves out of consideration the main reason, that mentioned first, namely, that only one of many sources of supply had been closed, and that I expected the coal merchants to maintain supplies without the necessity of these things.  That was the gist of that argument.  The arguments used all along with regard to the coal supply in the country was that the people ought to have faced&mdash;remember not the coal merchants only&mdash;but that the people generally ought to have <Col N="78" /> faced the position that one source or supply had been closed, but that there were others available&mdash;that how far those others were available depended on how far industrialists, the ordinary domestic consumers and manufacturers had placed their orders with the coal merchants, so as to enable the coal merchants to have a certain amount of money coming into them to place their orders abroad at the extremely high price at which coal was then being bought.  With regard to the coal merchants, it is quite easy to see why they should have been reluctant to place orders abroad.  Take the ordinary financial resources of the coal merchants of Dublin and the normal orders for coal coming into them month after month.  If you take it that they were paying for coal from 25s. to 35s. a ton, and that this price was raised to 80s., you get some idea of the extra financial responsibility thrown on these men. If you consider further that I should take control of the whole coal supply of Dublin, a control which, I am sure, the coal merchants; in its financial aspect, would be glad to throw on to the Government, and that there are orders for 100,000 tons of coal privately placed up to December at an average price of 80/-, that the coal strike came to an end more speedily than people expected, that supplies of English coal came in and there was a drop of even £1 on that price&mdash;a very ordinary thing to look forward to&mdash;you have there a loss of £100,000 on the orders placed, as between now and December. I think that the Coal Merchants' Association did continue to place orders ahead and that they are to be congratulated for the risks they took considering what their finances were.  There has been a lot of argument here as to my failure to take powers.  I have powers that I could have availed of to the fullest.  I have heard no Deputy in the House put forward any argument to convince me to-night that it was necessary to enforce these powers at this time.  It was necessary to have them there.  I do say this that I found no reluctance on the part of the Coal Merchants' Association to deal with the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I investigated one case where turf was being sold at 1½d. a sod.  As far as the individual who was selling that turf is concerned I discovered that he was making no extraordinary profit on it.  Neither was the man from whom he bought it, nor the man from whom that man bought it, but about five places down the line there had been some person or other making a big profit on it.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that I know a place, not twenty miles from Dublin, where turf was being sold at 4d. per dozen sods.  I can assure the Minister that the same turf was being sold here in Dublin at 2/- per dozen sods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible that if I got a huge staff in <Col N="80" /> with tremendous machinery and that if I incurred tremendous cost I could have commandeered turf and got it retailed here in the city at much less than 1/6 per dozen sods.  That certainly could have been done.  On the question of control, no one has used any argument to me indicating that control was necessary for the purpose of ensuring supplies of coal, or to put it this way: that if there had been control better supplies of fuel would have been got into the country. Control is useful and necessary if people are not co-operating together to get supplies into the country, but there was no lack of co-operation.  Control might be useful and necessary if the body set up under control could give you a more efficient organisation for the bringing in of supplies than any existing medium.  No one can use the argument that a Government Department was going to get into the coal trade at a moment's notice and bring in coal cheaper and in greater amount than the coal merchants were doing.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the supply of turf in the country this year has been more plentiful than for very many years past?

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister interrupted Deputy Norton when he was speaking and put several questions to him.  I have put a question to the Minister now and he has refused to answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I interrupted Deputy Norton at a relevant moment, and asked him a question which he could answer in the stride of his argument. <Col N="81" /> I am asked now a question about profiteering and I will deal with that at the proper time.  There has been no argument brought forward in the House to show that control would have ensured better supplies of fuel. If there is any argument proved it must be based on either of two things: that it would have given better organisation or that it would have given me an organisation that was willing to do what other people efficiently equipped for it were not willing to do, and I say that both those propositions are false.  Deputy Byrne said we had got cautions as to an emergency, as to the obvious difficulties from prices rising, and he referred to the point that people with big salaries were laying in supplies of fuel.  It required no great caution as to the possibility of an emergency arising.  That is why I got Regulations drafted.  I had meetings with the Coal Merchants' Association as early as 3rd May, on the matter of prices, about which I felt there was not merely a possibility of a rise but that a rise was inevitable.  It was seen clearly that the price of fuel from America and of freight from America, and also from Germany, was going to rise, but with all the powers with which the Dáil could endow me I could not keep the prices down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>They could be kept at a certain level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister was not an unreasonable profit made on briquettes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say so on the price the Deputy quoted, but before determination is made as to whether there is profiteering or not one must compare the purchase with the sale price.  I do not know what the purchase price was in the Deputy's case. All I say with regard to some coal is that it was bought at 30s. per ton, and as regards other coal 80s. per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would you say all the briquettes that came in were ordered on your instructions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not, and if I gave that impression I withdraw it. The briquettes were ordered before I <Col N="82" /> had anything to do with the Coal Merchants' Association, or came to close quarters with them.  As to Deputy Byrne's point about people laying in stocks of coal because they had big salaries, one of the difficulties was that people with big salaries did not order in coal early enough.  No one was willing to have in his cellar more than a week's supply at the same time, and if people had done more of what Deputy Byrne spoke about there would have been a less acute situation about October. The Deputy spoke of a certain industry that is closing down.  I do not know what excuse there is for that except they have not funds enough to buy coal at the prices now ruling.  It is not a matter of not being able to get coal if they pay the price, and if notice of orders is given in time.  Deputy Norton spoke of my power in preventing profiteering.  I say as against that that there has been no great evidence of profiteering.  There have been cases which have been made quite a lot of here.  You can raise individual cases, but if you take the relative amount of fuel for sale in the country, say since the beginning of October, there has been very little profiteering, and where there has been it would have required tremendous machinery and personnel to catch it and stop it.  You have to guard right down along the line until you get to the individual who sells in the first instance.  I was faced with a difficulty here recently when it was put to me that I should declare a certain price for the coal which was being bought at Government orders.  If that price had been fixed the net result would have been that the Coal Merchants' Association would have netted about 25s. per ton average over all their privately placed orders, because we had bought dearly where they had bought cheaply, having bought earlier. The question is, where is the exercise of powers going to lead?  Is it going to achieve the object sought?  We do not think it would.  To return to Deputy Johnson&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister leaves that point, he has been dealing with profiteering in coal and turf in the city.  and he has talked about the difficulty of getting at the <Col N="83" /> person who first sold the turf.  Is the Minister aware that in the country people who had turf brought it into the towns, and the people who bought it were charged 35/- per load for turf which they previously got at 15/- or 20/-, and would he consider that profiteering in view of the fact, as I have already stated, that turf is more plentiful in the country this year, as most Deputies are aware, than it has been for many years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty is to answer a general proposition on an individual case.  It is a fact that there is about twice as much turf saved this year as last year, but I cannot deal with the position of an unnamed individual in a town not mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that if the Minister's Department was doing its duty in this matter he would have information not only from Dublin, but from every town showing what was happening with regard to fuel, but as far as we see the Minister had no information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>

They could have furnished particulars as to prices charged, and if they had done so the Minister would not have made the statement he did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking in the whole situation and the amount of fuel on sale from September to October I suggest that there was relatively little profiteering.

      <P>We are getting to personal experiences.  If I also said I had not a sufficient supply of fuel I might not be believed.  Deputy Johnson spoke with regard to my allegations against the coal merchants.  I made what I considered to be a frank statement about the position, and I doubt if any member of the Coal Merchants' Association who will consider what I have said will object to it.  I said I had investigations and negotiations. There were investigations as to what the merchants were doing.  At a certain point, about the middle of October, it was suddenly discovered there was a shortage of supplies in Dublin.  I say there was a failure on the part of the Coal Merchants' Association to indicate to me the difficulties they were meeting at the time, and a failure to take action to overcome <Col N="85" /> these difficulties.  I want to put these difficulties clearly.  I have spoken already of the strain upon their financial resources.  That could have been met, as it was later met, by a Government guarantee, if the guarantee had been asked for.  But I do not consider it any part of my duty to go to the coal merchants with a guarantee before they claimed that such was due them. There was that point about the finances.  There was, further, the point that certain individuals, domestic consumers and manufacturers, apparently closed down on orders that had been placed by them.  I mention as an individual case one cargo of coal brought in, suitable for gas purposes, refused by certain gas undertakings, and sold at a loss to the particular merchant concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that on account of quality or price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It was because the gas undertakings had some idea that the coal strike was coming to an end and that industrial coal would be released to their undertakings.  They thought they could get coal cheaper if they could only hang on for a certain period.  At that time I say further that there were two difficulties in addition to that domestic type of difficulty. There was the fact that certain foreign Governments placed embargoes on the exportation of coal from their countries. Coal was held up at Danzig; there was Polish coal held up in Germany, and an embargo at the ports was put on coal coming from Germany. In addition, American coal was prevented from coming.  Further, there was the question of the tremendous increase in freight charges between America and here, and the fact that even at that time, with the high freights, boats were not available.  Boats had been diverted from grain-carrying, their ordinary business, and they reverted back to grain-carrying, leaving the coal business. There was the impact of these three things which caused the coal merchants to withdraw from the line they had previously been advancing on.  It has been complained that I should not have accepted statements from the coal <Col N="86" /> merchants.  I have not said that I accepted statements from them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson said that I should have satisfied myself that supplies were being maintained.  How is one to be satisfied on that?  In the last resort only by seeing that supplies were coming in.  That puts off the matter for the fortnight or three weeks at the end of which American boats would arrive.  I hold that all that could have been done to see whether coal orders were being placed up to requirements was done It was not within my power to know that certain orders were going to be withdrawn, that certain orders placed by coal merchants in Dublin were going to be cancelled by foreign Governments, or that certain orders ready for confirmation were not confirmed when the date for confirmation came along.  That all happened in a very short period and the emergency arose.  But there had been definite investigation and definite in quiry as to what was going on.  I have no charge to make against the Coal Merchants' Association save what I did say, that in a particular week they failed to give information to me of a certain line of action taken by them out of the ordinary course that they had been pursuing.  I complain of a want of frankness during that period. Deputy Johnson asked: &ldquo;What of the future?&rdquo; The question is to ensure supplies and to regulate prices.&rdquo;  Let some argument be adduced to me to show that supplies will be better maintained through a Government department, using the powers under the Special Powers Act and coercing the Coal Merchants' Association to do at Government expense what they are doing pretty voluntarily to-day at their own expense, with the exception of this small amount of coal with which I am involved and for which I will have to seek the sanction of the Dáil if any liability falls upon the State by reason of that order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the regulation of prices, again let there be some argument to show that the establishment of a maximum price&mdash;which would immediately become the ordinary price&mdash;or that any attempt to deal with these prices would <Col N="87" /> create on the whole a better situation with regard to fuel than exists at the moment.  It could stop a glaring case of profiteering, but what would you do if, as I suggest, the maximum price tended to become the ordinary price, or even the minimum price?  While you may stop a glaring case of profiteering, you would raise prices at which fuel of all kinds would be sold.  But if there are arguments that one could regard as reasonable, and if it could be proved that control would effect either of these two things&mdash;the provision of better supplies, or the better regulation of prices&mdash;then there would be no hesitation in assuming all the powers that have been granted.  No argument has been advanced to show that either of these things would follow from the application of these powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put a point to the Minister on a matter that he has not dealt with, the supplies which normally, in the pre-emergency days in Dublin and district, had been distributed through the small factors and bellmen.  It is not possible to-day, I am informed, for these men, who supply a very considerable proportion of the community in normal times, to obtain supplies from the merchants.  I understand that certain arrangements were made with respect to that portion of the import which has been at the order of the Department, but that is a comparatively small proportion of the total. But in respect of the main supplies of coal the position is that that portion of the community which has been in the habit of buying from the small factors and bellmen are not now able to get any coal at all.  I should not, perhaps, go so far as to say that they cannot get any at all, but it is difficult, and that particular body of factors and merchants are losing their trade, which is being taken over by the merchants. There is a clear divergence from the normal course owing to the fact that these men are not able to get supplies from the importers.  I wonder whether the Minister has any policy in that respect, or whether he is able to exert any influence on the merchants to ensure <Col N="88" /> that at least a <i>pro rata</i> proportion of the trade that has usually been done by these men will continue to be done through that channel.</P>

      <P>I feel quite sure with regard to, say, one-fifth of the orders due for unloading between now and the end of December, the amount which was purchased on Government guarantee, that some arrangement can be made, and I feel pretty sure also that some of the coal merchants will make some such arrangement with regard to coal brought in at their own expense.  But I would like Deputy Johnson to know that to a certain extent I was actively instrumental in getting supplies denied to these men.  The most vehement allegations in regard to profiteering were made against these very men, and certain action was taken by way of limiting supplies to them, or at least insisting that supplies would only be given when the proper promises were given by them.  That was done on my own instigation.  However. that matter can be taken up.  I feel pretty certain that the coal merchants will divert portions of the coal to selected bellmen or small dealers, conditional upon these people not being the very same gentlemen as those who had been pointed out to me as being most concerned in increasing prices.</P>

      <P>I would like to inform the Dáil that, through an oversight, a paper which ought to have been placed on the Table was not so placed because sufficient notice was not given.  However, copies will be in the Dáil Office and the paper will appear on the Order Paper to-morrow.  The British Government will issue it at the same time.  It gives the heads of the ultimate financial settlement between the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free State.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the application of Mr. Owen Donegan (ex-R.I.C.), c/o Miss Kennedy, 479 East 137th Street, New York, for a pension, has been considered; if he is aware that Mr. Donegan, a native of Sligo, resigned from the R.I.C. at Goresbridge, Co. Kilkenny, on 2nd June, 1918, through national sympathies, and was discharged on 30th June, 1918, after six years' service, and subsequently emigrated in 1923; that he had a good national record, and whether a decision in the case will be expedited.</P>
