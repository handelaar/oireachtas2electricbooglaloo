      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move for leave to introduce and to have printed and circulated a Bill entitled the Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy (Cork) Bill, 1926. In Cork for many years past there has been a local Bankruptcy Court which is within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Judge of that area.  The Clerk of the Crown and Peace for Cork City and the East Riding of the county, was Registrar to that court.  For some time past he has been in failing health, but pending the re-organisation of the court staff, which is now being achieved under the Court Officers Bill, it was not convenient to relieve him of his duties and appoint a successor.  He was permitted to act through the Deputy Registrar. It was recently decided by the courts that there were certain things which could be lawfully done only by the Registrar himself and which could not be delegated to the Deputy Registrar. It becomes necessary, therefore, <Col N="1726" /> to validate certain acts performed by the Deputy Registrar.  We consider it is in the public interest that should be done and this Bill is brought forward to that end.</P>
      <P>Leave granted.  Bill read a First Time.  Second Stage ordered for Tuesday, 25th May, 1926.</P>

    <P>The Dáil went into Committee.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    <P>The Principal Act shall as from the 24th day of June, 1926, be construed and have effect as if sub-section (1) of Section 8 thereof were amended as follows, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  by the insertion in sub-paragraph (c) (iii) thereof after the words and figures &ldquo;during the period of the two years 1923 and 1924&rdquo; of the words and figures &ldquo;or the period of the two years 1925 and 1926&rdquo;;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 5 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Principal Act shall be construed and have effect as if&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  Section 3 thereof were amended as follows, that is to say, by the deletion of sub-paragraph (ii) of sub-section (1) thereof, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  Section 17 thereof were amended as follows, that is to say, by the insertion therein of the following sub-section&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1727" /> (5)  The application of this seeto any house or part of a house shall not be excluded by reason only that part of the premises only is used as a shop or office, or for business, trade, or professional purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to vary the terms of the principal Act. The principal Act is being construed by the courts as follows: Where a letting consists of premises, partly business and partly residential, even where the greater part of the premises is business premises and even in the extreme case where the whole of the letting is business premises and the tenant merely sleeps on the premises, the whole premises have been construed as a dwelling house and not as a business premises.  The effect of this is that only 10 per cent. and not 25 per cent. can be added to the standard rent under the 1923 Act, and the other benefits to the landlord, by having the premises regarded as business premises under the present Bill, are lost.  This amendment is intended to rectify that anomaly, and provide that where any part of a letting is business premises, the whole letting shall be construed as a letting of business premises.  I would like to add that under the original Act. as Deputies are aware, where a premises is construed as a business premises, 25 per cent. is allowed to be added to the standard rent.  In a case where it is a private letting only 10 per cent. is allowed to be added.  If the custom of the courts has been to construe a business premises as a private premises, there is a loss to the landlord of 15 per cent.  The present Bill that is before us reduces that difference. Instead of the 10 per cent. formerly allowed under private letting, this Bill increases that to 20 per cent.; accordingly the difference between the two will be only 5 per cent.  The landlord will suffer only to the extent of 5 per cent.; but still it is a rather serious injury. The landlord suffered in the past, and he will continue to suffer if this amendment to the original Act is not carried by the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished to hear the arguments used by Deputy <Col N="1728" /> Good.  Speaking on behalf of that section of the business community that occupies shops, I would have imagined the Deputy would be rather inclined to remove the present restrictions or, to put it the other way, to give the tenant of business premises the same privileges as the tenant of the dwelling house.  Apparently, the Deputy is anxious to throw a heavier burden upon the business community than they at present bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the intention of the Act carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the Act was&mdash;and I think the Deputy will confirm me if he looks at the discussions that took place&mdash;to allow a much heavier increase to be imposed upon tenants of business premises, and that was determined by the fact that the business people, in those days, were making rather excessive profits and were, thereby, enabled to pay this increase in rent.  If the Deputy's contentions, in other places, are well-founded these business profits which were then, when the original Act was passed, prevalent, are not prevalent today, and the business people in the city and throughout the country are not in a position to pay an increase up to 25 per cent.  I should have hoped to hear from Deputy Good a plea, on behalf of that business community, which he so ably represents, for a reduction of the rent charged on their premises.  When he says that the rents they now pay are not up to the standard, he is not representing the business community but really he is representing the house-owning and property-owning community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this amendment of the Deputy is inadvisable.  The Deputy assumes the proposed increase of 20 per cent. will be carried.  I think that is an assumption that is not warranted, notwithstanding the fact that the Minister is backing it.  I have a certain amount of hope that the Committee will see it is inadvisable to make any allowance for an increase at all even on dwelling-houses.  I could have supported the Deputy if he had urged, by amendment, that no greater increase to the landlord should be <Col N="1729" /> allowed in respect to a business premises than has been allowed in respect to dwelling-houses.  I shall oppose the amendment if it goes to a division and I certainly hope the Minister will not accede to the Deputy's proposition.  I am speaking on behalf of the business community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to bring mixed premises outside the application of the Act. Section 3, sub-section (1), paragraph 2, which the Deputy seeks to delete says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The application of this Act to any house or part of a house shall not be excluded by reason only that part of the premises is used as a shop or office or for business, trade or professional purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 of the Act of 1923 has reference to lock-up shops.  Generally speaking, these shops are held on a tenure shorter than a yearly tenancy. The idea of the amendment is that while mixed premises are taken outside the Act as dwelling-houses they might come within the Act in so far as business premises held on a short tenure come under the Act.  My information is that the small business premises, of the huckster shop kind, where the proprietor lives on the premises, require a certain amount of protection and control. Rather high rents are charged for small shops of that kind.  The reduction of the valuation figures already accepted will put outside the scope of the Act any substantial shops, and in that way, remove such grievances as householders might consider they labour under.  The Deputy will admit, I think, that the existence of a shop or business puts up the valuation.  I put it to the Deputy that at any rate, in the last year of our controlled period, as provided in the Bill, substantial shops which have residences attached will have got outside the scope of the Act &mdash;that is, in the third yearly period.  I <Col N="1730" /> am not disposed, therefore, to accept the amendment, and I shall ask the Dáil to take that view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister cannot see his way to rectify what seems to me to be a very real grievance.  A great many cases that come to one's knowledge in connection with this Act show that it has apparently been wrongly construed.  I had an instance the other day brought to my notice where a public house was construed as a private dwelling under this Act.  The result was that the landlord only got 10 per cent. in excess of the standard rent instead of 25 per cent., that he would have been entitled to, had this public house been, as was intended by the Act, defined as a business premises. As I said, at the outset, my only object is to revert to what was the original intention when the Act was introduced. I am sorry the Minister cannot see his way to adopt that policy.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and negatived.</P>
      <P>Amendment 14.  &mdash;To insert a new section before Section 5 as follows:</P>
      <P>The Principal Act shall be construed and have effect as if sub-section (3) of Section 4 thereof were amended by deleting from said sub-section so much thereof as begins with the words &ldquo;for such period or periods as it thinks fit,&rdquo; and ends with the words &ldquo;as the court thinks fit,&rdquo; and substituting therefor the words&mdash;&ldquo;Provided always that any such adjournment, stay, suspension, or postponement, shall not be for a period or time exceeding six months from the time of such application, order, or judgment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this amendment, sub-section (3) of Section 4 allows the Court to adjourn an application for possession or stay, or suspend the execution for possession, or postpone the date of possession, for any period it likes and under any condition it likes.  This amendment proposes to limit the period for adjournment, stay, or suspension or postponement to six months.  I think the reason of that will be obvious to all Deputies.  They will see that under sub-section (3) Section 4 of the principal <Col N="1731" /> Act, the Court has power to suspend any one of the objects I have mentioned for an indefinite period.  If the Court has power to make orders there certainly ought to be a time limit, and this amendment seeks to remedy that defect in the principal Act by such an amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the form of the amendment, it has been suggested that the following form would be better:&mdash;&ldquo;The principal Act shall be construed and have effect as if sub-section (3) of section 4 were amended by the addition at the end of the sub-section of the words: Provided always that any such adjournment, stay, suspension or postponement shall not be for a period or time exceeding six months from the time of such application, order or judgment.&rdquo;</P>

The only justification for that would be the assumption that judges would be unduly harsh on house-owners or owners of property.  I do not think there is ground for any assumption of that kind.  For that reason, I prefer the text of the principal Act as it stands, and I object to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 5 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The principal Act shall be construed <Col N="1732" /> and have effect as if sub-section (1) of Section 4 thereof were amended as follows, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  by the deletion of so much of paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) thereof as begins with the words &lsquo;and in the opinion of the Court,&rsquo; and ends with the words &lsquo;granting it.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>(ii)  by the deletion in sub-section (1) after paragraph (e) thereof of the words &lsquo;and in any such case as aforesaid the Court considers it reasonable to make such an order or give such judgment&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is intended to remove the discretion of the court in granting a decree for possession.  If adopted, the court will no longer consider whether greater hardship would be caused by refusing the order for possession than by granting it.  It will be sufficient to prove that the premises are reasonably required by the landlord for occupation by himself or for any person bona-fide residing or to reside with him, or for some person in his whole-time employment or in the whole-time employment of some tenant of his.  This amendment is very like the last one.  There is a discretionary power given to the judge under the Act.  I am strengthened in my contention by the fact that the view has been expressed by a judge that it is scarcely reasonable to leave such a discretionary power in their hands.  I know a number of them are of the view that the amendment of this particular section would be a distinct advantage to them.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister for Justice will treat this amendment as he did the last one.  It is the only portion of the Act in which the tenants get the smallest justice.  If this discretion is taken from the judges, you will have landlords in every town in the Saorstát finding an employee, or finding a tenant who has some employee, for the purpose of getting possession from the court.  The result will be that you will have more people evicted during the next twelve months than for the past 750 years.  This is a question of going back to the time of Oliver Cromwell.  I really think the mover of <Col N="1733" /> this amendment must have close knowledge of ancient times when he asked the Dáil to adopt such a proposal.  It brings us back to the hardships, the sufferings and trials of even Pagan times.  If the Dáil were to accept this amendment, it would be taking away the independence of the judge and making him a slave of the State.  It would be placing the judge or justice in the same position as in regard to the 1923 Licensing Act, under which he has no discretion but to endorse the licence.</P>
      <P>If this amendment were accepted, I think you would not find an honest man in the Saorstát to act as judge, because you would be depriving him of his freedom.  Surely Deputy Good should be the last to treat a judge in such a way and to deprive him of such power.  The judge is supposed to be neutral and to decide according to the evidence, without giving any advantage to either side.  In this class of case he is given a discretion according to the amount of hardship that would be inflicted by granting or refusing possession.  Surely the Dáil will not deprive the judge of that discretion.  I hope the Minister for Justice will leave the tenants the slight advantage they have under this portion of the Act.</P>

      <P>I oppose this amendment, because I believe that if inserted it would lead to great hardship. The number of cases which would be brought before the court, if this amendment were accepted, would be very large.  This clause in the Rent Restrictions Act is an eminently fair one, because it leaves it to the judge to say on the evidence adduced in the case wherein the greater hardship lies. If, in the opinion of the judge, the greater hardship would be caused by dispossessing the tenant, he finds in favour of the tenant.  If Deputy Good's amendment were carried, it would mean that the judge, no matter how great the hardship on the tenant, would have to give a decree for possession.  If, as Deputy Good says, the landlord or householder proved that he wanted it for himself or for some member of his family or some tenant, or someone employed by his tenant, the house-owner would be entitled to possession.  I <Col N="1734" /> think the amendment is so comprehensive that no house-owner would have any difficulty in satisfying the judge upon some one of the heads set out here.  I hope the Minister will not accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 4 of the principal Act is the section which deals with restrictions on the right of the landlord to resume possession.  It sets out certain conditions which must exist if possession is to be successfully resumed by process of law by the landlord. Amongst other things, that section sets out that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No order or judgment for possession of any dwelling-house to which this Act applies or for the ejectment of a tenant therefrom shall be made or given unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>and then we come to paragraph (d) which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Right">(unless)</P>
      <P>the dwelling-house is reasonably required by the landlord for occupation as a residence for himself, or for any person bona fide residing or to reside with him or for some person in his whole-time employment, or in the whole-time employment of some tenant from him, and in the opinion of the court greater hardship would, owing to the special circumstances of the case, be caused by refusing the order for possession than by granting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good wants to delete the concluding portion of the paragraph, to relieve the court of the onus of deciding whether greater hardship would arise to the landlord by refusing the right to resume possession of his property than to the tenant by granting that right.  It seems to me if the Deputy is to make a complete job of what he is seeking, he should also delete the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; at the commencement of the paragraph.  Because, in fact, implicit in that word, there is all that he is seeking by his amendment to delete from the paragraph.  If the judge has to decide whether a house is reasonably required by the landlord for occupation he will, in his efforts to arrive at a conclusion as to whether it is reasonably required or not, advert to the hardship to the tenant that would arise by his <Col N="1735" /> granting such an order, and advert to whatever inconvenience would result to the landlord by his refusing to grant such an order.  Thereby, I suggest he will, in fact, be adverting to this test which Deputy Good wishes no longer to have applied&mdash;the test of greater hardship. I am suggesting to the Dáil, that if the Deputy were to be quite logical, and make a complete success of what he is seeking, there would have to be a further deletion than that which is covered by his amendment&mdash;the deletion of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; at the beginning of the paragraph.  I am opposed to the amendment.</P>
    <P>The judge or some judges of Deputy Good's acquaintance may have remarked that that section or that paragraph puts a burden upon them.  But we appoint judges to bear burdens and to arrive at decisions in matters of difficulty and complexity.  I think that a hardship such as this on the judges ought to continue rather than that we should create a hardship, and that the house-owner, merely by going to the court and stating he wanted his house, could thereby get it&mdash;by simply showing that certain domestic arrangements which he proposed to make necessitated the resumption of possession of this house, that the order should issue automatically, without any advertence on the part of the court to the magnitude of his need or the bigger hardship inflicted by catering for that need.</P>
    <P>Once admit the principle of control&mdash; and we have admitted that in the principal Act and again on the Second Reading of this Bill&mdash;and then you arrive at the point that, owing to particular stringency, and the particular shortage, this right of the landlord to vacant possession of his house is by statute hedged round with conditions imposed by law.  It is reasonable to impose as one such condition the test that if he is to resume vacant possession of his house, then he must show a real need and that need must be greater, and must outweigh in its proportion the hardship and inconvenience that would be inflicted on the tenant by ejectment.  However invidious the court finds it to decide in that matter, I think that we ought not, in extending this control legislation, to remove from <Col N="1736" /> the judges the onus of that decision, and to bring about automatic ejectment when the householder comes along and makes the case, which may be on the face of it a good case, for the resumption of possession.</P>

      <P>I would like to lay down one rule, which I think is a sound rule, for the guidance of Deputies in debating an amendment like this.  No views, I think, should ever be attributed to judges unless in cases where a judge singly or judges collectively have thought fit to make a public pronouncement.

      <P>I think this amendment goes a little further than the Minister would appear to think from what he has told us.  The President told the Dáil yesterday that he was disappointed that housing had not been more enthusiastically taken up by the larger trading firms.  What the President had in his mind was that houses should be erected by these firms for occupation by their employees.  I think that is a fair interpretation to put on what he said, and that that is the point of view that should encourage these firms to embark on housing schemes. Bearing that in mind, what is the effect of this section?  When an employee leaves such a firm for any reason, either because of promotion or otherwise, and that firm has a number of houses, the object for which those houses were erected being to house their employees, the natural desire of the firm would be that the incoming employee would occupy his predecessor's house.  But the former employee finds that the <Col N="1737" /> house is a particularly comfortable one, and he decides to hold it because of that and because of the difficulty of getting another suitable house at an equally favourable rent.  That being so, and the firm in question being anxious to do what the President would like these firms to do, to embark more largely on housing schemes, here is the very impediment that in many cases is stopping that desirable object from being achieved, and when we bring up this proposal the Minister refuses such a firm the opportunity of giving proper accommodation to their men.  To my mind that state of affairs is indefensible.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert a new section before Section 5 as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If any of the conditions contained in Section 6 of Principal Act <Col N="1739" /> shall fail to be complied with by the tenant retaining possession by virtue of the Principal Act the said failure shall constitute a forfeiture of the said tenancy within the meaning of Section 16 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, 1881.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object is to amend Section 6 of the present Act, which sets out the conditions of a statutory tenancy.  The amendment provides that on the breach by a tenant of such conditions such breach shall mean forfeiture within the meaning of Section 14 of the Conveyancing Act, 1881, that is, that the landlord cannot re-enter on the premises until he has served on the tenant a notice specifying the breach and requiring him to remedy it, and if the tenant fails to do so, to give compensation. The real object of this is to get a clear definition of what is a breach of a statutory tenancy, which, I believe, is a very complicated and difficult question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14 of the Conveyancing Act of 1881 imposes certain restrictions on and gives relief against forfeiture for breaches of conditions under a lease.  The effect of the section may be summarised as being that, where a lease contains certain conditions, for a breach of which the lessor is entitled by the lease to retake possession, he cannot in the case of a breach enforce his right to possession unless he first serves notice on the lessee complaining of the breach of the condition and requiring him to remedy it.  On the failure of the lessee to comply with such notice the lessor may proceed to enforce his right of forfeiture, the court being empowered to grant leave to the lessee on such terms as to damages, compensation and costs as it may think fit.  Breaches of certain conditions are exempted from the effect of the section, notably those prohibiting assignment or sub-letting of the property leased.  Where, therefore, the lessee assigns or sub-lets in breach of a condition, or fails to pay the rent reserved, the lessor may enforce his right to forfeiture without the service of a notice.  It is difficult to appreciate what the Deputy seeks <Col N="1740" /> to attain by the amendment.  Presumably he desires that a breach by the tenant of any of the statutory conditions of his tenancy will entitle the landlord to determine the tenancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were correct in stating that as being the object of the amendment it is not at all certain that it is achieved by the amendment, as Section 14 of the Conveyancing Act of 1881 gives no right of forfeiture, but places restrictions on such a right where it exists under a lease.  Apart, however, from that somewhat technical point, Section 4, sub-section (1) of the Principal Act of 1923, which will be continued by the present Bill, entitles a landlord to recover possession from a tenant who fails to comply with the statutory conditions of his tenancy. The landlord's right to possession is not absolute in such circumstances.  The court has a discretion as to whether an order for possession should, in fact, issue.  It is considered that that provision is ample protection for house-owners. That is the provision set out in Section 4, sub-section (1) (a) of the Principal Act, and no change should be made which might have the effect of cutting down the discretion given to the court in such cases.  The amendment, therefore, as far as I am concerned, is unacceptable.  Section 4 of the Principal Act, sub-section (1) (a) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No order or judgment for the recovery of possession of any dwelling-house to which this Act applies or for the ejectment of a tenant therefrom shall be made or given unless&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  Any rent lawfully due from the tenant has not been paid, or any other obligation of the tenancy (whether under the contract of tenancy or under this Act), so far as the same is consistent with the provisions <Col N="1741" /> of this Act has been broken or not performed.</P>

The object of the section is to increase the ten to twenty. I object to the proposed increase.  I think ten per cent. should be quite sufficient.  Unfortunately I did not hear the Minister on the Second Reading of the Bill and I have not heard any reasons in favour of the change.  I do not see any reason why there should be a change.  An increase of ten per cent. on the standard rent is quite sufficient. Three years ago ten per cent. was put into the Act after a great deal of consideration, and there has been no change of circumstances since on which the increase from ten to twenty per cent. could be based.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this amendment can be best discussed and understood by taking a specific example. If you take a Dublin house with a valuation of £14, and the 1914 rent £34.  The rates were £8 in 1914, therefore the standard rent is £26. The net profit rent to the landlord would, of course, be less than the standard rent.  It would probably be about £24.  Under the Bill this net profit rent might be increased by twenty per cent. of the standard rent, which would be £5 4s.  That would be £29 4s. as against £24 in 1914.  As I propose in the Bill, the net profit rent might be increased by twenty per cent. of the standard rent which is £26.  Twenty per cent. of £26 is £5 4s.  Adding that to the net profit rent you get £29 4s. now, as against £24 in 1914, which seems on the moderate side.  The Deputy asked me to defend the proposal for an increase. If he will admit the figures in the specific case I am putting I think he ought to agree that it requires no further defence in view of the increased <Col N="1742" /> rate of wages and salaries enjoyed by occupants of houses now, which are very often two or three times the pre-war rate.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must remember that we are facing towards decontrol and we are facing towards it in two ways.  One way is to cut down the scale of valuation over a period, allowing out a certain number of houses; and another way is to increase this figure and allow an increased charge to the landlord.  Without going into the question of conditions in 1923 or what was the proper thing to do then, I simply say it is not unreasonable, at any rate from the Deputy's angle, whatever the house-owner may have to say on the inadequacy of the increase, to allow a charge of £29 now in comparison with £24 in 1914, and that it is not harsh on the tenant to allow it.  The probability is that there is a feeling on the part of owners of house property that it is an inadequate concession.</P>

      <P>The Minister has suggested that the question has to be considered as one affecting a marketable commodity that is at present in the market, and that should move towards the owner being allowed to make whatever he can on that house.  It is well that we should have a clear understanding of the principle at work because yesterday, on behalf of the house-owners, we heard a good many expressions indicating that it was an investment, and a fair rate of interest on the investment that was in question&mdash;it <Col N="1743" /> was not so much an article of merchandise to buy and sell, and make the best profit, but property in which men invested their money and would be entitled to a fair return.  That is the case which was put forward by Deputy Good, I think by the President, and certainly by Deputy O'Connor.  I think it is well, therefore, to bear in mind that this Bill and the paragraph in question proposing to allow twenty per cent. increase on the standard rent, instead of ten per cent., has relation to house property which was built prior to 1914.</P>

I have taken the trouble to find out what would be the relative position of three men with a thousand pounds to invest, one of whom invested in Consols, another in railway stock, and another in house property.  Investments made in this fashion in May, 1914, in respect of Consols would give a return of three-and-a-third per cent., and in respect of railway stock, debenture stock of the Great Southern and Western Railway, or the Midland and Great Western Railway, the rate was slightly above or below four per cent. The utmost that can reasonably be claimed by the investor in house property at that time is what was received and what is received by the investor in those other securities, plus an allowance for depreciation.</P>

If you are treating it as an <Col N="1744" /> article of merchandise, it is a different picture.  I ask the Minister, is he treating this as an article of merchandise which can be bought and sold, and is he wanting to ensure a certain rate of profit?  If we are treating it as an investment, there is no case made for guaranteeing a higher rate of interest on that pre-war investment in respect of house-owners than in respect of holders of Great Western and Great Southern Railway stock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Two per cent. gives a gross return of eight per cent., the rent being charged pre-war.  Let us say eight per cent. on the investment.  That rent was the basis of the standard rent. We have already allowed a ten per cent. increase on that, and you propose to allow a further ten per cent. That would give us nine point six per cent. and if we deduct, as it is right to deduct, two per cent. for working charges we would have, according to this proposal of the Minister, guaranteed to the person who invested in house property in 1914, 7.6 per cent. on his investment if my surmises are correct. <Col N="1745" /> Deputy Good would not think five per cent. a reasonable return in 1914, so I am assuming six per cent.  We are asked by the Minister to guarantee seven-and-a-half per cent. on his investments to the man who bought property in 1914, besides allowing him statutory increases in charges in respect to expenditure on repairs which have been executed since the standard rent was fixed.</P>
      <P>I think there is no justification for it. There is no justification for treating the investor in house property pre-war more favourably at the expense of the tenant than it has been thought desirable in respect to any other investors. If we are only treating this from the point of view of a marketable commodity being bought and sold, we are back again on the question of the reasonableness of controlling prices.  To add a further 10 per cent. to the standard rent beyond what is allowed under the last Act at a time of falling wages, lowering purchasing power in the wages received, lower real wages than existed three years ago, is putting an unfair burden on the great mass of the community.  There has been a good deal of talk about the burden of taxes, but in this instance you are going to put a very big burden of tax upon one section of the community, simply by allowing landlords to add to their rental ten per cent. additional to the standard rent.  That kind of tax, which is proposed to be imposed by the authority of Parliament in favour of the landlord, is no less a tax and no less a burden upon the occupiers of houses than if it were imposed by the Minister for Finance instead of by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the example the Minister has quoted, he is proposing to add 45/- a year to the taxation of the small householder who is living in a house valued at £14.  That is the proposition&mdash; namely, to allow by statutory authority the landlord to impose a new tax of, say, 50/- a year on that class of householder and every other householder, in proportion to the amount of rent he pays.  I hope that this matter will be considered in the light of the burden that is being imposed on the people of the country in favour of the <Col N="1746" /> landlord, at a time when the ability to pay is less than when we passed the Act of 1923, and that the tenants will not be required to bear this additional burden at a time when they are less able to bear it than they were even in 1923.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards this amendment, I say that the Labour Party is very honest, as it agrees with the ten per cent. already imposed on the workers.  I would like if this amendment were to delete the complete section.  I would then be in a better position to speak on it, as I deny the right of any landlord to increase the rent of a house or property erected prior to 1914.  The cost of such a house is not anything like the cost of houses which have since been erected.  Not alone do we give an increase to the landlord who erected the house, but we give the same increase to a person who purchased the house at a public auction.  If a house were put up for sale under the authority of the Bankruptcy Court, there would not be many bidders, but some miserly landlord would probably come forward and buy it for £140 or £150.  As soon as he has purchased it he can immediately charge 20 per cent. on the standard rent.  I know houses which were purchased in that way on which the landlord made £240 on his purchase of £140. Yet we are asked to give such landlords a further increase of ten per cent.  Not alone are we assisting the landlords, but we are not encouraging the lending of money for the building of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a man can purchase an old house at a small price he can safely spend a few pounds upon it, and he is at liberty to charge 20 per cent. on the standard rent, and 15 per cent for repairs.  We do not consider the worker's point of view and we do not bother about him and his children.  It is not taken into account that when he is out of employment his family must be maintained by the local council through the medium of home help.  The Government, on behalf of the landlords, are now giving another 10 per cent. on the standard rent, and I think that that proposal has been inserted, not as the result of a <Col N="1747" /> joint conference of tenants and landlords, but of a conference of landlords with the Minister.  The Minister has admitted that in the case of a house of £14 valuation there will be an extra cost of 45/- or 50/-.  I wonder will the Government instruct the local authority to increase the wages of workers who live in such houses.  If such instructions are given, or if Deputies who favour the increase will give a guarantee that every employee living in such a house who is compelled to pay this increase will have his wages increased accordingly, then I will agree to the imposition of this 10 per cent. extra. We have not got that.  What we are asked to do is to raise the cost of living on the worker by an extra 50/- a year. On the other hand, we are told that wages are too high, and that the cost of living cannot come down until wages are reduced.  What we are doing here is increasing the cost of living on the workers.  I think after four years of legislation here that the capitalist class, as we call it, should realise the necessity of looking to the interests of the masses of the people, and not to the interests of a particular class.</P>

The people who are speaking on behalf of a particular section should do something to help to bring about a reduction in the cost of living in the case of the masses of the people who will have to bear this 10 per cent.  For my taste at least, the Labour Party is too mild altogether on this Bill.  I hope the Dáil will see that justice is done to the class of people who will have to bear this proposed increase. If the Dáil were to vote a few million pounds for distribution amongst the workers who will have to pay this extra 10 per cent. of course I would agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's figures of £26 standard rent and £24 nett rent make up the proposed increase of £5 4s.  The increase that is proposed in the Bill seems reasonable from some points of view.  Roughly speaking, it is <Col N="1748" /> little more than 20 per cent. on the nett rent, but there is a huge difference between the nett rent and the £26 standard rent in the Minister's mind, and the nett rent and the £26 standard rent that will be put forward by the house-owners. For instance, the house-owner would claim that the nett rent was considerably less than £24, because he will put forward the plea that a great proportion of the £24 was spent in keeping the house in a habitable condition. From the house-owner's point of view I think it would be moderate to say that he will claim £18 or £20 as the nett rent rather than £24.</P>
      <P>If that claim is going to be considered in this matter, then the £5 4s. mentioned by the Minister would be a considerably greater increase than it would be on the £24 nett rent the Minister has in mind.  When the Act of 1923, referred to here as the Principal Act, was passing through the House, I did not say a single word on it for the reason that the Departmental Committee set up to deal with the expiry of the English Act of 1920 had made recommendations to the Minister after having held, I think, thirty-one sittings of 95 or 96 hours' duration.  The Minister accepted the recommendations of that Committee in full.  I was the only Deputy at the time who was a member of that Committee, and as the Minister had accepted its recommendations there was no necessity for me to say a word one way or the other.  I could not even voice the view that the Labour Party put forward at the time, simply because the Minister had included the recommendations of the Committee, of which I was a member, in his Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the meetings of that Departmental Committee we had evidence from scores of representatives of house-owners and tenants, bankers and others.  The reasons put forward by the representatives of the house-owners for a big increase on the standard rent were, firstly, that they wanted a larger income than they had in 1914 owing to the increase in the cost of living, and, secondly, that they were compelled to execute a great deal of repairs from time to time, the cost in connection with which had also increased considerably. It was the considered opinion of the <Col N="1749" /> five or six members of that Departmental Committee that, taking things all round, the amount of money spent on repairs, so far as the members of the Committee could find out, was practically nil.  We agreed unanimously that we were more than generous in allowing the 10 per cent. increase on the standard rent.  We did that so as to encourage the house-owners to spend more money in putting their houses into a habitable state.  We included the recommendation which is embodied in the present Act making an allowance for an increase in rent in proportion to the amount of money that would actually be spent over and above a certain sum &mdash;I think it was two-thirds&mdash;in putting the house into a habitable state.  Having heard all the evidence on that occasion, and having regard to all the facts, I must remain of the opinion that the 10 per cent. was a quite sufficient increase. Consequently, I intend to move this particular amendment, and, if necessary, to call for a division on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment of Deputy Nagle.  The important question is: what really would be looked upon as the standard rent?  I am quite well aware of what was in the Minister's mind so far as the standard rent is concerned.  Up to the time that the Rent Restrictions Act came into operation a great number of the landlords and house-owners in the cities and towns of Ireland paid the rates of their tenants.  When they did so, I think we are entitled to assume that the tenant had the rates included in his rent.  Since the passing of the original Act and since the new adjustment came into effect, a great number of landlords have refused to pay the rates for their tenants, with the result that they have benefited not only by the 10 per cent.  which the Act permitted them to increase the tenants' rents by, but also by the amount of money which, prior to the passing of the Act, they used to pay to the local councils in rates in respect of the houses occupied by their tenants.  This is a matter that, I think, requires more careful consideration from the Minister. I suggest to him also that he ought to make inquiries in the various cities and towns as to whether the tenants <Col N="1750" /> are not already sufficiently overtaxed so far as the payment of rent is concerned before he tacks on another 10 per cent. to them.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Johnson pointed out, it is not a good time for increasing rents when there is so much unemployment, and when we have had an agitation from the Town Tenants' League, and from people entitled to speak on behalf of tenants for a decrease in rent. Be that as it may, I ask the Minister to consider this question regarding the rates.  I think it would have been a good thing in the earlier part of this year, when pressure was brought to bear upon the President, if he had brought in that Bill, which has been promised for such a long time, whereby the landlord would be made responsible for the collection of rates.  Until that is done rents and rates will be in a state of chaos.  What I have said is a statement of facts, for I am in a position to know that up to the time the Rent Restrictions Act was brought into operation the landlords paid the rates for their tenants and collected them.  Since the Act came into operation, they have closed on the rates, and they have gained to that extent, in addition to the 10 per cent. provided for in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It was admitted by me at an early stage of these discussions that control was an evil, but that it seemed a lesser evil than the state of affairs that would exist in the absence of control.  Now, control is all the time an evil, and, perhaps, not the least evil of it is the muddled mentality that it has created in connection with this whole matter of house property. We had it, for instance, running through Deputy Johnson's whole statement on this amendment.  The house-owner was an investor, and we were to measure out more or less what he was to be allowed on his investment. The house belonged to God knows whom: to the Government, to the State, to Deputy Lyons, or to anyone except the house-owner.  That shows just how far one can travel along the lines of losing sight of the fundamental fact that the house is the property of an individual, call him the house-owner, <Col N="1751" /> call him the landlord, or call him something even worse&mdash;but the house is his property.  Justification for the measure of legislative control that has existed, and that it is proposed to continue for a further period, is due to a shortage arising from a cessation of house-building for a considerable period.</P>
      <P>Occasionally, when the need is great, and when the social reactions of inaction would be great, governments acting on behalf of the community take the right to interfere with private property, and lest Deputy Good and Deputy Hewat be shocked at that remark, let me remind them that in the course of the Great War people were dispossessed of their holdings, put out of their farms, which were taken over compulsorily by the Government, and given into the use and possession of people who would undertake to cultivate them adequately and maintain a high output of food.  Only in that way, and from that angle, can this legislation we have introduced be justified.  In 1923 we realised that at that time control could not be allowed to lapse, and we legislated for a further period of three years.  We are not now of opinion that it can be allowed to lapse, but we are of opinion that we must, and can, face now in the direction of decontrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We provide that over a period of three years a fresh block of houses shall come out from under the pressure of our legislation, and we are also of opinion that at this stage the owner of the house can be allowed, without danger to the community, a greater freedom in dealing with what is, after all, when we get back to essentials and fundamentals, his or her property. That is the modest justification for this very moderate increase of 20 per cent.  I would not have bothered speaking again, I would have allowed this issue to go to a division, only that I was impressed by what seemed to me the dangerously muddled mentality running through Deputy Johnson's statements on this amendment as to where the proprietorship lay, and as to what the fundamentals of the position are.  We have interfered legislatively with the <Col N="1752" /> unrestricted exercise of private property rights, but let us not forget, when all is said and done, and when you have passed your Act with all its sections and sub-sections, that it is still private property.  It is just that, I feared, Deputy Johnson was losing sight of when he spoke on this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister need not fear I was losing sight of any of these points he has made, and particularly I was not losing sight of the fact that it had been considered necessary to interfere with the right of the house-owner to sell for a period his property to the highest bidder.  Because of the fear of social reactions it was found necessary for the State to interfere with these rights of private property which have hitherto been secured to the landlord by law.  These rights of private property that the Minister speaks of are rights granted by the legislature, and being such may be interfered with, as they have been interfered with, by the legislature.  The question that has arisen is whether it is time to remove the legislative restrictions attaching to the property-owner.  The Minister contends that the time has arrived when it is justifiable to relax restrictions; in effect, to say to the house-owner: &ldquo;Recognising that you as a house-owner have private property, and that your ownership entitles you to take advantage of the social necessity, the requirements of the masses of people for houses for protection from the weather&mdash;a natural necessity&mdash;we are prepared to allow you an exceptional liberty to make an additional profit out of that social necessity from the poor people who are bound by that necessity to pay more than they can afford.&rdquo;  The legislature decided three years ago that something more was required than by the ordinary laws of supply and demand.  When there was no legislative restriction in operation.  We were prepared by legislative sanction to allow these house-owners a certain addition over and above what they were able to extract by the ordinary market operation in 1914.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course the house-owner has taken the fullest advantage of the <Col N="1753" /> law in that respect, and recognising that this is a natural attribute of the genus house-owner, the Minister asked us to agree to allow him a further liberty to take further advantage of the social necessities for his private benefit.  I say that the duty of the legislature is to prevent the operations of the market which would allow the house-owner or the owner of any other necessity to take advantage of the imperative need of the people, and following the operations of the old laws in respect of land to allow that landlord to extract a rack rent.  The Minister recognises that the pressure will be to extract the utmost possible from the tenant.  He says we shall not allow you complete liberty; we shall allow 20 per cent. more than the ordinary operations of the market in 1914 allowed, and the Dáil is asked to agree to back up the landlord against the tenant. That is practically the proposition that we are facing.  The pleas that were made here yesterday were that the house-owner was entitled to the benefits of his investments.  We were asked that he should be considered entitled to a reasonable return upon his investment. His investments were in 1914 and prior to 1914, and I showed that a reasonable return upon the investment, basing that claim upon what other investors received for investments made at the same period, was secured to him, and more than secured to him, by the existing law in the matter. without giving him an additional 10 per cent. upon the standard rent.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, this proposal in the Bill is to give a privilege to the man who invested his money in houses prior to 1914 over and above the position of the investor in any other form of property at that time.  The Minister talks about the rights of private property as being fundamental.  So far as the exercise of any statutory right in respect of private property conduces to the public welfare or does not interfere with the public welfare, one may well recognise those rights, but the exercise of rights in private property does and will under these provisions interfere with the public welfare, and we are bound to interfere with these rights if we are doing our duty as legislators. If the Minister wants to stand upon the <Col N="1754" /> rights of private property, he should do as Deputy Good and Deputy O'Connor would require, let this increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act lapse at the end of June.</P>
    <P>That is what those Deputies would desire, and the Minister, of course, has stated more than once that he is not going to recognise the rights of private property in respect of property in houses, and he is quite right in that. I believe he is giving far too much away to the landlord, far too much of the necessities, far too much right to play upon the public necessities, and to make a profit out of the public necessities in the Bill that he has presented to us.  The proposition is whether those rights in private property that the Minister speaks of are such as will enable the owner of private property in any form to monopolise it or to sell it or to let it out at such a price as the inevitable natural demand of the people will enable him to extract. The amendment will go some distance to protect the mass of the people who are resident in houses from the additional tax that the Minister proposes to put upon them, and I hope the Dáil will realise that that is what it is being asked to do, and that it will not agree to this additional impost upon the people.</P>

      <P>I think so; not capital invested in Funds, perhaps.  I want to make my point a little clear. Suppose, instead of buying house property or building houses, a man chose to invest his money in the tailoring business.  Deputy Johnson says that houses are intended to protect people from the weather.  Clothes are also needed to protect people from the weather.  There is a need on the part of the community in each case.  The profits of the man engaged in the tailoring business are not limited.  The price of clothes has increased not by <Col N="1755" /> 20 per cent., but by a hundred per cent. and sometimes more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Some tailors may have, but they are not known to me.  The tailoring establishments that I know appear to be fairly flourishing, though probably they suffer from the fact that we are making our clothes last longer than we did before 1914.  But this limitation of profit applies only to the person who supplies the need of the community for houses.  There may be an economic limitation on profit, but there is no State limitation whatever in the case of other businesses which supply the needs of the community. It may be desirable that there should be some such limitation.  That is a point upon which I do not want to pronounce at present, because the Tribunal on Prices is still taking evidence, and have not yet come to a definite conclusion.  There may be a case for it, but there is no case for singling out the house-owner and saying: &ldquo;You, and you only, are to be limited.&rdquo;  I did not hear Deputy Johnson attempt to make any case in that direction.  It is common knowledge that the rent of houses has increased owing to the operation of these Acts far less than any other commodity in the market.  A 20 per cent. increase is not comparable in any way with the increases that have taken place in the prices of practically every other commodity that the necessary to the public. So you ought either to pronounce a limitation of profit in regard to every commodity or else you can hardly insist that the house-owner should be singled out.  I think as a step in that direction of decontrol the Minister's proposal is a wise one and I shall vote against Deputy Nagle's amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister is getting wiser every day, I hope.  It seems to me the amendment moved by Deputy Nagle is a very reasonable one. The landlord is not restricted, as Deputy Corish pointed out, in all cases to an increase of ten per cent.  It is well known that landlords collected rates from the tenants in many cases along with the rent, and prior to the Rent Restrictions Act they paid over these rates to the local authorities.  It is well known that since this Act came into force the landlords have simply closed on the rates paid through the rents by the tenants, and because of the Local Government law the tenants are being compelled, except in cases where there was a definite written agreement, to pay the rates.  That is a matter that should be taken into consideration.  It is a matter that is known to many members of the House, and it is probably better known to the President than to any other Deputy.</P>

      <P>On the day this Bill was before the House for Second Reading, I cited the difference in rates between 1924-25, 1925-26 and 1926-27. I pointed out to Deputy Johnson, I think, very clearly, that after allowing <Col N="1757" /> for this particular increase of ten per cent.  the actual increase to a person in occupation of a house the valuation of which is £15, amounted to 3d. per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the Minister's argument is that these rates may be reduced.  You are asking people to agree to a reduction of rates or to assist in bringing about a reduction in rates, and when you have succeeded in bringing about reductions in rates, it is all to go to the landlords.  The people who have been looking forward to a reduction in rates are not to have any benefit, and we are to hand it all over to the landlord.  That is the President's proposition.  Deputy Cooper finds fault because we singled out property in houses as the only property about which there should be any restrictions as to the selling price or the letting price.  If Deputy Cooper could imagine the supply of bread or other necessaries in the country being so small and the demand being so great as to force up the price, or if for any cause there was a shortage in the supply of coal in winter time and an insistent demand from the people for that absolute necessity, would Deputy Cooper approve of that freedom which he thinks should be given to the house-owner to get whatever price he could in the market?  Would he even agree to an increase being demanded by the owners of these commodities, owing to the insistent demand of the people, over and above the price which they were able to get in normal times?  That is the position. In normal times, when supply and demand were supposed to be met by ordinary economic activities, the price was sufficient to allow four or five per cent. upon the investment, but now, owing to the continued shortage of houses and the growing demand, it is perfectly right that we ought to say to property owners, &ldquo;Because of your accidental monopoly of the possession of this property, because of the shortage as compared with the demand, you are not to be allowed to get an additional price for your commodity, any more than we would allow if we were dealing with bread or coal or water.&rdquo; That is my case, and I am prepared to support it.</P>

      <P>The one case above all others in which the alteration in the incidence of charge falls upon people directly is the city of Dublin.  Take the city of Dublin as a case in point.  The Corporation of Dublin has constructed something like 3,000 houses.  They have yet to construct something like 20,000 more.  The 20,000 people who have yet to be provided with houses have got to pay a rental of certainly 50 per cent. more than those are paying who are lucky enough to be in possession of the present houses.  The cost of housing falls on the local authority.  The twenty thousand people who have yet to be provided for is a very large consideration in this matter.  They will have a rental of something like 12/6 or 15/- per week while houses provided during the last 15 or 20 years are let at approximately 33? per cent. under that price.  I submit that the 3d. per week to which I have referred is not an undue burden to place on these people in order to relieve the housing shortage.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that.  The Deputy in this question of rates wanted to know if there was any reduction would it be handed over to the landlord.  The landlord is not a landlord living in Merrion Square or some mansion elsewhere.  The municipality is the landlord in this case, and it is the largest landlord with one exception in the city.  The Corporation of Dublin is the largest landlord.</P>

Yesterday I made the case that there should be some sort of latitude to enable other people to come in and share that burden.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>During the last seven or ten years anybody who has experience of this matter in the city of Dublin knows full well what damage the Rent Restrictions Act did with regard to this particular institution.  It is not a case in connection with which I could enter into a very elaborate explanation at a moment's notice.  I can, however, say that in 1919 when the first Dáil was sitting that particular case was cited before us, and it was pointed out that for something like three or four months practically no rentals whatever came into the Artisans' Dwellings Company.  An interruption such as that is not an inducement to any such body to indulge in house-building.</P>
      <P>On many occasions here I mentioned the Artisans' Dwellings Company as one of the most public-spirited corporations in the whole country.  They have built something like 5,000 dwellings in and around Dublin City.  The houses are let at very fair rentals.  An agitation was got up to prevent them collecting rents at the time of the ordinary increase which was involved in the 1919 Act.  Now, the case that is made in this connection is that there is much more work to be done than has been done.  There is a much greater burden to be borne by the people who have yet to get houses than has to be borne by people who are in possession of houses.  That is a large item which must be taken into consideration.</P>

There were increases in wages all round; the reason for the increases was attributed to the cost of living, and it was pointed out that the cost of living included rents.  Wages were increased to meet the cost of living and also the increase of rents. The capacity of people to pay has been mentioned, and I maintain that the capacity to pay rents was covered by the increase of wages to an extent of fully 300 per cent.</P>

They went on strike and would not pay the increase equal to the increase in rates, and, to-day, there are owing to the Pembroke Council several thousands of pounds.  This increase of 20 per cent. in rents is a reasonable advance in comparison with the increases in wages to meet the cost of living which included increased rents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope not to follow him into the obscurity.  The President talked about building new houses.  I think it is perfectly clear that there is nothing in the Rent Restrictions Act to prevent anyone who wants to build new houses from doing so, and I do not see that any such issue should be raised here in connection with the increase of rent on old property.  The President said that he had dealt with the rates question.  But I submit he dealt with the question from an angle entirely different from that which any of us, representing a country constituency, would look at it.  He acquired a certain knowledge in the Dublin Corporation, and he has been a long time dealing with the housing problem, and I am glad to say that he always lent a hand in the endeavour to secure houses for the working classes.  The question of rates in provincial towns is an entirely different matter; their implication and incidence are entirely different, in country towns, from that which prevails in the city of Dublin.  All over the country, practically in every town and city in Ireland, before the Rent Restrictions Act, the rates were collected by the landlords and paid to the local authority.  An adjustment was made <Col N="1763" /> in the rent in order to enable the landlords to do that.  I will cite a case. Let us say a house in a provincial town, before the Rent Restrictions Act, was let for five shillings per week, The valuation was £4; the rates in 1914 were 8/- in the £.  That would be £1 12s. 0d., and they were collected by the landlord and paid to the local authority. Since that year the rent was, say, increased ten per cent.&mdash;that is 6d. per week&mdash;and the rates were increased, say, to 10/- in the £, that meant the rates would be £2, so that the tenant is paying £3 6s. 0d. direct every year more than before the Rent Restrictions Act was introduced.  Everyone will agree that the increase in rent in provincial <Col N="1764" /> towns in Ireland is more than ten per cent.  The landlord, when not compelled to collect the rates, took advantage of the situation provided for in this Bill to enable him to get more than ten per cent. additional profit on his rent.  I do not think the President answered that case.  He spoke from his knowledge of Dublin and the position that he cited there does not prevail in other towns and cities in Ireland.</P>

      <P>This amendment was put down in view of the possibility that the result of the last vote would be as it has been.

      <P>I cannot accept the amendment.  My reasons are those which I gave on the previous amendment which Deputy Johnson foresaw <Col N="1765" /> would be rejected in the Dáil.  I have nothing to add.  I took a specific case of a house with a valuation of £14 in 1914, the rent being £34 and the rates in 1914 £8.  The standard rent was £26 and I showed that the landlord's net profit rent would be about £24.  Under the Bill this net profit rent may be increased by 20 per cent. of the standard rent.  That would be £5 4s., which would give a rent of £29 4s. now as against a sum of £24 in 1914.  That is not an undue increase and I am confirmed in that view when I remember that in most cases the income of the occupants of those houses is increased since 1914 by anything from 150 per cent. upwards to 200 and 300 per cent. I do not want to tread again the beaten track that we travelled on the last amendment, but my objection to this amendment is quite definite, and it is based on the reasons which I gave for my opposition to the last amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well perhaps to note the factor that is influencing the Minister's thoughts and decisions in this matter.  He says the incomes of people affected have increased in this period by from 150 per cent. up to 200 and 300 per cent.  I hope he will be able to persuade the Minister for Finance that that is the general truth &mdash;that that is the fact with regard to all those people who will be called upon to pay this increased rent.  It will affect the income tax returns considerably if it be true.  Hitherto, from certain quarters of this House, the story has been that it is only the workingmen whose income has increased by this 150 per cent., 200 per cent. or 300 per cent., as the case may be.  Now we have it from the Minister that the incomes of all householders have increased from 150 per cent. to 300.  I wonder whether the constituents of the Minister will agree with <Col N="1766" /> that?  I wonder whether it is true of all professional people, of all semiprofessional people and of those people who are living on small businesses and who live in houses protected by this Rent Restrictions Act?  If it is not true that their incomes have increased from 150 to 300 per cent., then the Minister is wrong in his calculation. He is not justified in making his proposals, if the basis of his proposals is proved to be wrong.  It would be really a very important piece of information if it could be shown that the general income of the people has increased by 150 to 300 per cent.  It is not true in relation to the wage-earners, speaking generally, though you may pick out a few here and there, in respect of whom it would be true. Presumably the Minister has been well informed with regard to the rest of the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">

      <P>I should like to remind the House of some statements made in the Dáil in connection with this matter in the hope that the section will be defeated on the next division.  The section is really uncalled for if credit is lent to the statements made by the head of the Government with regard to the present cost of building houses. This ten per cent. additional is supposed to put more profit in the landlord's pocket.  On the Second Reading of the Bill, on Wednesday, 12th May, the President, speaking on this Bill, in reply to Deputy Cooper, said:</P>
      <P>The real position is that the unfortunate people who have no houses are being blackmailed owing to the cost of building houses.  It is no advantage to anyone that the cost is so high.  It is high, but it has gone down during the past three or four years.  The house that cost approximately £750 in 1922 can be built in Dublin now for a little less than £600. That is a considerable reduction, but there is room for more.</P>
      <P>This is the President's own statement &mdash;that a house can be built now for £150 less than in 1922, and still we are asked by this section to give an extra ten per cent. to the landlord who purchased a house in 1926 at £150 less than he could purchase it in 1922.  What is the necessity for this ten per cent. increase at all?  I would like to say that I was delighted to see that the farmers have acted so manfully by voting in the interests of the tenants.  I am sure that they fully realise that but for the devotion of the town tenants before the Land Act of 1903 none of them would own his land now.  They had the town tenants to help them in their fight.  I am sorry that there is one black sheep among the flock, and if a division is called I hope we will be able to get that stray sheep back to the flock.  I would ask every man, whether he is elected to stand by the Government or not, to vote against this section. You are asked to support an increase of 10 per cent.  Twice votes have been given in favour of it, but now is the opportune time to support the town tenants, and you can do so by voting against the section and fulfil the promises that you made.  There is not a Deputy on the Government benches who did not make elaborate speeches to his constituents about town tenants, who did not say to them: &ldquo;Return me to the Dáil and I will see that you are all right.&rdquo;  That is what you put up to the people.  I ask you to fulfil that undertaking now.  I ask every honest man in the Dáil who represents his constituents&mdash;</P>

    <P>Sub-section (3).&mdash;This section shall not entitle a landlord to recover from a tenant any sums which have been recovered from the landlord before the 4th day of May, 1926, by means of deduction from rent or otherwise or any rent which has not been paid by reason of such deductions having been made therefrom.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), line 54, to delete the words and figures &ldquo;4th day of May, 1926,&rdquo; and substitute the words and figures &ldquo;22nd day of June, 1923.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we might take amendments 20 and 21 together; they deal with the same matter.  They are put forward in order to enable the landlord to recover from the tenant overpayments of rent which the tenant has got back since the passing of the 1923 Act.  This should have been provided for in the 1923 Act. An Act passed in England in 1923 provides for this as from 1st December, 1922, and this amendment does not seek to make this Bill go so far back; only as far back as 23rd June, 1923.  It is hardly necessary to remind the Dáil that this particular subject had given rise to a considerable amount of contention and litigation.  Under the principal Acts the landlord is entitled to get three definite advantages: an increase of rent, an increase in the cost of repairs, and an increase in the rates. Owing to a flaw in the Act, it was held that before the landlord could recover these rights notice to quit should have been served in order to terminate the original tenancy.  An Act was passed in Great Britain to rectify that error, but it still remains in this country, and we now seek to put this matter right even at this late date.  This flaw has caused very grave hardship to landlords. I will cite only one case to show the extent of the hardship.  A landlord with nine houses points out the injustice that he has suffered by reason of the non-service of the notice <Col N="1771" /> to quit when claiming increases in reference to the Acts of 1922-23.  He submits details showing the amounts claimed in each case.  &ldquo;These amounts were not,&rdquo; he points out, &ldquo;repaid by us, but in each case the tenants lived on in the houses, paying no rent, and in that way got back the money they claimed.&rdquo;  These claims on the part of the tenants, to money to which the landlord was justly entitled but for a flaw in the Acts I have mentioned, that is non-service of notice to quit, amounted to £536 15s. 3d.  Owing to that flaw the landlord had to yield up this money in the case of these particular houses in the city and county of Dublin.  He had to refund to the tenants sums to which nobody will allege they were entitled.  All I seek in this amendment is that this money, which has been wrongly taken from the landlord by the tenants, should be refunded to him.  In other words, that the landlord should be put in the position which the Acts of 1900 and 1922 intended he should occupy.</P>

      <P>The amendments have been put down to meet the situation arising from decisions of the courts in two cases, Schmidt v. Christie and Kerr v. Bride, in which it was held that where a landlord charged and a tenant willingly paid a rent which did not exceed the standard rent by more than the increase permitted under the Act, and the landlord had not complied with certain technical points, such as service of notice to quit, or the statutory notice to increase the rent, the tenant could recover such permitted increases paid by him, either by action, from the landlord or by deduction from rent accruing due by him. It was considered inequitable that a tenant should be able to recover in this manner the permitted increases willingly paid by him, and the section under consideration accordingly removes the technical grounds on which this recovery could be made.  But the <Col N="1772" /> section as it stands, unlike the Deputy's amendment, recognises as an accomplished fact all sums recovered by tenants in that way prior to 4th May, 1926, the date of the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill as it stands, unlike the amendment, does not attempt to re-open these transactions.  I have my own view about these transactions.  It would probably be no less strong than the view of the mover of the amendment. I think it is wholly wrong and wholly inequitable that, after a tenant had agreed willingly to pay a particular rent, no greater than the increase permitted under the Act, he could then recover from the landlord, availing of a technicality, the amounts so paid because of the failure of the landlord to determine the tenancy by means of a notice to quit, thus creating a new statutory tenancy under the Act.  But, unlike the Deputy, I have not thought fit in the Bill to attempt to re-open all these transactions.  Deputy Good does not shrink from it.  His amendment attempts that very thing.  He wishes by his amendment to enable the landlord now to recover from the tenant all sums which the tenant may have recovered from the landlord, on these technical grounds, since the 22nd June, 1923.  If carried, the Deputy's amendment would mean that probably a thousand odd judgments, given by the courts since June, 1923, and based on the then existing law as interpreted by the courts, would be set aside and discharged, notwithstanding that those judgments had, in fact, been executed or satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a good deal of talk lately about the undesirability of retrospective or retroactive legislation.  Deputies had better realise that this amendment would be retroactive legislation with a vengeance.  It would create a position in which moneys actually paid by a party to a party under a judgment of the courts, would have to be repaid in accordance with our legislation.  The tenants, who recovered moneys on these technical grounds, utilised the law as it was found to exist at the time, and the recovery of those moneys by the aid of the court, ought not now, in my view, be nullified, whatever we <Col N="1773" /> may think as to the fairness, as between man and man, in seeking the recovery of those moneys by legal processes.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may urge that a distinction might, perhaps, be drawn between those cases in which the tenant recovered through the machinery of the court and those other cases brought to my notice, in which they simply deducted from the rent the increases which they had paid to the landlord when they discovered the technicality that the landlord was not entitled to charge in certain cases without terminating the tenancy by a notice to quit.  Some tenants set the machinery of the law in motion, secured favourable decisions, and actually induced the landlord to recoup moneys paid by way of increase of rent.  Other tenants merely figured out what the amount of such increases were, and deducted that amount from their rent.  In many cases some people paid no rent, and said: &ldquo;I do not have to pay any rent because the amount of my rent is due from you to me in respect of increases which were charged, and which were not legally chargeable owing to the fact that there was an omission to serve a notice to quit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No distinction is possible, I fear, between the cases where the actual machinery of the court was utilised and those other cases where the tenants simply deducted the increases from their rents.  If we are not to reopen court judgments then other transactions ought not to be reopened.  House-owners, from whom recovery was made in the courts are, in fact, in a worse position than those who lost increases by the tenant who deducted them from his rent, because, in addition, they had to pay the costs of litigation.  My position is this: while recognising the underlying injustice of the case from the point of view of individuals, while recognising it was not equitable that tenants should avail of a legal technicality to recover moneys which they agreed to pay, I shrink from asking the Dáil to accept an amendment which would mean striking back into the past and reopening a very large number of judgments of the courts.  I feel that it would not be proper to attempt to reverse <Col N="1774" /> court processes in that way, because that is what would be achieved by the amendment.</P>
    <P>I see no possibility of securing redress for those other house-owners who were not actually brought into court in litigation, but from whose rents the increases were subsequently deducted by tenants.  The whole matter is a very difficult one and one which had been of grave concern to me at the time.  It is true, as Deputy Good states, that a particular section of the Principal Act of 1923 failed to effect what, in fact, was desired, and intended by it&mdash;failed to effect what the British Act of 1923 effected after it was found by the judgments in Schmidt and Christie and Kerr and Bride that there was that technical loophole for tenants who had voluntarily agreed to pay increases in their rents not greater than the increases under the Act.</P>
    <P>The British introduced legislation in 1923 which effectively covered that flaw.  In our legislation of 1923 we desired and intended to effect a remedy for that position but the language of the Act failed.  We cover the point in this section, but we are not doing what the Deputy asks, namely, to strike back as far as June, 1923, and reopen all the transactions which were dealt with under the law as it was found to be then, when interpreted by the courts. Our proposal is to date the effect of the section as from the introduction of this Bill, and we are not asking the Dáil, because we do not see any way to do it that would be, in our view, sound and proper, to provide any redress for those house-owners who suffered through a flaw in the legislation of the past.  Their wrong&mdash;and it is a wrong&mdash;amounts to this, that their real position is that they were unable to secure any increase in their rent; that where they agreed with their tenants to pay an increase and did not go through the legal processes set out in the Act of 1920, namely, by means of a formal notice to quit, notice to increase rent, and so forth, the tenants subsequently discovered that such increases were not legally chargeable owing to the absence of notice to quit.</P>
    <P>Many tenants took advantage of that technicality and either went into court <Col N="1775" /> and recovered these increases from the landlords or took the other course of deducting them from the rent, sometimes paying no rent until the amount of the increase so paid was exhausted. These flaws in our legislation&mdash;first of all the flaw in the British Act of 1920, and then our failure to remedy that in our Act of 1923&mdash;have meant very serious loss to individuals, and the difference between myself and Deputy Good would only be this, namely, that whereas I recognise that fact and have very considerable sympathy with those individuals, I, unlike the Deputy, shrink from asking the Dáil to sponsor a piece of legislation which would reopen many hundreds of court judgments and reverse the processes of the court.</P>
    <P>Parliaments will fail from time to time to effect what they wish to effect in their legislation, and these errors will be discovered afterwards, sometimes perhaps soon afterwards, and sometimes, perhaps, not for many years afterwards, when the thing is tested in cases before the courts.  I do not think that it would be a sound precedent to set in our legislation here that, when errors of that kind are discovered, Parliament should proceed forthwith to strike back over that period, however long or short it may be, and deal with all the reactions of the original error.  It would be a question of degree. It would be justified only by the proportions of those reactions, and, when I speak of proportions, I must be taken as speaking of their proportions to the community at large, to the State fabric as a whole, rather than of their proportions to the individual.  I have been shown definitely in black and white that these flaws in legislation&mdash; the flaw in the 1920 Act, as passed by the British, and the flaw in our Act of 1923 in failing to cover that&mdash;have had the gravest financial consequences for individuals in Dublin and throughout the country.  It is in face of that knowledge and in face of any sympathy which I feel for individuals that I ask the Dáil not to pass Deputy Good's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must accept the state of affairs as indicated by the Minister.  It is not so very long <Col N="1776" /> ago since the Dáil pronounced on retrospective legislation.  At the same time I think that the Minister has really stated the case, not in any exaggerated form, as regards the hardship that has been placed on landlords.  Arising out of this measure, you will probably have a great outcry, as if certain people in the community were injured by the increase of rent.  It may be as well to recognise fully the whole implication of State interference in this matter of providing houses.  If there is any hardship so far as the tenants are concerned &mdash;or if it can be proved that there is any hardship&mdash;surely, on the other side of the question, one must recognise that there has been very great hardship inflicted on another section, and it is not out of place in connection with this amendment to emphasise the fact that a very grave injustice has been done, though not intentionally, in connection with the operations of the Rent Restrictions Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister makes no distinction between cases that have been decided by the courts and cases which have not been decided by the courts, but where the tenant has taken the law into his own hands.  I wonder can the Minister follow his argument to its logical conclusion? First of all, we must recognise that where the law decides certain cases, these must stand.  I question whether in justice the same argument would apply in connection with the withholding of rents.  If you recognise that it is only by a flaw in the Act that certain decisions were given by the court, surely you must base your objection to going back retrospectively on the fact that you do not desire to upset your legislation or the decisions that have already been given.  But is it equally necessary for you to legalise the action of the tenants who, without legal authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point was decided by the court and the action of the tenant in deducting these increases from his rent, whatever we may think of the decency or equity of it, was legal action, and what the Deputy is suggesting now is that we should retroactively make it illegal action to have done that because it was legal at the time.  The court, when the point was raised before them, so decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Decided that the tenant was entitled, without an appeal to the court at all, arbitrarily to take this money.  Is not that the case?  In other words, the basis of the whole thing lies in the notice to quit in the first place. The very fact that a landlord in a case did not give that notice to quit made him legally liable, because of that omission, to a deprivation of certain rights that he was granted under the Act. The tenant comes along and says by implication or by reference to other cases: &ldquo;I am entitled to withhold my rent, not the additions, but my whole rent, without going to the court.&rdquo; Surely the two things clash.  If by an omission on the part of the landlord, the tenant became entitled to refuse to pay something, by the reverse process, I suggest, the tenant cannot be entitled to take from the landlord without giving him what is the legal notice before taking action.  I think the cases are on a different level.  As far as the justice of the matter is concerned, the Minister does not dispute that.  I do not think anyone in the House will dispute the grave injustice&mdash;the legalised robbery, because that is what it practically amounts to&mdash;that has been done in these cases by the deliberate conspiracy of a large number of tenants. Let us be clear on this matter, that people have got privileged decisions in connection with the holding of a man's property for rent.  They have deliberately combined and incited one another to do something that they were legally entitled to do by a decision of <Col N="1778" /> the law, but which does not hold water in equity at all.  When we hear about landlords oppressing and all that sort of thing, it seems to me, in connection with a great deal of the administration of this Act, that the oppression has been on the other side.  The oppression has been very serious for a great many people.  They have not only lost control of their property but have had it abused, and there is no remedy against that.</P>

      <P>The Minister, I think, has made it clear to the House that, after all, the house-owners were not the great tyrants they were painted by certain Deputies.  I know the case of a widow who has suffered a good deal in connection with this matter. She has asked me to speak in support of this.  For two years she has received no rent simply because the tenants were friends of hers.  When she was entitled to an increase of rent she only served them with a notice to increase the rent.  As they were friends of hers, she did not like to serve them with notice to quit.  She did not think it was necessary to do so.  They have now taken advantage of her friendship and of her desire not to create a spirit of discord and, as I have stated, they have paid her no rent for the last two years but took advantage of this quibble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has explained what it would mean to go back on legislation for a number of years in connection with certain things that have been done.  I sympathise with all that. The point I want to make is that in my opinion all the blame is not on the one side.  The landlords are not all to blame, and the tenants themselves should face the facts and do the right thing in the right way.  It would be a great thing if there was a good spirit created between the landlords and tenants.  This Rent Restrictions Act has created a very bad feeling, indeed, between landlords and tenants, and it is now much more difficult for landlords to deal with their tenants than it was before the Rent Restrictions Act came into operation.  House-owners, <Col N="1779" /> in hundreds of cases, are suffering from serious grievances under this Act, and from my knowledge of them I say they are far greater than any the tenants have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very difficult matter, and I would despair of my competence to make it perfectly clear to the Dáil.  My desire is that, so far as it is possible, the Dáil should understand the position in outline. The British passed this Act of 1920 controlling houses.  They said: &ldquo;There is a scarcity, there is a shortage, and that shortage must not be exploited to the detriment of the community at large, to existing tenants or prospective tenants, and it is necessary to restrict the rise that there would otherwise be in the letting value of houses.&rdquo; The Act was a difficult, technical and complex one, but it did provide the machinery which was to be adopted by the landlord seeking an increase of rent from a tenant and any increase of rent from a tenant otherwise than under the Act was prohibited.  The Act took over charge of the relationship between tenant and landlord for the period of control, and it provided the forms and procedure governing their relations.  The notice to quit simply terminated the previous relationship and the previous tenancy, and the tenant entered on the new statutory tenancy created by the Act.</P>
      <P>You had this position; that some landlords and tenants, distrusting the law with that kind of distrust one meets amongst citizens in every country, said: &ldquo;They have passed an Act bearing on the matter of housing and the relationship between landlords and tenants, but you and I need not bother about that overmuch.&rdquo;  The landlord might say: &ldquo;I do not propose to increase the rent to any great extent, but you will recognise that some increase is reasonable having regard to altered conditions.&rdquo; and the tenant would agree, and there and then outside the machinery of the Act the two parties agreed upon a sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time passed and there arose those cases to which I have referred, under which it was decided that in any case where that happened the tenant, if he <Col N="1780" /> so chose, could have resort to the machinery of the courts and recover the increased, not the whole, rent which he had paid under any such agreement because of the failure to adopt the processes and the machinery of the Act, to serve a statutory notice to quit and to create a new tenancy.  Many tenants, through their associations and advisors, heard of that point and availed of it, and did, in fact, resort to legal processes to recover from landlords the increased rents on which they had agreed.  Other tenants did not&mdash;and here is where Deputy Hewat's point comes in&mdash;go to court and seek a positive refund of such increases, but deducted the increases from their rents.  I could not, and I do not believe anyone could, meet that second case without boldly facing retroactive legislation and ripping up the thousands of court judgments that have been delivered on this matter, because the man who went to court and sought to secure the positive refund, who set the machinery of the law in action to secure the recovery of monies he was entitled to, and the tenant who deducted the increased rent which he had paid from his payments to his landlord, from his pre-legislation rent, was legally entitled to do that.</P>
    <P>That was legal, and he knew it to be so, having seen the other judgments and their effect.  If he was doing anything which was not legal the landlord would no doubt very quickly bring him into litigation in the matter.  Both parties were availing of their legal rights, both the man who went to court to set the machinery working to get a refund of the increased rents he had paid, and the man who passively deducted these increased rents from his liabilities to his landlord.  The law was in their favour, and they took the full advantage of that.  You could not deal with the cases separately.  You could not try to deal with the case where the money was deducted or withheld and not deal with the case where the man had actually gone to court and compelled his landlord to make a refund.  I shrink from doing that.  I think it would be making bad worse.  A number of flaws may creep into legislation which may not be discovered <Col N="1781" /> for twenty or thirty years and then be discovered by a test case before the court, but the Dáil could not and should not attempt to deal with all the individual equities that might arise in that way.  It would be justified only by national considerations, and these considerations would need to exist in a large measure before Parliament would, in my view, act wisely in passing retroactive legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I know nothing about these cases except what I have heard in the course of this discussion, but there is general agreement apparently amongst those who have spoken that there is something like moral culpability on the part of these tenants who have claimed their legal rights, in one case by using the courts, and in the other case by using their power of deducting from the rent to the landlord.  Everything seems to turn upon the term &ldquo;agreement,&rdquo; where an agreement was entered into for an increase in rent.  I would like to know something about the nature of these agreements before I join in the general condemnation.  I rather imagine that what has happened is that the landlord comes along and says: &ldquo;Your rent from such and such a date will be so much of an increase,&rdquo; and because there has been no vacation of the house the tenant, believing he had no alternative, pays.  That is the kind of agreement that has probably been entered upon&mdash;a kind of &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; agreement&mdash;&ldquo;pay this increase or leave the house.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the case, and I suspect it is, I think there is no blame to be attached to the tenant for doing on his side what the landlord immediately sought to do when he got permission to increase the rentals.  When the landlord found that he was entitled to make certain increases under the last Act he made them, and then said to the tenant that he had no option but to pay, and the tenant having paid, that is deemed to be an agreement. If it could be said that it was an agreement, that all the facts were before the tenant, that he knew there was no obligation on him to pay this increase, and yet in face of that knowledge he <Col N="1782" /> said: &ldquo;I am prepared to pay,&rdquo; and afterwards took advantage of what is called a flaw in the Act, then there might be some charge reasonably levelled against him of indecency in the matter.  In the circumstances, I think no such charge can fairly be levelled, and in seeking the refund which he appears to have found out he could claim under the law he is only doing on his side what the landlord did on his side in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I only rose to put what I think is the other side of the case for these tenants.  I know nothing about any individual case or any groups of cases.  What knowledge I have I have deduced from statements I have heard made here, but I anticipate with a good deal of confidence that the kind of agreement in question was no agreement in any reasonable use of that word.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate the sympathetic manner in which the Minister <Col N="1783" /> has dealt with this proposed amendment. I must say that one could not propose an amendment of this character without foreseeing the difficulties that would arise under it, but seeing that these difficulties have been remedied on the other side one is justified in endeavouring to see that the same justice should be meted out to the house-owners on this side.  If the Minister has come to the conclusion&mdash;and I am sure he has weighed the matter very carefully&mdash;that it would be unwise to pass legislation of this retrospective character&mdash;and the Dáil has already expressed a very strong opinion on retrospective legislation&mdash;I think that some alteration is necessary in the Bill that is before us.  Sub-section (2) of Section 6 states: &ldquo;Nothing contained in the foregoing sub-section shall affect the right of the tenant.&rdquo; The following sub-section states: &ldquo;This section shall not entitle the landlord to recover.&rdquo;  So it appears to me that you are conferring under these two subsections a privilege on the one class that you are refusing to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that it is morally wrong, though it is not legally wrong, for these tenants to recover these moneys from the landlord. He pointed out then, on the other hand, that there are difficulties in giving power to the landlord to recover these moneys from the tenant.  That being so, why allow the tenant to continue to exercise what is admittedly wrong?  In other words, if these tenants have been stopping payment of rent in order to get repaid moneys that they held were wrongly recovered by the landlord, why will the State permit that state of affairs to continue?  I hold very strongly that if the Minister will not go as far as putting what is wrong right he certainly should prevent any continuance of what is admittedly wrong.  I think we are entitled to ask that the Minister shall consider between this and the Report Stage the insertion of some clause or clauses whereby there will be an end on the part of the tenant to continue to do what we all admit he is not entitled to do.  If he will not allow the landlord to recover, then stop <Col N="1784" /> the other side also from further plundering the landlord.</P>

      <P>I would like the case to be made quite clear that this proposal in the section does not affect cases where the landlord may have charged rentals over and above what is allowed under the existing Act; that is to say the permitted increase.  Both Deputy Lyons and Deputy Good seem to suggest that this section has something to do with cases where landlords have demanded and obtained rent over and above the permitted increase.  It is clear&mdash;I hope the Minister will confirm my statement&mdash;that sub-section 2 precludes any such case from the operations of the section.  That is to say: &ldquo;Nothing contained in the foregoing sub-section shall affect the rights of the tenant under paragraph C. of sub-section 1 of Section 7 of the Principal Act.&rdquo;  As regards the rights of the tenant under paragraph C to which Deputy Good referred, these are in respect of amounts collected which exceeded the standard rents by more than the amount permitted by this Act, so that there is no change in the law which allows a tenant to recover from the landlord moneys which have been wrongfully taken from the tenant, that <Col N="1785" /> is to say, moneys over and above the amount of the permitted increase.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Good will look up Section 7, sub-section (1) (c) of the Principal Act, he will realise there is nothing sinister in sub-section (2) of Section 6 of this Bill, because all we are doing is making it clear that nothing in sub-section (1) shall be held to impair the right of a tenant to recover increases that were over and above the increases permitted by the Act, but as regards this process of tenants striking back and saying: &ldquo;It is true we made an agreement but you did not serve a notice to quit to terminate my tenancy, and to create a new statutory tenancy and you must refund,&rdquo;&mdash;if this Bill becomes law, that cannot happen after the 4th May, 1926.

      <P>To insert before Section 8 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 16 of the Principal Act is hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The meaning of that amendment is that where a house is vacant for the purpose of carrying out alterations and repairs&mdash;for constructional purposes&mdash; whilst it is undergoing repairs or reconstruction it should be free of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 16 was inserted in the Act of 1923 to meet the position which, it was explained, existed on a fairly large scale in Dublin, of house-owners leaving their houses vacant rather than letting them, with probably the hope of effecting a sale. The Dáil considered it proper to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a dwelling-house to which this Act applies is empty or unoccupied the landlord of such dwelling-house shall be deemed to be the person in rateable occupation of the dwelling-house for the purposes of any enactment authorising the making, levying or recovering of any rate on or from an occupier thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was felt that in a time of acute housing shortage it was not a proper or a good thing socially that houses should be left vacant in that way-While <Col N="1789" /> we did not go the length of compelling the landlord to let, we said that at least we would discourage the practice of leaving houses empty by making the landlord liable for rates as the occupier would be if there were an occupier.  I am now asked to reconsider that and to agree to the deletion of the section.</P>
    <P>I would not accept the amendment as it stands.  I would be prepared to consider whether I could bring in on Report an amendment which would not relieve the landlord of the onus of Section 16 of the Principal Act of paying rates, but would enable the district court to remit rates where it was proved to the satisfaction of the court that a suitable tenant for the house could not, in fact, be found. That would leave the discretion to the court, and where it was clear it was not a case of deliberately leaving the house vacant, but rather a case of an absence of applicants for the house, then that penal clause&mdash;and I think it was definitely penal in character&mdash; would not apply.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the amendment to reject Section 16 and the idea underlying Section 16, but I would consider a mitigation of the rigours of Section 16, where it was shown that in fact the state of affairs which that section was intended to deal with did not exist. I could vest the discretion in the Summary Court to remit the rates, where it was satisfied there was no deliberate holding of the house vacant in the face of a great need and a great shortage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister, in formulating any proposal of that kind, to put some limit upon the price of the house as a selling proposition, or the rental of a house. Unless the Minister proposes to leave the determination of the value of the house, either for letting or for selling, to the court, there would be no possibility of proving the case that there was a deliberate withholding of the house from the market.  I think there is reason in the point made by the Deputy who moved the amendment, if the amendment were limited to relieving the landlord of a liability during the time the house was being reconstructed <Col N="1790" /> or repaired, if that reconstruction or repair was going on at an ordinary pace; but the amendment does not do anything of that kind.  It does not limit it at all.</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposal is worth a good deal of consideration with a view to preventing the owner of a house, which is, as you might say, outside the region of any present-day buyer or tenant, from holding it up.  There are certain houses that one sees up and down the country which are so big and expensive as to put them almost outside the reach of a tenant.  I think, perhaps, there is hardship there if the landlord has to pay the rates in full upon such a house.  I think there should not be an absolute remission, even in those cases, but I fear it would be difficult to put the discretion on the Justice unless one is able to provide a formula which would fix the price whether for selling or letting.  However, I hope the amendment will be defeated, and then we can discuss the further proposal on Report.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may take it that implicit in my statement as to the absence of a suitable tenant there is the idea of a suitable tenant within the range of the restricted rent. I recognise the amendment would need to be carefully drafted.  I think it would need to make provision not merely for the contingency of the absence of a suitable tenant within the zone of restricted rent, but also for the other portion of the house being under repair.  It would be for the court to satisfy itself that the repairs were, in fact, genuine and substantial, and of a nature which required the house to be vacant, and also that they were not unduly prolonged in operation.  We can, as the Deputy says, discuss that when the amendment comes up on Report. In the meantime, I think the Deputy ought to be willing to withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 25.  To insert before Section 12 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where on hearing of any action for the recovery of rent or possession, the Court considers it necessary or desirable to have the standard rent determined or any order made as provided for by Section 2 (1) (b), Section 2 (4) or Section 3 (3) of the Principal Act it shall proceed to determine the said rent or make the said Orders forthwith with any notice or application by any party to the said action, and whether any such notice or application shall or shall not already have been given or made by any party.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is intended to remedy an apparent oversight in the original Act. It has become a popular practice of tenants, where a landlord takes action either for rent due or for possession, to counter his action by instituting an application under the Rent Restrictions Act, 1923, Section 2 (1), paragraph (b), Section 2 (4) and Section 3 (3), to have the standard rent determined or the rent apportioned as between the use of the premises and the use of the furniture, or the rates of the whole premises, if only part is occupied by the tenant, apportioned as between that part and the remainder.  The effect of the tenant serving notice of such an application is that the court before whom the landlord's action for rent or possession comes refuses to consider the action until the application instituted <Col N="1792" /> by the tenant has been heard and decided.  Very great delay has been experienced in having these applications heard.  The tenant escapes scot-free and the rent is unpaid for a long period&mdash;so long in certain cases that when the application is decided and the landlord gets a decree for his rent the tenant has no money to pay.  This practice of the tenants instituting such applications has grown into an abuse, and in many cases the application is not a bona fide application on the tenant's part.  This amendment simply proposes that the hearing of the landlord's action and the tenant's application should take place at the same time.</P>

However it may be worded, the suggestion is that the notice or application made by the tenant should be considered at the same time as the application on the part of the landlord.  The amendment seems to require that such application to determine the rent shall be considered at the same time &ldquo;with any notice or application&rdquo; by the tenant. If the Deputy's speech was properly understood, that, I think, is the meaning of the amendment, because there is implicit in his statement the intention that the tenant's application and the landlord's application shall be heard at the same time.  If you take out the <Col N="1793" /> word &ldquo;with&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;without&rdquo; there would be no meaning in that.</P>

I can see the possibility that the landlord, being better advised in respect of the legal side, would be able to take advantage of the absence of time between one application and another, and the tenant's rights in that case ought to be safeguarded.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of sub-letting has been the subject of a good deal of consideration and our conclusions on this point are of a negative character.  I am aware that in connection with sub-letting there is a certain amount of abuse and a good deal of exploitation.  I would use the word &ldquo;profiteering&rdquo; except that I was never sure what the meaning of it was, and I never got a definition of it.  Unquestionably you have this anomaly, that a tenant who secures occupation of a house at a rent that is artificially restrictive, that is controlled and kept down by statute, in many cases proceeds to sub-let one or two rooms of that house at a rent sometimes twice as great as that which he himself is paying for the entire house.  It has been established beyond all question that that does exist.  But remember that the whole basis of this legislation is that there is an acute shortage of housing accommodation.  There would be no justification for this legislation otherwise.  Is it suggested that in face of such a situation, when admittedly there are not enough houses to provide adequate accommodation for our population in many areas, we should prohibit sub-letting, so as to say, if not &ldquo;one man one house&rdquo;&ldquo;one household <Col N="1795" /> one house,&rdquo; or &ldquo;one family one house&rdquo;?  That might have, if we were to do it here simply under the pressure and under the influence of what we know about the evils and abuses of sub-letting, very grave social reactions.  I am not disposed, in face of the acute house shortage, to prohibit by our legislation sub-letting.  That is the object of this amendment.  I think we might discuss with this amendment the question of sub-letting generally and the other suggestions that were made thereunder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with sub-letting, we have to distinguish between the sub-letting of a house as a whole and the sub-letting by a particular tenant of portion of the house of which he is in occupation.  The sub-letting of a house as a whole is covered by the 1923 Act.  Deputies interested will turn to Section 4, sub-section (1) of that Act.  The proviso after paragraph (e) of sub-section (1) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that nothing herein-before contained shall be construed to prejudice the right of the landlord to obtain an order or judgment against a tenant for the recovery of possession of any dwellinghouse or the ejectment of the tenant therefrom where such tenant has sub-let a dwellinghouse otherwise than for temporary convenience to a sub-tenant who, or any person deriving title under such sub-tenant, will be entitled to retain possession of the dwelling-house under this section notwithstanding such order or judgment against such tenant.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the sub-letting in-toto position. There is the problem then of partial <Col N="1796" /> sub-letting.  I think, if Deputies reflect on it, they will probably work round to my point of view, which is that it is probably insoluble.  On the one hand, as I have shown or suggested, it is scarcely the proper thing, and scarcely consistent with the whole conception underlying this legislation, to make sub-letting too difficult.  It might even be held that it is a good thing that a tenant should inconvenience himself to sub-let portion of his house to provide others with accommodation in face of the situation which we know to exist. There is a kind of theoretical solution suggested&mdash;that is, to create between the tenant and the sub-tenant an identical or analogous relationship to that which we have already created in our legislation between the house-owner and the tenant.  That would lead us into even greater difficulties and complexities than those which arise from house control as we now know and practise it.  It would involve some process of finding a standard rent for each portion of the house so sub-let&mdash;a task of very considerable difficulty.  I have not been able to find, either with my officials or with people interested in this matter, any solution for this sub-letting position that I could commend to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is one ingenious suggestion on the question of the exploitation which we know to exist.  It is this&mdash;that if there is to be exploitation, the owner of the house, the actual landlord, should be allowed to share in it fiftyfifty with the tenant who sub-lets.  I am asked to provide that it shall be incumbent on the tenant to give the fullest information to the landlord as to the rent which he is charging his sub-tenant and to share that in equal proportion with him.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the views of Deputies on that.  I would like to hear the views of Deputies more directly and personally acquainted with this whole housing problem than I am, as to the probability of my succeeding in effecting anything of the kind&mdash;that the tenant would say to the sub-tenant: &ldquo;I will have to charge you £10 per month for this room, and I am sorry I have to charge you so much because I am compelled to make a full disclosure <Col N="1797" /> to the landlord and to share half of that with him.&rdquo;  Suppose we were to provide anything of the kind, it would inevitably make for very much increased rents to these unfortunate sub-tenants, which would be justified by the tenants on the grounds that they had to charge high because they had to share with the landlords. That is one aspect.  Let us take another. Humanly speaking, is there any chance at all that there would be a straight deal between the tenant and landlord in a matter of that kind?  I think nearly every Deputy who reflects on the matter will come to the conclusion that what in fact would happen would be a conspiracy between the tenant and sub-tenant to defraud the landlord of what legally and technically would be his right.  Let us take the £10 a month position.  I ask you to picture a man saying to another man who is applying for a room in his house: &ldquo;I am sorry I have to charge you £10 a month, but then you know I have to hand over £5 of that to the landlord.&rdquo;  Well, clearly the sub-tenant who sees himself about to be fleeced in that manner would say: &ldquo;But what about the landlord?  I can pay you £6 and tell him I am paying you £3.&rdquo; I have the feeling that if we were to insert any provision of this kind in our legislation we would be simply courting defeat in practice and in its application in real life as distinct from the theories of legislation.  The more we examined the sub-letting problem the more we felt that in the face of all the anomalies, inequalities and exploitation which we know to centre around it, we would not do any real good by anything we could insert in our Bill bearing on it.  If there are Deputies who think otherwise, and who wish to urge their representations on the Dáil, I am prepared to give very full consideration to them.  But I have no solution myself, and the Committee which we set up prior to introducing our 1923 Bill found no solution either. I think that the position to-day is not markedly different from that which existed at the time when that Committee sat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that we have reached a crisis in connection <Col N="1798" /> with our housing proposals, in which it is incumbent on us to deal, and to deal effectively, as far as we can with some of the difficulties that have arisen. One of the blots, to my mind, on our present method of housing is the permitting, in the way we are permitting, sub-letting.  In this way we are really making the conditions in our new houses worse than the conditions of the tenement out of which we try to take these people.  We have had on many occasions discussions on this subject in the Dáil.  We have had case after case brought before us which showed that there were two factors at all events that ought to be dealt with in connection with this question of sub-letting. The first was that it produced undesirable overcrowding.  I quoted a case which came under my knowledge in which in one small five-roomed house there were four families living with twenty-seven children.  These are not things that go to improve our housing methods or our housing schemes. Let us try to get on the proper lines, and see that those lines are carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us to-day that he does not see how he is going to deal with this evil of sub-letting.  In fact, he has gone so far as to say that there is a necessity for permitting sub-letting owing to a shortage of houses. If we are satisfied that there is a necessity in the present circumstances for permitting sub-letting, then let us recognise that and deal with it.  If it is necessary, and to my mind it is necessary, we should control it.  We should put a limit on the extent to which sub-letting should be carried out.  The proposal, in the first amendment of the series of amendments that we are considering, is that sub-letting should only be allowed on the part of the tenant provided he has the consent of the landlord.  That means that sub-letting would be controlled.  It would be admitted and controlled.  If once we admit and control it, then it is up to us to take steps to regulate it.  That is the problem that is presented now in the amendments that we have before us, 27, 29 and 30.  Amendment 27 recognises that, first of all, it is necessary to admit sub-letting, and consequently that it is necessary to control <Col N="1799" /> it.  I think that is the principal thing in these amendments.  That being so, it appears to me that there is only the question of how best to regulate it.</P>
    <P>One of these proposals is that the landlord, after consenting to sub-let, should derive a benefit from sub-letting. The Minister seems to see some difficulty in carrying out a proposal of that character.  No doubt there would be cases of evasion, cases of collusion, but I think in the main that it would work satisfactorily.  The proposal is that where the consent is being given the landlord should get 50 per cent. of the income over and above the amount of the rent that the tenant pays.  I do not see any great difficulty in administering that.  In order that the matter might be made clear, it is incumbent on the tenant to make a return to the landlord.  Then it is set out that if the tenant wilfully makes an incorrect return he should be liable to penalty. That is exactly the procedure in the 1920 and 1923 Acts.  Under them the tenant has the right to call upon the landlord for certain particulars in connection with the regulation of the standard rent, and the landlord is bound to give the particulars.  If he gives incorrect particulars there are penalties attached.  That is how the standard rent is arrived at.  This amendment proposes in exactly the same way to regularise and to deal with the question of sub-letting, and it seems to me to be a practical method of doing so.</P>
    <P>If there are better methods I am quite willing to give way to them.  But this practice is obviously unfair.  Let me give you an example of a case that is typical of hundreds.  In a five-roomed house for which the tenant paid 12/6 a week rent he sub-let two rooms for 20/- and a third room for 9/-, and he and his family lived in the other two.  In other words, he derived a profit of 16/6 a week out of the house.  I do not think that will be supported by any Deputy as being a desirable condition of affairs from any point of view, and to my mind the proper line for us to take, as the Minister says that owing to the conditions that exist he cannot see his way to stop sub-letting, is to admit the principle and take steps to deal with it. <Col N="1800" /> That is exactly what the amendment proposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has admitted that he is aware that the practice of sub-letting has led to grave abuses.  It seems to me that his reply is not effective on two points. For one, I am not satisfied with his statement that sub-letting is a way of meeting the housing difficulty.  It may be to a limited extent, but I think it is very much more likely to lead, as it is doing in many cases, to what Deputy Good referred, a solution that is worse than no solution at all&mdash;overcrowding&mdash; and the principle of the amendment that I suggest is to attempt to control the sub-letting much more than to increase any receipts to the landlord.</P>
      <P>My amendment limits the amount of sub-letting and the amount of extortion that can be applied by the tenant to the sub-tenant.  If the principle of that amendment were adopted it would mean that if the sub-tenant were to receive more than a certain amount&mdash; I have no attachment to 50 per cent.&mdash; but some proportion of the amount he himself pays for the house, it would automatically remove the house from control, and therefore it would no longer be in the interests of the tenant to demand an extortionate rent from the sub-tenant, or to let too much of the house.  It would automatically prevent overcrowding and extortion. If there was any tendency towards overcrowding it would restore the house to the landlord, who would be responsible for the overcrowding and who would be entitled, because he is the owner and because his house would suffer from the overcrowding, to the extra receipts.  I think that overcrowding is no solution of the difficulty; it leads to worse evils than it cures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit, in reference to the other point made by the Minister, that the fact that this provision could be dodged and abused is no real reason for not inserting the amendment.  I do not think it is at all likely to be as much abused as the Minister thinks.  It would act as a very strong deterrent to any attempt to dodge it, because if an attempt to escape the force of it was <Col N="1801" /> discovered, the loss to the tenant would be serious.  He would lose his tenancy.  But even if it were so evaded in certain cases, I think it would be effective in many other cases, and it would be good for the two reasons I have stated, that it would have the effect of diminishing overcrowding, and&mdash;what we know is occurring in a great many cases&mdash;the undue raising of rents which these tenants demand from their sub-tenants, in order to make a profit to which they have no right, moral or legal, whatever.</P>

      <P>I accept absolutely the case given by Deputy Good of a tenant who pays a rent of 12/6 a week for his house, sub-lets two rooms of that house at 20/- a week and one other room at 9/-, and lives with his family in the remaining two rooms, making a profit on the house of 16/6 a week.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;in connection with sub-letting, and let us apply Deputy Good's remedy to it.  The fact is that that tenant is making a profit from the house which makes the teeth of the unfortunate house-owner water, and the house-owner asks the Dáil to let him in on that handsome profit, at any rate to the extent of 50 per cent. That is the proposal, and if we accept it I want to put it to you whether the occupants of these two rooms at £1 a week and of the other room at 9/- are likely to continue to enjoy, or not enjoy, as the case may be, that accommodation at the same price?  Deputy Thrift says that if we make this arrangement there will be no longer any inducement to the tenant to charge an exorbitant rent for the accommodation he sub-lets.  There would, of course, be an inducement to him to charge a much more exorbitant rent for such accommodation as he would sub-let, inasmuch as, if he dealt fairly and as we would wish, under our legislation, supposing we were to accept this amendment, he would be compelled to hand over 50 per cent. of the proceeds to the owner of the house.</P>

      <P>We do know, and it is borne in on us by the breezes from time to time, that in connection with house control, even as it exists, there is a great deal of evasion.  There is &ldquo;key money&rdquo; and a lot of other devices to evade the effects of the Act. You simply open up one vast field of evasion if you attempt to tackle this question of sub-letting.  Deputy Thrift wishes to create the position that a tenant's right of occupation lapses if he charges a sub-tenant more than a given fraction of what he himself pays.  But there will not be <i>uberrimae fide</i> in this matter.  A prospective sub-tenant seeking to get in out of the rain, wanting the accommodation, will come to terms with the tenant on the basis of concealment from the owner of the house of the sum actually paid.  If you say with Deputy Good that the landlord is to have half that sum whatever it is, then the inducement towards such concealment will be all the stronger. Even if you say with Deputy Thrift and reject Deputy Good's amendment, that the tenant's right of occupation shall lapse and the house revert to the landlord, if more than a given fraction of his rent is charged to a sub-tenant, you still have that inducement.  A contract would be made between the tenant and the sub-tenant, and the important clause in it would be concealed from the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find in the Department&mdash;it may not be so clear to Deputies&mdash;that there is such a thing as being too ambitious in legislation.  There are problems which baffle legislation.  You might legislate about them, but it is theoretical legislation, and in practice and by administration they prove insoluble. You might write into this Bill fine spun theoretical sections or sub-sections about the terrible things you are going to do to the man who sub-lets at more than a given fraction of his rent, or the serious penalties you are going to impose on the man who does not share <Col N="1803" /> 50-50 with the house-owner whatever he gets by way of sub-letting, but it will not work.  It may look well in the print of the Act but it will not operate.  That is my view about it.  If Deputies think otherwise they can vote otherwise.  This, and, for that matter, most of the amendments to this Bill do not really raise any issue of confidence, and it is a question on which each individual Deputy can exercise his judgment and vote accordingly.  I really do not approve of an attempt to tackle the sub-letting problem, such as it is, in this legislation.  First of all there is the straight-cut thing of prohibiting it. I think we would not be justified in prohibiting it, in face of the admitted shortage of houses, which is the very basis of this kind of legislation.  Then there is the other suggestion of making the tenant share with the landlord, thereby increasing the burden on the sub-tenant who, as we know, is already heavily burdened.  If you are going to say that the proceeds must be shared with the landlord, that there must be full disclosure, and fifty per cent. handed over to the landlord, then that is not legislation in the interests of the sub-tenant.</P>
    <P>If Deputies wish to legislate along the lines of Deputy Thrift's suggestion that no tenant shall be allowed to sub-let at more than some fixed fraction of his actual rent, and provided that he does so his own right of occupation shall lapse to the landlord, well and good.  My only comment on that is that I do not believe it will effect a substantial improvement in the position of existing or prospective sub-tenants.  I feel that it would be something that would be more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  But there is nothing to be said against it, I think, on its merits.  You might need to be careful as to the actual fraction you would fix, not to fix it too low lest, supposing by chance it were observed, it would not prove equivalent to prohibition of sub-letting, which I think would be socially bad.  If the fraction were a reasonable fraction, then there is very little to be said against that suggestion on its merits.  I have the feeling that it would be very largely broken, in fact and in practice, and that simply there <Col N="1804" /> would not be disclosures to the landlord, and consequently the tenant's right of occupation would not, in fact, lapse.  I dislike Deputy Good's suggestion to share the spoils with the owner of the house, because it would have very serious reactions on the people who are in that unfortunate position, that they have to try to get in somewhere and be sub-tenants.</P>

      <P>I did not think it was possible for the Minister for Justice to surprise me.  He surprised me twice this evening.  First of all he has enunciated a truth that it is possible to be too ambitious in legislation.  I knew that long ago, but I did not know that the Government did.  I recall many ambitious projects that were damped down on the Second Reading or later.  However, I welcome the late conversion.  The second surprise the Minister gave me was even more astonishing. He admitted that he was powerless to deal with an evil that is acknowledged on the Government benches, acknowledged by himself, acknowledged most forcibly by the President, and on every side&mdash;sub-letting. The Minister put before the Dáil the theory that though this evil exists, though it is unjust both to the sub-tenant and the landlord, it is impossible to deal with it by legislation.  As far as Deputy Good's amendment goes, I think I agree with him, but I do not agree with him so far as Deputy Thrift's amendment is concerned.  I think that would at least be something of a deterrent to sub-letting at exorbitant rents.  The Minister's general thesis was based on one supposition alone, that the head tenant and the sub-tenant would be in league together to delude the landlord and also the courts of justice.  I do not think that is accurate. Admittedly, the sub-tenant wants to get accommodation, and he also wants to get it as cheaply as he can.  I think that a provision such as that of Deputy Thrift would enable a sub-tenant to say, when he is making his bargain: &ldquo;You are asking me more than 50 per cent. of an increase on the rent you are paying, and as that is <Col N="1805" /> going to be an illegal bargain you ought to give me portion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am not tying myself to the figure. It is possible that 60 or 70 per cent. might, on examination, be paid, but I put it to the Minister that he has admitted this is an evil and admitted that Deputy Thrift's amendment, though it may not be fully practicable, might do something.  It is not absolutely impossible and I suggest that a partial remedy of the evil is better than no remedy at all. Though there may be evasion, though there may be a conspiracy to defeat the objects of the Oireachtas, it is much better to have a danger signal of this kind on the statute book which will be ineffectual in some cases.  Even in those cases it will, at any rate, tend to check extravagant profiteering.  It is much better to have that rather than throw up your hands as the Minister has thrown up his hands and say &ldquo;Sub-letting is an evil; it was denounced with great force by the President on Second Reading, but there is no possibility of dealing with it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That the profit rent should be divided by the house-owner and the landlord was not in the minds of the framers of the amendment.  It was really meant as a deterrent.  There is wholesale over-charging in sub-letting. We know lots of cases where a tenant gets as much for one room which he has sub-let as he is paying the landlord for the whole house.  I agree that what Deputy Thrift has mentioned is fair and reasonable.  If we could arrive at something where sub-letting would be in accordance with the rent as charged I would agree with that, but I think something is needed to stop this wholesale over-charging.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see any sense in amendment 29 at all, but there is some little sense in amendment 27.  I have one case in point.  A friend of mine, in a house composed of two storeys and a basement, occupies three rooms on top.  He pays £65 a year for those three rooms, and the man who occupies the other five or six rooms pays £60 for the whole house.  Let me put myself in my friend's position. What does it matter to me who gets my £65?  Am I going to inform the landlord, or compel the man from whom I have sub-let to inform the landlord, that he is charging me more than he is paying the owner?  It does not make it any easier for me to know that the house-owner is going to get some of that.  It is useless to me.  It would not be any incentive to me to insist that the provisions of this amendment should be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding amendment 27, the end of it says: &ldquo;The house shall cease to be subject to the provisions of the Act of 1920, of the Principal Act, and of this Act.&rdquo;  That would mean practically the same.  It would mean that the real owner of the house would be empowered to charge any rent he pleased and that rent would be based on the amount of money the immediate tenant was getting from his sub-tenant or sub-tenants.  If that amendment aimed at making the house cease to be subject to the provisions of the Principal Act and this Act in so far as the immediate tenant was concerned I could see some sense in it.  If it meant that the owner could get possession from <Col N="1807" /> the immediate tenant who was over-charging his sub-tenants, and if those sub-tenants could rent portion of the house at a rent in accordance with the Rent Restrictions Act, then there would be some sense in the amendment. I do not claim to be a Parliamentary draftsman, but, as the amendment is worded, it does not appear to me that that would be gained by it.</P>
    <P>I will give an instance about the difficulties of getting at people who are overcharging their sub-tenants.  I told my friend, of whom I have just spoken, that I thought he would be entitled to have a refund of the amount of money he was overcharged, because, if the house is subject to a standard rent, certainly a portion of it should be subject to a standard rent, less than the standard rent of the entire house.  If he is paying more, he is paying more than the law entitles a person to charge.  He told me that he might think of applying for a refund in another year when he gets another house, but if he attempted to do so now the remainder of his term in his present house would be a living hell, as the people would make it so hot for him the reduction in rent which he would get would not be worth the trouble which he would have to suffer by having to live with people with whom he fell out by demanding just treatment. As the amendment stands, I do not think that it is going to achieve what some of its more altruistic supporters aim at.  Of course, I do not include Deputy Good amongst them, as all he wants is to enable the house-owner to share the swag, and I am against anyone sharing the swag.  If it would be possible for the Minister to bring in an amendment on the next stage, whereby the amount overcharged would be taken from the immediate tenant who is dealing unjustly with his sub-tenants and whereby the sub-tenants would be entitled to continue their tenancy at the reduced rate, I would be in favour of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Nagle is wrong in his view as to how the amendment would work out in <Col N="1808" /> practice.  To my mind it would result in the case of the tenant which he has mentioned in reducing the rent of £65, as it would be too dangerous for the tenant to overcharge and so run the risk of losing his tenancy.  In practice a man would know that he was running a serious risk if he charged the sub-tenants more than 50 per cent. of his own rent, and it would prevent the extortionate sub-letting which is going on.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must not take me as having thrown up the sponge in the argument.  I do not think that he appreciates what I said A tenant would be afraid to charge £65 if he himself was paying only £60, as he would probably lose his house altogether.  In many cases it would mean that the sub-tenant would give to the tenant only 50 per cent. of the tenant's own rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has, I think, said that the position is so extraordinary that an Act of Parliament is not capable of putting it right.  I agree with him.  The only way to put it right is to abolish control.  In this case, the object of the amendment is to deal with the difficulty by legalising sub-letting.  I think one would want to be cautious about that.  I know a case in which a tenant in possession of a house purchased another house on his own, and his immediate proposition was that the landlord should pay him a certain sum for getting out of the house which he did not want.  That is another form of what is, more or less, a gigantic swindle on the part of tenants. Deputy Good wants to legalise sub-letting.  The Minister indicates that the situation is such that sub-letting and overcrowding are necessary at present.  That, I think, is an admission of a very grave state of affairs as regards a section of people who are supposed to own something at present which they do not in fact own.  On the basis of sub-letting, I think if the Minister, or the Dáil, accepted the amendments in principle, care would have to <Col N="1809" /> be taken so that some of the other evils of sub-letting would not be confined to houses where the tenant is in possession and makes use of the house for the purpose of extortionate sub-letting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing together amendments Nos. 26 to 30 inclusive, with the exception of No. 28, which has been withdrawn by Deputy Cooper.  Amendment No. 27, that of Deputy Thrift, is, to my mind, the only one that the Dáil might seriously consider. Deputy O'Connor describes amendment No. 29 as a deterrent.  I do not know what it is meant to deter. It is, in fact, meant to deter the tenant from keeping 50 per cent. of what he would get from his sub-tenant, and if it does not mean that it means nothing. My plea against that is not based on whether the landlord is not entitled to some of the proceeds of sub-letting. Without going into that, I oppose that amendment because it is calculated to make accommodation still dearer for sub-tenants and for prospective tenants. Deputy Hewat says that the whole question of sub-letting is a gigantic swindle.  We ought not throw big words like that about loosely, because what the tenant is doing is exploiting to the full, in an unrestricted way, the scarcity value of accommodation. Deputy Hewat is a staunch opponent of control by means of legislation or of any restriction of the letting value of houses.  Deputy Hewat ought just think it over and ask himself whether it is quite a consistent attitude, on the part of one who is against this whole principle of control, to say, at the same time, that it is a gigantic swindle on the part of the tenant to agree to use for himself and his family four rooms instead of six, and in regard to the other two, to exploit to the fullest extent the scarcity value of accommodation and the anxiety of his fellow humans to get in, so to speak, out of the rain.  I would like, if Deputy Thrift is agreeable, to consider further his amendment, No. 27, and in particular to give a little more consideration to the fraction.  It may be a good thing to write into the Bill that &ldquo;It shall not be lawful to sub-let at more than X per cent. of the total rent which <Col N="1810" /> you yourself pay.&rdquo;  It may have some little beneficial reactions, and, as Deputy Cooper is so emphatic that some benefit is better than none, we propose to consider inserting something of that kind.  As regards the remaining amendments, I am against 26 flatly.  Amendment 28 has been withdrawn, and I am opposed to 29.  Amendment 30 is supplementary, and merely provides the machinery for amendment 29.  The position is that I would like to consider amendment 27 further, but I am opposed to the others.</P>

All the arguments, explanations and illustrations that have been given in respect to this show how important it is to prevent the exploitation of this human need, and not to relax the control.  Deputy Hewat says that the remedy is to abolish control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect we are admitting in this discussion that such protection as is provided in the Act for that part of the dwelling-house which is sub-let, and which is deemed to be a dwelling-house, in view of the very intimate relations between the sub-tenant and the tenant, does not prove a sufficient protection, and that control does not exist in respect to those persons.  If decontrol were to <Col N="1811" /> come in respect to the house the same grievance that we are now dealing with as applying to the sub-tenants would apply to all the tenants.  It is, unfortunately, true that in many cases the people who have been induced and, in some cases, obliged by their circumstances to enter into possession of the new houses, even under comparatively advantageous terms, are, by the nature of their economic circumstances, obliged to sub-let.  Undoubtedly, in very many cases they have exploited the needs of their even less fortunate neighbours.</P>
      <P>When we are talking about sub-letting, I think we should take heed of the Minister's explanations that sub-letting is not inherently an evil in present circumstances.  Many persons have been obliged by their needs to take houses at rents very much higher than their circumstances would allow so as to get a habitation at all.  They have taken houses, and have offered to pay £50, £60, and £70 a year for them, with the knowledge that they would be able to sub-let a portion of them.  That is the only way they were able to satisfy their need for a house.  I think that probably some good would be achieved by a modification of Deputy Thrift's amendment.  I am not too hopeful that it will remedy the evil, but I think it may go some distance towards protecting the sub-tenant. It certainly will create, if it is of any value, a moral barrier against the action of the tenant in his exploitation of the sub-tenant.  I welcome the promise of the Minister to consider this proposal in the light of the discussion that has taken place.  Later we can discuss the form of the amendment with some hope that it will be acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point that I desire to draw attention to.  The Minister has undertaken to deal with one of the two serious evils that we have been discussing at some length.  The first is uncontrolled profiteering.  There is another evil which, to my mind, is even worse, and that is uncontrolled overcrowding.  No suggestion has been put forward to deal with that.  It is an appalling thing to see new houses, <Col N="1812" /> put up with the object of providing people with more decent surroundings than they had heretofore, and with more decent conditions than prevail in tenements, abused to such an extent that the conditions are much worse than they were in the tenements.  I admit it is not an easy problem to deal with.  Two factors that we dealt with in to-night's discussion were uncontrolled profiteering and uncontrolled overcrowding.  I think it would be very desirable if between now and the Report Stage the Minister would give some consideration to this problem of uncontrolled overcrowding as well as to the other one of uncontrolled profiteering.</P>

      <P>I think if this amendment were to be effective at all that it would have the effect intended of diminishing overcrowding.  At the same time, I think the course suggested by the Minister is the better one, particularly for the reason that the figure 50 was put down at random.  The Minister may have information at his disposal which will enable him to put a more considered figure before us.  I have no objection to the change suggested by Deputy Johnson.  Decontrol was suggested because the intention was to prevent undue sub-letting.  I am not attached to decontrol specifically. What was in my mind was that the tenant could see that he himself was running a definite and a real risk if he was sub-letting an unduly large part of his house, or if he was sub-letting it at an unduly extortionate rent. I am quite satisfied now to leave the matter with the Minister for his further consideration.</P>

If there were no notice to quit, and no notice of intention to increase the rent, then the old relationship existed.  In our 1923 Act we provided in the schedule the combined form of notice to quit and notice of intention to increase the rent, and as from the service of that notice a new statutory tenancy was created, and that would survive until the expiry of legislative control.</P>

      <P>I understand what the Deputy means is that he wishes to be satisfied regarding this process of recovery by tenants of agreed increases of rent where those increases were permitted increases under the Act but were invalidated by omission to serve the notice to quit, and he wants the agreed relationship contemplated by the Act to continue in the future.  Sub-section 1 is designed to draw the line as from the date of the introduction of this Act, the 4th May, and to say that after that date there shall be no more of it.  We are not going to rip up the <Col N="1815" /> many hundreds of court judgments that have been given on the point in order to compel tenants who passively recovered, by deductions, their rents to disgorge.  There cannot in future be a positive recovery through the machinery of the courts, nor the other process of deductions from rent after the 4th May.  Reading sub-section 1 of Section 2 through, that ought to be clear. If the Deputy will follow me reading it, leaving out unessentials, he will see that: Where the rent is reserved which does not exceed the standard rent, and the increase is permitted by the Act of 1920, or by the Principal Act as amended by this Act, the amount by which the rent so reserved shall exceed the standard rent shall, notwithstanding the fact that no valid effective statutory notice had been served on the tenant in conformity with certain sections and sub-sections, be deemed to be and always to have been a valid and permitted increase of rent, and not to be or ever to have been the sum irrecoverable from the tenant within the meaning of Section 12 of the Principal Act, or recoverable by the tenant within the meaning of Section 15 of the Principal Act.  The Deputy may take my assurance that the effect of that sub-section is that after the 4th May, 1926, there can be no more of that, either positive recovery through legal processes of increases of rent paid by the tenant to the landlord, or the other process of deductions by the tenant from his rent of such increases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE (Minister for Local Government and Public Health) Mr. BURKE (Minister for Local Government and Public Health)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE (Minister for Local Government and Public Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Stage of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Bill, 1926.  This Bill goes a long way towards carrying into effect the ideal cherished by the founder of the Sinn Fein movement, our late President, namely, the establishment of a national service which should be recruited on the principle of merit alone.  That principle has already been adopted so far as the Central Service is concerned, and those of us who have had some experience in administering Departments are aware of the fact that it has been very helpful.  I believe if the Ministers of Departments at the present time had any large patronage at their disposal their position would be made almost intolerable. Even as it is, occasionally we have requests from people throughout the country who do not understand that we have divested ourselves of every shred of patronage, and from the embarrassments and annoyance caused by those few individuals we can readily understand how impossible our position could be made if all the patronage of our Departments rested in our hands.  What holds good with regard to the Central Service probably is equally true of local services.</P>
      <P>Charges of nepotism and corruption have occasionally been made against local authorities.  We are, unfortunately, in the position where we are able to confirm those charges, and while I do not say that either corruption or nepotism is carried out on any great scale in appointments made by local authorities, at the present time, yet there is some foundation for the statement. But even if there were no foundation for such a statement, it is undoubtedly true that the best representatives of local authorities object very much to the continual canvassing that goes on with regard to appointments by local authorities, and they would be very glad, as we are glad, to be divested of all patronage with regard to those appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, as I say, goes a considerable length in divesting local authorities <Col N="1817" /> of this patronage.  It is a rather urgent matter for one reason, namely, one class of officer who will come under this Bill is the county medical officer of health.  They will be very responsible officers, in fact, key men in the counties where they are appointed, as all the health services, both curative and preventative, will be under their control.  The selection of those officers will be a very difficult matter, and I would not care to leave the responsibility of their selection solely to local authorities.  Until this Bill is passed through the Dáil you will have no machinery for ensuring that the proper men are selected for these positions, and until these officers are selected there are various health services in the country that we are anxious to see established which cannot be established, as there is no machinery by which they can be provided.  That is an urgent reason why this Bill should not be delayed in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is not intended to bring all classes of officer or employees within the scope of this Bill.  At the start it only applies to these county medical officers and to the chief executive officers of local authorities, and to officers who require various professional qualifications. The Bill can, afterwards, be applied by Order to other classes of officers.  But until we have the machinery set up, until we see how the Act works, we do not consider it advisable to apply the Act too generally. Local authorities are still left a considerable amount of control in this matter.  They may promote existing officers who are doing duties similar to those which they would be required to do in the offices in which the vacancies exist.  They may, also, appoint pensioners who were previously performing similar duties under local authorities. The local authorities will be given two months within which they can make those promotions or appoint those pensioners with the consent of the Minister.  If they do not make the appointments, it will be open to the Minister to request the Commissioners set up under this Bill to select or nominate either one or more persons to fill the vacancy.  The qualifications as regards character, age, health and sex <Col N="1818" />&mdash;sex where the Commissioners think it necessary&mdash;will be decided by the Commissioners, at the request of the Ministry.  If there are other qualifications necessary, for instance, if it is necessary that the officers should be qualified medical practitioners, those qualifications shall also be prescribed by the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>As a general rule candidates will be selected by open competitive examination, but it is obvious that cases will occasionally arise in which this system cannot be adhered to.  That is probably true in the case of those county medical officers.  Mere theoretical qualifications are of very little use when it comes to testing the qualities needed for responsible positions of this kind.  A young and inexperienced student from one of the universities might do very much better in an examination than a highly qualified and experienced practitioner, who had become rather rusty on the usual subjects required in examination tests of this kind.  Accordingly, some other system, probably a selection board, will be adopted by the Commissioners in those cases.  If there happens to be an officer of a local authority whom the Minister considers would be a suitable candidate for the post, and he is not nominated by the local authority, it will be open to the Minister to recommend him to the Commissioners, and if they consider him a suitable person they can appoint him.</P>
    <P>Section 12, which gives the Minister for Local Government certain control over officers appointed by local authorities, is already enforced under the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act.  In that case these powers are only given by reference.  It is considered advisable, in this Act, to give them direct.  Section 13 gives the Minister power to suspend an officer. The same power is given to local authorities while any charge against him is being investigated.  One of the difficulties I find in administration, at the present time, is that it is very hard to deal with an officer against whom there is any charge pending.  It is a very drastic step to dismiss such an officer.  Yet that is the only course open.  Under this provision an officer <Col N="1819" /> can be suspended, say, if there is a charge of falsification of accounts or anything of that kind, or that it might be a danger to the finances of the authority to leave that officer in charge during any long period.  It is very advisable that we should have power to suspend him while any charge against him is being investigated.  If the charge proves to be without foundation he can be re-instated.  If, on the other hand, the charge is substantiated he is deprived of any opportunity to do any further injury to the finances of the local authority while the investigation is going on.  Provision is made for payment, first out of the Central Fund and afterwards through recoupment to that fund by the local authorities as in the case of the Combined Purchasing Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further to say in this matter.  While the original Local Government Bill was going through the Dáil and through the Seanad, there seemed to be almost unanimous approval for the principle of this Bill.  Accordingly, I do not anticipate that it will meet with much opposition going through either House.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the Bill, and I do so for very definite reasons.  There is scarcely, I suppose, any Deputy representing a country district who is not brought into very close contact with these things which the Bill deals with and who finds it humanly impossible, so far as he is concerned, to take any action or to take any decision upon it in his own mind whether the thing is right or wrong. The Minister has put up this Bill which I have gone very carefully into, and I have the greatest pleasure in supporting it from the point of view of Deputies from the country and, I think, in the interests of the State.</P>

      <P>I think the Dáil will agree that this measure is revolutionary. While I say that, I am going to agree on the other hand that there is quite a good deal of good in it.  I am not prepared to say, though, that, as the Bill stands, I believe it should be accepted by the Dáil and supported in every line.  At this hour of the evening I will be as brief as I can.  I <Col N="1820" /> will just quote two sections in it that really determine what is to be done under the Bill if it becomes an Act. Section 2 gives the Minister power to make every appointment that is to be made under any authority.  The Minister points out that at the present stage the intention is to make the appointment of a Chief Executive Officer and the appointment of the County Medical Officer of Health, but the section also says &ldquo;to fill such other offices and employments under a local authority as the Minister shall from time to time, with the concurrence of the Commissioners, declare to be offices to which this Act applies.&rdquo;  That means every rate collector, every dispensary doctor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Every employee of a local authority can be appointed by the Minister.  Section 6, of course, determines that the Minister and the Commissioners will finally determine the individual who is to fill any of these posts.  We have to ask ourselves whether the conditions in the country in the matter of local administration are such at the present time as to demand that all authority and all power for the making of every appointment should be vested in the Minister, through the Civil Service Commission, and entirely taken out of the hands of the local authority.  I am not in agreement with the Minister when he says that the best representatives on the local authorities would be anxious to be divested of the responsibility of making such appointments. I think the Minister will find that good, honest and capable representatives will take very strong exception to the Bill and to the Ministry or to the Dáil that will take from them every vestige of authority in determining what official is to carry out work under their supervision or their management in the future, in their counties.  If the Dáil agrees to pass this measure and gives it its full support as it stands, undoubtedly on the part of many representatives here from the rural districts, it would be a vote of no confidence in the Councils and Boards of Health that have been recently elected.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>A recommendation to be ratified by the Minister.  The local authorities will not have one word or one voice in that.  I suggest seriously that you will have many well-meaning representatives down the country saying that if they are not capable of playing any part whatever in the making of appointments under their respective bodies, they are not capable to sit or act or to take part in the administrative work of that body at all, and I think with a good deal of justification.  It is difficult to see how local authorities are going to get loyal work from officials over whom, to a certain extent at least, they will have not much control, inasmuch as they are not responsible for making <Col N="1822" /> their appointments.  It will take from their authority to some extent for the work of these offices, take from the authority of the local bodies, and I do not think it will make for efficiency. How is the Commission to make a recommendation in the case of every rate collector that is to be appointed and every doctor for a dispensary, where you get a young man or a young woman coming out with equal qualifications? It is going to be an extraordinarily difficult thing.</P>
      <P>How the Commissioners could make a recommendation in regard to one candidate, who would be selected from a dozen possessing equal qualifications, is more than I can see.  I think the Minister is asking for too much when he seeks authority to determine that all offices should come within the scope of this measure; by that I mean the filling of all offices under local authorities. It seems to me that the case the Minister refers to in connection with the appointment of a county medical officer of health is a case undoubtedly where men with a capacity to judge should be called upon to pass judgment on the ability of candidates who are to fill this very important post.  Is it not possible that in the making of that important appointment you may have in every county two or three individuals with equal qualifications?  Under such conditions, would it not be more advisable for the Minister to say that the Civil Service Commission would hold examinations, make recommendations, and these recommendations would be laid before the local authority in each case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephODoherty" hpid="Mr. O'DOHERTY Mr. O'DOHERTY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DOHERTY</NameTxt>
      <P>No, certainly not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be more advisable to lay the recommendations in their order of merit before the local authorities?  The capacity of the individual to pass a qualifying examination up to a certain standard that would be determined by the Commission would then be apparent.  I feel that, however difficult an examination may be, you will have in the case of every appointment more than one applicant qualifying. It seems to me that from the point of view of efficiency in local administration, from the point of view of <Col N="1823" /> justice to the local authority, and from the point of view of ensuring that the local authority would have a real interest in its work and would have some responsibility for the making of the appointment, it would be more advisable if the names of two or three of the successful candidates were submitted to the local authority with indications of how they fared at the examination, and it would then be the duty of the local authority to make a selection.  It would be their duty to appoint one of the candidates who had qualified.  The final sanction to the appointment would then come from the Minister.  Under such circumstances the Minister would secure what he seeks under the Bill and he would not take away the power to appoint from the local authority. He would give them an interest in local administration and they would feel they had some share of responsibility in seeing that local officers do their work.</P>
      <P>If the Minister desires members of county councils, boards of health and other local bodies to have a proper appreciation of the responsibilities of their position&mdash;I observe that Deputy O'Doherty shakes his head at that&mdash;he must show he has some trust in them. If you do not want to create more suspicion and lay yourselves open to further charges such as are being suggested&mdash;not with very much foundation&mdash;to the effect that a central authority will make all appointments and that powers are to be taken from the local authorities, you will adopt some such course as I suggest.  Suggestions are made that the Government are moving towards this idea of centralisation.  It is suggested there is an attempt to create a spirit in the country whereby every responsible citizen will feel that his position as a member of a public board is of such a character that it is scarcely advisable for him to attend meetings because of the distrust and suspicion existing in regard to every man&mdash;distrust of his ability honestly to discharge his duty. Responsible citizens will feel that by attending meetings they only become tainted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wants to inculcate <Col N="1824" /> the spirit in the country that we all desire to see, he must put men in the position of feeling they have responsibilities. The Minister must not take from local authorities every vestige of power they have enjoyed up to the present.  I agree that in some places they did find enjoyment in this power, and perhaps a little profit, too.  These cases, I hold, are very few.  After all, the work of our local bodies has been such up to the present that, while there were grounds for complaint in the past, we have no guarantee that the methods the Minister seeks to employ to change things are going to give us such perfection in future as will satisfy us that it is the right course to adopt and that we should support him wholly and entirely.</P>
    <P>I believe appointments should be made after open competition.  The best possible individuals should be selected to fill every post that becomes vacant. In the making of these appointments everything should be fair and above board, and it is the Minister's duty to do whatever he thinks necessary to secure that.  I suggest that the Minister should not act unwisely by rushing too far, and I believe he is asking under this measure for more than the Dáil would be wise in conceding. Beyond question, very violent opposition will be taken to this by every local authority in existence in the country.  I feel the measure indicates want of confidence in local authorities that were brought into existence at the last election.  While I am prepared to support the underlying principle, I am not prepared to support the measure as it stands, and unless the Minister agrees that what I have pointed out will be open to consideration, I cannot see my way to vote for it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite true.  The Executive Council appoints the Commissioners, who may be civil servants. <Col N="1826" /> The Executive Council appoints the Commissioners who are to act from time to time, and they may be officials of the Department.  Possibly and likely one of them would be an official of the Department of Local Government, and possibly one of them would be an official of the Department of Agriculture, and they will recommend the appointment of local officers dealing with matters under the supervision of those particular Departments.  But it is the Ministry concerned that will have the appointment.  Let us bear that in mind.  Under Section 10 it will be possible&mdash;I say possible, I am not suggesting the Minister is capable of it&mdash;for the Minister to secure the appointment to any office of any reasonably qualified person, at present in local service, or on pension from a local service, otherwise than by way of promotion, and this, without any consideration of any other candidate whatsoever.  There is not even the shadow of a promise of the establishment of a municipal Civil Service in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were proposing to establish a municipal Civil Service we would have competitive examinations for people to enter into grades or classes from which there would be appointments, and through which there would be promotions. That is not suggested in the Bill. Every appointment is to be the subject of a separate examination.  The Minister will indicate the appointments and the qualifications, and may recommend that a particular person shall be considered by the Commissioners, and having the qualifications before them that are required by the Minister, and having the particular person named by the Minister, the Commissioners will be able to say whether or not this person recommended fits in with the qualifications, and will indicate to the Minister whether the person would suit the qualifications and then the Minister makes his appointment.  If that is not patronage, if that does not open the way to nepotism, I do not know what the meaning of the word is.  You must bear that in mind in relation to Section 2, which as Deputy Baxter pointed out, leaves it within the power of the Minister to determine what offices, from the highest to the lowest employee of the local authority, shall come within the <Col N="1827" /> provisions of this method of appointment. Every office, under any local authority in the country, under this Bill, can have appointments made to it by the Minister, provided that the Local Appointment Commissioners do not turn down absolutely that person as unfit.</P>

      <P>&mdash;and that no longer can the administration of this country be carried on by elected authorities.  If the Minister would come forward and say that he would be saying what appears to be in his mind and the Dáil would know where it is being steadily led to.  We have had a succession of measures all tending in the same direction, but this is the climax.  Because here he says the central authority&mdash; authority over the municipal administration of the country&mdash;shall determine not merely what is to be done, but it shall see that it is done and, in fact, all responsibility is taken away from the local authority.</P>
      <P>Now, I want to make quite clear that we are in favour of ensuring that candidates for any office shall be qualified for their posts, and we desire, in every possible way, to prevent any kind of canvassing or pressure, from one side or another, upon local representatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have it to say I never had occasion to be canvassed, and I never made any recommendation for any office, either major or minor.  The suggestion of Deputy Baxter that professional appointments would have to be by competitive examination, is a suggestion that I think is not practicable. I think that the method of examining <Col N="1828" /> qualifications and forming a panel of qualified persons for classes of appointments is quite satisfactory, and from that panel recommendations could be made by a body such as these Local Appointment Commissioners or Civil Service Committee, or whatever body may be set up.  But I think that that Commission should not make a recommendation to the Minister.</P>
      <P>If there are three men selected, as Deputy Baxter has suggested, from qualified men as suitable for a particular appointment, that recommendation should go to the local authority, and the local authority should be given some responsibility in the making of the appointment.  I say that the plan of the Bill does not even promise to set up a municipal Civil Service.  The alteration that it makes in the present system is a transfer of patronage&mdash;but I will leave out that word&mdash;and I will say transfer of the power of appointment to any individual office, from the local authority to the Minister acting on the advice of the Commissioners, such advice to be possibly so manoeuvred as to retain the power in the hands of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Now that is not the establishment of a municipal Civil Service by any means. And first I want to emphasise this: that every appointment is to be the subject of a separate examination.  I wonder does anybody think of that as appertaining at all to a municipal Civil Service?  Every promotion, or promotion from one office under one authority to the same office under another authority, is liable to be treated in the same manner.  We are not creating a Civil Service from which there will be appointments and promotions and the ensuring of an urge towards efficiency because of the possibilities of that promotion, and all the promises of the Minister regarding the establishment of a Civil Service for municipal affairs are entirely baseless.  But there is this further fault in the Bill.  While Section 8 provides for competitive examination as a means of selection for each particular post&mdash;not for so many vacancies &mdash;there are so many possibilities of exceptions under Section 9 as to make the assurance of a competitive examination very small indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1829" /> Of course we shall be told that what is in the Minister's mind in this matter is that the only exceptions he proposes to make are for those professional appointments for which competitive examinations are not satisfactory.  That is to say, the qualifications needed by a professional man in the beginning shall be deemed to be sufficient to place him upon the panel apart from his experience in the particular work for which he is required.  But under Section 9 the Minister may make all kinds of exceptions.  There is really no assurance that the system of competitive examination shall be maintained for all minor offices apart from professional offices.  There is no assurance of that whatever.  Then again we have under Section 12 (1):</P>
    <P>The Minister shall have power with respect to all persons now employed or hereafter to be employed by any local authority in any office to which this Act applies to define and prescribe the duties of such persons and the places or limits within which these duties are to be performed, and to determine the continuance of such persons in or the removal of such persons from their offices, and to regulate from time to time the remuneration payable to such officers and the mode of payment thereof.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All persons now employed or hereafter to be employed.&rdquo;  I think that it is that section that the Minister indicated when he said by reference that the power is at present in his hands. We have explicit here what was secured by reference in an Act having regard to particular circumstances. It is now made clear to the Dáil and to the country that the Minister can determine the retention of office, the pay for the office, and the duties of every municipal employee.  It is an extraordinary power to leave in the hands of the Minister and to extend.</P>
    <P>Why does not the Minister come forward frankly and tell us what is in his mind is that all local authorities should be abolished, and that these bodies should be run by a Commissioner appointed by him?  Let us note the final proposal of this Bill.  All the appointments are to be made by the Minister. In respect to every appointment there <Col N="1830" /> is to be a special examination, and whatever deficit there may be as between the cost of the examination and the fees obtained is to be charged upon the local authority.  Local authorities are deprived of all responsibility and all powers.  The Minister makes regulations regarding the fees, regarding the examination, the qualifications for the office, the mode of examination, the conduct of the examination and everything connected with it.  He may make a profit if he can.  I do not know what becomes of the profit.  I do not know whether that is intended to be divided between the local authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is moving very rapidly in the direction of making membership of a local authority so mean and petty an office as only to attract the meanest and the pettiest minds in the country.  Local authorities are going to be so hedged round by regulations, so much deprived of responsible authority, that only the poorest types in the country will consent to act upon those authorities.  If the Minister thinks that that is going to improve local administration, I think he is making a very grave mistake.  It would be better for him frankly to tell the Dáil that he is desirous of wiping out the local elected authorities.  The Bill, to my mind, is going, if it is passed, to make much more difficult the establishment of a real municipal civil service, is going to make more difficult the attracting to local administrative work the types of people we would hope through the municipal civil service to have placed in that service.  I hope the Dáil will, even if it passes the Second Reading, make such radical amendments to the Bill as would make it unrecognisable by its parent.</P>

      <P>It is quite evident from the remarks that have fallen from the Farmers' Benches and from the Labour Benches that this Bill is <Col N="1831" /> not going to have a very easy passage through the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I admit that I think changes will be necessary in the Bill, but I am prepared to accept it for whatever good is in it.  During the passage of the Local Government Bill I stated that if the appointments of these new county medical officers of health were to be appointments of incompetent men which would simply put increased payments on local authorities, I would prefer to tear the Bill up and trample it under my feet. In other words, unless we were going to get real, good, energetic, conscientious, capable, well-educated men to fill those posts I think the Bill would better not be passed.  That, at all events, was my opinion and I still adhere to it.  If this Bill is going to give us an opportunity of having thoroughly good men appointed to these posts, then I will support it in the heartiest manner.</P>
      <P>I have, perhaps, as great knowledge of competitive examinations as anyone in the Dáil, and I say quite frankly that competitive examinations are not always the be-all and the end-all in getting the best men.  That is clear to everyone, but, on the other hand, I would not leave it to the local authority to be the judge as to the capacity, training and qualification of professional men, which qualifications they themselves know nothing of.  If you would put on me the selection of a farmer to do certain work I would consider that I would be out of place altogether. I would not be able to tell you whether a farmer was good or whether he was a bad farmer, nor could I tell with regard to most matters in connection with a labourer's work.  Therefore I hold that a lay body is not competent to judge the qualifications possessed by a medical man who is up for one of those important posts, and wherever this Bill can be shown to give us for particular posts the men best qualified for them, then I will support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that Deputy Baxter's case is a good one, that there are certain <Col N="1832" /> appointments that should be made by local authorities.  I admit that.  But the Minister perhaps overstepped the mark a little when he suggested that he was divesting himself of all patronage, when, as Deputy Johnson has pointed out, under Clause 10 he is still keeping a considerable amount of patronage.  Deputy Baxter has also been frank in saying that they want the best men appointed.  They want perfection.  But there is no perfection. At all events, if there is no perfection going, still, we should make an attempt to frame our regulations so that we should get the best men.  Deputy Johnson has pointed out that there must be considerable trouble in holding a special examination for each special case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>He may be wrong, but that is the statement which he has made.  Here is a statement which I am unable to translate.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Whenever the Minister requests the Commissioners to recommend a person for appointment to an office to which this Act applies and the Commissioners with the concurrence of the Minister are of opinion that, having regard to the nature of the duties of that office, the knowledge and experience necessary for the efficient performance of those duties, and the qualifications prescribed under this Act for that office, the person or persons to be recommended for appointment to that office cannot be satisfactorily selected by competitive examination, the Commissioners may dispense with the competitive examination required by this Act and may select the person or persons to be recommended by them to the Minister by such means and in such manner as they think proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I think I have a very fair knowledge <Col N="1833" /> of the English language, but I cannot find any meaning in that.  It is quite possible that the Minister might by giving a case illustrate what was in the mind of the person who drafted that section.  But what that was I do not think any man reading it over would make out.</P>

      <P>Even the farmers, with all their ability, could scarcely analyse this sentence.  Now again I repeat that the most insistent matter to be dealt with at the present moment is the appointment of these <Col N="1834" /> county medical officers of health, because their non-appointment is holding up the sanitation of the country.  One of the first speeches I made in the Dáil was in reference to the woeful sanitary condition of the country.  I merely wish to say that I hope the Bill will be amended if amendments can be moved that will improve it.  On the other hand, I am anxious to support the Bill in every direction which seems to make for the appointment of the best men that can be got.</P>
