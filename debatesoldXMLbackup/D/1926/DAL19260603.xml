      <P>The Parliamentary programme approved for the present session does not provide for the discussion of legislation affecting town tenants other than the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Bill, 1926.  Having regard to the amount of business to be dealt with before the Summer Recess, I cannot undertake to give Government time for the discussion of a measure introduced by a private Deputy.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister hold out any hope that there will be such a Bill?  In view of the fact that the recent Rent Bill places a certain number of shopkeepers who have residences over their shops in a much worse position than they were in prior to that, will he not consider the advisability of getting them some safeguards?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has received from the Secretary, Dublin Metropolitan Police Pre-War Pensioners' Association, a resolution protesting against the action of the British and Saorstát Governments in depriving them of the benefits of the Pensions Increase Act, 1924, which have been granted to all other pre-war British pensioners, including the R.I.C., the Postal Service, Prison Service, etc., and if he intends to take any action in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received from the Secretary, Dublin Metropolitan Police Pre-War Pensioners' Association, the resolution referred to by the Deputy in the first part of his question. As the cost of any increases granted by the British Government under their Pensions Increase Act, 1924, to pre-war British pensioners is borne entirely by British Funds, I regret I cannot, as suggested by the Deputy, take action to ensure that the pre-war D.M.P. pensioners will receive an increase.  The pensioners themselves are, of course, free to make any representations they may desire direct to the British Government.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this estate was held by this man's father and two brothers, that they were evicted in 1881, the time that the celebrated Land Act was introduced, that the lease fell in, I think, just before the Land Act was passed, and that the landlord put on £10 an acre on this holding of 80 acres, which, as they were not able to pay, they were evicted?  They were most deserving people, and this man is the representative of these people, the others having given up their claims to him.

    <P>Question proposed&mdash;&ldquo;That the Finance Bill, 1926, be read a second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="271" />
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill follows very closely the Budget statement and the Financial Resolutions which were adopted.  Certain remissions of taxation are provided for in the Bill which were not mentioned in the Budget statement.  They are of a minor character.  In Section 12 there is an exemption from the duty of the non-textile parts of certain wearing apparel. That remission has been given because it is believed that it will lead to an increase of manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister deal with that in a little more detail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave that to the Deputy.  In Section 14 we exempt caramel from the confectionery duty. Caramel was included in the list of articles of confectionery by mistake; it was confused with what are called caramels.  It is, in fact, a preparation of burnt sugar, which is used for colouring purposes.  I think it is used for colouring whiskey, but in any case it is not a confectionery preparation, and it is exempted.  We are specially exempting washing-soda and other preparations from the duty to which soap substitutes are liable.  Sometimes washing-soda is imported as a soap substitute, but it is also imported for other purposes which have no relation to that, and difficulties arose in a few cases.  In Section 16 we are providing for the exemption of what are really foods, where they are required by dietetic patients.  They frequently contain a small proportion of saccharin, and if they are charged the duty it means that the minimum of half-a-crown duty has to be charged on each parcel.  Only a small quantity of these preparations can be imported, because they do not keep, and it is felt that no money is involved and that it is desirable that a certain hardship should be mitigated or removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the next section we provide for the bottling of spirits in bond in bottles smaller than a pint.  Previously whiskey bottled in bond had to be put into quart or pint bottles.  The firm which bottles &ldquo;Baby Powers&rdquo; has been applying for a long time for permission to bottle in bond, and other firms have recently joined in the application, <Col N="272" /> and it was felt that the concession might be given.  It will entail a small additional cost for the provision of extra supervision, but the cost will be quite immaterial.  Then, in Sections 30 to 34 we are providing for bringing the Excess Profits duty to an end.  The collection of Excess Profits duty and claims for repayment of the duty have practically ceased, and it is felt that it is desirable, with provisions for certain last-moment claims, that the regulations for the duty should be repealed.  There are a number of minor provisions in the Bill to which I do not think I need refer until the Committee Stage.  Deputies will notice that the Bill contains no reference to the Tariff Commission. Naturally, the setting up of a Tariff Commission such as we contemplate, would not come within the scope of a Money Bill.  A separate Bill is being prepared providing for the setting up of a Tariff Commission.</P>
    <P>There are certain new changes in the Bill which were not provided for in the Financial Resolutions.  The principal of them are those charges which I may class together as the betting taxes.  It had been originally intended that the entire legislation to be proposed to the Dáil in relation to betting should be put in a separate Bill.  It was later thought, however, that the definitely taxing provisions ought not to be included with other provisions, and accordingly it seemed desirable that the taxing provisions in relation to betting should be inserted in the Finance Bill.  There will be a separate betting Bill which will provide for the legalisation of betting, the regulation of the conditions on which licences to carry on business as a bookmaker and the licensing of premises in which bookmaking may be carried on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In using the term &ldquo;legalisation of betting,&rdquo; the Minister is not going back on his original suggestion about the irrecoverability of betting debts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the legalisation of betting mean giving power to the bookmaker to recover debts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I was coming <Col N="273" /> to that.  As a matter of fact, I have been in communication with several very reputable and fair-minded bookmakers since then, and although I see by the papers that the bookmakers have demanded the removal and repeal of the Gaming Act, bookmakers who have seen me did not make such a demand. One bookmaker in particular, who is a very prominent man, recognised that the repeal of the Gaming Act would lead to very great abuses, and would lead very disreputable people into bookmaking on account of the abuses, and without my putting the question at all, he volunteered the opinion that the Gaming Act should not be repealed.  We heard no arguments at all that would induce us to repeal the Gaming Act.  It would lead, as I have already stated, to people being induced to bet, perhaps in their youth, to an unlimited and unreasonable extent, so that the property which they might be possessed of, might get into the hands of those who were inducing them to bet.  We intend in the Betting Bill to provide for powers to initiate or establish the Totalisator or Pari-Mutuel system on such racecourses as we may think fit.  There are certain difficulties about the carrying on of the Totalisator in this country. They arise largely from the way in which racing is dispersed, the number of courses on which races are held, and the comparative infrequency of racing on any particular course.  It is not intended that this system should be set up on every course, but it is intended, at any rate, to try it out on a considerable number of suitable courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended that the State should use the totalisator?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are anticipating a Betting Bill, may I ask where either the pari-mutuel or totalisator system is in force will the other kind of betting be prohibited as it is in Australia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It would simply go on alongside with the betting tax. The position here with regard to betting is undoubtedly linked up with <Col N="274" /> horse-racing.  Horse-racing is necessary to horse breeding and I think it is universally agreed that it is desirable to keep the horse-breeding industry in the position it occupies at the moment. I believe if racing were to collapse, if there was to be practically no horse racing here, that a most serious blow would be dealt to a very important industry in this country, so that while the State has no interest even in the continuance of betting, it has an interest in the continuance of racing. Racing is necessary to an important industry and we must see that the carrying on of horse-racing is not unduly handicapped or prejudiced in the country.  There are some people who believe that much of the difficulty which racing has been subjected to in the past would be cured by the institution of the pari-mutuel or the totalisator system of betting.  Since the announcement of the intention to impose a betting tax I have been subjected to what I might call a good deal of long-distance bombardment in regard to it from the opponents of the tax.  I received a deputation quite soon after I made the Budget statement and to that deputation I put certain questions.  I was promised that figures would be collected and information supplied to me.  I need hardly say that there has been no attempt since to supply the information and no figures have been put up.  I did not take the opposition to the tax very seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I was one of the members of that deputation.  It was the bookmakers who were to supply these statistics to the Minister, and if they failed to do that it has nothing whatever to do with the other persons who have taken up this question&mdash;the stewards of the Turf Club, the owners and the trainers.  They have given statistics which I have here, and which I intend to mention to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy apparently thought it wise not to supply them to me because then, perhaps, I might be in a position to analyse them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I never guaranteed to supply any figures from the bookmakers. <Col N="275" /> Mr. Power made the announcement that he would do it, but I never offered to do it because I do not know anything about the bookmakers' business, and therefore could not do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the tax is one that affects bookmakers, and I do not care very much as to what people who have nothing to do with bookmaking may say about it.  Certain points in relation to the betting tax were mentioned when the proposal was announced to the Dáil: the hardship it would be if the credit bets of defaulters were taxed.  I recognise that and it is provided for in the Bill.  It was also mentioned that it would be a hardship and an impossible burden if laying-off bets were taxed.  We have provided in the Bill for the exemption from tax of bets which are in the nature of laying-off bets.  These were really the only difficulties or hardships suggested, and these we have met in the Bill.  The threats that all betting would stop, and that all the money that is employed in betting would be sucked up by this tax do not, I think, bear any examination at all.  In other countries where there is a form of a betting tax, higher rates than 5 per cent. have prevailed for a long time and betting still goes on.  There are many countries which have 5 and 6 per cent. rates and there are countries which have rates very much higher. If in other countries betting can pay 7 or 10 per cent., and that racing still continues, then it would take a great deal to convince me that in this country a 5 per cent. tax cannot be borne.  The suggestion that there is a certain pool of money in the business and that this simply circulates is not a correct representation of the case.  The money invested in betting really comes from the ordinary earnings of numerous citizens who bet a certain amount, perhaps fairly regularly, but who are not professional betters.  Not only have the bookmakers not put up the figures which it was suggested they would put up, but although race committees and directors of race courses seem to have protested against the fact none of them has come to me with any figures showing the present position of the <Col N="276" /> executives with which they are connected. I really believe the idea is, by shouting hard enough and simply relying on shouting and loud protests, to scare us from going on with the tax on bets.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested, though afterwards the suggestion was withdrawn, that we might get almost as much as the £200,000 which I mentioned in the Budget statement from a heavy tax on bookmakers.  It was at one time suggested that a very large number of bookmakers would pay £200 a year as a licence fee so that we might get&mdash;the figure mentioned was £140,000 a year&mdash; from that source.  Afterwards we heard we would get something less.  It is, I know, difficult to know how much money a 5 per cent. tax on bets will give.  We, after as much consideration as we could give it, hazard the guess, if I may put it so&mdash;we hazard the opinion&mdash;that it may give from £150,000 to £200,000 per annum.  Some of the people who have been opposed to the tax said it would give £500,000, some that it would give £1,000,000, and some in the end that it would give nothing at all, because it would completely kill off betting.  The opposition is so incoherent and so inconsistent, as put forward by different persons, that it is impossible to learn anything to add to such knowledge as we have been able to gather from the arguments put forward by those who are opposing the tax.  To some extent undoubtedly the betting tax will reduce the volume of the betting business.  Sometimes bets of £100 are laid to win £10.  Obviously, if there is a 5 per cent. tax, or a tax anything approaching that, bets of that character will cease to be made, and there will be a diminution of business. That provides a quite natural explanation of the opposition of the bookmakers. I believe as a result of this tax that there will not be as much betting as heretofore, and consequently there will be some loss of profit to the bookmakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be more money for the wives&mdash;or husbands, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The bookmakers will not pay the tax.  The tax will be passed on to the betters by the adjustment <Col N="277" /> of the odds, and a successful bookmaker carrying on business will still make the same rate of profit as in the past.  He will still make his income as before, but if there is a reduction in the volume of betting there probably will be a means of living for a smaller number of bookmakers, and naturally we have the condition there in which there will be strenuous opposition to the tax.  It was half suggested at one stage to me that the case of the people who oppose the tax might be met if we had a 5 per cent. tax on betting off the course, that is 5 per cent. on bets laid in offices in towns or elsewhere, and 2½ per cent. on bets made actually on the race-course.  That was a suggestion which I had a certain amount of sympathy for, but as I have said already, the only sort of betting in which we have the slightest interest is that which induces people to go to the race courses, and which enables the race committees or directors of race courses to pay their expenses and horse-racing to be carried on.</P>
      <P>But, on examination, I came to the conclusion that the chances of evasion. and the difficulties of collection would be enormously increased by having two rates of tax.  There will be naturally, and especially in the early stages of such a tax as this, certain difficulties as regards its enforcement and certain difficulties to counter the methods of evasion that will be adopted. It seems to be unwise to make any arrangement which would make the collection more difficult and more costly.  I say this that if it proves to be a fact that a 5 per cent. tax gives us very substantially more than £200,000&mdash;I had no belief at all that the tax would give us the figures that some people mentioned, such a figure say as £500,000&mdash;if it were to give us say £250,000 in practice and that there seemed to be any basis for the suggestion that racing would be injured unless some counteracting measures were taken, I would be prepared to propose to the Dáil that in the interests of horse-breeding a certain sum of money should be provided to give increased stakes at race meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the annual sum provided in stakes is about £116,000.  That is <Col N="278" /> not a large sum of money when we consider that some 1,300 horses participate in races during the year and when we consider the cost of the up keep of horses.  If it were proven that the attendance at race-meetings&mdash; which is the thing that keeps racing going&mdash;was injured in any way by the betting tax, some recompense of the kind that I have indicated could be given, and I have no doubt that if the situation I suggest arose, the proposition would be acceptable to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>So far as I have discussed the matter with those who take an adverse interest in the betting tax proposal, no concession seems to meet their case. If something were suggested by themselves, and if I were to show any disposition to meet them, the next thing would be a statement from them that the concession would be no use at all and that there must be no tax on betting. Anything I have been able to say or do to meet the people who are opposed to a tax on betting has had no effect.  It really causes a suspicion to arise in my mind that a great deal more money can be got out of the betting tax without any injury to racing than I first thought.</P>
    <P>Amongst the opponents of the tax there is a disposition to have no tax on bets at any price.  They have suggested paying very big sums by way of licence duty; they have suggested they are prepared to do anything at all rather than have a tax on bets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>At racecourses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at racecourses. If there is nothing to conceal about the question of betting on racecourses, any injury that might possibly be inflicted on racing by the tax can be met in the manner I have suggested.  I have no doubt the setting up of the pari-mutuel system would have a stimulating effect on attendances at race meetings, because it would enable certain people who usually bet in small sums to get odds they never could get otherwise.  It would help to dispel some of the suspicions of rigging and arranging that exist.  It has been suggested from many sources that, in itself, would have a stimulating effect on the attendance at racecourses.  If, in spite of that, <Col N="279" /> there was a falling-off in the receipts resulting from attendances, I have indicated that could be met, and quite properly met, if there was a good yield from the tax&mdash;if there was anything like half or one-third of the yields that have been suggested.</P>
      <P>Of course, the question of the betting tax will have to be discussed again by the Dáil on Financial Resolutions. Owing to the change in intention which has taken place, the betting tax proposals have been put in the Finance Bill without first having been the subject of Financial Resolutions.  The Resolutions will have to be proposed in the Dáil before the Committee Stage of the Bill can be taken.  If passed, they will have to be reported, so that when we come to the Committee Stage of the Bill, the betting tax proposals will have been twice before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether there is a hope of avoiding a repetition of the tariff debate on the Second Reading of this Bill.  I rather indicated that when we were reporting the Financial Resolutions, I would reply to some remarks Deputy Baxter made on the question of tariffs.  In the hope that a renewal of the tariff debate might be held over until the Tariff Commission Bill comes before the House, I think on the present occasion I will withhold what I may have to say on that point.</P>

      <P>There is no power to rule out of order on this Bill a question touching on tariffs.  The Minister's suggestion would make the position in regard to the other Bill much simpler.  If we have a tariff discussion on this Bill, the discussion on the other Bill could technically be restricted. Whether it would be in the power of a human chairman to restrict the discussion, I could not say; I rather doubt it.  An arrangement could, no doubt, be made.  There is, however, no power to rule out of order a discussion on tariffs when we are at the Second Stage of a Bill which contains provisions for the imposition of tariffs.</P>

      <P>I could not rule anything of that kind out of order.  Deputies can endeavour to reach an understanding, and during the discussion I could indicate to a Deputy whether, in my opinion, he is going outside the limits of that understanding. As regards Deputy Cooper's point, this Bill will be taken in Committee, and on the sections of the Bill which impose an oatmeal tax or a wireless apparatus tax, there will be a discussion touching on these matters.  What really arises on the Second Stage is the principle of the imposition of tariffs, and, I take it, it is that type of general discussion that needs to be excluded. If it is agreed that the general discussion need not take place, then in Committee on the Bill we shall have a discussion touching only the points that are involved in each section.  On the Bill connected with the Tariff Commission the Chair will not be able to accept any technical point of order suggesting the ruling out of a discussion on tariffs.</P>

If we all agree to rule out new tariff duties, well and good.  We can discuss the specific duties later.  If any Deputy considers that, say, bachelors or cats ought to be taxed, this is the principal opportunity he has of bringing the matter forward.  In the same way, if any Deputy thinks an alternative betting tax should be brought forward instead of the one proposed by the Minister, this is his opportunity.  It is desirable there should be some understanding on that point.  If there is a general understanding that we should not discuss the general tariff question, it will greatly facilitate the Dáil.</P>

A reduction or a remission of tax would be quite in order; but no Deputy can propose to put a tax on bachelors, for instance, in Committee.  Therefore, the advocacy of a tax of that kind could only take place now.  The advocacy of any kind of tax may be made now, but in Committee the advocacy of a tax will not be in order, nor can an amendment be moved by a Deputy to increase a tax. The only amendment that would be in order is an amendment suggesting the alteration of a tax by way of reduction or remission, but not by way of an increase.</P>

      <P>As I presume the betting tax will probably be the most controversial item in the Finance Bill, I think it as well that I should make my statement now, as I consider that it may be the means of saving a good deal of time in the discussion, as there are many points in my statement which have not, so far, been made public. The clause which I take particular exception to is the 5 per cent. tax on bets on racecourses and coursing meetings. It says, &ldquo;There shall be charged levied, and paid on and by every bookmaker who makes, lays, or otherwise enters into any bets, on or after the 1st day of November, 1926, an excise duty (in this Act referred to as the duty on bets) of five per cent. of the amount of every bet entered into by him on or after the said 1st day of November, 1926.  The amount of a bet shall be the sum of money which by the terms of the bet the bookmaker will be entitled to receive, retain, or take credit for, if the event of the subject of the bet is determined in his favour.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I would like to make it perfectly clear that, while it is the bookmakers who transmit the money to the Revenue Commissioners, it is out of the pockets of the public the money will come, in the same way as the wine and spirit duties are paid by the consumer and not by the licensed trader. When it was announced in Mr. Blythe's Budget statement that it was proposed to impose a five per cent. tax on all stakes invested, the various persons concerned with racing and breeding interests held a preliminary meeting at the Curragh.  It was there decided to prepare a form of protest which would be presented to the Government, and at Punchestown, and subsequent meetings, over 500 persons <Col N="284" /> representing the owners and breeders, together with very many public representatives including the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Seanad, signed this protest.  The Minister gave an explanation in his opening statement as to why the betting tax is now included in the Finance Bill.  The opinion of the public is that it has been included in the Bill because it would not have passed through the Seanad and the public are very often very good judges.  A subsequent meeting was again held at the Curragh at which the stewards of the Turf Club and the representatives of the signatures authorised myself and Senator Parkinson to convey their views to Mr. Blythe.  The Minister for Finance has mentioned something about long-distance bombardment, but I may say that on the following day we interviewed Mr. Blythe and spent over two and a half hours discussing the whole subject.  We presented him with the following unanimous agreement which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We, the undersigned, representing the considered unanimous views of the Stewards of the Turf Club, the owners, trainers, breeders, agricultural and other such interests, hereby request the Minister for Finance to exclude race meetings from the proposed tax of 5 per cent. on all stakes invested.  We have no doubt whatever that, if such tax is insisted on, racing in the Free State would not survive even the experimental period.  We believe a considerable source of revenue could be obtained by the imposition of a substantial licence duty on bookmakers operating on racecourses, which would be obtained at a minimum cost of collection.  In view of the menace that a cessation of racing would mean to our great breeding industry of world-wide fame, and to the fourth largest asset the Free State is possessed of, we confidently believe that no Irish Government would ignore the unanimous opinion of the vital interests affected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(Signed)</P>
    <P>&ldquo;J.J. Parkinson, Senator.</P>
    <P>Patrick W. Shaw, T.D.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> That is the considered opinion of everyone who is thoroughly conversant with the subject and everyone believes that if this five per cent. tax is imposed racing will not last nine months in this country.  We spent some two and a half hours with Mr. Blythe, but, as stated publicly, we did not succeed in convincing him, for the simple reason that our arguments were futile, as the Minister could not be convinced, and his policy appears to be to take the plunge in the dark and chance the consequences.  Arguments were of no avail, and his motto appears to be, &ldquo;I never yield, whether right or wrong.&rdquo;  Last year, in England, Mr. Churchill introduced the silk duties in his Budget statement, but, when the many interests involved proved to him that such tax would be detrimental to British trade interests, he met the people interested and practically withdrew them.  We have made a stronger case on behalf of Irish interests, but so far without success.  I may also mention that a well-known city bookmaker produced audited figures for the past six years, those figures having been accepted by the Revenue Commissioners for income tax assessments, and that the net results of the six years' trading showed a profit of £9,000, whereas, if a five per cent. tax had to be paid on the turnover, this one person would be liable for £60,000.  As this is one of my principal arguments, I would ask the Minister if he will accept or contradict my statement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>We are absolutely convinced <Col N="286" /> that a five per cent. tax on turnover will cause a cessation of racing inside nine months, owing to depleted attendance at race meetings by the public, and as, at a low estimate, at least 30,000 people obtain a living out of those industries, the seriousness of such a possibility should be recognised. On behalf of the people interested in racing interests in the Free State, I would like to say we are not at all unreasonable, and are quite agreed that further revenue could be obtained from racing, but that it should be one which the industries of racing and thoroughbred bloodstock breeding could bear.  In regard to the question of money circulated in racing I have some details here with reference to the Great Southern Railway only.  Up to the 30th November, 1924, over 7,000 horse-boxes carried more than 13,000 horses during eleven months.  These totals do not include horses (or mares) coming into Ireland for stud purposes, nor those mares (and their produce) going back to England when they had visited sires at the stud in Ireland. Down to the period stated (for eleven months previously), 50,000 passengers were carried to the Curragh meetings alone.  It is computed that millions of passengers are carried on the railways to and from race meetings in the course of a season, and these people would not travel on the railways except for the attraction of racing.  The suggestion of five per cent. tax on all bets staked, or, in other words, on turnover and not on profits, will cripple the racing industry, deprive breeders of their business and throw tens of thousands of people out of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish horse-breeding industry is only now recovering from the effects of the war, and the adverse conditions caused thereby, such as rates of exchange, etc.  Our live-stock trade has been challenged by Canada, our butter and egg trade by Denmark, our agricultural products by America, our woollen manufactures by England, but up to the present we remain unchallenged in the markets of the world for our world-famed thoroughbred horses.  Now, however, a challenge is issued by a Minister of our own Government. On behalf of the persons I <Col N="287" /> represent here, I say that if the Government are going to enforce this tax in its present form and thereby strike a serious blow to our great breeding industry, it is well to know they are going to alienate the sympathy and support of the hundreds and thousands of persons interested in racing and breeding in the Free State.  It should be unnecessary for me to have to convince Irishmen of the great asset we possess in the breeding industry, and to show that our bloodstock commands the highest prices in the world's markets, a fact which was again proved last year at Doncaster sales, when Irish yearlings obtained the record prices of 12,000 guineas and 10,500 guineas, being first and second respectively. Over 400,000 guineas were realised at public auction for thoroughbred yearlings, etc., in 1925.  This does not include private sales.</P>
    <P>We have suggested that a substantial licence duty should be imposed on bookmakers operating on racecourses, which would be obtained at a minimum cost of collection.  This, with the huge revenue obtained by the Government from the public by the amusement tax, is surely as much as can be borne with any hope of carrying on.  It may not be generally known that the amusement tax yields such a large amount as the following official figures prove:&mdash;The actual sum paid in the past five years to the Government by the three Metropolitan race meetings and the Curragh, was no less than £90,993, and there are 31 other racecourses in the Free State, all contributing large sums to the Government yearly, and all out of the pockets of the public who attend; the following are the actual figures for the meetings in question:&mdash;Phoenix Park, £24,400; Leopardstown, £21,592; Baldoyle, £18,284; Curragh, £26,767; total, £90,993.  Those amounts, together with the tax from coursing, will show what the public are contributing out of these two pastimes.  The effect of a 5 per cent. tax on stakes would have even a more serious effect on coursing, inasmuch as where a stake is being run for, a dog, before he could win same, <Col N="288" /> would have to win five courses; the owner would, therefore, be reinvesting his own money five times, and would pay 25 per cent. tax to the Government instead of 5 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Coursing is not included. The Minister surely does not dream of doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the fact that in almost every course there are partisans of each dog from different counties, who invest their money at, say, 5/4 on and evens, the winner being paid out of the money obtained from the loser's backers.  So that a 5 per cent. tax imposed on each individual bet would exhaust the capital of coursing people, even sooner than the tax on racing, owing to the fact of it being a case almost every time of two persons putting up their money against one another.  If the 5 per cent. tax is insisted on, I can see all coursing meetings in the Free State being held in the Six Northern Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of the Six Counties have the reputation of being very shrewd, and I am sorry our Minister for Finance has not inherited the sound judgment displayed by his fellow-countrymen in refusing to assist Mr. Churchill to enforce the betting tax.  Let us, therefore, in the Free State, make a beginning towards the united Ireland we all look forward to, and have no border in the interests of sport, at any rate.  In conclusion, therefore, I appeal for the support of the Labour Party on the ground of the unemployment that would be caused.  I appeal to the Farmers' Party on the ground that their interests are vitally affected by the menace to the breeding industry. I appeal to the Independent Party on the ground that, as business men, they must be aware that a 5 per cent. tax on turnover of any business or enterprise could not survive.  And, as regards our own Party, I claim the votes and support of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Protectionist Party, on the ground that as they are prepared even to take chances, by imposing experimental tariffs in order to provide employment for our people, and stem the export of the nation's blood to foreign countries&mdash;surely they <Col N="289" /> cannot vote to injure an established successful industry, the fourth largest asset of the Free State, and thus cause a vast increase in unemployment.  With regard to the other members of the Government Party, I only ask the Minister to allow a free vote on a question of national importance such as this, as by doing so he would not be coercing very many Government supporters to support a tax which they believe would cause a grave injury to a great industry.  I, therefore, confidently, leave the matter to the good sense of the Deputies.  It is my intention to move an amendment on the Committee Stage to exclude race meetings and coursing meetings from the proposed tax, and, if the Minister is agreeable to leave those particular clauses to a free vote of the House, my position as to the Second Reading will be easy to define.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters that arose out of the Minister's statement that I want to refer to. In the first place, I had nothing whatever to do with the bookmakers or the others who met to prepare and furnish statistics to Mr. Blythe.  I find serious fault with them that they did not do it.  It is their own look-out.  With regard to the Minister's statement about taxes in other countries, there is a tax in other countries, but it is on the totalisator system.  The people who bet receive mathematical odds to their money, not the prices that people are obliged to take from bookmakers.  I am in agreement with regard to starting the totalisator here as an experiment.  I am entirely in agreement also with the refusal to legalise the recovery of betting debts, because I am only too well aware of the abuses it would lead to. There are people, of course, who make fools of themselves in betting as in everything else, but there is no reason that because one man gets drunk or a dozen men get drunk that every publichouse should be closed.  There are hundreds of thousands of people throughout the Free State who take a great interest in racing and have a shilling or two on-perhaps a little more-but at the same time, owing to the times we are living in, the most <Col N="290" /> of them are well able to hold their own. There is nothing further that I wish to say on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. JOHN CONLAN Mr. JOHN CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHN CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Shaw in his opposition to the imposition of this tax.  He has gone so fully into all matters concerned with it that I need not detain the Dáil very long.  I may say my interest in the matter arises from the apprehension that the tax will kill racing and that it will also destroy the very important industry of horse-breeding. I mean the breeding of high class thoroughbred horses.  Perhaps the Deputies as a whole do not realise how important that industry is or the vast amount of capital that is invested in it, and the great amount of employment it gives.  Within recent years we have had a remarkable development in the way of horse-breeding in this country.</P>
      <P>Extensive breeding studs have been set up, especially in the vicinity of the Curragh, not alone by Irishmen but by Englishmen and other foreigners.  We have men of the type of the Aga Khan coming over to Ireland and investing a very large sum in a stud farm.  We have men like Lord Furness, Major Giles Loder and other wealthy Englishmen coming over and starting the breeding of thoroughbred horses.  They do so because they have come to realise that this country, from the advantages it possesses in the way of soil and climate, is better fitted than any other country for the production of high class racehorses.  Deputy Shaw has referred to the remarkable prices which have been realised not alone at Ballsbridge, but at Newmarket and Doncaster for Irish bred yearlings.  In connection with that I may say that a man who has a stud farm near my place realised £29,000 for 12 yearlings last year. This industry is not confined to what I might call big men like those I have mentioned.  Farmers have taken it up extensively, not alone in Kildare but in a great many other counties in the Free State, and they have got very fair prices&mdash;in some cases very large prices&mdash;for their horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Shaw has said, it is the considered opinion of men who have a <Col N="291" /> very intimate knowledge of racing conditions that the imposition of this tax will kill racing in a short time. It has been stated, and I believe with truth, that in Australia and South Africa, where they have this tax in operation, it has had a very bad effect on racing; in fact it has nearly killed racing in those countries, Senator Parkinson, who perhaps knows more about racing than any man in Ireland, is positively of opinion that the tax will not alone kill racing but that it will re-act on horse-breeding. He has been very active in the development of that trade.  He has opened up a connection with Continental countries and in the past twelve months he has exported no less than 60 blood horses. That shows how important the industry is.  If you wipe out thoroughbred horses you also affect another very important branch of horse-breeding, that is hunter-breeding.  You cannot have hunters without a thoroughbred sire.  Racing has always been a favourite amusement with the Irish people.  I believe it is on record that chariot races were held at the Curragh in pre-historic times.  Racing is an amusement that can be partaken of by every class of the community.  Even people of very high positions are to be seen taking part in racing.  I have had the pleasure of seeing His Excellency the Governor-General and the President enjoying themselves at Punchestown.</P>

Racing committees, I believe, find it very hard to keep things going at present.  Not more than half-a-dozen of them are in a sound financial position.  If the Minister persists in his proposal, and if it is carried into effect, I hope he will carry out the promise he has made to supplement stakes at these meetings.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my view with regard to the interest taken in the betting tax by those who breed horses.  Undoubtedly, horse-breeding in this country is a great asset to many people.  A lot of money comes into the country year after year, and that money finds its way, in due course, into the pockets of every member of the community.  Those who are interested in the horse-breeding industry say that the five per cent. tax on racing will undoubtedly be injurious to the horse-breeding industry.  I do hope that the Minister will, in some way or other, reduce the 5 per cent. tax and make it more reasonable.  I would be in favour of the totalisator.  It ought to be a great asset in bringing in something to the State for the purpose of reducing taxation.  I hope, for the sake of the breeders and those others interested in the industry, that the Minister will take a lenient view of this matter.</P>

      <P>I was hopeful that one could read into that a little more than what the Minister intends to read into it.  I have referred to that tax at considerable length already, and I was hopeful that we would, at all events in this Budget, if we did not see the end of it, get an undertaking from the Minister that it would not be continued beyond a certain period.  Clause 29 contains a marginal note which is important, &ldquo;temporary continuance.&rdquo; I was hopeful that that referred to the whole tax rather than to certain provisions of it, but apparently in this matter, as in other matters, the Minister is like Stonewall Jackson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One was glad to note that certain hardships which occurred in connection <Col N="293" /> with certain proposals have been met in this Bill.  One of those that I was particularly glad to see, and which was one that attention was directed to from a number of quarters, was in connection with wireless apparatus.  Apparently there is no provision at the moment whereby apparatus that is imported into this country&mdash;as we know there is very little apparatus in connection with wireless manufactured in the country&mdash;and which has to be exported for the purpose of having temporary repairs and adjustments made, can escape a second tax.  Quite irrespective of how many times it comes in, it has got to pay the duty.  That is a matter that I am glad the Minister for Finance has put right in this Budget. One is also glad to see that he has put right another matter that has caused a considerable amount of hardship, possibly more to the agricultural community than any other section, that is where sodas were brought within the jurisdiction of the soap tax.  Certain of these soda crystals were used very largely by agriculturists for the spraying of potatoes.  That is a matter of very considerable importance to those engaged both in the industrial side and also in the agricultural side.  I am glad to see that the Minister has put that right in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>There are one or two matters about which difficulties have arisen and in respect of which no provision has been made in this Bill.  One of these is concerned with the interpretation of the word &ldquo;furniture.&rdquo;  A number of us have had curious instances brought to our notice of the interpretation of &ldquo;furniture&rdquo; in this connection.  One outstanding instance was the case of a bucket composed entirely of sheet metal.  By no stretch of the imagination could it be regarded as &ldquo;furniture,&rdquo; but yet because it had a wooden handle it was included in the category of furniture.  There are a number of instances of that character which have caused considerable irritation.  One would have liked to have seen a provision introduced into the Finance Bill which would obviate that irritation. It could have been done, as was pointed out last year, by means of a schedule setting out exactly the items <Col N="294" /> included under the term &ldquo;furniture.&rdquo;  I hope the Minister will introduce some section that will put an end to this irritation.</P>
    <P>Heretofore it was understood that arrangements would be made with the revenue authorities whereby owners of charabancs crossing the Border, particularly from the Northern side into the Free State, could make arrangements whereby duty would not have to be paid on them on every occasion they crossed.  Owing to the difficulty that the Revenue Commissioners have had in making such arrangements, it appears that charabancs are forbidden to cross the Border except such duty is paid.  I have a letter, dated 5th May, in which the writer, who represents a large firm engaged in this trade, states:</P>
    <P>We have been officially informed by the Inspectors of Customs and Excise at Beresford Place that the bonds in this case cannot be issued and that the only way of getting the charabancs over the Border is to pay duty on them.</P>
    <P>One would like to see facilities granted to those engaged in that trade. I am sure it is the desire of the Minister to meet all reasonable cases and to endeavour to grant facilities to persons in trade.  I would suggest that these two matters receive the consideration of the Minister and that a provision be inserted in the Bill to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Under some Bills which we discussed recently, fines heretofore accruing to local authorities are now transferred to the Central Fund.  Under those Bills, power is given to the Minister for Finance to re-transfer those fines, or portion of them, to the local authorities if he so desires.  I should like to know if it is necessary to get authority for the issue of the order to this effect in the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I have no particular <Col N="295" /> views on this betting tax.  I am still open to conviction one way or the other.  Personally, it is a matter of indifference to me whether the tax is imposed or not, as I nearly always manage to back losers.  However, I promised some friends that I would raise a question on the duty which the Bill imposes on wines.  At the present time the difference in cost between what would be called cheap wines and the better class of wines is 3/6 per gallon, or 7/- per dozen.  Under the new rates, the difference will be 7/- per gallon, or 14/- per dozen.  I understand that prior to the imposition of this new duty on wines, wines could be purchased in this city and in the Saorstát generally at from 16/- to 73/- per gallon.  Under the new proposals, with the tax added, the same wines will cost from 26/- to 97/- per dozen.  At 16/- per dozen the price works out at 1/4 per bottle and at 73/- it works out at 6/1 per bottle.  As wine is charged in practically every publichouse at 1/- a glass, that leaves a profit of 8/8 on the 16/- stuff and 3/11 on the five-star Sandeman.  I occasionally visit a publichouse.  I am not a &ldquo;pussyfoot.&rdquo; When I do visit a publichouse, I usually have a glass of wine.  There are many other people in the same position.  But there are wines and wines.  I am sure I have often got stuff bought at 16/- for which my friend had to pay 1/-.  Occasionally, I have had to pay it myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who drink porter have had their views expressed in the papers and elsewhere.  The people who sell porter have had their views expressed, and I think the people who sell wine and the people who drink wine should have their views expressed.  A friend of mine once gave expression to the suspicion that some of the wine he got had never been within one hundred miles of a vineyard.  There is a great discrepancy between this cheap stuff and decent stuff, such as the five-star Sandeman.  This tax provides the publicans with a direct incentive to stock the cheaper stuff.  Some friends of mine who have considered the matter carefully say that these cheap wines bear about the same relationship to <Col N="296" /> good wines as poteen, which it is illegal to make or sell, bears to decent whiskey. I think the Minister ought to consider the advisability of increasing the duty on the cheaper wines, and bringing it more into relationship with the duty on the better class wines.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the revenue must be got.  I am not suggesting that the amount of revenue from wines should be reduced, because I know the Minister would not consider that for a moment.  But if he would reduce the duty on the better class wines and increase the duty on the cheaper wines, so that the total amount realised would be the same, I think it would be well.  Otherwise, he could increase the duty on the lower class wines.  The course I have indicated would be good for the country.  Most of us have read in the papers lately of the prevalence of drink at dances.  Some people have pointed out that at some of these entertainments young girls become disgracefully intoxicated.  It has been suggested to me that the ability to buy these cheap wines is responsible for that demoralisation. Anything that tends to encourage the seller of wines to stock only the cheap stuff and that tends to the consumption of these cheap wines in unsuitable places and at unsuitable times is very undesirable.  I should like the Minister to give attention to this question of the duty on wines.</P>

      <P>I do support Deputy Nagle's point of view.  I think it is the general desire of Deputies that Deputy Nagle should speak more often. He always brings an individual point of view to bear upon a question and he generally has something very sound <Col N="298" /> to say.  I do not want to elaborate Deputy Nagle's point of view.  I agree with him, and I think he has expressed it so fully and well that it is not necessary for me to do so.  But I would like to say that it is a pity that this discussion has centred so much on details of the Bill.  As it has, I would refer to one or two points raised. Deputy Shaw&mdash;I am sorry that Deputy McGoldrick frightened him away&mdash; told us that the betting tax would kill racing.  He said that racing would not survive the experimental stage and the tax on betting would cause a cessation of racing within nine months.</P>
      <P>I am not an expert on racing.  I once rode in a point-to-point, and my position was returned as &ldquo;also ran.&rdquo; It would, I think, have been more accurately returned as &ldquo;also fell.&rdquo; But I have observed a certain amount of racing from time to time.  I am not as conversant with it as Deputy Shaw, but I do not believe that any tax of 5 per cent. on turnover will kill racing in this country.  Racing is very much more firmly based in this country than that, and I think in a way it is a misfortune for racing in this country that it is associated so much with betting, that at the average race meeting the assumption is that you are going to bet and win or lose so much, that you do not care what you pay for admission, what you pay for meals and refreshments and what you pay for a race-card.  That has been the assumption in racing, both here and in Great Britain, and I think it has done harm. There are a number of men and women who delight in the sight of a good horse well ridden, who delight in the thrill of a test between two horses, but who are not interested in betting at all, and, because racing is based on betting, they do not go racing as often as they might.  It is not necessary to bet to delight in racing.  I do not believe nowadays that more than 40 per cent. of those who go to race meetings bet. A great many bet who do not go.  I accept that.  But of those who go to race meetings there are a large number of ladies who never bet, and there are a good many men, who go for the sake of seeing a good horse, and who do not bet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> I do not believe that racing depends on betting, but if it did, a 5 per cent. duty on turnover will not kill it. Deputy Shaw has bought a horse at an auction sale before now.  So have I. He has found at an auction sale that the bidding goes in guineas.  I pay £40, £50 or £100 for a hunter.  Deputy Shaw, no doubt, pays larger amounts for racehorses.  But you pay in guineas, and the 5 per cent. on your pound goes to the auctioneer as commission. What will happen under this measure is, that you will bet in guineas, and the five per cent. will go to the revenue of the Minister for Finance, that the bookmaker, instead of sending out a bill to a client for £1 or £5, will make it one guinea or five guineas.  I think that that scheme is a practicable one. My only doubt about it is, that it may involve very considerable costs of collection, that the inspection of bookmakers' accounts and the issue of cards and tickets may cost a good deal of money.  If any tenable alternative proposal had been put up, I would have been inclined to advocate it, but as far as I can gather, the bookmakers began by putting up an alternative proposal of the high licence duty, and then ran away from it.  As far as I can understand, there is no such proposal now in the field.  That being so, I think that I am bound to support the Bill, and I do so, believing that it will not kill racing.  If an autocrat arose in this country he could abolish the Dáil. There would be a few perfunctory protests; Deputy Johnson would protest, but the Seanad would go quietly. Deputy Johnson has very high sense of principle, and I know that he might insist on coming in here, and on getting the autocrat to remove him.  But let that autocrat try to kill either racing or hunting in this country, and his days would be short.  Racing and the love of horses is a much stronger thing in Ireland than the life of a parliamentary institution, and I do not believe that this measure will kill racing.</P>
    <P>Leaving that, I want to refer to Deputy Good's point about the tax on charabancs coming from Northern Ireland.  I am not in great sympathy with charabancs, but in regard to <Col N="300" /> other motor vehicles, including motors carrying furniture, I gather that a definite preference in this matter is given to charabancs and motor lorries coming from firms in Belfast who have no branches in the Free State.  But where a firm has a branch in Belfast and Dublin there is a certain suspicion on the part of the Revenue Commissioners that it may be getting motor vehicles in without paying duty.  I think that that can be avoided.  I think that a substantial bond entered into by the firm and a reasonable system of inspection ought to be able to get over that.  It does seem to me that it is a little hard to penalise people who are giving employment in the Saorstát, paying rent and rates and employing people in Dublin, as against those who are known to have headquarters in Belfast but who, having no branch in the Saorstát, are bound to bring back their lorries. There are administrative difficulties, but I cannot help thinking that if the Minister would go into it a little more in detail, these difficulties could be overcome.</P>
    <P>There was one omission from the Minister's speech to which I want to call attention.  As far as I know, he has not said anything about the sixpence duty on parcels.  Last year he adumbrated the suggestion that it might be possible to dispense with that duty.  I hope he will tell us more about it.  It is a duty that is, I think, yielding a decreasing revenue, because people are learning to use the book post and other methods of sending goods by which they will not be taxed under this head.  It is one of these petty duties that cause annoyance out of all proportion to the amount of money collected, and I had hopes that the Minister in his Budget statement was going to announce its withdrawal. If he is determined to continue it I hope he will tell us whether he thinks it is a sound duty, or whether he is merely retaining it for experimental purposes for another year.</P>
    <P>I have gone more into details than I intended to on these matters.  This is one of the few opportunities we have of discussing the general financial position of the State.  The Minister <Col N="301" /> has very wisely decided to resort to borrowing to meet part of his expenditure, expenditure which may be called of an abnormal and non-recurrent nature.  I think that the process might have been carried a little further.  I think that some, at any rate, of our housing problems might have been treated as abnormal expenditure; not the whole, but a proportion.  But I would suggest that if the Minister is going to meet such expenditure by borrowing, he should consolidate his borrowing.  He should, in fact, issue another loan.  Our financial position at the present moment is eminently sound, sounder, I think, than any other Dominion of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  The one Loan that we have issued stands four points above its issue price, a most valuable testimony of the administration of the Executive Council, of the Minister for Finance in particular, and also, I think, to the stability of the State.  That being so, I do suggest to the Minister that it would be sound financially to consolidate his debts, and not to have a variety of debts.  There is one loan on certain definite terms.  There are various Ways and Means Advances from banks, and there are Telephone Capital Loans, compensation grants, and so on.  I believe that it would be a sound, financial doctrine to consolidate the majority of these, not the £10,000,000 of the National Loan, but the other minor loans, and also to provide for the capital expenditure that will be needed in the coming year, by the issue of another loan.  I do not want to press the Minister to make an announcement now; it may be premature. I do not want to handicap the prospects on the market of our present loan, particularly as I hold a certain amount of it.  But I do suggest that on broad financial lines it is a mistake to go on taking little savings from Estimates, Ways and Means Advances from banks, and so on, and that it would be better to have a general scheme.  The Minister need not be afraid that any loan of £10,000,000 or £15,000,000 will interfere with our credit.  Our credit, compared with that of New Zealand, Canada or Australia, is in an extraordinarily strong <Col N="302" /> position.  Australia alone is paying in interest annually more than double our total debt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend only to deal with the proposal in the Bill for a tax on betting.  I was struck by the peculiar idea of betting that Deputy Cooper has.  He compares betting to buying a horse.  As a general rule, a horse is only bought once a year, and the horse that goes under the hammer once a year has very close acquaintance with the hammer.  On the other hand, the same money is betted, practically speaking, every week.  If there are fifty, or even twenty, extractions out of this amount of money in the pool there will be very little left after a time.  We ought to approach this from a commonsense point of view, and we ought not to be led away by the people who preach that betting is immoral, is wrong; that sport of every description is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that the Deputy did, but there are people, in this country and outside, who are continually saying it, and who are endeavouring to interfere with the legislature and to have their way.  I will only say of that kind, that no nation was ever great and no people ever worth much because of these craw-thumpers. Old maids and others who belong to that class of people are only a drag; they have never built up a nation and are no use to it.  There is only a very limited amount of money in the racing pool of this country. Coursing has been mentioned, but you may leave coursing out of it, for the amount of money involved in the case of coursing does not amount to much, nor does the bookmaker make very much.  For an obvious reason, pretty well understood in coursing circles, the bookmakers found it very expensive. You can tax coursing in any way you like, but racing is a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said, and of course there is no idea of contradicting it, that racing is an absolute necessity if horse-breeding is to be carried on.  The mares and stallions that are going to <Col N="303" /> carry on the line, that is to say, the blood horses, must be tested and proved.  The national income derived from the sale of our bloodstock is something too substantial to be trifled with and too much of a necessity to the nation.  It has been admitted that our country is peculiarly suited for the raising of the best bloodstock in the world.  The reason for that is that we have the best quality of limestone at the surface of our land which goes to build up the bone of the thoroughbred in quantity and quality.  Very little of that limestone is found in England or, indeed, in any other country.  It is because we have this rich sub-soil of limestone in our land, so near the surface, that Ireland will always, and more in the future than in the past, be the home of the thoroughbred.  The establishment of a betting tax here is likely to do more harm in England than it is here.  If you establish it here you fix its roots in England, and if you do not establish it here then they will find it a very difficult proposition to establish it in England.  I do not care what form this drain on Irish racing takes, whether it be through the means proposed by the Government by the use of a totalisator, or whether it be from the pockets of the bookmaking fraternity. I have no brief for the latter, but what I do say is that you cannot have both systems.  You must make a choice.  The money that is in a pool of this kind could not possibly support both systems.</P>
    <P>Let us for argument's sake assume that there is a fairly substantial sum in the pool.  That money is circulating all the time.  It is being reinvested week after week, and one might almost say day after day, by those who attend race meetings.  Take it, say, that a man goes to a race meeting one day in the week throughout the year, and that he has one bet per day per week.  That represents fifty transactions in the year.  The proposal is to charge 5 per cent. on each transaction, or, say, that he has half a dozen transactions for each week in the year.  If you are to charge five per cent. on all these transactions, how long, I ask, will it take you to get to the bottom of the pool or this turnover <Col N="304" /> on racing?  You can easily prove it if you put a hundred coppers in your pocket and you start making certain subtractions.  You will soon find that very little will be left after a short time if the process of subtracting goes on in the way that I suggest your charge of five per cent. on the racing pool will operate.  The point I want to emphasise in this connection is that you cannot have both systems at work.  If the State thinks it is a good thing to take this up, then by all means let it do so, but you cannot have the two.  As Deputy Shaw pointed out, countries which introduced the totalisator made provision at the same time to enrich the stakes for racing, to subsidise horse racing and horse-breeding. If the Government here is going to take all the money they expect to get out of the racing pool in this country, then they had also better make up their minds to subsidise and foster racing, and that can only be done by adding to the stake money for races in the country.</P>
    <P>It could not be the idea of any Government to kill racing and horse-breeding, which is one of our greatest industries.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should seriously consider this matter, and do all in his power to preserve the goose that lays the golden egg.  In my opinion we should increase our subsidies for horse-breeding and do all in our power to improve the bloodstock of the country. Though I have not been on a racecourse for five or six years, I am well aware that many of the executives conducting race meetings in this country find themselves unable to keep the stakes at a point that will attract a sufficiency of horses.  Practically all our race executives are in that position. There is no use in comparing the present time to the period after the war, when there was a great circulation of money in the country.  A great part of that money undoubtedly found its way at the time to racecourses. Those in touch with things know very well that the amount of money circulating on racecourses at the present time is very small compared to what it was from 1918 to, say, 1922.  At coursing meetings in England during those years I saw people betting <Col N="305" /> in thousands, but now the same people bet in ten pounds notes.  There is another point I would like to urge. The Government is getting considerable revenue from the amusement tax. I suggest that in the steps they are taking now they are going a long way to dry up that source of income.  Unless the Government, from a moral point of view, wanted to kill amusements then they had better be careful as to the steps they are taking in this matter.  As a source of revenue the amusement tax is bringing in a lot of money.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in forecasting that if the experiment indicated by the Minister is carried out in the way he suggests that it will be a failure,, because the racing public will not be able to carry the double load it is proposed to put on its back.  In the event of the Minister not proceeding with his betting tax I would ask him, whether the bookmakers like it or not, to put a substantial tax on them.  A certain number of undesirable people attend at race meetings to make a book.  They offer prices above those offered by the solvent bookmaker, and they usually reap a rich harvest from an unsuspecting public.  I have seen that happen myself at race and coursing meetings. In my younger days I think I first came into notoriety by flogging a few people of that sort.  They had to be removed on stretchers from the course. People of this class constitute a most undersirable element.  The law apparently is not able to reach them. The only law that has been made to reach them is that of the ashplant and of the boot.  I would suggest to the Minister, if he has made up his mind that this thing is wrong, that he should substitute for it a substantial tax on bookmakers.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister is on sound ground when he proposes to recover a 5 per cent. tax on the turnover, because it is the same money that is being circulated all the year round. I suggest to him that the turnover is not anything like the amount he fancies.  The same money is passing between the bookmakers and the backers all the year round, but of course I <Col N="306" /> would say that on balance the bookmaker has the best of it.  The same money is being paid and repaid, and I suggest the amount invested will not bear this tax.  I suggest to the Minister that he is living in a fool's paradise if he thinks he can recover the tax in the way suggested in his Bill.</P>

      <P>There are one or two points that I would like to put before the Minister.  It frequently happens at race meetings that three favourites win and three favourites lose.  A man, say, might have £50 on the winner of the first race at even money.  That would mean that he would have in hand a £100.  He puts his £100 on the favourite in the last race, and the horse loses. What tax would the Government get from him?  Would it claim 5 per cent. on the £100 invested?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>That proves Deputy Gorey's case home to the hilt, that the pool will be exhausted.  If you take 5 per cent. from this money that is reinvested, then you are bound to exhaust the pool.  At race meetings I have often seen men have six bets in the one day.  A man might have a £100 on each race.  That is to say, that on the six races he would have £600 invested. As a result of playing up and down during the day he would probably go home in the evening not having made as much as his taxi fare. That means that out of the pool you are going to take 5 per cent. on the £600 invested by that man.  Cases such as that are quite common at race meetings, where a man invests £600 and neither wins nor loses.  How is he going to pay 5 per cent. to the Government on his £600? I think that is a matter that ought to be considered; some steps should be taken to deal with it.  Otherwise, as Deputy Gorey has stated, the pool will be exhausted probably before the end of twelve months.</P>

I have had a few rays; I am not quite sure whether they are violet rays or other coloured rays, <Col N="307" /> but they tend, however, to give one a little clue to some of the economics of racing.

Presumably as some proportion of it falls into the pockets of those who live by the profession, as it is now called, money is poured in from other sources.  It is a pool having its source in the general wealth production of a community and has its exit in the profession which lives upon the pool.</P>

The members of the profession are actually the final consumers of this pool, which rotates, having its source in the general wealth production of the community.  The profession manipulates this pool and the people who engage in the profession invest.  I presume it is not the casual betting man amongst the general public that is called the investor.  Once upon a time that kind of financial transaction was called a speculation, but now it is an investment.  The terminology of this profession differs from that of the ordinary economist.</P>

      <P>It does bear examination. We are dealing with a very important question, the question of imposing a tax upon, as Deputy Gorey and others term it, a source of income.  That is the case: that this is going to militate against the economic wealth of the community by putting an obstacle to the breeding of horses and it is worth while examining from the point of view of the financial consequences. Will any Deputy explain to me what the effect of this proposed duty will be?  Am I wrong in putting the matter this way?  To-day, without the tax, a man will put down one pound in the hope of winning two pounds.  In the future he will put down one pound in the hope of winning 38/-.  Take it that to-day he will put down one pound in the hope of winning ten pounds; in the future he will be putting down one pound in the hope of winning £9 18s.  That seems to be the net effect of this proposal. The person who now hopes to receive £10 as a consequence of his bet can, in future, hope to receive only £9 18s.</P>

      <P>He puts down his pound in the hope of receiving something. If he loses he does not receive anything, but the money which he has put into the bookmaker's hands has to return five per cent. to the State.  In the long run, taking losses and gains into account, my first statement is correct. I cannot understand how that is going to have the immense influence upon horse-breeding that is contended. So far as I have been able to understand the psychology of the man who bets, the difference of 10 per cent. in the odds does not deflect him from following his bent, and it certainly is not going to prevent him from attending a race meeting.  I am possessed of an immense amount of ignorance on this whole question, but nothing that has been said here to-day gives me any reason to believe that the Minister is taking the line that he is going to destroy, or move towards destroying, <Col N="309" /> horse-breeding or even racing.  If Deputies will throw their minds back a little to the time when there was a proposal years ago to increase the whiskey tax, not by five per cent., but by a much higher percentage, they will recollect there was a great cry as to the effect such a tax would have.  It took very many times five per cent. to have any effect on the consumption of whiskey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>A very much higher percentage than five per cent. has been imposed on whiskey since pre-war days.  What effect has it had upon consumption?  I wonder if it is unreasonable to connect this proposal to add five per cent. to the Exchequer from the pockets of those who bet, with the recent decision of the Dáil to add ten per cent. of the rental charge to what 999 out of every 1,000 people in the towns and cities in the Saorstát will be obliged to pay?  The cry in regard to that matter has been very weak indeed.  That is practically a compulsory charge, whereas this is a voluntary charge upon the public.  It is very important to bear in mind the fact that, I think, was stated by Deputy Shaw, that this was a tax which has to be borne by the public who bet.  It is an optional tax, and it is not to be borne by the &ldquo;profession,&rdquo; save the mark!</P>
      <P>I want to repeat what I said on the Resolution Stage of this Bill.  My protest was against the proposed reduction in super-tax&mdash;reduction in the taxation of those in receipt of more than £2,000 per annum.  Of course, the Minister has endeavoured to defend that by saying that the man who lives may, while he lives, get a benefit, but when he is dead his heirs and successors will pay out on his account.  But it is a distinct proposal to relieve the rich man of a liability while additional charges on, or abstractions from, the very poor are continued.  I speak now, of course, of the old age pension reductions.  I repeat my protest against this proposal to reduce the super-tax so long as the cut in the old age pension remains effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> In regard to the general proposals affecting income tax, I was curious as to what the Minister's budget speech this year would contain in relation to the proposal made a year ago to abolish income tax altogether on Irish industrial undertakings.  The part of the proposal which, I think, had soundness in it, was that suggesting preference in respect to income tax to investors in Irish industries, and particularly to make allowance to the fullest extent far every halfpenny that was reinvested in the capital undertaking.  I think that portion of the Cork proposals of a year ago was sound and worthy of favourable consideration.  I looked forward with some anticipation to the introduction of that idea into the income tax proposals of this year. Instead of that we have the income tax maintained at a flat rate, except so far as super-tax is concerned, and super-tax payers get a distinct advantage. But then there was also a distinct hope that the Minister would have been more generous in his allowance in respect to children, and particularly in respect to children whose education was being considered.</P>
    <P>That section of the community is much more entitled to benefits in the way of reduction than super-tax payers.  I regret that the Minister has not seen his way to meet the lower income taxpayer in respect to remissions, particularly remissions in the case of families and school-going children. That is a matter on which, I hope, we shall have something to say later, but I leave it to the consideration of the Minister, trusting that even yet he will meet the case made on that behalf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the betting tax, it seems to me that the arguments which have been used against that tax are quite sound, in exactly the same way as arguments used against every tax in the Finance Bill may be regarded as being sound.  It does not seem to me that disastrous results will flow from the introduction of this tax any more than disastrous results flowed from other taxes.  My broad criticism of this Bill is that which I have adopted in connection with the subject from the very first, namely, <Col N="311" /> that the burden of taxation which we are called upon to bear by the operation of these taxes is very heavy and our aim ought to be, as far as possible, to lighten it.  I do not propose to do more than to say that the betting tax is, I am sure, a very unpleasant one and one which will not be very popular among people who bet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that these are very unselfish people by considering the whole State as apart from the individuals.  Deputy Gorey argues that this tax is going to injure horse-breeding and its adjunct, horse-racing.  I do not believe that that is going to happen any more than in the case of the forecasts made at the inception of other taxes, which very often resulted in a satisfactory income being drawn from these sources, to such an extent, indeed that the Minister has been attracted in the direction of making them unbearable. That is what happened in the case of the motor duties.  All that Deputy Gorey has said in connection with the suppression of horse-breeding and horse-racing can be applied by me, with even greater force, to the question of motor duties.  I recognise that, so far as the Dáil is concerned, Deputies in all quarters are adamant on the subject of heavy motors on roads.  There may be one or two Deputies who are not, but the general cry is to shove these motors off the roads altogether. The roads, apparently, are only to be ornamental and must not be injured. The Minister in regard to the tax on motor lorries has in my opinion, accepted the principle of taxing them out of existence.  What happens there is that, in the case of a car which in the past paid about £30, the owner will now be called upon to pay £117.  That is a very steep increase, an increase which, in my opinion, will probably drive these cars off the road altogether. I am, of course, expressing only my own opinion on the matter, but when I am talking to Deputies here I may as well be talking to a stone wall.  I do not think that my opinion will influence <Col N="312" /> the Government on one side, or Deputies on the other.</P>
      <P>The main thing, of course, is that the whole gamut of the taxes is very unacceptable to the individual who has to pay, but in the assessment of the levy I think the Minister has been rather hard on the motors.  I think he has not been as hard in connection with the betting tax as we would be led to believe, but I do not wish to say that those who express the opinion that the betting tax is going to damage horse-breeding and horse-racing do not believe that it is going to do so.  In my view, however, I think that the injury which they expect to be done by the tax is exaggerated.  As regards the question which Deputy Johnson raised about the super-taxpayers, I think it has been thrashed out before. I think, so far as business is concerned, that if income-tax and super-tax are continued at their present rates, they will have, as they have had, a crippling effect on the development of business.  It is quite true that anything that the Minister misses in connection with super-tax is certainly got back on death duties.  These duties in connection with property are very heavy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is arguing in the same way as the Minister, that the super-taxpayer, to whom is remitted certain proportion of the tax now being charged, is thereby better off when alive, but that his estate pays for it on his death.  I want to know whether a super-taxpayer receiving, say, £100, more to spend during this coming year, is necessarily a man whose estate is going to pay higher estate duties on his death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so, but Deputy Johnson will, I think, recognise, that those whom you may call super-tax people are more likely, as regards their income, to spend more in the development of industry, or at all events in the accumulation of capital, which will ultimately benefit the Exchequer when they shuffle off the mortal coil.  If a person spends it, the actual spending of it benefits, I suppose, more people in his lifetime to a <Col N="313" /> greater degree than the Government would benefit.  The circulation of money is always beneficial to the community. Except on these broad lines which I have indicated, I think that the time is too late to criticise the incidence of taxation which is placed on the shoulders of the people by this Bill. In my opinion, the hope of relief lies more in the development of the country and in the development of industry, and also in the development of farming than in anything which can be said against these particular taxes. I quite agree with Deputy Johnson as to the need of fostering education in every direction and of a rearrangement of the income tax allowances which will induce and promote better education among the coming generations.</P>

      <P>In the proposals under review in the Finance Bill submitted by the Minister for Finance, I feel that there is a general appreciation of the continuance of the tariff duties of last year.  I desire to express my regret that a further extension has not been made in that direction other than the items included in the Bill.  As to the general tariffs which were imposed last year, it may be the opinion of many that it is too soon to pass judgment on the results, but I think that, having regard to the amount of employment that has been given and the consequent increased production of the goods protected, these tariffs have justified their imposition.</P>
      <P>As regards immature spirits, I may point out that there is a considerable quantity of Scotch whiskey imported into the Saorstát and I consider that the law ought to be amended so that each vessel&mdash;which would include bottles&mdash;in which this whiskey is exposed for sale should have thereon a certificate stating the respective quantities of pot and patent whiskeys in the ingredient.  It would have the effect of letting the public know that they were receiving mainly patent whiskey and it would have a deterrent effect on its consumption.  Another advantage would be that it would be necessary to have Scotch whiskey bottled in the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now as to representatives of foreign <Col N="314" /> manufacturing firms, in the Saorstát there is a considerable number of men who have taken the places of those Irishmen who were representing Irish firms, and I would urge on the Minister to consider the matter of imposing a licence on commercial travellers or agents who do not permanently reside in the Saorstát.  There are well established precedents in other countries for the licensing of commercial travellers. In South Africa they have such a licence.  Commercial travellers are allowed to pursue their calling on holding a certificate of such a licence. The payment is something like £100 in the first year.  I am glad the Minister granted exemption of corset component parts as it will mean a considerable impetus to a new Dublin industry. I am sorry that he did not also give the application for the extension of taxes on blankets and quilts, and confectionery bottles.  However, I presume he has given the fullest consideration to the many applications put before him and in his wisdom considers that he has done the best under existing circumstances.</P>
    <P>As regards the betting tax, I must express my approval of the principle. I believe it will clear away a good deal of the irregularities that have taken place in the past regarding betting. But I am not sufficiently acquainted with the details of the tax to express an opinion on it.  I believe there is strong feeling against the point that has been referred to by Deputy Shaw, that is, as regards racecourse meetings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephEgan" hpid="Mr. P.J. EGAN Mr. P.J. EGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good deal of discussion on the question of the betting tax, and I do not think I could throw very much light on it by virtue of any experience I have had in the matter.  But I would like to say that I thoroughly approve of the general principle to tax betting, because betting is a very definite luxury, and I think it is very much fairer that a thing like betting should be taxed than that the poor man's bottle of stout should be taxed.  With regard to the particular method of putting on a betting tax it does appear to me at first sight that five per cent. on every individual transaction is a fairly high tax. I can understand a tax on profits, but <Col N="315" /> to put a tax on losses appears to me to be a little severe.  I have consulted various people connected with the racing industry, and numbers of them appear to think that the tax will have a very serious effect on the horse-breeding industry.  I do not follow them the whole way in their exposition of the case, but I would think it a pity that anything should be done to injure the horse-breeding industry.  My idea about a tax on betting is that I would tax as severely as possible the sort of betting that is done away from racecourses, because, to my knowledge, a good deal of harm is done in that way. A great many people go astray and back horses with money they cannot afford.  I am rather inclined to think, owing to the semi-legal position that is going to be given to betting now, that very probably there will be an increase in the type of betting that is done away from racecourses, and that, in my opinion, will do a great deal of harm.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson mentioned that he was opposed to the reduction of the super-tax.  I think if he looks into the matter a little more closely he will see that a reduction of the super-tax is likely to help industry.  There is no question about it that a reduction of the super-tax will bring a certain number of people who have left this country back to live in it.  Quite a number of people are attracted to Ireland by hunting, shooting, fishing and sport of various kinds.  Numbers of them who used to spend their surplus incomes in amusing themselves in Ireland left the country.  I think a reduction of the super-tax will be one of the things that will bring back a number of these people, and it will bring a greater circulation of money into the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things that makes it difficult to pay great attention to the arguments of the opponents of the betting tax is the extreme way in which they put their case.  There certainly is not the slightest possibility that this tax will finish racing, either in six months, twelve months or twelve years.  If it were possible to stop betting altogether <Col N="316" /> you would not stop racing.  You would certainly restrict racing but you would not stop it.  Racing does not depend, as Deputy Cooper put it, entirely on betting.  One has only to look at the attendance, for instance, at the horse jumping competition at Ballsbridge or at any other horse jumping competitions to see that there are people and considerable numbers of people who will attend races even if betting is not carried on.  The extent to which this tax will reduce the number of bets is extremely doubtful. The illustration that Deputy Johnson put forward will apply in many cases. The tax will not deter people from betting but there are bets which I mentioned earlier and which I believe will cease to be made with a 5 per cent. tax.  Where a man formerly put on £100 to win £10, if the tax is to be payable on £100 I believe that type of bet will practically cease.  There will be, I believe, a decrease in the volume of betting.  Deputy Byrne talked about the man who in the course of the day invested £600.  With the tax in operation he will not invest £600, because the odds that he will get will be shorter.  If he starts with a certain sum of money he will have less to reinvest. He will invest less than he invested formerly, but it will not necessarily keep him away from betting. Deputy Gorey supplied me with an argument which seems to me to show the unreasonable character of the opposition.  He talked about people who a few years ago at coursing matches bet in thousands but who now bet in £10 notes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies equally. They pay no licence and now they are betting in £10 notes.  I suppose if they were poorer they would go lower and bet in £5 notes.  Even if you have a falling off in attendances at race meetings it does not follow that you are going to have a serious decline.  A number of people who go to races go purely for the outing.  Whether they are going to invest £5 or £50 does not matter very much to them.  Five pounds will, as they say, give them an <Col N="317" /> interest in the races, just as £50 will give them an interest in the races.  I think the suggestion that this 5 per cent. tax could by any chance kill racing is ridiculous.  I believe that there is not any danger that it will seriously injure racing.  I believe it would be a serious thing if you had not sufficient racing to keep horse-breeding at the point at which it is, but, on the other hand, I do not think it can be argued that it is absolutely necessary that every one of the hundred and fifty race meetings that are held in the Free State should be continued.  Some of these meetings are of no value from the horse-breeding point of view.  Some of them are held in places that do not attract any horses from outside at all. A few old stagers go round the course and the whole thing is rigged.</P>

      <P>I do not see why the bookmakers should be relieved of the tax.  The position that is put up in connection with the betting tax is that they will agree to anything except the tax.  That rather tends to arouse my suspicion.  One can get no reason from the people who are opposing this tax for their attitude.  They say 5 per cent. is too much.  Somebody who gave evidence before the Select Committee set up in England said that half per cent. would be too much.  You cannot deal with the mentality that is responsible for that attitude.</P>

      <P>Betting in the towns does not affect racing in the country. What keeps racing going in the country is the money realised at the gates.  That is what enables the stakes to be put up.

    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Cooper said, a sport like <Col N="319" /> horse-racing has a very definite hold on the people.  All the efforts of the police cannot eradicate another practice which can hardly be described as a sport.  I noticed where people recently attended a cock-fight adjacent to Dublin.  Where any sort of a sport is popular, or where a practice which can hardly be described as a sport is popular, people will follow it even under the greatest difficulties.</P>

      <P>No.  A Deputy said he hoped that if we were going to do anything that would be injurious to racing&mdash;and he believed the betting tax would be&mdash;he believed we should do something towards increasing the stakes.  I have already said that if we found that we were getting an unexpectedly large sum from this tax, or if we found that it was seriously affecting in an adverse way the attendance at race-meetings, and, consequently, the funds available for keeping racing going, we would be prepared to consider the putting up of a substantial amount by way of increasing stakes.</P>

      <P>No, not betting.  After all, betting is only indirectly connected with racing.  The stakes are a very important thing.  If the stakes cannot be maintained at a reasonable level, racing will undoubtedly fall off.  On the other hand, if you could have stakes, the attendance on the course would not matter seriously.  As I have said, only experience can resolve the doubt that exists as to whether any appreciably adverse effect will follow from the imposition of this tax or not. I have heard nothing from the opponents of the tax that would convince me.  They start out by asking us to assume that this five per cent. tax will kill racing.  They then proceed to argue about the necessity of racing to the horse-breeding industry and about the value of the horse-breeding industry to the country.  Those latter are points on which we are in agreement with them.  The type of argument <Col N="320" /> Deputy Johnson put forward is one which the opponents of this tax decline to meet.  I have not seen the argument met by anybody.</P>

That is a matter I would have to consider.</P>

      <P>If they back a good thing, I am sure they will be quite willing to have the five per cent. tax paid on the bet.  Deputy Cooper referred to the importation of charabancs and motor lorries across the Border.  This whole matter of the duty-free, temporary importation of lorries and cars is receiving consideration. We are acting under British regulations which came into force in 1915.  They are regulations which, of course, did not contemplate a land frontier, and they are not, perhaps, entirely suitable for the circumstances that exist in the Saorstát.  We are examining those regulations with a view to recasting them.  At present, the position simply is that there is no legal power to allow a lorry or car to enter when owned by a person resident in the Free State.  There is power to allow, temporarily, a car owned by a person outside the Free State, to enter. The position of a firm having a branch here and a branch outside the Saorstát is that they are regarded as residents here.  Before the position was understood, certain cars were allowed in and bonds were taken.  That was discovered to be wrong, and it had to be stopped <Col N="322" /> once we obtained legal advice as to the effect of the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole matter is being examined, but I do not know that I can indicate that I will take a view favourable to the people who have been circularising Deputies.  There are difficulties in meeting their case, or perhaps I should say, in providing for what they want.  At present a lorry imported temporarily can be kept a considerable time and a firm could use practically a whole fleet of lorries and avoid paying import duty if it established a branch here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the position not be met by providing for a certain deposit which would be forfeited if the lorry. did not return within a limited time?  I may say that I have not been circularised by anybody.  I have been interviewed, and I have gone into the case with some care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I dare say the matter could be met in various ways.  It is really a question of seeing what are the maximum facilities that can be given to people without endangering the revenue and without introducing anomalies.  The lorries would not have to pay tax every time they came in.  If they paid tax once&mdash;and they would be only charged tax on the value of the body&mdash;they could come and go without having to pay tax again.  The Deputy referred to the sixpenny duty on parcels.  There are two sixpenny duties.  As regards the postal delivery fee, it is not intended to drop that.  We feel that this tax is fully justified, in view of the cost of the postal service and the loss sustained on parcels post work&mdash;particularly on parcels coming from outside the country.  The greater part of the work of handling those parcels falls on the Post Office, which has to deliver them, and the loss is consequently greater.  There is then the Customs Entry Duty.  That is a tax which did not produce the results we had hoped as regards reducing the excessive number of small parcels brought in.  But it yields £40,000 of <Col N="323" /> revenue, and just at the moment we do not feel like dropping it.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that another loan should be issued.  I might say that, in the ordinary course, I should not think of issuing a loan until a great part of the loan could be absorbed immediately. Once the Exechequer were empty, the procedure would be to borrow temporarily and when temporary borrowings had reached a substantial figure, to make a new issue of National Loan.  But to issue £10,000,000 of loan at present would simply result in a very substantial balance remaining in the Exchequer, on which we would be paying 5¼ per cent., and on which we would be getting a rate of interest very much less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say what rate of interest is paid on temporary borrowings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Not more than 5¼ per cent.  We are able to use for telephone capital certain funds like the Teachers' Pensions Fund very satisfactorily.  These advances are paid within a comparatively short and stated period.  They suit the working of the Pensions Fund very well, and I do not think it would be desirable to interfere with that.  I do not think that I need refer any further to Deputy Johnson's argument in relation to the reduced super-tax and the increased estate duty, but I would ask him to look at the matter from another angle. If a person comes into an estate now and pays high estate duty we are simply letting him recoup himself by reducing the super-tax.  That is the converse of the case that Deputy Johnson quoted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>In the great majority of the cases where estate duty will be charged at the increased rate they will be liable to super-tax.  I admitted last year that it would be desirable, if possible, to increase the allowance for children.  I can only say that the general position of revenue and expenditure <Col N="324" /> does not seem to admit of it.  We could only do it by getting further revenue.  If this betting tax yields as well as we expect we might hope to do it.</P>

      <P>Well, it may do very well.  Deputy Doyle made certain suggestions about Scotch whiskey.  I do not know that it would be very desirable to take steps directed at making impossible the trade in Scotch whiskey in the country.  If the distilling trade here is to get back to any really prosperous position, it can only do so by increased exports and by inducing people in England to return to some considerable extent to the consumption of Irish whiskey.  It is not the trade in whiskey that would be done in Ireland that would make the distilling trade here prosperous, and I do not think, if we face up to the position in that way, that it would be desirable to make unduly difficult the carrying on here of the trade in Scotch whiskey. Scotch whiskey has not the advantages that it is supposed to have.  There is a notion abroad that Irish whiskey can be sold at not more than 25 under proof and that Scotch whiskey can be sold at 30 under proof.  As a matter of fact Irish whiskey can be sold under the same conditions as Scotch whiskey if the people in the trade desire to do so. The condition is that the bottle be marked with the strength of the whiskey sold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, provided the bottle is marked.  The law in regard to the strength of whiskey applies equally to Irish and Scotch whiskies.  There is no difference except that, as a matter of practice, Scotch whiskey is sold at 30 under proof.  On the other hand, the policy has been that Irish whiskey should be sold at 25 under proof. There are what you might call two <Col N="325" /> standards in regard to it, and I know that the Irish distillers are against the policy of selling at anything lower than 25.  But it is not a matter of a legal privilege for Scotch.  It is simply a matter of practice.</P>

I do not know that I should like to agree with the suggestion that there should be a duty on commercial travellers; at least I would like to hear a good deal more in justification of the suggestion before I would consider it. There are some people, unfortunately, whose only notion of beating a rival is to hit him with a brickbat, and it is just possible that it would be as well to leave the Irish commercial travellers to beat their rivals by commercial traveller methods.</P>

      <P>Last night if I had another half-minute I think I would have finished my statement.  As far as I remember, I answered all the points raised, particularly by Deputy Johnson, except one, and that is one that it is practically impossible to answer.  Deputy Johnson raised the point of our position in case of war. The Deputy may remember that on 5th February the same question was raised, and I said at the time that as regards actual participation, the point was covered by Article 49 of the Constitution, and as to legal or technical war, it was a thing that was very doubtful and was largely dictated by brute facts.  Deputy Johnson himself, I think, pointed out that public opinion in the Dominions was tending very largely towards the assertion of a position whereby the Dominions would not be either technically or legally at war necessarily by the fact that Great Britain was at war.  That is the opinion certainly, but I think so far it cannot be given as a definition.  I think the whole trend of things will tend to make that opinion a fact.  How far as a fact it will have any reality in the case of war it is very hard to say.  It would be a valuable thing to have it established that the Free State would not be even technically at war, but from the point of view of utility the position of the Falkland Islands would be much more effective.  I can only say that the general growth of opinion is towards the point maintained by Deputy Johnson, namely, that it would be possible for Great Britain to be at war and other Dominions not to be even technically at war, but I do not think that is a thing that so far can be laid down as an actual definition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say a few words to support the Minister in not laying down any definite formula as to our participation in wars.  The Constitution is perfectly clear that we cannot be involved in war, except in case of invasion, without the consent of the Oireachtas.  But war over-rides all rules.  There are citizens of the Saorstát on ships at sea, and those ships may be sunk and the lives of citizens of the Saorstát may be lost.  There are citizens of the Saorstát earning their living in foreign countries.  In case of war with Great Britain, those foreign countries may disregard the fact that they are nationals and not nationals of Great Britain, and imprison them.  We must review the situation as it arises, and we cannot lay down formulas in advance.  The provision in the Constitution is sufficient to safeguard us, and so I think the Minister is wise in not committing himself definitely to any precise definition of our position in the case of war.  You cannot do so. But we can and should work for peace, and we can do more, I believe, by reason of our position in the British Commonwealth of Nations than if we were an isolated power.  I have an intense hatred of war because I have seen war.  I have an intense desire for peace, and I believe that instead of formulating our position in Ireland we shall do far better for ourselves and far better for the world if we keep ourselves free always to discourage war and always to work for peace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Standing Order 93, I beg to move to refer back this Estimate for reconsideration to the Minister.  I do so on several grounds, on the grounds of the illegality of this Estimate, on the grounds of the negligence of his Department and on the grounds of waste of public money.  In the first place, with regard to the illegality, Deputies have been asked to vote this sum of money for the Department of External Affairs, and presumably they consider that in doing so they are voting it for a Department such as is defined by law in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  It is my contention and belief that the Department as at present constituted and administered is <Col N="328" /> not a Department as defined by law under sub-section (11) of Section 1 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act.</P>
      <P>Perhaps for the information of the House I might read out that section which defines the position and the functions of the Department for which Deputies think they are voting this money.  This sub-section says: &ldquo;The Department of External Affairs, which shall comprise the administration and business generally of public services in connection with communications and transactions between the Government of Saorstát Eireann and the Government of any other State or nation, diplomatic and consular representation of Saorstát Eireann in any country or place, international amenities, the granting of passports and of visés to passports, and all powers, duties and functions connected with the same.&rdquo;  It is my contention that the Department, as at present administered, does not fulfil the conditions required by the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  I had thought for a moment that Section 12 of that Act, which makes it possible for the Executive Council, by Order, to distribute functions and duties amongst the different Departments, that it perhaps could have saved this Department from any charge of illegality in the conduct of its affairs, but I find that in the sub-section to Section 12 any such decision by the Executive Council must be communicated to the Oireachtas, and the Order of the Executive Council to that effect must be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words in the Act are: &ldquo;This Department has control of communications and transactions between the Government of Saorstát Eireann and the Government of any other State or Nation, and all powers, duties and functions connected with the same.&rdquo; It is quite obvious that such a Department is necessary in a sovereign State. If that were the case there would be less objection to this Vote than there has been in the Press and elsewhere and as has been expressed also in the Dáil within the last few years.  I am convinced that the most important section of our external affairs includes &ldquo;communications and transactions between <Col N="329" /> the Government of the Saorstát and the Government of any other State or Nation, and the powers, duties and functions connected with the same&rdquo;. I contend that these &ldquo;communications and transactions&rdquo; are not under the control of the Department for which we are asked to vote this money.  As a matter of fact, we have several Ministers for External Affairs in this country. We have the President of the Executive Council, the secretariat of the Executive Council; we had, until recently, when he became a financier, Deputy Duggan; we have also the Governor-General; lastly, we have the Minister; the least important is the Minister, who is officially designated as Minister for External Affairs.  I do not suggest, and I do not wish it to be implied, that the Governor-General exerts any influence in any way as regards the relations of this country.  I would not wish it to be understood that he acts in any way contrary to the opinions and advice of the Executive Council.  But I do maintain that he fulfils the requirements under the Act by being at any rate one of the Ministers for External Affairs, seeing he does control &ldquo;administration and business generally of public services in connection with the communications and transactions between the Government of Saorstát Eireann and the Government of any other State or nation.&rdquo; That likewise applies to the President and to the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>I have on many occasions drawn the attention of the Dáil and the Government to this anomaly, this confusion, this lack of unification and control of our relations with, in particular, the Government of the United Kingdom.  I am convinced that that lack of uniformity has resulted in many unfortunate disasters&mdash;I might almost term them so&mdash;to this country during the last few years.  It is admitted in all parts of the House, I am sure, that our relations with Great Britain and Northern Ireland are amongst the most important and essential interests of the State at the present time.  It is intolerable that those relations should be conducted in an inefficient and a confused manner by several Departments of State.  If my information is correct, <Col N="330" /> the greater part of the communications and transactions between this State, the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland are not conducted by the Department of External Affairs but are conducted by some other Departments, whereas minor transactions do come within the purview of the Department whose Vote we are discussing.</P>

      <P>I am convinced that this Department does not control all communications between this State and any other State or Nation.  If that is the case, this Department is reduced to the position of being practically redundant and unnecessary.  It is reduced to the position&mdash;many people have stated that it is the position occupied by the Department at the present time&mdash;of being an advisory committee on etiquette, and its advice is not always accepted. An example of the absence of control in this Department over our relations with Great Britain was given during the negotiations, the communications and transactions, in connection with the Boundary Pact last December. When the majority of the members of the Executive Council were in London communicating and transacting business with the British Government, it was noticeable that one Minister who was not in that position was the Minister who, according to the Ministers and Secretaries Act, is supposed to conduct the communications and transactions with external Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This absence of uniformity, this confusion in Government Buildings, has <Col N="331" /> been the cause of many misfortunes to this country, from the point of view of developing and defending the national status.  I do not know what resources this Assembly possesses; I do not know if there are any means whereby the Dáil can force the Executive Council to carry out the law inside Government Buildings.  I have consulted legal opinion on the matter.  One very distinguished person suggested that the only method was a petition of right, whatever that may mean.  Apparently we have no means of seeing that the laws passed by the Oireachtas are carried out by the Government inside Government Buildings.  That is the first point I would like to make in connection with this Estimate.  I am convinced that this Department does not fulfil all the functions and duties necessary and has not got all the powers as defined in the Ministers and Secretaries Act.</P>
    <P>With regard to the negligence of this Department, I notice in the Estimates that a considerable sum is expected to be obtained by passport fees and visa fees in the United States. Passports are issued by the Governor-General of the Irish Free State, and on the first page of that passport His Excellency requests and requires in the name of his Britannic Majesty that all assistance shall be given to the bearer of the passport.  It has come to my knowledge that in every quarter of the globe these passports are ignored and insulted by British Consuls, representatives of his Britannic Majesty, in spite of the categorical requests and requirements of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State demanding that the bearer of the passport should be given every facility.  Whenever the bearer of an Irish passport in a foreign country does not possess on his passport the visa for going to some country to which he wishes to go, he has to go to the British Consul, and the British Consul refuses to recognise the passport issued by the Governor-General of the Irish Free State.  He says that he will accept it as evidence of British nationality. He confiscates the passport and issues a British passport on which he adds the visa to the country to which the person requires to go.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> This has been going on since the time that Irish passports were issued, and it is an intolerable situation.  We are supposed to be a co-equal member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and when passports are issued by the Governor-General of the Free State and the Governor-General's signature is insulted and ignored by every twopenny-ha'penny passport official throughout the whole world&mdash;I only refer to passport officials of the British Empire&mdash;I think it is high time for the Department of External Affairs to see that that state of affairs is remedied. That has been going on for two years, and it is high time it was put an end to.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters I could refer to&mdash;matters of negligence. It is a fact that paid officials of the British Foreign Office conduct at the present time&mdash;in the year 1926&mdash;propaganda against the financial stability of this State in foreign countries.  These are matters which should be protested against amongst our co-equal and friendly neighbours in the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy give us a little more information on that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to give long extracts, if Deputies wish. I have not them with me, I am sorry to say, but I am prepared to give them to the Minister and to Deputies.  In practically all the countries of Europe, the new countries and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, there is a Government publication issued in the French language which gives information about that particular country for the benefit of foreigners coming in or foreigners living in the country.</P>
      <P>I would mention such papers as &ldquo;Gazette de Prague&rdquo; (CzechoSlovakia), &ldquo;La Bulgarie&rdquo; (Bulgaria), &ldquo;La Pologne&rdquo; (Warsaw), &ldquo;Argus&rdquo; (Bucharest), &ldquo;Message d'Athénes&rdquo; (Greece), &ldquo;Bouyouk Yol&rdquo; (Constantinople). Nearly all these papers have got British correspondents who write every week a British letter, and these correspondents, from the information which I have received, are in many cases, officials of the British Foreign Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> There are other papers in America to which the same applies, and I have taken the trouble to subscribe to these papers, and repeatedly, almost every week, the British correspondents engage in jibes and attacks on this State, on its financial stability, and on its commercial prospects with regard to trade.  These correspondents are, as I have said, officials of the British Government. There is another matter which deserves attention.  I presume this Department, although it has not control of our external affairs and does not fulfil the requirements of the Act, is supposed to see that international obligations are fulfilled by this country towards other countries, as well as by other countries towards us.  There is an international engagement which, in spite of the opposition of many Deputies of this House, was passed last December, and it has been registered at the League of Nations, namely, the Treaty Confirmation (Amending) Agreement Act, 1925.  The fifth article of that agreement refers to a matter which Deputy Johnson has often raised in this House, namely, the abolition of the Council of Ireland and the meetings between the Governments of the Irish Free State and of Northern Ireland, as and when necessary, for the purpose of considering matters of common interest arising out of, or connected with the exercise and administration of the powers of the Council of Ireland in regard to Northern Ireland. That article, as the spokesmen of the British Government announced in the British Parliament, was inserted at the express request of the Irish delegates to that furtive conference, and it was held out to us here in the Dáil as a valuable link in keeping the two parts of Ireland together.</P>
    <P>It is now six months since that agreement, wise or foolish, was accepted by the Oireachtas, and there has been no sign on the part of the Executive Council of any attempt to meet the Government of Northern Ireland for the purpose of fulfilling Article 5 of that agreement.  It was mentioned in the Press that a visit was paid by Deputy Duggan to the Northern Parliament, but that could not be considered as fulfilling the requirements of this article. <Col N="334" /> Of course it is quite probable that there is no department in Government Buildings considering our relations with Northern Ireland.  We have, at least, heard of none, and presumably there is none.  As I understand, Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State are drifting more and more apart. There is no political hostility, but each section of the country is ignoring the other.  This article was held out to the Dáil as containing a hope of ultimate unity, but since that time, apparently, the Executive Council have come to the conclusion that it served its purpose in order to enable this agreement to be passed through the Dáil, and it may safely be relegated to oblivion.  If this Department, for which we are asked to vote this money, is supposed to look after our external relations and commitments one would suppose that it would have taken some steps to see that that article would be carried out. Apparently, from the information we have received, it has done nothing of the kind.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with the waste of this Department to which I would like to refer, and that is, the fact that we are asked to pay over £15,000 for representation in the United States of America.  Yet any legal documents which have to pass from this country to the United States and through Great Britain, in connection with aliens and in connection with all forms of property transactions, with the fees attached thereto, have to pass, not through our representatives, for whom we are paying £15,000, but through the British consuls. That is an anomalous state of affairs</P>
    <P>These notarial functions, which are among the principal functions of consuls in every part of the world and for which substantial fees are charged and given to the Exchequers of the countries concerned, are denied to our ornamental representatives for whose upkeep the taxpayers are asked to pay £15,000.  There are many other items which could be referred to, but, in conclusion, I would like again to stress the fact that this Department is not fulfilling the requirements under the Act establishing it.  At the time of the <Col N="335" /> passing of that Act, Deputy Heffernan, I think, put down an amendment to the effect that this Department should be placed under the Executive Council. It was before the split in the Government Party and, though a member of the Government Party at that time, I could not bring myself to vote against that amendment as I felt it was right.  I felt convinced that there could be no unity, no intelligent coordination of our relations with Great Britain, unless they were all brought under one Department.  That has not been done.  The result is that there has been chaos, and there still is chaos, while the results to the country have been unfortunate, and, apparently, it is intended to continue the same system.  On those grounds, and because I believe that this is a very great weakness in the administration of the country and the whole national position, I move that this Vote be referred back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments of the Deputy are very good except for one flaw&mdash;they are mostly based on non-facts.  All forms from the British Government to the Irish Government and from the Irish Government to the British pass through the Department of External Affairs.  It is true that despatches sent by us to Great Britain bear the Governor-General's signature. I quite agree that that is an anomaly. Deputy Esmonde was not here last evening when I referred to certain anomalies and said that one was that in connection with the office of the Governor-General, which arose from the fact that originally the office was an office of the British Colonial Office, that it has devolved entirely from that position, but that certain things remain. It is true that when we send despatches to Great Britain the Governor-General's signature is upon them, but we do not recognise his right to alter one word or comma in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that despatch sent by the Minister's Department direct to the Governor-General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and no other Department.  Many despatches <Col N="336" /> dealing with technical matters in other Departments are drafted first by those Departments, and they come to our Department which, as you might say, &ldquo;vets&rdquo; them.  They go to the Governor-General, who sends them to England.  I agree with the Deputy that it is anomalous that they should pass through the Governor-General, but, as I say, we do not recognise the Governor-General's right to alter one word or comma in those despatches. The Deputy referred to the position in regard to passports.  Passports contain a request to give to the person visiting a foreign country the usual amenities.  When Irish visitors go to Great Britain my information is that they receive those amenities.  The Deputy has an unfortunate habit, not exactly of departing from the truth, but of indulging in considerable exaggeration. We have had some cases where the British consuls refused their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give a single case where the consul did not refuse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are many cases where the consul has not refused, but there are a number of cases where he has refused.  I do not know that they have been as many as the Deputy suggests.  We certainly have had a number of cases.  In China, for instance, I think the French Consul acts for a Swiss citizen.  It is a courtesy arrangement.  We do not pay the salaries of British Consuls but generally, in the case of the Dominions, the British Consul, as an act of courtesy, does service for the bearer of the passport.  In a number of cases he has not done it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot insist upon a person performing an act of courtesy.  We have no right, that I can see, to demand that a British Consul appointed by the British Government, acting for the British Government, and paid by the British Government, should give services to our citizens.  I think the British Government makes a very bad mistake. I referred here last night to the need, in so far as unity is necessary in the Commonwealth, that that unity can only be got by unanimity and unanimity <Col N="337" /> can only be based on lack of friction. I think this courtesy is a courtesy which, in the circumstances, could be expected.  It is not a thing that we can claim.  It is a thing we think possibly we might be justified in expecting and in being disappointed at not receiving, but we have no right to claim it.  That is one of the points that might be cleared up in October.  Another matter which should be dealt with in October&mdash;whether it will be finally cleared up is another thing&mdash;is this very matter the Deputy referred to of the Governor-General signing dispatches. A British Consul, the Deputy said, confiscated passports.  I have not heard of a case of his confiscating a passport.  I have heard of a case where he misrepresented the case to the bearer of the passport.  He suggested that there was something wrong with the passport and that the best thing for him to do would be to issue another passport.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also used his habit of grotesque exaggeration in connection with another matter.  He said that almost without exception every week in these propaganda papers conducted by Eastern European countries in the French language an article written, he tells us fairly clearly, by a British Consular representative, contains propaganda against the financial stability of the Irish Free State.  That may have happened.  If the Deputy would come along and bring me conclusive proof&mdash; that I could myself use&mdash;that an article in such a paper containing such propaganda has been written by a British official, I shall certainly take steps in the matter.  We have had many suggestions of acts which might be considered more or less unfriendly by British Consular agents.  To deal with cases like that you have to have conclusive proof.  People come and tell me that somebody else's mother was travelling, but when we try to get something that we could base a case on we do not succeed.  If the Deputy is prepared to come along and prove his statement it will enable me to act.  His statement was that almost weekly, in all these papers, British Consular agents or Consular officials&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I never mentioned <Col N="338" /> Consular officials.  The Minister, I think, is exaggerating what I said.  I would be very glad to supply him with great numbers of these articles, which, I understand, have been written by paid officials of the British Government, whether in that particular country or in London.  I would be very glad to bring them to his notice, but I would suggest that it ought to be the duty of the Minister for External Affairs, and not of any private Deputy, to find out these matters.</P>

      <P>I might be permitted to digress and tell a story about a man who was up before a judge. &ldquo;Do you always do this?&rdquo; the judge asked him.  &ldquo;Yes, my lord, always,&rdquo; was the reply.  &ldquo;Remember now, you are speaking on oath,&rdquo; said the judge. &ldquo;Do you always do it?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes, my lord, almost always,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Almost always?&rdquo; asked the judge. &ldquo;Yes, my lord, nearly almost always,&rdquo; replied the man.  I am afraid if we are to discuss much further something like that will happen.  The Deputy undoubtedly clearly suggested that articles appeared weekly, or almost weekly, and that they were written by Consular officials.</P>

      <P>Let him come along and give me the evidence that I can base a despatch on.  Let him give me the names, the dates, and the proof that these men wrote the articles.  We strongly suspect all sorts of things.  I have often seen a man get out from court when everybody felt quite definitely that he was guilty, but it is another matter to prove it.  &ldquo;Almost every week&rdquo; were the words of the Deputy.  I think those were the chief points he brought up.  I quite agree as regards the Governor-General.  Last night I referred in general terms to a great many anomalies of that kind.  I suggest the fact that the Governor-General's signature is affixed to a despatch does not in any way mean that he controls those despatches.  The Department answerable for them and that <Col N="339" /> sees whether they are in order is my Department, and the Department from which most of them originate is the Department of which I am in control. The Deputy also mixes up Ministers with Departments.  Most of the negotiations are not done individually by Ministers.  Most of our negotiations in London are done by the High Commissioner. The Executive Council or the Department of External Affairs reserve the right to use anybody that in their opinion is a suitable person as their agents.  Many Ministers have been over in connection with matters relating to their Departments or to Executive Council matters in general. It is not necessary, for instance, that I should go over to argue the question of double income tax.  Usually an expert official goes over.  He does his business and reports to the High Commissioner what he has done.  The High Commissioner is not an expert on double income tax.  It is a thing that very few are expert in.  There is general responsibility in the Executive Council, and the Executive Council as a whole, or my Department as a Department, uses various agents.  It does not follow that only the Minister for External Affairs will have any dealings with other countries.</P>
      <P>As to the meeting with the representatives of Northern Ireland, first of all it is a thing that should be made clear that Northern Ireland is not foreign or it is not a State.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty about dealing with Northern Ireland&mdash; I am sure the Deputy will appreciate it&mdash;is that after the long and bitter feeling that was aroused in connection with the events of the last few years very little said and very little done would continue that bitter feeling.  It must, in my opinion, be allowed to subside. Things could be done much better without advertising them.  Nothing is being done.  If people thing that the <Col N="340" /> Executive Council has been wrong in that respect, I am prepared to take the blame of it, and I think it should be raised on my Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>The President anticipated what I was going to say, to some extent.  I do not think that the Treaty Amending Act stipulates that such a meeting shall take place in any given time.  I think while the Executive Council has the responsibility it must be regarded as the best judge of when the best time comes along.  The Dáil may move a resolution saying that they consider that such a time for such a meeting had already arrived.  As things are the Executive Council's opinion must be considered as of almost equal weight to that of Deputy Esmonde.  The Deputy also referred to the question of the consulate powers of our trade representatives in New York. Again in general terms I covered that position last night.  I quite agree that we should recognise no suggestion whatever that the Dominion Governments have not the power to appoint exequatur consuls in other countries.</P>

      <P>The Minister can perform all the functions performed by a Minister plenipotentiary of any country.  As regards the trade representative, there are certain functions which until he takes the position of an exequatur consul, he cannot perform. I think as we have appointed a Minister Plenipotentiary we can also have a certain fully qualified consul. I have stated here before that I am not in a great hurry provided I see things moving in the right direction.  I think the whole consulate question should be raised at the Imperial Conference.  I agree with the Deputy again that he is not an exequatur consul and cannot fulfil all the functions of an exequatur consul.  There was one minor point the Deputy slightly misrepresented.  He said the office in America cost the taxpayers here £15,000 a year.  The actual cost to the taxpayers here is something less than £5,000.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister give us a little more information on the <Col N="341" /> point that was raised by Deputy Esmonde, in which he was met, to some extent, regarding the confiscation of passports.  Deputy Esmonde stated that passports had been confiscated by British Consuls.  The Minister meets that by saying that he has no information of any such thing as confiscation, but, as I understood, he accepted the statement, modified to the extent that the consul suggested that the passport should be retained and another passport substituted.  I think I am stating the position clearly, but what I desire to know is whether if that is the position and the Minister was aware of it he took any steps to protest against that action and what was the result of that protest, because it does seem to me to involve a very important question&mdash; the status of the Free State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>To give a type of case, somebody is going to a country which does not require a visa, and in which there is no Free State representative. He requires to go from there to a country needing a visa.  He requires a signature or something like that from a Consular representative in a country, and he goes to the British Consul.  In our passports our citizen is described as &ldquo;a citizen of the Irish Free State and the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;  The British Government and most of the Dominions have on their passports &ldquo;British subject.&rdquo;  I myself am very doubtful as to whether there is anybody who can exactly be described as a British subject at all.  The form we use is in exact accord with the Treaty of the 6th December, 1921.  I am, therefore, satisfied that it is a perfectly adequate description.  The British Consuls act as though they have received instructions that they must not give facilities to anybody who is not described on the passport as a British subject.  Therefore, when our people require the services of a Consul he refuses them.  I <Col N="342" /> have heard, but I have no proof of it, that a Consul has said: &ldquo;This passport is not in order.  I will give you another passport.&rdquo;  I have heard that stated.  This has been the subject of considerable argument and protest between us and the British Government. Deputy Esmonde, I think, was with me once when we were in London arguing that particular point.  We cannot really claim this courtesy from the British Government but we have protested.  I think this is one of the many anomalies and possible causes of friction, misunderstanding and misrepresentation which should be cleared up at the Imperial Conference.  But I do not think there is any matter which we have protested more about than this matter.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, may I ask you, A Chinn Comhairle, to clarify the present situation. Deputy Esmonde has moved to refer back the Vote, under Standing Order 93, which says that it shall be in order, before entering on discussion of the items in a Vote, to move that the Estimate in question be referred back to the Minister.  If we have entered on discussion of the items Deputy Esmonde is, I presume, out of order.  If we have not entered on discussion of the items, then I had a motion on the Order Paper to reduce one item by £700.  It does not appear on the Order Paper to-day, but I would like to know exactly where we are.  Instead of talking about local government, I engaged in local government last night and, consequently, I missed some of the debate. I should be very grateful if you, A Chinn Comhairle, would rule whether the items have been entered upon or whether we are still to undertake that task.</P>

      <P>I was here last evening and I can assist you, A Chinn <Col N="343" /> Comhairle.  At ten o'clock last night we took up this Vote.  The Minister closed his introductory statement about 10.10 p.m.  Deputy Johnson raised some points.  Deputy Hall also raised some points and then the Minister was replying.  He had half a minute to go, but he could not restrain himself and crossed the boundary.  To-day we took up this Vote and the Minister completed the statement which he had intended to complete last night.  Deputy Esmonde came in and moved, under Standing Order 93, a motion to refer back the Estimate.  Having got that far, Deputy Johnson contributed to the debate and the Minister has replied. That is exactly the situation at the moment.</P>

      <P>I understood it was customary to deal with the Orders of the Day as they appear on the Order Paper.  Although there was no previous notice, about half a dozen Estimates were passed over last night and this Estimate was brought in. Encouragement was given to that course by Deputy Sir James Craig, who said that the Estimate had better be passed as quickly as possible, because Deputy Esmonde was not present.</P>

      <P>With the last point mentioned by Deputy Esmonde, I am not concerned.  It seems to me that a motion to refer an Estimate back for reconsideration is a motion of which we should have notice. If the Deputy makes the point that there is nothing in the Standing Order about notice, the answer is that unless a Standing Order prescribes that, notice need not be given, then the necessity for notice is implied.  It has been the practice, in dealing with Estimates, to take certain motions without notice, but this year, on the opening of the Estimates, I announced that I would refuse to take any amendment without notice, making reservation in respect of a case which, in my judgment, should be regarded as exceptional.  I think if the Deputy has such a serious view regarding the Estimate that he desires to have it referred back, he ought to have given notice.</P>

      <P>I desire, then, to raise a question on sub-head A (4), which refers to the cost of entertaining distinguished foreigners.  I agree that this sub-head is necessary and valuable.  I have seen, within the last month, how valuable it can be, because the Minister entertained, under this sub-head, I presume, a distinguished citizen of the United States.  He invited not only members of the Executive Council and distinguished American business men, but he was good enough to invite representatives of parties other than his own party.  The result of that entertainment was a <Col N="345" /> column of very valuable publicity in one of the most important pages of the &ldquo;Boston Globe,&rdquo; which is a very influential paper.  I do not know how much the lunch cost&mdash;I suppose it did not cost more than £30&mdash;but it certainly would cost more than £30 to get a column advertisement on a good page of the &ldquo;Boston Globe.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is justification for this Vote, but I should like the Minister to justify the increase in this Vote.  Last year we voted £500.  This year we are asked to vote £1,200, which is more than double the former amount.  Last year there was exceptional cost imposed on the Executive Council by the entertainment of a convention of American doctors. That entertainment was given in the Museum adjoining.  It was, if I may say so, an admirably planned and arranged entertainment.  The whole manner in which the function was carried out redounded to the credit of the State.  I make one reservation&mdash;I did not seek the refreshment department and I cannot speak with regard to that.  But in every other respect, and particularly in regard to the music, the entertainment was admirable. That was done on a Vote for £500. How can the Minister justify an increase of £700 on that?  I do not know if any similar convention is anticipated this year, but even if it is, one might hope that it would be catered for as well for £500.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Dáil will grudge money on this account.  It is desirable, in view of our relations with the world outside, that we should impress them with the fact that we are an established and well-ordered State in exactly the same position as any old European State, that we have dignity and authority and that we can entertain our guests.  But we did that on £500 last year.  If more is needed this year, if any exceptional emergency arises, could not the Minister come down with a supplementary estimate?  I do not think it would be grudged.  The voting of a large amount under this sub-head is rather a temptation to the Ministry to overspend on other sub-heads and use their savings for this sub-head.</P>

      <P>I should like if the Minister would justify the <Col N="346" /> amount, apart altogether from the increase. It is very interesting to hear the effect of the recent entertainment. Possibly there are some effects that we do not hear of.  Deputy Cooper has told us that that entertainment secured a column of attention in an American paper.  What advantage is that?  What advantage is it to the people who were around the corner of the hotel, who had not a good dinner for three weeks before?  It is just as well that we should keep some kind of even balance and understand what the advantage is of giving an impression that we cannot sustain&mdash;that this nation is in the position of entertaining foreigners when it cannot possibly look after the interests of its own citizens properly.  It is a gross waste of public money to create false impressions even to the extent of a column of American newspaper space, which Deputy Cooper seems to rate so highly.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Cooper has made a mistake.  The doctors were, I think, entertained out of our Estimate for the previous year, which amounted to £750.  A certain courtesy exists among nations, and a great many Deputies have experience as to how that courtesy works in other countries.  This year is an exceptional year, with a strong possibility of exceptional calls on this Vote.  We are going to have visiting within a few hours' distance of us the Prime Ministers of certain States with whom we are in very close alliance.  In addition, there will be other Ministers and officials.  These visitors will be from countries with which we are in very close alliance and with which our interests are very closely connected.  There is an International Women's Body coming here.  The doctors came at very short notice last year.  There was a Celtic Congress sprung upon us at very short notice.  There is an International Military Exhibition at the Horse Show this year.  We know of the visit of the International Women, we <Col N="347" /> know of the International Military Exhibition and of the visit to Europe and to Great Britain, in particular, of Prime Ministers, Ministers and officials of those countries known as the Dominions. This sum, which Deputy Hogan considers a large sum, is infinitesimal compared with the amount available for such work in practically every other country.  I feel that this year it is necessary for us to have a fair sum of money available and not to have to ask the Prime Minister of a Dominion to come here in such a voice as to clearly indicate that we hope he will not.  Last year an American flagship visited us unexpectedly, and this entailed certain expenditure.  This year there is the possibility of certain war vessels of other countries coming here.  The thing I want to stress, however, is the fact that the Imperial Conference is on this year and that it is certainly due to us to give the courtesy of invitation and the courtesy of entertainment to representatives of the Dominions.  That would not take the whole, but apart from that, to our knowledge so far there are the International Women and the international competition at the Horse Show.  But generally when we have had to give entertainment we have had very short notice.  We have the twelve months to run, and it might very easily happen that in spite of the £1,200 there we might have to come here for a Supplementary Estimate under that heading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My view upon this question is pretty definite, that we ought to provide a sum of money which would enable Ministers, somebody representing the citizens of the country, to entertain visitors with something like the courtesy that any important company of individuals, not to speak of citizens of the State, would desire to show.  I think that it is certainly due to us, if we desire to make a claim to statehood, that the heads of the State should be in a position to act accordingly, following the custom of the world, with moderation, in a matter of this kind, and I have pleasure in voting for a sum of this nature under the formal title that it is for official entertainment. Otherwise we would be <Col N="348" /> forced to wait for private individuals out of salaries, or officials out of salaries, to perform these courtesies. On several occasions when the Vote for the Governor-General has come forward I have attempted to reduce the amount to be voted to that official and I propose to continue to do that.  I would prefer that the entertainment that is to be given, the hospitality that is to be offered, to representatives of other countries, should be done by the Ministers whom we appoint, whom we have control of, rather than by, shall I say, a figurehead, who is not appointed, in a way, by the people or the people's representatives.  I think it is essential that Ministers should have available a sum of money to extend hospitality and reasonable courtesies to visitors.  I would say, too, for fear that there might be some misapprehension, that so far as I have seen these entertainments, the hospitalities have been moderate, restrained, and by no means extravagant, and I think that the figure that Deputy Cooper let fall must have been an accident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I need say a great deal on this. There have been two meetings of the Assembly of the League of Nations last year which we attended, and I think I gave a report on each occasion.  Deputy Johnson asked me last night if we had received from the American Government a copy of their statement to the League of Nations as to their proposal, with reservations, about the International Court, if we had received a communication from the League of Nations on that matter, and if we were invited to a conference to deal with it. Well, we were not in existence when the Protocol of the International Court was signed.  It was signed by Great Britain when we were regarded as part of the so-called United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  I understand that the American message has been addressed to the signatories.  It is a matter we have given consideration to as to whether we should be deemed as being included in the signature which was affixed in the name of Great Britain and Ireland in the year 1921.  As we were not one of the original signatories we did not receive the formal message from the American Government and as apparently the League of Nations, while this matter is in doubt, deem it safer to consider us as non-parties to the convention rather than as parties, we have not actually been invited to take part in the conference in September.  We are entirely sympathetic to the project and the work of the International Court.  The only thing, therefore, that is left otherwise than very clearly in the Convention is the fact that there being a doubt as to whether it is necessary for us to take separate steps now or not.  As soon as we have that matter cleared up, if we judge that we cannot be regarded as parties to the International Court Convention we shall immediately take steps to affix our signature and become parties to it.  I am not quite sure if that meets the point that Deputy Johnson raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="350" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It meets the point, but it raises another.  It raises the point which, perhaps I might confess, I was driving at&mdash;that is to say, the attitude that the Minister takes regarding the conventions that were entered into within the League of Nations by Great Britain.  Does the Minister accept the position that all conventions which were entered into by Great Britain before the Treaty of 1921 have been accepted by the Irish Free State?  Are we reckoned to be parties, as an independent State, to these conventions which were entered into by Great Britain before the Irish Free State came into a separate existence? If that is the case with one convention, if it is deemed that we are automatically parties to those conventions, we shall understand the position.  But if they require a separate, formal agreement confirming decisions, treaties and conventions which were entered into by Great Britain, then we ought to know how many of these conventions we have formally confirmed.  What our position is in regard to those is a matter that I think requires to be cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are deemed to be parties to those conventions because Great Britain entered into them before we came into existence, we ought to see that we carry out our obligations.  If that is not the position, we have to examine the question as to how many of those conventions we ought to enter into formal agreement with and have registered as being parties to, and I think it is requisite that the Ministry should give us information upon that point as to what is their contention, whether that contention has been discussed by the League, whether it has been adopted by the League, whether there is any objection to it by the League, of whether it has been refused by the League.  I do not know what the position is, but it is desirable that we should know where we stand, because there are some of the conventions that we would certainly desire to be formally parties to, if we are not already automatically parties to them. In this case there seems to be no doubt. If we are automatically parties to this convention regarding the world court, then I think the duty of the Minister <Col N="351" /> is to intimate to the League of Nations that we are entitled to a formal invitation to that conference.  By virtue of the fact that we are a separate member of the League of Nations, and certainly a separate State, we are entitled to an invitation to that conference, which is a conference of all the States that have adhered to this convention regarding a world court.  I hope the Minister will be able to satisfy that request for information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>Conventions can be described as political and technical. This is one of those technical conventions which was dealt with before we came into existence and there may be a doubt as to whether we are bound by it or not.  We could submit a statement to the League of Nations asking them to regard us as a State that wishes to be recorded as bound by it. I think that is what happened with certain technical conventions such as those dealing with the minimum age in agriculture and workmen's compensation and one other, with regard to the international court that will come under the head of political conventions. It raises a very serious question, one that I frankly admit I am going to try to avoid making any definite statement on.  I think if we were to decide that on the whole we were bound by such conventions, in that case we might use the form used in regard to the other conventions, namely, that we wish to be regarded as bound by them. I do not wish to be forced into appearing to beg the question as to whether we are or are not bound by them.  If we consider that we are not bound by them so far as the international court is concerned, we shall not ratify it.  If we consider it is doubtful, as in the case of the technical conventions, we will state that we wish to be bound by it, but at this stage I do not wish to make any statement which could be regarded as a decisive statement by me as to whether we are or are not bound by them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a most amazing statement by the Minister.  I think it is two years now since he stated that he did not know whether we were or were not bound by this <Col N="352" /> convention or whether we were not members of this international court. Now, two years after, he makes this further statement.  I think it is a most amazing situation, and that it is high time that some decision was arrived at as to whether we are members of the court or not.  This State has been in existence for a number of years, and possibly has been a member of the court for a number of years.  According to the Minister's statement we may have been a member all the time.  I think it is a most unsatisfactory position. I would urge on the Minister to register at the League of Nations the First Schedule to the Finance Bill, the Second Reading of which was passed to-day.  It contains the agreement between the Irish and the British Governments with regard to income tax.  I understand it is the first agreement which has been arrived at between two States carrying out the recommendations of the League of Nations on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, think that the Minister's statement is unsatisfactory. He has insisted, and we all have insisted one time or another, that in respect to the League of Nations we are an independent unit, registered there with equal rights with every other State&mdash;member of the League. So far as the League is concerned, we are recognised as the equal of any other State in status.  The Minister has emphasised, too, that within this Commonwealth of Nations all the States are equal.  He has told us with a good deal of force that the Dominion status is a thing of growth and not very well defined, and that in the minds of many people it is not desirable to define it too closely.  But in respect to the League of Nations, surely our position is different and should be defined, and there should be no question in that relationship as to whether we are bound by certain conventions automatically; whether we took on us when we entered the League these conventions, or whether we are not members and not bound by these conventions until we have formally notified the League that we are bound by them. Now there is a very definite distinction between acceptance and non-acceptance, <Col N="353" /> and between being bound and not being bound, between having affixed our signature or not having affixed our signature.  That surely is not a matter of doubt and it should not be indefinite. The League ought to know our position and we ought to know our position.  I do not think it is at all satisfactory to say that when the matter arises we will consider whether we are already bound or not.  I do not suppose there could possibly be another member of the League who would take such an attitude, and it rather suggests confusion on the part of the Ministry that in respect to the League we are not independent and that we have not a definite status.  I think that is wrong, but I think that the Ministry is bound to take steps to make its position clear regarding these conventions so that not only we in the Dáil, but the League itself and all the other nation-members of the League shall know whether we are bound by certain conventions or not.  It is a most unsatisfactory position to be in doubt as to whether we have entered into treaties or not and whether we have obligations or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>This raises a very difficult question.  Suppose England were to divide in two halves tomorrow, North and South England, and that in the name of all England, the King had signed certain documents and had ratified certain conventions, the question is whether these two parts of England, now as new States, are any longer part of the one State, and are the two bound by these conventions: is one bound and the other not bound, or is neither bound?  The question is a very difficult one to answer offhand.  I am afraid this Government has rather spoiled people here. We do things rather quickly, and then there is always the expectation that things will be done quickly.  But this is an international question in which we have to act slowly; the other government concerned has also to act slowly, so that you have the slowness of the two Governments multiplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention is signed actually in the name of Great Britain and Ireland, as one unit, but we are separate.  We may say that we are bound by it and <Col N="354" /> the others are not.  Naturally we have acted slowly in this.  It is a matter for discussion and very serious consideration. As to whether any acts done in our name beforehand still remain, in remaining they do not take away from our status because we as a sovereign entity have the right to denounce anything that was done in our name in the past. It does not affect our status now.  It only means did we inherit a convention signed in our name or did we by separating separate from that heritage and take a separate part?  I think Deputy Johnson has rather misrepresented the position in thinking that it derogates in any way from our position in the League of Nations or from our status as a sovereign State.  It simply means one convention was signed in the name of what is now two, and whether that one convention covers the two or whether it only covers one, and which one, is a very subtle point.  It is a matter on which I think a good deal of time will go by before it is really cleared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN (Clare) Mr. HOGAN (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mainly concerned with the voting of this large sum of money for the purpose for which it is down in the Estimate.  I confess, if I thought I would get any support, I would move a reduction of it, because the greatest estimate that anyone can form of an individual or an institution is the estimate which he or it forms of itself.  If we try to appraise the estimate which the League of Nations forms of itself we ought to see how the constituent parts of that League obey the instructions and decisions given by it.  That is the way the Irish taxpayer is endeavouring to appraise the utility of that body and the utility of spending so much money as part and parcel of it.  I think I am right in saying that France, Italy and England are the three largest powers within the League.  What estimate did the Governments of these countries place upon the decisions of the League of Nations?  We all know what France did when the League of Nations gave a decision against the occupation of the Ruhr Valley in Germany.  The League of Nations expressed certain opinions on that, and France religiously ignored them.  Italy was not always on good terms with other nations beyond the <Col N="355" /> Mediterranean.  The League of Nations expressed certain opinions on that matter, but Italy religiously ignored them.</P>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister if there is any instance where England accepted the decision of the League of Nations?  France did not consult the League of Nations in the matter of the war against the Riffs, nor did England forget to protest against the registration of the Treaties of this State with the League of Nations notwithstanding the fact that the League of Nations had accepted these Treaties and recognised the right of this Nation to register them.  On this question of the utility of the League of Nations, has the position of Egypt and of India as regards England been submitted to it for consideration?  About six weeks ago, at about 7.30 in the evening, I heard a message broadcast on the wireless to the effect that there were raids in Bengal, that the troops were called out and fired blank cartridges, and that the rioters were dispersed.  At 10.30 on the same night another message was broadcasted saying that 15 persons were killed and 40 wounded.  It must have been a very dreadful type of blank ammunition that was fired from the rifles in India that produced such results.  What the Irish taxpayer would like to know is, what value is the League of Nations to the Irish Free State?</P>
      <P>Take the States that are outside the League of Nations.  You have America, probably with the greatest gold reserve in the world and probably the strongest military power at the moment.  That was the nation that made the Great War mainly a manoeuvre to train its troops.  Germany is outside the League of Nations, and Russia, which is not only a note of interrogation in your political institutions, but a huge note of interrogation in your whole social order, is also outside the League.  One is inclined to ask why these nations remain outside the League and of what value is it to the Irish Free State to be part of the League.</P>

    <P>There does not seem to be any sincerity in the protestations of the great States within the League.  They use the League as a kind of buffer institution <Col N="356" /> between the Great War and any opportunities they may get of effecting alliances.  Just as it suits them, and when they can effect alliances, they will drop the League and disobey its instructions.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to get any publication relating to the League of Nations.  It is difficult to get any real information as to what the League does.  The most one can appraise it as is an institution, an international clearing-house, for all the intrigues of the world.  That sums up the only function it fulfils; it can fulfil no other function, because the nucleus around which the present institution grew was composed of politicians. The effort to build a world peace around a political nucleus certainly will not succeed.  Probably the Minister for Finance would be able to find another nucleus around which to build it.  If anybody is in earnest in seeking the nucleus around which to build a world peace, he will find it far removed from the politicians who guide the destinies of most of the States within the League at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the last speaker on this very intricate subject has not formed a reasonable conception of the difficulty of the work that has been undertaken in connection with the formation of the League.  I think the original enthusiasm in connection with its formation did not take into consideration the enormous difficulties there are in getting any body, whether it is a body of nations or individuals, into a working arrangement that will satisfy all.  We have seen that difficulty in the growth of the labour position generally.  We see it every day in the efforts that are made to get over the difficulties that confront the smooth working of labour and capital. We see it all around us, and yet we cannot recognise it when it comes to the point where, instead of what one might call societies, you have got nations to deal with in conclave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one feels inclined to be disappointed with the results of the work of the League of Nations, the exposure of differences of opinion, and the difficulty of harmonious working within <Col N="357" /> the League and around it, one must at the same time recognise that the basic principle behind the whole arrangement is to endeavour to organise a state of things out of which can emerge a working arrangement that will be practicable.  It is useless to express impatience in this matter.  We have to be satisfied that the conscience of the world had consented to treat the matter as one that is possible of solution.</P>
    <P>That actual harmony can be obtained over even a series of years is, I think, taking too optimistic a view of human nature as we find it embodied either amongst individuals or amongst States.  In this matter one must look to every point that has been gained as an achievement, and a great achievement.</P>
    <P>As regards the participation of the Free State in the proceedings of the League of Nations, it does not matter if we are the smallest State there or are smaller than other States represented there.  I do not think you can sum up the total influence of a State either by its size or importance.</P>
    <P>I think that by passing this Vote we accept the principle that we are going in to do our best for the common weal. Whether our best has any effect or not, the gesture we make by our representations is, I think, of very considerable value to the League and it is well worth the money that is being expended on it.  If every State begins to think in the light of what is going to be gained individually, I think the difficulties will be magnified; the difficulties of arriving at a point which I think the whole world would desire the League to arrive at&mdash;a position of influence whereby their decisions will carry weight in any direction it is intended they should&mdash;will in such circumstances be magnified.  There is no use in saying in this matter that laws can be laid down that will be accepted by strong or weak powers under all circumstances.</P>
    <P>I fancy that the power of the League of Nations as a body will be of slow growth and it will be at all times subject to being upset; but the very incidents that upset it or cause disaffection for the time being will, with all well-minded people and States, be an incentive <Col N="358" /> to try to get over these difficulties and arrive at a formula which will really govern the conduct of the nations associated with the Assembly.</P>
    <P>One must feel that the progress towards a universal representation with the League of Nations has advanced and is advancing every day, even though such States as America have not come in.  After all, if the League is to carry on its work, America has got to come in sooner or later.  The very working of the League will be a factor in that direction.  If the League is going to establish itself in the way originally intended I do not think you can look on the possibility of any nation being left out.</P>

      <P>I desire to speak on sub-head B.  I take the unusual course of standing up to express my admiration for the work of the Minister for External Affairs in connection with this sub-head, under which he has made a commendable reduction which has not got the Press notice one would expect with regard to it.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a statement previously made in connection with one item here.  The reference, of course, was not made in connection with this Estimate, but I consider the matter is relevant.  It touches on a practice that has now been stopped and that forms one cause for the reduction in the Vote. I would like to get an assurance from the Minister that that is so.  The reference was made by Deputy Heffernan on the 25th March on the discussion of the Vote on Account.  The Deputy intervened in the discussion, and, in response to an interruption by the President, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will tell the President all the circumstances.  I went on the Continent as delegate of the League of Nations.  I went there as a delegate from the Government of the Free State, and I went at the expense of <Col N="359" /> the Government of the Free State. I might say that we stayed in palatial hotels and that we travelled first class, with sleeping saloons and all the rest.  But I have not the faintest idea of what our expenditure was.  I left shortly before the close of the Assembly and I travelled back on my own account, getting actual expenses later from the Government. I would be inclined to think that my actual expenses would not be one-fourth of my expenses when travelling as a member of the delegation. As the President has asked for an explanation, I think it is only fair that that explanation should be given.</P>
    <P>I think it only fair a further explanation should be given.  I happened to be closely associated with the official who was acting as treasurer to the delegation that year, and I also happened to be one of the few members of the delegation who remained until the end of the Assembly that year. I was amazed to see this as reported in the Official Debates.  I did make some inquiries and I found that the cost of bringing Deputy Heffernan to Geneva as a member of the delegation&mdash;that is, arriving at the figure by taking the combined expenses of the delegation and dividing the total by the number of delegates&mdash;was £14 4s. 4d.  The travelling expenses of Deputy Heffernan outwards from Dublin to Geneva amounted to £14 4s. 4d.  Deputy Heffernan on that outward journey travelled under the personal direction and control of the Minister for External Affairs, who was one of the party. He was put on board the boat at Dun Laoghaire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There was sleeping accommodation provided to London; then there was a hurried rush across London in the morning and he got a train down to whatever was the port.  He crossed by mid-day boat and arrived in Paris in sufficient time to have a little dinner.  Then they got him put to bed so that he could be called early in the morning in time to get a train for Geneva.  He was put <Col N="360" /> aboard the train and brought straight away to Geneva.  On the way back he travelled by himself.  He said that he would be inclined to think that his actual expenses would not be a quarter of those when travelling there.  It cost £15 5s. 0d. to bring him back.  I thought it necessary to refer to this as the Deputy seems to have been under a misapprehension.  He put up at good hotels and travelled saloon with sleepers, whereas on the way back he travelled as an ordinary Deputy, and was inclined to believe that his expenses would only be a quarter of those on the outward journey.  I suggest what happened was that the Deputy, not being acquainted with the ways of the Continent, found that his money went to some extent astray.  I do not, of course, mean that he misused any funds in any way, but that, travelling with the delegation and being one of a number of others and being under expert control of people who knew all the incidentals in connection with the journey, he got better value on the way out than on the way home.  I presume that the Minister has made up his mind for the future that Deputies will not be allowed to come home apart from the official party, so that in that way money will be saved. I thought it better to draw attention to this matter, as it is on the official record, and have the facts stated.</P>

      <P>Last year, when this Vote was under consideration, the Minister promised to inquire into the possibilities of having the Children's Court separated from the ordinary Police Court and also to separate the court in which commercial cases are heard.  As I pointed out on that occasion, it is very inadvisable to bring children with their parents into the surroundings of the Police Court. When one member of the family is brought into the Police Court, for instance, for non-attendance at school, as a rule the whole family accompanies the mother.  I think Deputies will agree that it is very desirable in such cases that the court to which these children are brought should not have the surroundings of a police court.  The Minister pointed out that one court is set apart on a particular day for hearing these cases.  That is so, but the other courts generally are functioning so that the Police Court surroundings are still there.  I would impress on the Minister that it is eminently desirable in the interests of the youths that the court to which they are brought should be free from the influences to which I refer.  The same fact happens in connection with what is known as the Commercial Court.  A number of cases of a commercial character are dealt with in the Police Court.  Typists and other persons are brought into those surroundings to prove claims, and I think that that is very undesirable.  In many cases witnesses come from the other side of the Channel to deal with those claims.  If possible, one would like that the court in which these cases are heard should be separate from the Police Court.  I do not know whether the Minister has been able to do anything in the matter since last year, but <Col N="362" /> it is desirable that something should be done in both these connections at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>In connection with the rebuilding of the Four Courts, provision is being made for the erection there, within a few yards of the Metropolitan District Court, at Inns Quay, of a court for the civil business of the District Court, and also a court for the civil business of the Circuit Court. They will be more convenient to solicitors and barristers and will meet one aspect of the matter raised by Deputy Good.  When these two new courts are ready the courthouse in Green Street will be used for criminal business only. With regard to the Children's Court, that will continue to sit in the buildings at Inns Quay.  It is not thought proper to bring business of such a character into the Four Courts.  I am satisfied that the conditions in which the Children's Court is now held are satisfactory.  There are a separate waiting-room and a separate courtroom. There is really no reason why youthful offenders should get into contact with the adult criminal class there. In point of fact, I put it to the Deputy that they are much more likely to meet that class of person in their home streets than in the court or its precincts. The Justices and staff generally are opposed to any change on administrative grounds&mdash;accessibility of records, attendance of police witnesses, and so forth.  These juvenile cases are heard in a separate private court and no adults are present, except the officials, necessary witnesses, and any relatives of the accused person who care to attend.  The court opens half an hour before the court which deals with adults begins its sittings, so that the majority of those who appear in answer to summonses have left this court before the other opens.  I do not think that any undesirable contact on the part of juveniles can be reasonably said to take place in connection with their appearance before the court, or while they are waiting to have their cases heard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister cannot put them in separate buildings, which I think is highly desirable, perhaps he <Col N="363" /> could arrange to have these cases heard after the ordinary court.  To have them heard half an hour before the ordinary court sits is undesirable, inasmuch as you have all the different friends and relatives of many of the accused persons waiting for the ordinary court, so that you have all the objectionable surroundings of a police court, and it is not desirable to bring children there.  I admit what the Minister says as to the fact that in many cases the surroundings of the homes of many of these families contain these classes of persons, but we would like to keep them apart.</P>

      <P>the senior District Justice is very anxious to meet the point of view underlying the representation, and if there is anything in the suggestion that the Children's Court could be held after instead of before the ordinary court I have no doubt whatever that he will advise me adequately on that matter, and that the necessary administrative arrangements will be made, but I have investigated this matter rather closely, in view of the discussion in the Dáil on last year's Estimates, and in view of certain communications which I received from outside persons and bodies.  I came to the conclusion that there is a certain morbidity behind the representation, and that there is nothing in the existing arrangement calculated to injure the children in any way, and also that there is no undesirable contact on the part of children who have to be brought before the court for one reason or another.  I am as anxious to avoid anything in the nature of immoral contagion for these youthful offenders as the Deputy or anyone else can be, but the inquiries I have made led me to the conclusion that there is really little, if any, fault to be found with the existing arrangement. For what it is worth, I will ask the senior District Justice to let me <Col N="364" /> have an opinion as to whether there would be any advantage in holding the Children's Court after, instead of before, the ordinary court business is entered upon, and, if he is of the opinion that there would be such an advantage, beyond question that will be done.  On this year's Estimates I want to face definitely the suggestion of a separate building.  I contend that it would be an unnecessary and unjustifiable expenditure, that the existing arrangements are satisfactory, and that the maintenance and upkeep of a separate building would be a refinement of administration which we cannot afford, and which is not called for by anything in the evils attendant on the present arrangements.</P>

      <P>The figures set out in this Estimate appear for the first time as a separate estimate.  Hitherto they appeared as part of the Estimate of the High Court and Supreme Court.  The two offices, the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds, are under the same chief officer&mdash;the Registrar of Titles. There is an increase of about £3,000 in the total cost, caused by the provision of £3,000 under sub-head C for replacing copies of deeds destroyed by fire in <Col N="365" /> the Registry in June, 1922.  The cost is incurred in payments to solicitors for looking up the originals in their offices and also the copying of those originals to replace the destroyed copies.  The other decreases and increases cancel out and are mainly of a routine character, caused by reason of normal promotion or increasing increments.  There is a decrease due to a slightly more economic adjustment in the upper staffing of the deeds office and in the estimate of the number of memorials which will require to be copied in the course of the current financial year.</P>
      <P>The Registry of Deeds is a very old office, dating back to the year 1708.  Up to 1864 it was maintained out of its own fund, arising from fees.  The object of this particular Registry is simply to maintain a well-ordered and well-indexed record of all deeds, conveyances and wills which shall be made of any lands, tenements or hereditaments. The scale of fees charged was laid down by Acts of William IV. and Victoria.  Some of them were increased in 1916 by a special Treasury Order. There are about 20,000 deeds registered every year.  It is estimated that the fees will yield about £15,000 in the current year.  In addition, the Registry does certain work for public Departments without fees&mdash;searches ordered by the Land Commission and registration of deeds of charge under the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, when it is certified by the Board of Works that registration of these charges is necessary for the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Registry is the central office for the registration of title to land under the Local Registration of Title Act, 1891.  There is also a local office in each county, but the cost of these local offices appears elsewhere, as part of the circuit court organisation. They are under the care of the circuit court officer for the county&mdash;the Clerk of the Peace.  Most Deputies&mdash;and, in particular, Farmer Deputies&mdash;will be familiar with the object of the Land Registry.  It is to maintain a well-ordered, well-indexed and well-mapped record of the ownership in lands.  It is compulsory in the case of land bought out under the Land Acts and subject to Land Commission annuities, <Col N="366" /> and voluntary in the case of other lands.  It is gradually superseding the old Registry of Deeds, as the record of transactions of land bought under the Land Purchase Acts is kept in the Land Registry instead of in the Registry of Deeds.  The main object of the Registry may be said to be the production on one single folio of a complete and authentic record of the history of each farm in the country, and the exact extent and boundaries of each such farm, illustrated by a map, so that in selling or mortgaging that farm the labour of proving title or proving freedom from incumbrances is reduced to a minimum.  Fees are charged on the registration of such transactions and on the supply of copy-folios, but fees are not charged in a compulsory first registration of land bought out under the Land Acts.  The first registration is done automatically when the landlord is bought out, the Land Commission passing the papers to the Land Registry for the purpose. The fees were fixed by the Land Judge, with the consent of the Treasury, in the past, and now with the consent of the Department of Finance.  The fees were last fixed in 1917, and the new scale came into force on the 1st January, 1918.  The fees for the current financial year are estimated to produce about £18,400.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of discussion had centred round the question of the extent to which the work of local registration should be done in the central office or in the local county registries. Neither lawyers nor officials are entirely at one in the matter.  In actual practice, the local registry does very little except keep duplicate folios and any really serious or critical work is done in the central office.  It has been urged that that was hardly the intention when the Act of 1891 was passed, and that the central office has assumed powers and developed to a size and importance that was not contemplated by the Act, while the local registries have shrunk to shadows.  On the other hand, the view has been put to me that the existing practice is correct in law and that the only possible practice, if the work is to be done correctly and the records kept in proper order, is the existing <Col N="367" /> practice.  Simply standing outside and observing the matter as a problem of administration, I may say that there is a good deal of overlapping as between the central registry and these local registries. Because of that and because of the confusion caused by the disappearance of the judicial head of the office, the Land Judge&mdash;there being now no Land Judge as such&mdash;it seems that the position of the Land Registry will have to be cleared up by legislation when Parliamentary time allows. I had an idea of introducing a Bill in the current session bearing on the subject and linking that Bill, to some extent, with the Court Officers Bill, which is at present going through, but the matter is not one of very great seriousness or very great urgency, and the Bill has been allowed to wait over.  It probably will be introduced in the autumn or next year.  It aims simply at a tightening up of the administration and an avoidance of overlapping. It will be introduced in the interest of economy and in the interest of greater administrative efficiency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a matter which does not strictly touch the questions the Minister has dealt with but which, I think, should be raised upon this Vote.  In the absence of any other class of criticism, I will raise the point now.  It is as to the quality and probable permanence of the work done by this Department and other Departments similarly placed, which require to have deeds copied or originals made with a view to permanence. The question arose last year in the Committee of Public Accounts as to whether typewritten documents are likely to have the quality of permanence as compared with ink-written documents.  Not being able to get any satisfaction on the point, I put it to the Minister now with a view to inducing him to make inquiry, even if it requires some expenditure on scientific experiments, as to whether typescript will serve the purpose of a permanent document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that some of the work of the courts&mdash;and presumably work in the registries&mdash;is being done now by typing machines.  I am personally very <Col N="368" /> doubtful as to whether that is a sufficient safeguard of the permanence of the contents in the same way that fluid ink was in the past.  The officer of the record office is not in a position to say, because his duties are concerned with documents at least 25 years old, when there was very little typewriting.  It is said that a great deal of official work and legal work generally&mdash;both the work of Departments and the work of professional men outside&mdash;is being done at present in typescript.  I doubt whether that is going to be legible in 50 or 100 years' time.  I would urge on the Minister the importance of considering this matter and of satisfying himself that there is no risk that documents will become indecipherable after the passage of some years.</P>

      <P>This matter was before us at the Committee of Public Accounts last year.  I also should like to submit to the Minister the consideration as to whether typewritten documents, after a long series of years, remain as authentic as the handwriting used in connection with deeds.  I think this is a matter of some importance.  I think it is a matter that at all events some conclusion should be come to about after due consideration.  I think the Minister might take some steps to have these points cleared up and either recognise that a typewritten document is as good as a written deed, or alternatively see that the deeds registered are in the form of script documents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to dogmatise on this matter.  It is a matter that there is a certain amount of doubt about.  Deputy Johnson says the officers in the Record Office are not able to assist, for the reason that their work and experience bear on documents that are twenty or twenty-five years old.  As to the relative enduring qualities of typescript and manuscript they are not in a position to help.  The Department of Finance urged the use of typists rather than expert scriveners for the purposes of these records. Really we are not in a position to say, with any authority, that the typescript is not suitable.  It might be of interest to Deputies to know that when officials of my Department visited England for the purpose of a brief examination of <Col N="369" /> court officers there which might be of assistance to us in preparing the Court Officers Bill, they observed in the Land Registry there that all the work was being done by typewriters, and these records of title to land, which are very valuable, are regarded by the people there as sufficiently enduring in typescript. That is simply all the data I have with regard to the enduring quality of typescript.  I do not want to be dogmatic on the point at all.  If I can find any way of arriving at an opinion that would be of any real worth I will certainly do it.  As to Deputy Hewat's point as to the authenticity of a document, I do not think that arises very much on the question of whether typescript or manuscript is used.  There are other checks for that. In any case, it would turn not so much on the contents of the document as a whole, as on signatures, dates and so on.</P>

      <P>This Vote, like the High Court Vote, is the last of the old series, and, to a considerable extent, it is simply imposed on us by the existing law and must undergo considerable changes as soon as the Court Officers Bill comes into operation.  The amount is practically the same as last year.  It is worth, perhaps, drawing attention to that, though the Estimate is properly an estimate for staff, it is swelled by a sum of £2,550 (item 10, under sub-head A), being the estimated cost of one assistant circuit judge for the whole twelve months, that is £1,700, and another for six months, £850.  At present there are two assistants, Mr. Piggott, K.C., in Dublin, assisting Judge Drumgoole, and Mr. Roche, K.C., in Circuit No. 5, assisting Judge Wakely.  So far as we can see at present, both of these gentlemen will have to be retained for the whole year, though perhaps not in the <Col N="371" /> circuits in which they are at present assisting.  I find that in Donegal there are heavy arrears, mostly compensation work, and that some assistance may be necessary there to get the volume of work down to what might be regarded as normal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question as to whether there is need for an increase in the number of Circuit Judges, I have not yet formed any firm opinion.  There was, of course, a great volume of work for these courts arising out of the disturbed period of the past, a great many compensation cases, for instance, and I would like a longer period of observation before coming to a firm opinion on the question of whether or not the number of Circuit Judges fixed by the Act is in fact adequate and would prove to be adequate even when the volume of work had subsided to something which could be regarded as normal. As I say, I do not want to prejudice the matter one way or another just now.  We are not taking the position to the Dáil at the moment that the number fixed by the Act is inadequate. Item No. 9 under sub-head A, &ldquo;Remuneration of Criers to Circuit Judges,&rdquo; is simply an intelligent anticipation of a charge which may have to be borne by the State, as soon as the Court Officers Bill becomes law.  At present these men are not paid anything by the State.  They are paid small sums by the county councils, under the old county court law.  As yet we have not arrived at any definite understanding with the Department of Finance as to what they are to get.  A thousand pounds would represent £125 each to eight of them.  There will be one to each Circuit Judge.  Probably what will be done will be to allow each judge to pick his own man&mdash;they are really more in the nature of personal servants than public officials&mdash;and to give the judge an allowance of about £125 towards retaining the man.  There is a corresponding item of £500 to cover the travelling expenses of these men.  It will be found in sub-head C, No. 4, That again is simply largely guesswork. Expenses of this kind were never paid before, and we can only try to approximate to what they will amount to.  The figure given is about <Col N="372" /> one-fifth of the corresponding figure for the judges themselves.  That will be found in No. 1, sub-head C.  The item of £210 under sub-head D is the salary which is prescribed under the old statute mentioned opposite the item for the gentleman in question.  The work has dwindled down to nothing owing to the simplicity of modern law as against the old.  But the salary has to be paid and will have to be paid until the Act is repealed.  Probably then there will be a question of compensation of some kind for the abolition of the office. Under sub-head A it will be noted that the salary for the Clerk of the Crown and Peace in Dublin is on the new and more economic scale that will be paid in future to County Registrars.  A vacancy in that position occurred early in 1924.  The new occupant accepted the post at this salary, which represents a saving to the State of about £1,000 per annum.  A similar change has taken place since this Estimate was prepared in County Kerry.  The new occupant of the post there has a Civil Service salary of £850, plus bonus. That would amount to about £1,100 instead of the old salary which amounted to about £300 more than that.  There will be similar reductions in every county according as the old officials retire. On the other hand, the cost of clerical assistance set out under sub-head B is bound to go up when we take over the staffs under the Court Officers Bill, not merely because the work of the Circuit Court is heavier in fact than the work of the old county court, but also because the present lump sum method is always cheaper than the stated salary method.  It is sometimes rather cruelly cheap, and in fact it is because it was cruelly cheap that we are departing from it.  Men were doing a great deal of work in these offices for salaries that were really not adequate remuneration at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>They were personally employed, in the way that the clerk of the peace got an allowance towards clerical assistance and then made his own bargain.  There are twenty-seven clerks of the peace.  Six <Col N="373" /> of these are over the maximum age of seventy years fixed by the Court Officers Bill.  One is seventy-nine, another seventy-seven, and others seventy-six, seventy-four, seventythree and seventy-two.  These are over the very outside limit of seventy years of age that we have fixed by the Bill, and these will, of course, have to go.  I cannot say at the moment how many of the remainder will decide to stay on and accept the new position of county registrar.  Deputies know that we are holding out every possible inducement to them to remain on.  With one reservation, they are guaranteed their existing salaries, and it is also made perfectly clear to them that they will be allowed to serve on to seventy years of age.  When I say that there is a reservation about the guaranteeing of their existing salaries I should remind Deputies that I said on Second Reading of the Bill here, and again in the Seanad, that we set one limit to that, and that is that we are not prepared to pay to any county registrar, even though he be an existing clerk of the peace and we are anxious to retain him, a salary of more than £1,200 per annum, plus bonus, which would amount to more than £1,450.  If any existing clerk of the peace is not willing to remain on and become a county registrar for that figure we just cannot avail of his services. There are some four or five whose total remuneration at present exceeds that figure.  In Cork, for instance, you have an officer receiving a total remuneration of £1,881 13s.  In Galway the clerk of the peace has a total remuneration of £1,646 7s.  In Limerick city the officer had a total remuneration of £1,558 10s.; in Tipperary the officer has £1,650 12s., and in Donegal £1,617.  Even to a clerk of the peace we are not prepared to pay salaries as high as that.</P>

Under all heads there are some four or five who receive salaries greater than £1,450. Under the new Act, even to these experienced officers whom we are anxious to retain, we will not pay more than £1,200, with bonus, and if they will not remain on that basis we must simply let them go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>No; they are fixed but come under different heads.  Sub-head A 3 deals with the remuneration of registrars.  Registrars are appointed by the various Circuit Judges, and are paid at the rate of £2 per day for each day on which they are employed in court on civil business.  In addition to that they receive £1 for each day they are employed in the court away from home.  Two registrars, Dublin and Cork, are on a fixed salary of £500 a year, plus bonus in each case.  The registrar in Cork is also an additional clerk under Section 9 of the Officers and Courts Act, 1877, and deputy registrar in bankruptcy.  The salary of £500 there covers all posts.  There will not be special registrars of this kind attached to the Circuit Judges under the Court Officers Bill when it becomes law.  Under sub-head A 4 there is a sum of £12,000 for the salaries of process servers. That sum provides for something over 500 process servers, some of whom act for two or three districts and receive additional salary for so doing.  There is the item A 8, £4,600 for official stenographers. The total number of stenographers on the recognised panel is forty-five.  They reside in different parts of the country, <Col N="375" /> principally in towns in which sessions are held.  Travelling expenses are in that way reduced to a minimum. Stenographers are paid at the rate of two guineas a day, with 10/6 a day to cover travelling and subsistence for each day they are employed in a court held in a town situated more than thirty miles from their ordinary place of residence.  They are further paid at the rate of 8d. per folio of 120 words for transcribing notes in cases in which appeals are lodged.  Then there is allowance under sub-head B of £13,636. That is an allowance for clerical assistance payable to Clerks of the Crown and Peace under the Act of 1877 and the Local Registration of Title Act of 1881.  The Clerk of the Crown and Peace used to pay his staff in whatever manner he pleased, and he received his allowance quarterly.  This system is being abolished under the Court Officers Bill, and the County Registrars office will be staffed with civil servants on recognised service scales of salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the new procedure there will be a larger amount of reporting court proceedings.  Local people are mostly employed to do this work.  On the question of the staff of stenographers, has the Minister considered the matter at all on a basis of interchangeability between the courts for reporting, and whether it might not be desirable to have a central staff of stenographers to do the work?  The work has been very largely increased by the new procedure.  It will be a work of very considerable magnitude, and it seems to me that some arrangement might be made that would work out economically on the lines I have suggested.  I think that it would work out a great deal more satisfactorily with a centralised body that could be called upon when required, that would be interchangeable and would serve in the different courts.</P>

      <P>When the Court Officers Bill becomes law we will review the position with regard to stenographers, and we will endeavour to arrive at the arrangement that will be administratively best and most economical. <Col N="376" /> The Deputy's idea of a central staff of stenographers, interchangeable and serving all the courts, has just the weakness that it would involve travelling and subsistence allowances that would tend to swell the Vote.  I do not want to prejudice our consideration of the matter, but I am not sure that the present arrangement of local men, engaged ad hoc and working under the supervision of the county registrars, is not as good an arrangement as we are likely to hit upon, having regard to travelling expenses.</P>

      <P>We discussed the question of the staff of the High Courts rather <Col N="377" /> fully when the Court Officers Bill was under consideration, and I do not think I have anything to add to what I said then.  There are, however, two points in connection with this Estimate to which I should like to draw attention. This is the first time that this Estimate has been shown by itself unencumbered by the figures for the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.  I think that departure is a good one and that it is likely to be adhered to. there is really no reason for associating the Estimate for the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds with the Estimate for the High Courts proper. The second point is that the Estimate is based entirely on the facts and on the law as it exists, or rather as it existed when the Estimate was prepared about six months ago.  In this Estimate we are still considering the old system modified only to the extent that we have taken advantage of deaths, retirements and transfers to other Departments to keep down the cost.  Since the establishment of the State the cumulative effect of economies arising in that way, by the non-filling of offices in the case of deaths, retirements, and minor economies of other kinds necessarily limited by the rigidity of the existing system, is that there has been a reduction effected from approximately £100,000 to approximately £70,000 in the few years that have intervened.  I do not propose to go in detail into this Estimate, having regard to the fact that the whole court organisation is in a state of transition and that it must necessarily undergo substantial changes during the present financial year, following on the passing of the Court Officers Bill.</P>

I would like to take this opportunity of asking the Minister whether he is preparing legislation that would tend to relieve Dublin jurors of the very onerous burden placed on them in recent years.  I think it will be admitted that Dublin jurors have borne more than their share of the heat and labours of the day in this regard, <Col N="378" /> and that they are entitled to some relief as soon as possible.</P>

The heads of a comprehensive Jurors Bill have been drawn up.  The Bill is in an advanced stage of drafting at the moment, but certain discussions and conferences will be necessary.  I cannot see any prospect, however, that the Bill can be introduced in the Dáil for discussion and deliberation before the adjournment.  In those circumstances I will have to consider whether it would not be possible to introduce a short Bill of a temporary nature which I would hope would be non-controversial and which would secure an easy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That would give the relief which, I agree, is necessary to the jurors of Dublin sitting for the purpose of the Sessions that will take place in the autumn and winter of this year, and before the more comprehensive measure bearing on the general position of jurors will become law.  I will endeavour to have a short, simple Bill of just a few sections prepared, and there may be the possibility of getting it through before the Oireachtas adjourns for the summer.</P>

The cash payments made by the tenant represent part of the price paid by the Board for the tenancy interests referred to.  Pending the signing of purchase agreements the tenancy agreements provided for the payment of interest on the respective purchase moneys.  The Land Commission cannot make a refund.</P>
