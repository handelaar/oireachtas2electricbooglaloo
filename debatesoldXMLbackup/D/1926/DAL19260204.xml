      <P>A claim has been received from Mr. Watters.  It has not yet been admitted.  Mr. Watters was requested on the 12th December last to furnish certain necessary evidence in support of it.  No reply appears to have been received from him.  I regret that I am therefore unable to have the claim disposed of.</P>

      <P>Verbal application for a party line telephone circuit was made to the Postmaster of Naas some time ago, but when the probable cost of the service connection with Celbridge Exchange was explained to the applicants the matter was dropped.

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 2 (4), line 10, after the words &ldquo;five pounds&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or to imprisonment for not more than seven days.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> In the Bill it is laid down that the penalty in the case of a first offence shall be a fine not exceeding five pounds, and there is no alternative.  I suggest that there should be an alternative because the street trader, particularly a street trader on a small scale, is not a very easy person to levy a fine from.  He, or she, is evasive. The street trader who is breaking the law of street trading is difficult to catch; in some respects they resemble fleas; they hop about from one street to another, and when you do catch them, it is difficult to get them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains.  So that I think the Bill would be strengthened very much if it were possible to add a penalty of imprisonment to the penalty of a fine.  You are not dealing with a person in an established business; you are not dealing with a person who pays rent and rates, and whose goods might be distrained.  The street trader may live in a tenement, may be a lodger, may have no real legal existence. Although I do not say that a fine should be levied in every case, or that a fine should be levied in any case, except where there is obvious defiance of the law, I do think in a case where it is obvious that the offender has no goods to pay a fine, that there should be some penalty besides the fine.  Seven days' imprisonment is not a very serious penalty, comparatively.  It is, on the whole, below the five pounds scale.  I do not know what the code is now, but some years ago if you levied a fine of five pounds you would probably have a month's imprisonment as an alternative.  But still street trading against the law, though a crime, is not a serioús crime, and I am suggesting a moderate penalty.  It is optional; it can only be inflicted at the discretion of the Justice, if he is satisfied that a fine would not be a suitable penalty.  Therefore I suggest that the Minister might take this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to ask the Dáil not to accept this amendment.  Deputy Cooper's rôle frequently is that of moderator of my undue rigidity.  In this case he is pressing for a penalty which, to my mind, is unnecessarily <Col N="404" /> severe.  I am satisfied to leave it to the discretion of the District Justice to impose a fine within the range of the five pounds' limit.  There is a scale of imprisonment in the event of the non-payment of a fine.  If a fine of £2, for instance, is imposed, the person convicted would, under the existing law, render himself liable to a month's imprisonment in default of payment.  If the fine were fixed at a sum anywhere between £2 and £5, there could be two months' imprisonment. I think that that provision is ample.  I think that the resources of civilisation and the resources of the police will prove adequate to meet the illusiveness which Deputy Cooper ascribes to street traders as a class.  I think that in fact the administration of the Bill when it becomes law will be a simple matter for the police, and I am not attracted by the proposal to prescribe for what is, after all, not a very grave offence, imprisonment without the option of a fine.  I am therefore not accepting the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>They are inseparable, I agree, but I think the Minister considers them more than that, that they are not only inseparable but that they are one and the same thing.  However, this amendment deals with the first offence.  I appreciate the Minister's point that in the case of a first offence the Court should not be given the power to inflict imprisonment unless the fine is not paid, and therefore I will ask the leave of the Dáil to withdraw the amendment without prejudice.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 2 (4), line 11, after the words &ldquo;ten pounds&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;or to imprisonment for not more than fourteen days.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> Here I think I am on stronger ground.  I agree that in the case of a first offence leniency is necessary and a fine desirable.  But here I think there should be the power to reinforce the law in the case of frequently repeated offences, in the case where a man or a woman deliberately defies the police, deliberately defies the orders that will be issued under this Bill and insists on going on trading in the street where it is not allowed.  In some cases street traders make big profits.  Those big profits come in practically wholesale to their own pockets.  I do not think street traders make income tax returns. I am quite sure that they do not pay rent and that they do not pay rates, and therefore it is desirable to have a stronger penalty, not merely a deterrent fine of ten pounds, when their weekly profits may exceed ten pounds, but that it is necessary in the case of very frequently repeated offences that there should be a term of imprisonment. I appreciate and accept the Minister's argument that imprisonment is not necessary for a first offence. But I do urge him now to consider whether the law might not be better enforced by adding imprisonment as a possible penalty for frequently repeated offences of this kind.  It will be entirely at the discretion of the Justices, and I think nobody will say that the District Justices are extraordinarily severe in their punishments. Any complaint I have heard is the other way, that they are somewhat inclined to let their natural leniency carry them too far.  I do not think the District Justices would use this penalty in anything but the most extreme circumstances, where the law has been broken again and again.  But where it is repeatedly broken I do suggest to the Minister that it is desirable to have this power in reserve.  Therefore, I hope that while he objected to the last amendment he will accept this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>My attitude to this amendment is the same as to the previous one.  I do not think that it is necessary and I do not think that it would be wise to provide for an offence of this kind a penalty of imprisonment without the option of a fine.  I think that the ten pounds' fine which is the <Col N="406" /> limit of the District Justices' discretion, will, in fact, prove adequate.  A street trader, after all, cannot carry on his business furtively.  He cannot, for any lengthy period or with any degree of success, carry it on without the knowledge and notice of the police. I think that when a man has been fined once and recognises that if caught again he will be liable to a ten pounds' penalty, it will prove a deterrent, and I would prefer to wait and see whether I am right or whether the Deputy is right before deciding to fix a penalty of imprisonment without the option of a fine for this class of offence.  The alternative to the payment of a fine ranging between five and ten pounds is three months' imprisonment, and I think that the discretion to fine up to ten pounds, which lies with the justice, and in addition a period of imprisonment of three months in default of payment, will be adequate to meet the situation.  I cannot see a street trader doing such a flourishing trade as would enable him to pay a periodical fine of ten pounds and still carry on a lucrative business.  I would prefer even to have to bring in an amending Bill if the Deputy were to prove right than in the first Bill to take the view that it was necessary to impose a sentence of imprisonment without the option of a fine for this kind of offence.</P>

      <P>The amendment is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, Section 6, to insert before paragraph (f) a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;ensuring the cleanliness of and the freedom from contagious disease of second-hand clothing and harness.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the amendment is to ensure the cleanliness and freedom from contagious disease of second-hand clothing and harness.  The spread of contagious disease through the medium of second-hand clothing or harness should be guarded against in every possible way.  That might mean the necessity for having second-hand clothing disinfected before it is put up for sale.  The spread of disease through the medium of second-hand clothing to children or adults is particularly undesirable. It is quite possible that contagious diseases, such as diphtheria, scarlatina, typhus, etc., could be spread through the medium of second-hand clothing, and I think it is necessary that second-hand clothing should be disinfected before being put up for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same thing applies in the case of harness.  Harness that is affected with disease is largely responsible for cases of parasitic mange, glanders, and strangles.  A veterinary surgeon informed me a few years ago of the spread of parasitic mange in his district. The parasitic mange existed <Col N="409" /> over a large area, and the veterinary surgeon had inspected many horses, jennets, and mules suffering from it. He stated that he knew second-hand harness had been disposed of, and he believed that the origin of the disease could be traced to the second-hand harness. The disease affected many fine animals in the district.  In the interests of the people and of animals, some steps should be taken to have second-hand clothing and harness disinfected before people are allowed to sell them in the public market.  I desire to bring the amendment to the notice of the Minister in the hope that he will favourably consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather perturbed with regard to this proposal of Deputy D'Alton; I am perturbed as to the possibility of anything effective being done with regard to it.  There is no doubt that it is quite possible, if clothing that has been in contact with infectious disease is carried and sold to other people, that those people may contract the disease.  When we come to actual facts, I find that as far as smallpox is concerned, it certainly is contracted through the distribution of rags. That matter, however, is provided for by an Act passed in 1911, known as the Rag and Flock Act, by which it is impossible at present to have dirty rags distributed.  On the other hand, I am rather distressed as to what might happen when this Act is extended to the smaller towns throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 1925 the Notification of Infectious Diseases Act had not been adopted to any extent in this country, with the result that there was no knowledge of where infectious diseases occurred. When there was no notification of infectious diseases, it was not at all likely that precautions would be taken with regard to the necessary destruction of clothing and other things.  Under the Local Government and Public Health Act, 1925, notification of infectious diseases was made mandatory.  Although up to the present it has not become very effective, it certainly will become completely effective when the new County Officers of Health will be appointed.  When it <Col N="410" /> is effective, it will be possible to ascertain where infectious diseases are and provision can then be made for disinfecting all clothing.</P>
    <P>It does not seem to me that there is any great reason for bringing in this amendment in the circumstances.  It might be possible to bring in a by-law and, under that by-law, order the disinfection of all second-hand clothing.  Then, the man or woman offering second-hand clothing for sale, would produce a certificate indicating that the clothing had been disinfected. That would not necessarily meet the case, because it would be quite possible, under this certificate, to include a great deal of clothing that would never go into the disinfecting chamber.  I know, and perhaps many others are aware of it too, that two large bales come into the North of Ireland twice a week containing a huge amount of mixed second-hand clothing.  This clothing comes from Scotland and it is distributed very largely through Tirconaill. Almost 70 per cent. of the poorer people in Tirconaill are using this clothing that comes from Scotland. The clothing passes down even to Monaghan.  The way in which this clothing is gathered is through pedlars coming to Glasgow from all parts of the country, and on the part of the public health authorities in Scotland there is no knowledge that the clothing is disinfected and there is no knowledge whether any precautions have been taken in regard to it.  It is quite possible that a great deal of infected clothing would be scattered in that way through various parts of this country.</P>
    <P>If Derry port were under the control of the Free State Government, it is quite possible that an order might be made to prevent the import of any of this second-hand class of goods.  The case has another aspect which I am not going to dilate upon; that is, whether it is a wise thing to allow this second-hand clothing to be sold in towns where people are paying rates and rent and making a living.  That is one aspect of the case.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is whether it would be right for us to prevent poor people getting the clothing at a cheap rate. <Col N="411" /> I am not going into that.  I am now going into the public health aspect of it.  I say again that very little evidence has been afforded here of the spread of disease through this second-hand clothing.  Every time there is an outbreak of this class of disease the Central Public Health Authorities issue a circular, and one question in that circular is &ldquo;Can this case be traced to second-hand clothing brought into the district?&rdquo;  I am, therefore, in the position that I would like to ensure that the clothing was clean, because there are other dangers in addition to what Deputy D'Alton mentioned.  There are itch an scabies, to say nothing of vermin, which are very often carried in this clothing.  Deputy Cooper knows a great deal about fleas.  He did not say anything about other vermin that are more obnoxious than the class of parasite he is more familiar with.</P>
    <P>However, I would be very glad if any measures could be taken to ensure that the poor would not have sold to them clothing that would carry infectious disease.  I would very gladly support anything in that direction.  On the other hand, on thinking over this subject very carefully, I am not quite sure that we can see any effective or efficient means of having this done.</P>

      <P>There is a great deal to be said in favour of Deputy D'Alton's amendment, and I think it is worth the Minister's kind consideration. If he would attend any of the fairs throughout the country where so-called second-hand clothing is exhibited, he would see the necessity for this amendment.  I say &ldquo;so-called second-hand clothing&rdquo; because I think it is glorifying it to call it &ldquo;second-hand.&rdquo; I think a great deal of it has passed through many more hands than two.  I have often wondered that something was not done to regulate this traffic.  One sees sometimes a really repulsive garment held out to the admiration of possible purchasers.  The same thing applies to harness.  One sees filthy harness of all descriptions put up for sale.  There is no doubt of the possibility of infection through this harness.  For that reason, I think it is <Col N="412" /> well worth the Minister's while to consider this matter.  He will have more information than we have, and I certainly urge it as well worthy of careful consideration.</P>

      <P>I was not sure that this amendment would be regarded as coming within the scope of the Bill.  Its primary object is to prevent the spread of infectious diseases amongst human beings and amongst animals.  My view is that no useful object would, in fact, be served by the acceptance of the amendment, even if we agree to waive the question of whether or not it is strictly relevant to the Bill which we are considering. The Public Health Acts, ranging from 1878 to 1919; the Infectious Diseases of Animals Act, 1889, and the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act, 1890, contain between them very full powers for the prevention and spread of infectious diseases amongst human beings, and deal, in fact, more effectively with that matter than any bye-laws which would be made by the Corporations under the proposed amendment. Under their provisions, the sanitary authority has power to prevent the spread of infectious disease by attacking it at its sourcs, and is authorised to cause articles of bedding, clothing, etc., to be destroyed or disinfected. If the Deputy wishes to take a note of the relevant sections, he will find that Sections 137 to 154 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, has a bearing on the matter and that Section 66 of the Public Health Act, 1907, and other provisions contained in Part 4 of that Act deal with the matter. Then, with regard to the Diseases of Animals Act, the Department of Agriculture has power under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, and the enactments amending that Act to make provision, by regulation, for the prevention of the spread of the diseases amongst animals and for the disinfection of infected articles, such as harness. These powers have been exercised as regards horses, mules and asses in the case of parasitic mange and in the case of glanders.  Generally, I put it to Deputy D'Alton and the other Deputies whether a provision of this nature would not be more properly <Col N="413" /> included in a general Bill than in a Bill the operation of which is confined to districts which choose to adopt it and to make bye-laws under it.  There are administrative difficulties in the way of giving effect to any such provision as this&mdash;for instance, the determination of the precise standard of cleanliness and freedom of the clothing from infectious disease and the identification of disinfected clothing.  To be effective, power would also require to be given for the seizure and destruction of articles presumed to be infectious or to be in a state dangerous to health.  Generally, I regard the amendment as going considerably beyond the purpose of the Bill.  The Bill is introduced simply with an eye to keeping traffic clear in the thoroughfares of the larger towns and to prevent abuse going on by the over-crowding of the streets and footways by those casual vendors of articles of various kinds.  On the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage it was clear that there was a desire to give something of a swing to the Bill, and to divert it from what was the original departmental purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People became interested in it and thought the Bill was one intended for the elimination of competition.  I had to make it clear that it is not introduced to that end and in the case of this particular amendment it is necessary to point out that the Bill does not purport to be in any sense a public Health Bill or to have any particular bearing on public health at all.  If further measures are necessary for public health no doubt the Minister for Local Government will take notice of that.  If further measures are necessary for the prevention of the spreading of diseases among animals, no doubt the Minister for Agriculture will take notice of that.  This is to keep the streets and pathways of the larger towns free from obstruction by street traders, and there is even this limit which comes into it on an amendment which Deputy Duggan moves, that it is not to apply to the public fair or market.  The person who comes in with pig troughs or one thing or another into the fairs or public markets to sell them is entitled to sell <Col N="414" /> them in competition with any shopkeeper in the town who happens to stock that particular class of goods. That is moving away from Deputy D'Alton's amendment which, I think, itself moves away from the Bill.</P>

      <P>The statement made by the Minister makes it clear that this particular section which I want introduced into the Bill can be dealt with effectively by the Board of Health and the Minister for Agriculture.  The importance of it is very great, but I think, having brought it before the attention of the Minister, it is sufficient. I am aware of the harm that has been done, especially in the case of second-hand harness, and I thought it would be possible for the Minister to say that second-hand harness sellers would be under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Agriculture.  Now he has made it clear that they are, and that this Bill deals with street trading alone, and, as far as necessary, disinfection, cleanliness and freedom from disease are concerned, they are in the hands of the other two Ministers.  For that reason I am ready to withdraw my amendment.</P>

It does not appear from the Bill that Town Commissioners were included, but perhaps the Minister may see his way to have such towns included, because, as Deputy Broderick stated, there is a strong desire to have this Bill, when it becomes an Act, extended to other areas.  Perhaps if, in line 43, after the word &ldquo;commissioners&rdquo; he inserted the words &ldquo;or Commissioners of any town,&rdquo; it would cover the position.  In the Local Government Act of 1925, in the Definition Clause, &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; is explained as &ldquo;a county council, county or borough council, urban district council, rural district council, board of guardians, <Col N="416" /> or the commissioners of any town.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I took notice of the desire that was shown on Second Reading to have the provisions of this Bill extended rather more generally than was originally contemplated.  In the Bill as introduced in the Dáil, there was a population limit.  It has been since removed, and the Bill as it now stands applies to the Dublin area and can be adopted by any corporation or urban council in the Saorstát.  We are now urged to allow the Bill to be extended to include towns in which there are Town Commissioners.  There are considerable difficulties in adopting and giving effect to that suggestion. In the first place, the Money Resolution proposed and passed on the Committee Stage of the Bill did not make provision for the application of the Bill to towns having Town Commissioners. Town Commissioners appear to be outside the scope of the Bill, inasmuch as the long title confines it to county boroughs and urban county districts. I have some doubts whether any amendment including Town Commissioners would be in order at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from these technical difficulties. I am not convinced that any particularly strong case can be made for the inclusion of towns controlled by Town Commissioners.  Most of the towns so controlled are small towns. Exceptions can be quoted.  There is the notable exception of Mullingar, with its population of upwards of five thousand, and Tuam is a fairly large town to be controlled by Town Commissioners rather than by an urban council. The adoption by a town of a system controlled by Town Commissioners is largely actuated by the desire for a small rate.  Town Commissioners cannot strike a rate exceeding 2/-, and I should think that if a real case exists for the adoption of the Bill by a town controlled by Town Commissioners, it would not seem an undue hardship that such towns should apply for and obtain from the Minister for Local Government power to establish an urban county district.  In towns controlled by Town Commissioners the <Col N="417" /> only adjustment of traffic which could arise would be on market or fair days. As I indicated just now, and as Deputy Davin explained when proposing an amendment, this Bill will not affect people trading in markets or fairs, so that its adoption would not be for the purpose of dealing with traffic problems on market or fair days.</P>

      <P>Deputy Duggan moved an amendment, No. 3, and the effect of it is to exempt from the provisions of the Act persons who go into a lawful public market or fair to sell their goods.  As this seems to have taken the Deputies by surprise, I had, perhaps, better elaborate the amendment a little.  When the question of extending the Bill to towns generally throughout the Saorstát came to be considered it was realised that such an exemption was necessary.  The objects of the Bill are, as I have said, to ward as far as possible against interference by street traders with traffic and to secure cleanliness of articles of food sold by the street traders.  The object of the Bill is not to define what is, or what is not, legitimate competition among traders, whether they are traders in houses or on streets.  It was, therefore, felt that it was entirely outside the scope of the Bill to interfere with the existing rights of sellers and buyers to gather in market or fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is known, a market or fair is a concourse of buyers and sellers, and every person is entitled to go into <Col N="418" /> a market and expose his goods for sale, subject to the payment of certain tolls or stallage fees to the owner of the market rights.  To impose an obligation on persons who come into a market to sell by retail to obtain first a certificate as a street trader would be an undue interference with the existing law as to markets and fairs.  Selling by retail may be defined, roughly, as a sale to the consumer or user rather than a sale to a person for the purpose of re-sale.  If, therefore, the Act were to apply generally to persons selling by retail in markets and fairs, it will be seen that, say, the person who grew vegetables and sold them on the street could not carry on his business without obtaining a street trader's certificate. Similarly, a carpenter who made gates, feeding-troughs, etc., for sale in market, would be in a similar position and, in fact, the producers of most agricultural produce such as hay, turnips, etc., who sold to a person for use for consumption by such a person would have to obtain a street trader's or stall trader's certificate.  It is realised that a certain amount of congestion of traffic exists in towns throughout the country on market and fair days, but power is given by the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854, to make regulations for the purpose of freeing from obstruction all passages and thoroughfares in and through a market. If these powers were properly exercised by local authorities, the traffic problem could be dealt with adequately without interference with existing market and fair rights, and could be dealt with without any further provisions under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Town Commissioners who are clamouring for the extension of this Bill to their towns ought look up their existing powers under the Act of 1854 to make traffic regulations for market or fair days, and if these powers are exercised there appears to be no necessity for such towns to adopt this Act save that they may fear undue competition by street traders, and this is not a subject with which the Bill proposes to deal.  We did not set out to deal with the matter of competition, the matter of the moving shop versus the stationary shop.  It was not from that <Col N="419" /> angle that we approached the Bill, but from the angle of keeping the streets and footways reasonably clear, and I think the Bill does that, and does it as fully as is necessary.  I do not consider that its provisions are seriously needed in towns controlled otherwise than by Corporations or urban councils. With regard to remaining towns, I think they will find that their problems will disappear by a judicious exercise of their powers under the Act of 1854.</P>

      <P>I am a little doubtful as to the effect of this amendment. I think it will mean that many urban districts smaller than those originally contemplated will be free to adopt the Act.  The Minister's explanation rather suggests that the market or fair referred to in the amendment which has been passed, and I think referred to indirectly in the reference to the Towns Improvement Act, rather suggests a fixed market in a market place or a well-established market.  I do not think it can be said to apply to the people who set up stalls in a town on a market day on one day in a month or perhaps one day in a quarter, where they do not pay any toll.  I do not think that would be construed as being a lawful public market unless it were held in a market place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On that assumption the effect of the amendment would be to allow the local authority in any small town to prohibit the selling of goods on the street on a market day. It may be desirable to do that, but I am very doubtful whether it is desirable, because it is going to have the effect of enacting what the Minister says was not contemplated, particularly in this Bill&mdash;namely, to enable the local authority, which may be a body of shopkeepers, to say that on a particular day in the month or any day in the month because only one day affects these market traders&mdash;that this particular class of goods or that or the other shall not be allowed to be sold in such-and-such a street.  If we are going to enact in that manner, then we should do it quite deliberately and purposefully, but, as the Minister said, it is not intended by the Bill that that should be the effect, which is rather to regulate ordinary street trading.</P>
      <P>I think that the effect of this amendment would be to increase the number of towns which would be allowed to make specific regulations against the marketing on fair days of all kinds of commodities.  I do not know whether I am right in that belief, but I think that is going to be the effect of this in regard to small towns, and I am not at all convinced that it is a proved necessity, except in the interest of a few traders in those particular towns.</P>

It is well known that these people set up to sell their wares in the busiest part of the town.  Naturally, they will set up where the largest number of people congregate, with the result that there is bound to be a block in the traffic. The Minister said that the urban council have the power to prevent that, if they so desire, under some previous Act.  As a matter of fact, many councils have consulted their legal adviser on the matter and have been informed that they have no power or authority <Col N="421" /> to prevent those people from setting up in any part of the town on a market or a fair day.  I should like the Minister to make clear what the position will be under the Bill.</P>

      <P>The dilemma is that the local authorities can pick and choose.  That is the trouble.  You have this position: that the man who is quite prepared to take the risk of a bullock jumping through his window or walking in through his hall-door objects to the person selling pig troughs or gates or something of that kind on the street outside.  They have power to say where the fair or market shall or shall not take place, but if they allow the fair or market to straggle through the streets of the town and to acquire a kind of prescriptive right there, then they have got to put up with the inconvenience of that, and with whatever little minor competition that brings them in business.  If the Deputy thinks it over, I think he will find I am right. I certainly have considerable administrative experience to support me in the contention that that is the real position&mdash;that the moment the police, who have some concern for the amenities of the town, begin to suggest that the fair or market ought to be restricted to a particular area, they are met with indignant protest and resentment. &ldquo;Nothing of the kind; the bigger the tail to the fair the better; the more people there are buying and selling their cattle on the street the better.&rdquo;</P>

It is simply a question that if the fair or the market is to straggle, then your casual vendor of goods will straggle with it.  If the fair or the market is restricted to a particular area or confined within reasonable limits, to some square, open space, or fair green, the casual vendors can be restricted <Col N="422" /> along with it.  But where there is a fair or market, there is a right on the part of A, B or C to go there and sell his goods&mdash;any quality of goods he cares to go and sell.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of obstruction, I know that in the town of Naas the thoroughfare was completely blocked by people who sold not alone the articles that the Minister mentioned but also cattle.  The matter was brought before the Urban Council by the local branch of the Farmers' Union, the complaint being that cattle received a great deal of abuse when getting through this narrow thoroughfare. The Council took action, and, with the assistance of the Gárda Síochána, they have secured a perfectly clear thoroughfare.  There is a great improvement there now.  As to the point raised by Deputy Corish, I know an Urban Council that has compelled people to sell in the market, and they have successfully prosecuted people who disregarded that order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point Deputy Corish is raising, dealing with trading in towns or urban areas other than on fair days, is covered by Section 6 (I) (A).  I am not quite clear about that, and I would like to hear the Minister's opinion on the sub-section. The urban authorities may adopt this Bill, and I think they are also protected under the Towns Improvement Act. There are many urban towns in the Saorstát where fairs or markets are not held, but still stall-trading goes on, eggs being sold one day and other things another day.  I think the section would enable the local authorities to compel these traders to sell their wares in some specified area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>In this matter, I think a great deal of the difficulty is to locate the market.  As I pointed out at an earlier stage of this Bill, the habit is too common throughout the country of having the fair throughout the whole town.  I thoroughly agree with what the Minister has stated, that if fairs are to be permitted anywhere throughout a town, and not confined to a particular area, the people in the town will have to put up with the consequences and <Col N="424" /> permit traders of other descriptions also to carry on their business.  As far as I understand this particular Section, it will mean that if there is not a definitely specified market-place in a town, which unfortunately is too often the case, and if the fair is being carried on through the town, then these particular hawkers will be permitted to go wherever the fair is.  I think it is a bad system to have the fair scattered throughout the whole of an urban area, and perhaps this Bill may be a means of bringing home to those responsible for the conduct of the areas concerned the necessity for specifying a definite area for the holding of the fair and segregating it from the business part of the town.</P>
      <P>I understand that the point raised by Deputy Corish was not as to whether these traders could trade on non-market days, but whether they should be entitled to set up in the neighbourhood or in proximity to the existing market.  I see a great deal of force in the desirability of doing away with that practice.  The practice can be done away with, and it rests with urban authorities, who should have power to pass a by-law to prohibit&mdash;Deputy Conlan has referred to the case of Naas&mdash;these traders taking advantage of the proximity of the fair and not paying any toll or having any legitimate excuse to be in the fair, but merely lying on the outskirts in order to profit by people going in and legitimately doing their business there. Owing to the fact that the locality of the fair is so seldom definitely specified in country towns, I do not see how this Bill can do any more than it has done, and I do not think anything we could do could segregate the actual conduct of the fairs from the traders who are mentioned in the Bill.  If they choose to have a fair straggling through the town, they will have to have the followers of the fair there also.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question about the position of small towns and villages in which there is no local authority.  By what authority could an obstruction to the thoroughfare in these centres by <Col N="425" /> the setting up of stalls be prevented? Would it be possible for the County Council to make by-laws to prevent such obstructions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister, in the event of an urban authority making a by-law in this connection, who is it that would take action against a person that would set up to sell goods on the street?  Is it the Civic Guard or the urban council that would take the initiative in bringing a prosecution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will find that it would be open either to the county council or to the Civic Guard to bring the complaint.  &ldquo;All by-laws made by the Corporation under this section shall be deemed to be by-laws made by a sanitary authority for the purposes of the Public Health (Ireland) Act,&rdquo; and, according to the sections quoted, &ldquo;shall apply to all by-laws made under this section.&rdquo;  Under these sections the procedure with regard to the bringing of a complaint is set out.  You see there could be endless questions on this Bill, and I think they can only be met by stating that the particular circumstances in each place cannot be envisaged here.  That is a matter for the local authority which adopts the Bill. The Bill was brought in to deal specifically with the case of Dublin, where we had contact and consultation both with the police and those who feel aggrieved by the present state of affairs.  The power is given to other Corporations and urban authorities throughout the State to adopt this Bill, and they have that kind of limited autonomy within which they will have their discretion.  It will be for them to say where street trading shall or shall not be carried on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was necessary to insert in the Bill the exemption in favour of people going to buy or sell in a fair or market, and where the fair or market lies in a particular place is a question of fact which can be asertained.  Deputy Conlan put me a rather difficult question when he asked who was to control obstruction by street trading in a small town or village where there is no local authority of any kind, either an urban <Col N="426" /> council or a town commission.  The reply is that that is simply a question that every individual has the right to pass down a street, and that if he is obstructed his right is infringed.  He can bring his complaint before the District Justice or he can complain to the police, and they can inquire into it, and if, in fact, there is undue obstruction, that is an offence which can be dealt with under the law.</P>

      <P>The police have the right to deal with obstruction on the streets if they consider that there is a case for intervention and if there is real obstruction.  The Deputy quotes Mullingar and other towns.  My own opinion is that these towns can, if they so wish, move to have an urban council established in their towns, and that towns which have only a town commission at present can become urban districts if they want to do that.  There are reasons for not doing that&mdash;that there is a limit to the rate which a town commission can strike, and they like the limit.  Very good, liking the <Col N="427" /> limit, they must put up with whatever ensuing or consequent disadvantages there are to towns which have neither a town commission nor an urban council. I feel quite sure that under some of the existing Local Government clauses the remedy is available if they care to make use of it.</P>

I am informed that there is no such effect.  If the section had been set down in the reverse way to which it is&mdash;namely, if the details had come first, followed by the particular words&mdash;then the particular words would be bound, to a certain extent, by the details, but as it is here the general words retain the most general import that can be given to them, and are in no way limited by the details which follow.

      <P>I propose, with the leave of the Dáil, to ask that an amendment might be taken to-day to Section 9, page 4, line 63, before the word &ldquo;every&rdquo; at the start of the <Col N="429" /> section, namely, that there should be there inserted the words &ldquo;notwithstanding any other statutory provision.&rdquo; This is for greater certainty. It is understood that the section, as it stands, does actually over-ride such matters as were brought to my notice since the Committee Stage.  In the Dairy Produce Act and the Eggs Act there is a provision that no information given to an officer of the Department of Agriculture shall be revealed to anybody else save in the event of a prosecution. Now I am informed that this section actually over-rides that.  To make the matter quite certain, and to put it beyond all doubt, I would like to have these words introduced into the section. It has also a repercussion upon a matter referred to in line 67 as to inspecting and taking copies of records or documents.  There are certain documents where it is laid down by statute that a fee must be paid before copies of them can be taken.  Again, I am informed that that provision there would over-ride any statutory question about the payment of fees before copies of such documents can be taken.  It is suggested that the insertion of these words, which I propose, would put that beyond any shadow of doubt, and, with the leave of the Dáil, I move to insert them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with one point brought forward by Deputy Johnson.  In dealing with the second point, referring to Section 13, where the Deputy raised doubts as to whether this was not unduly restrictive, an examination shows that that is not the case.  Sub-sections (1) and (2) must be read together.  Sub-section (1) indicates that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Neither any individual schedule, form or other document filled in, or otherwise completed by any person in pursuance of any requisition made under this Act nor any part of any such document shall without the consent of such person be published or, except for the purposes of a prosecution under this Act, be shown or communicated to any person other than an officer of statistics.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That has reference only to the actual returns furnished by the individual. But sub-section (2) reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No report, abstract, summary or other publication made under this Act&rdquo;&mdash;or materials supplied under sub-section (1)&mdash;&ldquo;shall contain the particulars of any information&rdquo; ... &ldquo;supplied by any person to any officer of statistics so arranged as to enable any person to identify such particulars as relating to any individual person&rdquo; and so on.</P>
      <P>So there are these distinct words &ldquo;So far as is reasonably practicable&rdquo; in regard to any case or series of cases referred to by Depuey Johnson, such as Railway Companies and others concerned.  I am informed that the two sub-sections are drafted with that aim.  The first prohibits any order in the nature of precise returns made by any individual being published without the consent of the person, and the second provides that no abstract, report or summary shall be made public &ldquo;so far as is reasonably practicable&rdquo; containing particulars so as to identify him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper, on Section 8, had an <Col N="431" /> amendment, but it was finally left that I should consider, in line 41, whether there should be inserted in the amended Bill the words &ldquo;and reasonable&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;specified.&rdquo; Now the situation is this: I had spoken on the last day of matters analogous to a census.  That raises the whole question whether a Census Bill is, in fact, required, provided that this Bill be passed.  I put before those concerned Deputy Johnson's view that this Bill had been drafted really for Census purposes.  There is a Census Bill actually drafted.  It is in an advanced form, not actually the final form, but there is really no necessity to have such a Bill introduced now.  Those concerned are definitely clear now that a Census may be taken under this Bill.  If it is the case, and if it is proposed, as we would now propose, to have a Census taken under this Bill, my argument is all the greater against having no time specified.  I put it to Deputy Cooper that to put in the words &ldquo;and reasonable&rdquo; and to leave it to some Court to decide whether the time specified was or was not reasonable, is simply putting a certain amount of impediment in the smooth passage of the Bill, especially if the Deputy takes into consideration that there will be a Controller of Statistics, a highly important officer in the service of the Government, and that he will be assisted by a Statistical Council and that questions with regard to time where unduly limited can be raised here.  The Deputy may answer they can only be raised after the event and when the prosecutions have been brought, but, at all events, they can be ventilated here, and there will be the fear of such ventilation before the Controller of Statistics and the Council.  I do not think that there is any reason to believe that there will be any mistakes made, or anything unduly oppressive with regard to the time limit.</P>
    <P>I am not accordingly, moving to put in the words &ldquo;and reasonable,&rdquo; and I put it to the Deputy to say that he will accept that.  I will put another matter to Deputy Cooper also.  He was rather anxious with regard to certain particulars <Col N="432" /> that might be required to be taken in the Census.  It may be that if he knew this was to be made use of as a Census Bill, he would have raised a certain number of points on Second Reading.  If he presses that, I do not know how I can meet him, except by simply suggesting that he might move a motion with regard to particulars that he would desire to see put in for Census purposes, and we could take a discussion such as would take place upon the Second Reading on these if this were regarded as a Census Bill.</P>

I do think there is a danger in allowing even the Directors of Statistics, who are supposed to be somewhat inhuman and absorbed in their peculiar studies, to impose penalties on an ordinary man of whose life they have little idea.</P>
      <P>As regards the questions that I could raise on Second Reading, I am not worrying about that.  I can raise them on the Fifth Stage.  I am worried much more, however, about the things I could have raised on the Committee Stage. I think the Minister made it plain that if he had known it was intended to use this Bill instead of a Census Bill, he would have wished to make it clear to the Dáil at an earlier stage.  I think it is unfortunate that we had no opportunity of reviewing this Bill in the manner in which we would have reviewed a Census Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, this Bill gives powers, as far as I can see, in order to obtain information form an occupier.  The Census Bill gives certain definite powers for ascertaining particulars about people who are travelling at the time the Census is taken.  That is to a certain extent an academic point, because there are comparatively few all-night trains in the Saorstát, and there will not be very many travellers inside the area.  There are various omissions in this Bill of things that are to be found in Census Bills, and I regret that the Minister did not make his position clear earlier, and I think he regrets it too.  I am myself to blame. <Col N="433" /> I ought to know by now not to rely on the possibility that Ministers will bring forward amendments, and I ought to have put down my amendments in reasonable time.  I blame myself for my remissness.  I do not accept the Minister's reasoning.  I think it is the reasoning of the bureaucrat rather than the reasoning of the statesman, but I have no method of challenging it, and I must put up with it.</P>

      <P>There are two points.  If there are any matters which the Deputy considers vital to the proper discussion of the Census Bill and which he was precluded from discussing, not knowing that the Census was going to be taken under this, I am quite prepared to have this held over, if possible, and recommitted to enable him to discuss the points.  But taking the particulars the Deputy has referred to, since the matter was last discussed in the House this Bill has been very definitely under the consideration of the Department of Local Government, who have examined it in the light of things which ordinarily are asked in Census returns here, and they are quite satisfied that everything that used to be asked can be asked under this.  I am not sure with regard to the point about travelling.  If that is something that in olden times used to be queried, then the Department concerned is satisfied that these questions may be asked.</P>

      <P>I do not expect that the Deputy will take the assurance that I give him second-hand from the Department of Local Government, but they, at any rate, have been assured that they can get any item of information which used to be given when the Census was taken before, under this Bill.  If the Deputy wishes to challenge a Division I think I can arrange it for him now.  I would ask somebody to insert the words &ldquo;and reasonable&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;satisfied,&rdquo; in line 41. <Col N="434" /> I am sure that the House will agree to let that be moved in order to have a Division on it.  I would not move it myself because I do not think it is necessary.  But the other matter is more serious.  There is no exceptional hurry about this Bill, but in view of the fact that the Census is to be taken under it and that forms will have to be got out, it would be advisable to have it as early as possible, yet although I will urge that the Fifth Stage be taken to-morrow if the Fourth Stage be taken to-day, I am not so much in a hurry that I would not throw the whole matter back for ten days in order to have it further considered in Committee so that we could have Census matters discussed.</P>

      <P>The Minister has met us very fairly.  The obvious course would be to postpone the Fourth Stage and allow time for amending, but I am inclined to think that there is urgency about the Bill.  If we are to take the Census in April this Bill ought to go to the Seanad well before the end of February, having regard to various possibilities that may befall it.  I do not suppose they will take place.  I am not taking up the attitude that I want to prevent statistics being collected. I do not, and I am most anxious to have full, accurate and detailed statistics on a great many subjects about which we cannot get statistics at present and about which we ought to have figures.  Therefore I will not press the Minister to postpone the Fourth Stage.  The points at issue can be raised in the Seanad.  I can approach certain Senators, and no doubt they will be willing to get the matter more fully discussed there.  I accept the assurance that the Department of Local Government consider that they can get any information which was got in any census in the past.  As for a Division, the Minister has been so forsaken by his party that it would hardly be fair to call for one.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That is to say, to postpone the coming into force of the Bill for a period of a little less than two years.  There are a number of reasons for doing so.  The first is the fact that this Bill has not been produced in response to an overwhelmingly <Col N="437" /> popular demand.  It has sprung out of the brains of the Ministry, urged by no outside consideration, so far as we can judge.  In a country where resolutions spring up like weeds and spread more widely than weeds, there has not been, as far as I know, a single resolution demanding a separate and new coinage.  I do not think that even the County Cork Farmers' Union, who pass resolutions on every subject under the sun, have passed a resolution demanding a new coinage.</P>
    <P>There is no urgent popular demand for this change.  As I say, it has been incubated and introduced by Ministers alone, and they have given themselves ample time to consider this matter.  They have thought over it for two years, for more than two years.  Since the President was Minister for Finance, nearly two and a-half years, the subject has been under consideration.  It takes such a long time to make up a great mind, and when the great mind is a collective mind it seems to take longer still.  I am only asking that members of the Oireachtas should have the same opportunity as Ministers.  The Minister for Finance said himself on Second Reading: &ldquo;As a matter of fact, this particular proposal was considered very carefully, and all sorts of people were asked for their views in writing on it. People whose views would be valuable, and who have given study to the matter, were asked for their views in writing.&rdquo;  Should not Deputies have the same opportunity of careful study, and, if the results of their study suggest it to them, have opportunities of bringing in an Amending Bill?  I do not think that is an unfair thing to ask.  There are very few people in this country who have knowledge of questions of coinage.  I have, in the limited time at my disposal, tried to approach those whom I could discover who could speak with authority on the question. I do not pretend to speak with any authority myself.</P>
    <P>I never yet had time to undertake the necessary study&mdash;a study of books &mdash;on the question, that is really necessary here if we are to approach the subject properly.  On the whole question there has been very little argument, <Col N="438" /> very little detailed consideration, and I do think that rushing this into law after it has been considered for two years or more by the Executive Council, and for two months by the Oireachtas, is not the best method of approaching a question of this kind. There are many underlying questions. For instance, we have been told that we are going to get a profit of some £600,000 as a result of the Bill, and that was very naturally welcomed by the Dáil.  I think we might study it more carefully, and employ the time I am asking in considering the question of how exactly that £600,000 is going to materialise.  We are going apparently to ask the British Government to coin for us shillings containing&mdash;this is only an illustration&mdash;roughly speaking ninepence worth of silver.  Ultimately these coins will be paid for with silver coins withdrawn from circulation here, not immediately but ultimately. Therefore we are going to pay for shillings containing ninepence worth of silver, with shillings containing sixpence worth.  That is what the present ratio to the British shilling is. The British Government are going to be obliging enough to say that these shillings which contain 6d. worth of silver contain a full shilling's worth, and take them at their face value.  Has any agreement been reached on that subject?  I gathered from the President that the British Government has not been approached on this matter. Certainly if they agree to do it they are either the most philanthropic or the most foolish of mankind.  The Minister will, I hope, state if he has made any arrangement, and if not, is there any precedent for this?  The only one I know is not entirely convincing.</P>
    <P>That is one reason.  Another reason is that any change of this kind should be undertaken gradually.  We should have a little more knowledge about the form of the coin.  We do not know whether the nickel coins are to be pierced in the middle.  We should have a little more knowledge as to the manner and the date on which it is to be introduced.  We should have more knowledge as to the steps that are going to be taken to gather in the other coinage.  On all these points we are <Col N="439" /> entitled to ask for a little more delay and more consideration.  The mature consideration that the Executive Council gave, and rightly gave, to the matter, should be succeeded by an equally mature consideration on the part of the Dáil and of the Seanad.  I therefore beg to move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the proposal that the coming into operation of this Bill should be postponed. As Deputy Cooper has said, there are numerous reasons that could be offered for such a course.  I agree with him in the various reasons that he has already given, but I would like to supplement those by again suggesting what I suggested yesterday by way of question to the Minister for Finance, namely, that when he is setting up, as he has now, a Commission known as the Banking Commission, and when he is giving that Commission what he himself has described as wide terms of reference&mdash;and the terms do certainly seem wide&mdash;is it not folly for us, to say the least of it, to proceed with a measure of this kind without at least first taking the view of these eminent gentlemen who are to sit on this Commission? The Banking Commission, largely composed as it is of bankers and those interested from the banking point of view, must of necessity, especially owing to the fact that there are also outside experts brought on to that Commission, have an intimate knowledge of coinage.  The Minister, in reply to another question I put to him some time ago concerning this Bill, said that he had already consulted banking authorities.  Well, I think it is only fair to the Dáil that we should be told who these banking authorities were.  He is setting up a Commission composed of banking authorities.  Has he consulted members of the Commission, and if he has not, why should he not be satisfied to wait and learn their opinion on this question, which, though it may have been in his mind for the last two years, has certainly not been foremost in the public attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said previously on another stage of the Bill, there has been no demand for it.  No one can point even to a clamour in the Press by way of correspondence <Col N="440" /> in favour of a change in token coinage.  There has been a certain amount of discussion on the question of currency, but as for the proposal to change our token coinage and not to disturb the currency, I at any rate, who am a fairly close student&mdash; much as I dislike having to do it&mdash;of the daily Press, have certainly not found anything of that nature.  It is all very well for the Minister and those who support him to say that this leaves entirely untrammelled and untouched, as, strictly speaking, it does, the question of the future currency of the country.  Yet I reiterate my own belief that it will certainly be taken in some quarters as an indication that there may be a possibility at some future date, even not too remote, of interfering not only with the token coinage but also with the currency.  The immediate effect will be practically infinitesimal.  The Minister, I am sure, does not contend that at the moment we pass this Bill we shall be £600,000 better off in the State.  It will take a considerable time before that amount can be possibly saved, if that amount can be saved at all.  He has stated it is a round sum and we all wish and hope that his forecast may be accurate, but he has given no ground whatever to the Dáil to enable them to see whether he is in any way justified in the conclusion that he has drawn. When these coins are issued it stands to reason that the new coins and the old coins will not circulate together, because the country will not require that amount of money.  Either all new coins will not be issued at once, and therefore we will not be able to get our £600,000 within a reasonable space of time into our pockets, or else the present coins will be withdrawn and sent elsewhere.  I would also like to press the Minister for a reply to the question as to whether he has made, so far, any arrangements with the British Treasury, or with the Bank of England, or with any concern in England, to take over the existing silver and copper token coinage circulating in this country at its present face value.  I think that probably there must be sufficient token coinage in circulation in Great Britain to-day for the <Col N="441" /> needs of that country, and is it likely that we will be in the position of being able to force this surplus amount of coinage which we do not want here upon what seems to be at the moment an unwilling acceptor across the water? The necessity for getting rid of the existing currency, if we are going to issue a new one, is too simple for argument. But where are we going to get rid of it?  Who is going to take it? What are we going to get for it?  Are we going to have to part with it at a discount, and if so, what is that to be?</P>
    <P>The proposal to issue new forms of coin in the shape of nickel ones seems to have emanated from the minds of the Executive Council or perhaps even only from the mind of the Minister himself.  Apart from the difficulties and the smallness of the immediate profit, any advantage that can accrue, even on the Minister's own showing, from this new coinage will be far outweighed by the inconvenience resulting from it.  The other Dominions have their own coinage.  They are not in anything like the same proximity or immediate and constant intercourse with Great Britain as we are.  I do not know whether any provision has been made for the circulation of British coins here for any definite period.  It is true that until the Minister chooses they are allowed to remain.  But what I can see likely to take place will be this: that he will find it difficult to get the existing coinage out of circulation here, and that, just as occurred during the late war when a certain amount of hoarding took place in regard to gold coins, it is very likely that a similar system will be indulged in, in regard to the existing silver and copper ones. People in this country know the value of the present coins.  They do not know &mdash;they are not experts in coinage&mdash;the amount of silver and alloy in these coins.  That is not what concerns them. But they know that these coins are good for what they say they are; they do not know what will be the value of the future coins.  They may know their face value.  But they do know the intrinsic purchasing power of the present coin.  I have yet to learn where and from what source and by what means it has been brought to the knowledge <Col N="442" /> of the Executive Council that the people of this country desire to change their coinage.  For that reason and for the reasons I have already mentioned, I desire to support Deputy Cooper's proposal to postpone the coming into operation of this measure, if it passes, for two years.  I specially want to stress that we have now a Banking Commission composed mainly of outside experts, and one of the first duties of this Commission will be to examine into the existing system of coinage and into the possibility of future changes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper is a very well-informed Deputy and I am quite surprised to know where he got the information that the shilling which is going to be coined will contain ninepence worth of silver.  That is something that is not within the four corners of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy used it as an argument that we are issuing coins which contain ninepence worth of silver as against a coin which contains only sixpence worth.  As a matter of fact the British coin is half alloy, and the portion that is not silver may not be worth twopence.  The agreement which is entered into with the Mint in London gives him the exact amount which it will cost to get £1,000,000 worth of these coins.  These coins will be produced and accounted for to the Minister, <Col N="443" /> and handed to him less insurance expenses.  Therefore it is very easy to calculate what the cost is.  It is an easy sum in subtraction.  If it costs £350,000 to mint coins that are put into circulation to the value of £1,000,000, it is not difficult to calculate that there is a profit of £650,000 made on the transaction.  I am sure there will not be any argument on that point.</P>
      <P>As regards getting the present coinage out of circulation, we know very well that when the British Government wanted gold it did not take long to put gold out of circulation.  If you examine the statistics in regard to exports you will find that a considerable quantity of silver was exported from this country last year; silver was sent away in huge quantities.  I contend that there will be no difficulty in sending back the money now in circulation, and Britain has no right to refuse to accept it; Britain has no right to refuse acceptance of its own coin.  The coin is British, and they will have to pay for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to add my small voice to the remarks made by Deputy Cooper when he was moving the amendment.  When Deputy Wilson tried to infer that Deputy Redmond's remarks were out of order on this amendment, I think he merely illustrated the fact that he himself, rather than Deputy Redmond, was out of order, because he went on to discuss a thing that had no connection with the amendment, the cost of the minting of the coin.  The amendment seeks a postponement for two years of the putting of the coins into circulation.  I claim that is not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the immediate issue of token coins you are going to have an anomalous position.  Your new token coins will be in circulation at the same time as the Treasury note is in circulation. Arguments put forward for the introduction of token coinage must equally apply to the issue of the bank note. The Commission that is about to sit and consider matters relating to banking will, I presume, explore the whole question, and it is quite likely that some recommendation of a general character resulting from that Commission might <Col N="444" /> be prejudiced by the fact that in the meantime the coins indicated in this Bill will be issued.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned, I think, that the movement for the circulation of token coins emanated from the Ministry. I do not think it has been stated that there is any public demand for the coins.  Attached to the proposal is the attraction that the State is going to make a considerable sum of money over the change.  Owing to various circumstances, public opinion for some time past has been in a very comatose condition, and the general interest that we hope will be taken later on in the proceedings of this House has not, so far, been as much in evidence as one would wish, particularly considering the amount of wisdom that we display on various occasions here.  I think it is extraordinary the limited knowledge the general public have of the proceedings of this House.</P>
    <P>In a big issue of this kind I hold that the public has a right to get time fully to consider the change in all its aspects. Up to the present I think they have not had time to consider fully, not only this Bill, but many other Bills.  On various occasions I endeavoured to indicate in this House that in my opinion the people of the country do not want any drastic changes to take place or to be suddenly thrust upon them.  In my judgment the present public demand is that the people should be allowed to find their feet and form opinions on those changes.  They do not want to have the Minister or the Ministry throwing bombshells of this kind.</P>

I believe there would not be much loss to the country if we defer the circulation of new coins for two years.  This question of token coinage must, of necessity, form part of a very much bigger question.  When nearly every Minister in the Executive Council has some Commission or other sitting to examine or explore, and incidentally to inform the public on various things, I believe the time is <Col N="445" /> not opportune to press a change of this far-reaching nature on the country without due consideration.  I have much pleasure in supporting Deputy Cooper's amendment.</P>

      <P>I have thought a good deal about the present alleged agitation for economy and saving on public expenditure and I wondered what there was behind it&mdash;whether there was any reality in it.  I am convinced that, so far as Deputy Hewat and Deputy Cooper can speak, it is really an empty demand.  There is no real purpose or intention in the minds of people asking for a saving in expenditure and the better equipment financially of the State by any legitimate means.  Here is a proposition which the Minister, speaking with all the authority of his office, says will mean a saving to the value of £600,000 or £700,000 in some period of time.  I do not know whether Deputies doubt the authenticity of this estimate, whether they deny it or have any other estimate of the saving to the State of this token coinage.  But if they admit there will be any saving at all, why do they want to put it off for two years?  That I do not understand, if there is any genuineness in their claim for lowering of taxation or economy in expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am bound to agree with one or two things that Deputy Hewat said.  I think it is true that public opinion is generally in a comatose state and I think it is to be deplored.  Possibly, the introduction of a new coinage will help to arouse public opinion.  It might be cheap even if it were to entail all the evil consequences Deputies Hewat and Cooper seem to think.  Another item of the Deputy's speech with which I am inclined to agree is that the arguments used in favour of this token coinage are equally powerful and strong in respect to the arguments as to bank notes.  I am in agreement with that, but public opinion imagines it is something very different.  I believe there is no difference in essence between the issue of bank notes, without any gold or other real commodity behind them&mdash;nothing except a hope and a faith in the future.  I believe there is no difference, but, for good or evil, the public think differently.  They know <Col N="446" /> well, as far as bronze and silver coins are concerned, that there is not intrinsically the value of one-twentieth of a pound in a shilling.  They are not deceived and yet they are prepared to accept token coinage.  Because the public believes that and acts accordingly, I can see no harm whatsoever in handing over to that public a shilling containing, honestly, half the intrinsic value or, as in this case, a little more than the intrinsic value of the old shilling.  You would have a profit on the new coin.  I do not know what the law is regarding the obligation of British banks or the British mint to accept silver or bronze coins.  I do not know whether there is an obligation on them at all.</P>

      <P>There is an old doctrine that the coin which is baser will drive out the coin that is better in value.  I think this Bill, which provides that the Ministry can decide when a particular coin can become, and what issues can become, legal tender, safeguards any possibility that the British coinage will remain and drive out the Irish coinage.  I have no doubt whatever the public will prefer the Irish coinage very early after it is introduced, and nothing has been said that appeals to my sense at all in the way of showing there is any danger in the introduction of token coinage. After all, the banking or financial people do not think in terms of token coinage at all, and I can see no more real difference or greater danger in this matter than accrued in respect of the introduction of a new postage stamp or an over-printed postal order.  It is exactly the same thing.  Why there should be this curious opposition to the saving of any sum up to £600,000.  I cannot understand&mdash;even though it is saved in any period however long.  I cannot account for it except that there is a sentimental fear that if you do not introduce a coinage with the head of King George something is going to happen.  It may not be quite consciously realised, but I fear there is no other solid objection to it.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Johnson asked the question whether we <Col N="447" /> agreed with the Minister's estimate of the £600,000.  I do not think it would be possible to agree or disagree.  There is one thing I do say&mdash;that the reserve that will have to be held in proportion to the amount in circulation, so far as the Free State is concerned, will be entirely out of proportion to the amount of reserve in proportion to circulation of general coins such as we are at present using.  I think that if you are going to secure that the token coinage of the Free State will be always available, you will have to keep a reserve which will largely discount the £600,000 that the Minister refers to. Then, again, you are running a very much greater danger if you have not got a big reserve.  What has often happened before will happen: that is, that certain forms of the coinage will go out of circulation altogether.  That is only temporary, because if you have the reserve you can put them into circulation again.  For ordinary working purposes, a circulation of token coinage that is serving 40 to 50 millions of people is, according to Deputy Johnson's own idea of centralisation, much more economical and profitable to handle than a separate coinage which is only going to serve the needs of a population of three millions.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister knowledge of the extent of the traffic between England and Ireland annually, or during any period, say, five years, in silver or bronze coinage?  Is it a fact that we rely upon the reserve in England?  The coming and going of traffic might give us an indication whether there is any reliance here on English reserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the question of reserve arises in connection with token coinage.  The banks must hold a certain amount of money, in addition to that which is in circulation among the people.  The question of reserve would only come into consideration if there were a great and sudden increase of prosperity and rise of prices, as then you must get more silver from your reserve to put into circulation.  In pre-war days the amount of silver that came in was not large and <Col N="448" /> was clearly ascertainable.  Since the war there has rather been a tendency to get rid of silver.  Great amounts came into the country which were not required, and there has been very little coming recently&mdash;about £10,000 or £12,000 a year.  I think that Deputy Hewat cannot really have thought out the question of reserve.  Where money is wanted in large sums no form of token money is required with a limited circulation, and there need be no reserve, or practically none, in the hands of the Government at all, and so the question of profit is not affected by that question. There is no doubt what the profit will be.  We have had estimates based on the present prices of metal, and, unless there is some sharp variation in prices before the coins are minted, there is no doubt that we will have a profit of about £642,000.  We have not entered into any negotiations with the British Government as to their taking back the coins here.  When we have this law passed we can do that.  There are arguments which, I think, it would be impossible for the British Government to resist in favour of their taking back the coins now in issue in the Free State in view of the division of functional powers which has taken place. If they have already taken the coins in the case of one dominion&mdash;the amount involved was smaller but the principle was the same&mdash;and if they refuse to take back the coins in circulation here at their face value, it would be very like dishonouring a cheque. Assuming, however, that they were to do so, that would not prevent us getting rid of the coin at its face value, but the process might be slower.  I think that no one who has gone into the question has suggested that it would not be easy for us to get rid of all the coin here at its face value.  If the British Government do not take it over in bulk, it might require some time longer for us to get rid of it.  Very big sums have been taken out of the country in the past year.</P>

I have not heard any argument in favour of postponing this for two years.  The fact that we have taken care not to act with precipitancy is not an argument in favour of postponement, but rather is it otherwise.  If there has not been a newspaper demand there has been a popular demand.  I have met great numbers of people who were anxious to have our own token coinage.  I met them in all sorts of places and amongst all classes.  When we say that there is no popular demand we should not forget the historical background of the Free State.

      <P>There is one thing which I congratulate myself upon and that is, that this amendment has caused Deputy Johnson to break the unnatural silence with which he confronted us since the Recess.  He has now dissipated the fear which I had, that he had taken some kind of Trappist vow, but when he break silence on this amendment he cause me to say:&mdash;&ldquo;Quantum mutatus ab illa, Hectore.&rdquo;  It is not the Deputy Johnson we used to know. He talks in an awed voice as if he were entering into a cathedral and speaking as a Minister with all the authority of his office.  If I believed in possession <Col N="450" /> by spirits I should say that he has been possessed of the spirits of unnatural obedience and subservience, that Deputy Magennis has lately chastened out of himself.  Deputy Johnson knows better than to attach any undue importance to the statements of Ministers.</P>
      <P>He knows well that Ministers can make mistakes like anybody else, and, to do them justice, they do not pretend that they do not.  They are very slow to talk about &ldquo;speaking with all the authority of my office.&rdquo;  Thank heaven for it.  I do not like to see Deputy Johnson leading them astray.  When the Labour Party comes into office, perhaps after the next election, they will pontificate, and there will be solemn rebukes to people who dare question the authority of their office. I do not question the Minister for Finance.  He is always fair and candid, but I think that the Deputies have a right to get more information concerning the basis of his calculation. Deputy Johnson asked whether I was in a position to put forward another estimate of what we would gain.  I cannot, and that is the reason for this amendment.  It would probably take me eighteen to make the estimate, but if Deputy Johnson votes for and carries this amendment, perhaps in eighteen months' time I could give that estimate.  If I collaborated with Deputy Hewat I might do it within twelve months.  I want to get a little more information as to the Minister's estimate.  To Deputy Wilson I must apologise.  I had forgotten the passionate desire for mathematical accuracy which pervades the Farmers' Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going to ask Britain to coin for us a shilling containing 75 per cent. alloy.  We are going to pay them for that with a shilling containing 50 per cent. alloy, and they are going to be obliging enough to pretend that it does not contain any alloy at all.  Deputy Wilson says it is all right.  I think he visualised the Minister writing a cheque when the thing was done.  But you have got to pay for a cheque with something.  You have got either to have money or goods behind it.  The trouble is that we are not, in our dealings with England, having the same <Col N="451" /> amount of goods behind our currency or our cheques as we had in past years. The Farmers' Party know that, and are suffering for it, and I do not want to make any joke about it.  The Minister when he writes a cheque will have to give something in exchange.  I gather he contemplates the currency&mdash; gradually replacing this currency&mdash;and he accepts the position, that because the British Government have done that in the case of one Dominion it will do it in our case.  I think I am right in saying that the one Dominion which the Minister refers to is South Africa. Am I right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am correctly informed, the change in the coinage of South Africa took place in the year 1920, eleven years after South Africa received Dominion status.  That is another argument in favour of the amendment&mdash;that this change is not necessary. Nineteen hundred and twenty was not only the time when the coinage was changed in South Africa, but it was about the time when it was changed in England also, and instead of the coins containing 92 per cent. of silver the British Government substituted coins containing only 50 per cent. of silver.  Practically none of this new coinage had got out to South Africa, so that the mint got back nothing but coins containing 92 per cent. of silver, while at the same time they were coining coins containing only 50 per cent. silver.  That was obviously a profitable transaction for the British Mint&mdash; obviously advantageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These conditions do not exist in this case at all. I do not know why the Minister stood out for 75 per cent. of silver in his coinage.  He has never given any reason for that.  That is another argument for delay.  It might be possible to exchange on what you might call a fifty-fifty basis, but to coin a more valuable coin and accept a less valuable coin in exchange, seems to be quixotic.  The Minister said that even if the British Government did not agree we could somehow or another replace it in time by dribbling it over <Col N="452" /> the Border.  But it would be a long process; it would be a comparatively costly process, and it would not be a very dignified process.</P>
    <P>We have opened up new avenues in the subject this afternoon.  That in itself is an argument for further consideration and delay.  The Minister said that when he has got his law passed he can negotiate with the British Government.  I am not quarrelling with his passing the law.  Certainly let him pass it and let him have it in reserve.  All I suggest is that the law should not come into operation until he has time for these negotiations.</P>
    <P>The President was good enough to say on the Second Reading that I was generally reasonable in regard to matters. I am sorry he should think me unreasonable in this.  My only consolation is that I often find him unreasonable and that does not affect the respect and admiration I have for him.  I hope that feeling may be reciprocated.  But I am unreasonable in his eyes on one or two points&mdash;the points that touch the daily life of the ordinary man.  I do believe that the greatest need of the country and the greatest desire of the majority of people is to get back to normal conditions as soon as possible in the things that touch their everyday ordinary life.  They care little for constitutional changes, juridical changes, changes in the law courts, changes, that affect them only once or twice a year.  They do not mind outward changes, such as in the colour of the pillar-boxes, but I do think that in things that affect the everyday conduct of life in the home they are anxious to get back to ordinary bread and butter politics and, therefore, I hold that we should be wise to delay making sudden changes such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the discussion of the details of the proposals goes a very considerable way to support the plea for going slowly in this matter.  I agree with Deputy Cooper that the Minister has not really substaintiated the case for adopting, for example, the 75 per cent. standard of fineness instead of 50 per cent.  To get £180,000 for £75,000 appeals to Deputy Johnson, but I think the prospect of <Col N="453" /> getting £180,000 for £50,000 would appeal to him still more strongly.  The Minister simply said in that connection that there had been certain difficulties experienced in respect to the actual coinage where the alloy was 50 per cent.  Therefore, he went apparently somewhere about half-way between the previous 92 per cent. and the present 50 per cent., but he gave no indication that any real definite experimental work had been carried out to see what was the best alloy that could be used. If you have very fine silver you will have a coin that will wear fast.  If, on the other hand, you have only 50 per cent. of silver, there appears to be some difficulty in striking a good coin, not that any of us object very much to carrying the 50 per cent. coinage in our pockets.  Some of us would be very glad if we had it.  But, I think it is quite a probability that a very small percentage of change in the amount of alloy will give you a wearable and durable coin and also a coin that will not afford that difficulty with reference to striking that is experienced with the 50 per cent. alloy.  The Minister gave us no sort of assurance that any real trials had been made in that respect. That is one point on which I think time is required in order to make sure that when we are doing this we shall do it in as good a way as possible.</P>
      <P>I am speaking of details because I am taking it for granted that the principle has been adopted by the passing of the Second Reading, and I have no thought in my mind as to offering this suggestion of delay with the object of spiking the Bill or anything of that kind.  Reasonable delay does not mean throwing out the Bill; it means merely seeing that the Bill is carried into effect in the best way possible.  There are other things which require investigation, but I will confine myself to speaking of that.  If you can make this profit when you are going to put 75 per cent. silver into the coins, and silver costs something like 2s. 9d. an ounce&mdash;which is a substantial figure&mdash; I think you might very well try to get considerably more profit by putting in less.  You will not then be met with the difficulty of asking someone to hand you more than the actual value for the coin you return.</P>

      <P>I do not really know what bearing Deputy Thrift's and Deputy Cooper's arguments had on the exchange of coin.  I think it was some attempt to deceive or blindfold the Dáil, because it is a question of the British taking back coins which were issued for a certain sterling value. They issue their half-crown as one-eighth of a sovereign and the question of their taking it back has nothing to do with the totally different question of minting certain coins under contract. We are not bound to go to the Royal Mint for our coins.  We could get them in the United States Mint.  There are also private mints.  The question of mintage has absolutely nothing to do with the other question of the British receiving back certain coins which they paid out for a certain face value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with the other separate question. The amount of silver in the coin is a matter on which I stated briefly what our views were.  Several countries recently have had silver coins issued of the proportion we proposed, seventy-five per cent.  People who have experience of dealing with the mintage of coins recommended that proportion, which would give us a very good-wearing handsome coin.  That would be particularly desirable on our first issue of coinage.  At some later stage there would be nothing to prevent us issuing new coins with a less proportion of silver if we wanted to do it, and the expense of replacing one coinage by another would not be very considerable at any time if we choose to do it.  The cost of mintage would be something like five or six per cent. of the face value.  We could do it for one year's interest on the total coinage issue.  If it was desired at a later stage to issue coinage containing only fifty per cent. of silver these coins could be issued to replace the coins we now propose to issue.  We thought it desirable in all the circumstances, having regard to the <Col N="455" /> unreasonable hesitations and tremors that we have had evidence of here to-day, to issue a coinage that was a good coinage and that would be a creditable and handsome coinage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been very lenient, indeed.  The amendment is to insert the words: &ldquo;On and after the 1st day of January, 1928,&rdquo; and the reasons given are that it is desirable to get more information. Deputy Cooper and Deputy Thrift want more information, and to take the fullest possible advantage of the variations of the markets.  The proposal is that the Bill shall pass giving the Minister all the powers to take advantage of the markets and to issue coinage, gather all the information, and submit it to the public if he likes.  The Bill is to be passed, giving the Minister power to do these things, but he must not take advantage of the markets before the 1st January, 1928.  If silver becomes cheaper before that time, &ldquo;Nothing doing.&rdquo;  He cannot buy it; he cannot enter into this contract.  He must wait until the 1st January, 1928. As far as the Bill is concerned, the Minister may do this at any time, even waiting after that time.

I accept the principle of Irish coinage, but I say it should not be an Irish nickel coinage, because wherever I have come across nickel coinage it is one of two things&mdash;either ugly or inconvenient.  If it is, as the French and Belgian coins are, punched in the middle, it is impossible to have any really artistic design on it.  If you have a hole punched out of the middle of the coin you get little things crowded in the corners.</P>

The only argument the Minister put forward in favour of nickel was that it was decided to have a nickel threepenny bit because the present threepenny bit was inconvenient, and that involved having a nickel sixpence.  If that is his aim I suggest he might do equally well by abolishing the threepenny bit.  That is not the substance of my amendment, but I would be able to accept that as a compromise. We will have these coins and British coins for a time circulating in this country side by side.  My experience between silver and nickel coins of about the same size and the same value circulating side by side as in Italy, is that there is an extraordinary amount of confusion.  I only speak of my experience as a traveller and tourist. After all, travellers and tourists will be coming here, and there are a great many old-fashioned people who do not like to change their ways.  This is not a partisan amendment put forward with any ulterior motive, and I would urge the Minister to accept it or allow a free vote.</P>

      <P>I think there is a good deal in the concluding remarks of Deputy Cooper about the abolition of the threepenny bit.  There may be advantages in having a threepenny bit, but I do not think the advantages are on the side of the people who have them because they are very apt to get lost.  There may be an advantage to the Department of Finance because the Minister admitted the other day that one of the means he has got at his disposal of being able to replace coins in circulation is that some are inevitably lost, especially that small coin known as the threepenny bit.  It is an inconvenient coin.  It does not represent very much, and three copper pence is not a very incommodious weight to have to carry in one's pocket.  I do not think it would cause great inconvenience to any people in any walk of life in this country if the threepenny bit or its substitute were abolished. <Col N="458" /> Strictly speaking, this of course does not come within Deputy Cooper's amendment, but, the matter having been referred to, I took the liberty of doing so also.</P>
      <P>Now the suggestion is that the word &ldquo;nickel&rdquo; be deleted and that if there is to be a sixpenny and a threepenny bit that they should be silver.  I think there is a great deal to be said in support of that.  I have seen various forms of nickel coins, from Belgian coins to Chinese ones.  They are holy coins in China.  You see dragons and holes in the centre of them, but they are distinctly inartistic and in some ways incommodious and very likely to be mistaken for silver coins of similar size. The introduction of nickel is, of course, a novelty, and perhaps for that reason it commends itself especially to the Ministry because they are fond of novelty.  Perhaps it may be said on their behalf that because it is a novelty it does not commend itself to those on these benches.  However that may be, I do not think it is a novelty that has been demanded or asked for.  I do not think there will be any general approval for it.  If the threepenny bit were abolished and the sixpenny bit was to be of its present dimensions in silver, I do not think there would really be any necessity for any nickel coins at all.</P>

      <P>I desire to support Deputy Cooper and Deputy Redmond as regards the retention of the present silver coins.  I think the Minister would be well advised to continue the issue of silver coins as at present. My experience of dealing with silver coinage side by side with nickel coinage is that the silver coinage is preferred by the people.  I believe that the silver coin is the neater coin.  At any rate it looks very like real money. I know that, having had some experience in regard to the coinage in Canada, where we had the silver ten-cent. piece.  Sometimes that coin circulated there with the American dime or ten-cent. piece, which is made of nickel.  Although the dime was American, it was current in Canada, and it could be accepted, but it was not generally regarded as a coin that the people liked a great deal.  It was <Col N="459" /> an unsightly sort of coin.  It turned dark in colour, and was affected to a greater extent than the silver coin by being carried on the person.  An argument used in favour of the retention of the present silver sixpence is that the people have got accustomed to it. I think there will be some difficulty in getting the people to take kindly to these new nickel coins.  Then there is also the fact that this new nickel threepenny piece will, apparently, be of about the same size as the present silver sixpence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event I think no real advantage is to be gained by the introduction of these new coins. I do not agree with Deputy Cooper or Deputy Redmond as to the abolition of the threepenny bit.  I cannot see any disadvantage in its present size, and I do not see why it should not be retained. There may be a slight disadvantage in the fact that it is liable to get lost sometimes.  Even if it does it is not a coin of very great value.  In my opinion the introduction of these new nickel coins will be a great disadvantage, and I think it would be far more acceptable to the people if the present silver sixpenny piece and threepenny piece were retained.  Their retention would have this additional advantage, that they would be similar to the coins in use in England, and travellers coming here would have no difficulty in distinguishing them.  In an earlier portion of the debate Deputy Johnson made a remark with regard to inferior coins displacing the good ones. I think Deputy Johnson's information in that regard was hardly right.  My own opinion is that when you are dealing with token coins it makes no difference. It is only when you are dealing with actual currency, where the good coin could be taken out of circulation and melted down and where the actual metal value of the good coin is greater than the metal value of the inferior coin that danger might arise in that way.  That is the only case, I think, in <Col N="460" /> which the inferior coin would displace the good coin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to argue this on any matter of principle. The reason why the change was suggested is simply this: We found that there was a great deal of objection to the threepenny bit as it at present exists.  It is a coin easily lost and rather difficult to pick up again.  It is difficult to find in the recesses of one's pocket.  It is generally regarded as not being a very good sort of coin.  On the other hand it was felt that to have no coin smaller than the sixpence, nothing between the penny and the sixpence, was hardly desirable.  That might mean, in many cases, carrying more coppers than people would like to carry.  You have, of course, to have regard to the fact that the present purchasing value of a penny is small, so that if you had a convenient coin in place of the present threepenny bit it might have a good deal of circulation and be carried a good deal.  We want now to increase the size of the threepenny bit, but we could not increase that without increasing the size of the sixpence.  Otherwise there would be a liability to confusion.  If the threepenny piece and sixpenny piece were increased in size and were still made of silver it would have meant that the cost of making that change in size would have run somewhere near £100,000.  That would have been a very considerable sum.  I have not been able to get an exact calculation of the cost just at the moment, but at any rate it would have been a very considerable sum.  On the other hand, by making them of nickel there was an actual saving of about £35,000 as compared with what the cost would be under Deputy Cooper's amendment.  That is to say, to make them of the old size and of the same amount of silver would cost about £35,000 more than by making the coins to the new size and of nickel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is felt that nickel is a good deal used in many countries for coinage.  It is not an unpleasant metal in any way. Quite a nice coin can be made of it. and in all the circumstances it was thought that we would have a more convenient coin for the people if we increased the size of the threepenny bit somewhat <Col N="461" /> and increased the size of the sixpenny bit a little further, so as to prevent confusion, and so that there would be no possibility at all of mistakes being made.  In some countries you have nickel coins of almost the same size as certain silver coins, so that unless one looks carefully at them confusion is likely to take place.  Here the size would be big enough to prevent confusion arising.  There would be not only a difference in size but in colour, feel and design.  The intention is to make the nickel coin with plain edges instead of milled edges so that even in the dark people handling the coins would not be liable to confusion.  It is not a thing that I want to regard as a vital principle in the Bill or anything like that.  I submit to the Dáil that we will have, on the whole, a suitable coinage if we adopt these new sizes.  We will get rid of a coin that is of a very inconvenient size, and will substitute for it a coin that can be more easily handled. and that will cause no confusion. There will be no risk of mistake with it, and there will also be the extra gain to the State of about £35,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister, in connection with this matter, not consider the question of perforating the token coinage&mdash;the threepence and the sixpence?  I do not care what you do in the way of size; there is bound to be confusion, and the obvious way for a man to satisfy himself whether he is taking a silver coin or a token coin out of his pocket, in the dark, is to have the token coin perforated.  That would enable the Minister also to increase the size and to make a better coin than is proposed now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Cooper's amendment. I am rather surprised at the attitude taken up by the Minister with regard to this matter.  He stated, on the one hand, when he spoke of silver coinage, that he had no hesitation in adding 25 per cent. of silver to the larger silver coin.  He might have saved, if he had adopted 50 per cent., something like £200,000.  Now he makes a point that he is doing away with the silver coins in these smaller issues because he is going to make a saving of £35,000.  If he <Col N="462" /> wanted to save money, there is no reason why he should not have saved £200,000 in the other case.  I do not think that the Minister made a good case for the issue of nickel.  Anyone who has travelled abroad has a great objection to nickel coins; I object to them very much.  I also object to the threepenny piece.  I am one of those people who, for one reason or another, am constantly finding holes in my pockets and threepenny pieces are constantly vanishing through them.  Consequently I regard threepenny pieces with the greatest aversion.</P>

      <P>If the Minister gives a guarantee that there will be no confusion as the result of the adoption of nickel coinage, even in the mind of a cattle-drover coming from a fair in the dark on a wet night, and that he will not confuse the silver coin with the nickel, then frankly I do not believe it, or else I myself must be very inferior to the average person.  I have always found the use of nickel, side by side with silver, confusing.  Deputy Sir James Craig has disposed of the argument the Minister used as regards the plea of cost.  If the Minister wished to continue the silver coin he could have done so by adjusting his percentage of alloy to a certain extent without any additional cost.  It is hard to weigh and balance the argument with regard to the cost suddenly produced at the last moment.  We have no information as to the cost of the manufacture of those coins, or no information as to the estimate that may be in the Minister's possession.  I cannot properly weigh and balance the arguments with regard to cost, but I am sure that if the Minister wanted to get over it he could.  In my opinion, the desire to introduce these nickel coins is one more instance of change for the sake of change, and for the sake of doing something new.  I do not see how we shall derive any advantage from this change, either economically, spiritually, or otherwise, and therefore I must press my amendment.</P>

      <P>I beg, sir, with your permission, to intervene for a moment before we take the next item. I find that we could adjourn to-morrow for a fortnight, granted that the Minister for Justice would get some facilities in connection with the Land Bill. That has been more or less agreed to, but it would be necessary for him to get accommodation to-morrow for the Committee, Report and Final Stages of the measure, and if that could be agreed on we could adjourn for a fortnight. I mention it now to give Deputies an opportunity of considering the matter in time so that they could raise any objections this evening or to-morrow.  I understand that there is a request from some Deputies that the School Attendance Bill should not be taken to-morrow, and I presume that when we are about to adjourn to-night we will be able to hear what the general view is as to whether we should adjourn from to-night, or sit to-morrow and finish the Land Bill.</P>

      <P>I would have a very strong objection to any further postponement of the School Attendance Bill if it were possible to get the Committee Stage concluded before this proposed adjournment.  The President knows that there have been very long <Col N="465" /> delays, some of them unavoidable, some of them otherwise, with regard to this Bill.  It is three years late.  There have been no such delays in connection with any other Bill.  Between the Committee Stage and the Report Stage it may be necessary to have a delay of, say, a week or ten days.  If it is put off for another fortnight it will be well into April, into the Easter Recess, before we get it through, and I see no reason why it could not be got through this evening or to-morrow.  I do not think that there is any very important business on for to-morrow, with the exception of the Bill mentioned by the President, and I suggest that an attempt should be made to finish the Committee Stage of the School Attendance Bill before the adjournment spoken of by the President.</P>

      <P>Well, it would be very late to-night, if we reach them to-night, but even so we could not finish the discussion. We will have, as we always have on a Friday, a thin House when this important matter is being discussed. Furthermore, if we adjourn to-morrow afternoon for a fortnight we will have an interregnum in the middle of a Bill.  I suggest that we should leave the Bill over, let it be the first item on the Order Paper immediately after the adjournment, and then let it be dealt with continuously.  But to have a break of a fortnight and to have the most important amendments in connection with the Bill settled in a thin House to-morrow would be exceedingly undesirable.</P>

That is an obvious conclusion from the arguments. Then I take it we shall be having the Estimates, not the Supplementary Estimates, within the next two or three weeks, and that will give the House plenty to discuss, I think.

Otherwise, if we start to discuss it now we either have to rush it and attempt to finish it, or break off to-morrow and postpone the consideration of it for a couple of weeks further.  As Deputies know, it is impossible to forecast how long the Committee Stage of a Bill may take. What appears to be a very minor amendment may develop a very long debate.  We had to-day a very long debate on certain things that looked very unimportant, and still some Deputies thought fit to talk on them at very great length.  I am inclined to think we have only two alternatives&mdash;adjourn the Committee Stage until we meet again in a week or two, or do what Deputy Johnson says, continue sitting next week and finish the Committee Stage of the Bill, starting to-night.</P>

I think it is a very undesirable course if it could be avoided, because undoubtedly it is a very important Bill, and while the Dáil is the body that has to decide, there should be a fair opportunity given to the public, to whom the matters affected have been quite strange.  They have not been apprised of them, and I think it at least necessary that an opportunity should be given to that public to become acquainted with the Bill and the issues raised. On that alone I think it is desirable that there should be a meeting next week, and that combined with the need of discussing the School Attendance <Col N="470" /> Bill seems to compel us to the conclusion that we ought not to adjourn for a fortnight to-morrow.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The message prescribed by the Constitution has been received from his Excellency the Governor-General.  The charges which will ultimately fall upon the Exchequer as a result of the School Attendance Bill will probably be very considerable.  There may be some small charges falling on the Exchequer as a result of the work devolving on the Gárda Síochána through the enforcement of the Bill, but the charges will <Col N="471" /> mainly result from the increased number of teachers required, increased capitation grants, and, in addition, State assistance for the provision of additional school accommodation.  It would be very difficult to fix any exact figure, but I think I would be safe in saying that, as the Bill stands, in a few years there would be an increased charge between £100,000 and £150,000.</P>
    <P>There are amendments down increasing the age from 14 to 16 years.  If, as a result of those amendments, the children between 14 and 16 years who are not at secondary schools, technical schools, who are not already at Primary schools or are not in apprenticeship, were to be compelled to attend the Primary schools, there would be ultimately a charge falling on the Exchequer for additional teachers and additional capitation grants of probably as much as £190,000 to £200,000.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is to be anticipated that for some time all children who are not now attending school between those years will be compelled to attend school.  Even if they were, such a heavy charge could not accrue for many years.  The teachers could not actually be found, and I do not think accommodation would be available for some time.  The position financially, so far as it can be estimated, is that if the Bill is passed, and if amendments are passed increasing the age from 14 to 16 years, there is the possibility of an ultimate extra charge of something like £350,000.  I do not wish the Dáil to infer that in practice it would work out as high as that, but certainly the charge will be very considerable.</P>

      <P>In line 2 to delete the work &ldquo;six&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;seven.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment applies to the age at which compulsory school attendance will start.  A great many arguments could be used in regard to this particular suggestion.  It is a matter of opinion whether six or seven is a suitable age at which to start compulsion. My idea is that six is too young and a child is not sufficiently developed either physically or mentally at that stage of life to be compelled to go to school regularly.  I do not think parents should be compelled to send a child of that age regularly to school.</P>
      <P>This amendment applies more particularly to rural communities, where children have to travel long distances.  If this Bill is passed in its present form it will be compulsory on children to go to school sometimes a distance of two miles.  I suggest that a child of six years is not sufficiently developed physically to travel that distance.  A child of that age should not be forced to travel two miles to school.  I am against compulsory attendance in the case of a child of six years.  At the present stage I will not develop that argument any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not accept this amendment. The Deputy has put forward no arguments in support of it, and there are many good reasons why the precedent, established for over thirty years now, should not be departed from.  In the Compulsory School Attendance Act of over thirty-three years ago, six years was the minimum age for attendance, and I never heard of any complaint of that age being too low.  As a matter of fact, in England, where they had six years as the minimum age for a great many years, they have now reduced it to five, and one provision of the Act of 1918 is to the effect that no exemption from attendance at school will be granted between the ages of five and fourteen.  In the North of Ireland, too, the School Attendance Act fixed the age at six years, but they gave power to the local authority to make by-laws to reduce the age to five years.  There has been no argument <Col N="475" /> put forward in support of this amendment, except the argument as regards physical infirmity.  That is already provided for.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, there is in this country a special reason why compulsion should commence at a very early age.  It is part of the policy of the Government to teach a new language in the schools, and it is admitted by everybody who has authority to speak on the matter that if children do not take up the study of a language at an early age, its teaching will never be a success.  That is one additional reason why the age should remain as it is in the Bill, and as it has been for the past thirty years and upwards.  I hope the Minister will not accept this amendment. I would certainly have moved an amendment to reduce the age to five years, only that I thought it would be more valuable to have a year or two extra at the other end.  I think the age should remain as it is.</P>

      <P>I put it to anybody that sending a boy of six years, in a rainy climate like ours, two miles, <Col N="476" /> especially in the winter time, is most unreasonable.  While it would be all right if the child were physically fit, it is not good legislation to bring in compulsion to send a child of that age a distance of two miles in the sort of weather we have in Ireland.  I speak from experience as the father of a family.  I believe I am as anxious for the development and for the betterment of my children as anyone else.  I seldom send a child to school before seven years of age and I am closer than two miles to a school.  We heard of five years being the law in England.  There is no comparison between England and Ireland.  England is a very thickly populated country.  Here you have a sparsely populated country, with the schools far apart and with the children going out in the early morning in bad weather to walk sometimes over two miles.  This is especially important since you brought in the regulation closing the schools in the summer.  It is unreasonable to compel a child to go to school before the age of seven.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entirely with Deputy O'Connell in maintaining the age of six as the commencement age. I think it would be a very great mistake to alter it.  My experience is that at six it is full time for any child to begin to obtain the elements of knowledge. The children are much happier at school than they would be hanging about at home doing nothing.  I am quite certain that the majority of parents who have the interest of their children at heart take care that they do attend after they reach six, and it has been shown that the attendance of children of that age is extremely good. I have noticed it myself.  I know that the number of children of that age that I see going to school is very high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And then there is the point, as Deputy O'Connell says, with regard to the study of Irish.  The study of Irish must be commenced at a low age if the child is to become perfect in the subject. A person can never become accomplished as a speaker if as a child he or she does not start the study of the language young.  We all know that, with regard to the continental languages or any other language, that <Col N="477" /> holds good.  I am quite certain that a healthy child of six years of age, with only two miles to go to school, would be much better off at school, and that it would be far better for the child and for the nation generally.  I think myself that six years is not too early.  I hope that that age will not be altered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we approach this question not from the party view point, but from the view point of what in our opinion is right.  I am approaching it from the view point of the parent, and I do say that there is a good deal in what Deputy O'Connell says in regard to the extraordinary ability of very young children to obtain a speaking knowledge, at least, of the language.  I have seen it in my own little children from four years upwards. I was struck by the extraordinary knowledge these youngsters seemed to have gained of the spoken word at least.  There is another reason; to my mind, the child who is not compelled to go to school before the age of seven must, if that child is to get any fair chance at all, have very careful home training, and must, before that age, have very great care bestowed upon it.  Now, we are not dealing with that class of case at all.  We are dealing with the mass of the children of the State; we are dealing with the mass of parents, and we want to ask ourselves what care will the average child get if it is not compelled to go to school before the age of seven.  From my own observation I say that the average parent in the country will not bestow on the average child the attention it deserves.  Some parents, like Deputy Wilson and others, will give this attention to their children, but the average people do not.  If it were only even a very small percentage&mdash;if it were only ten per cent. of the whole who did not get that home training&mdash;I say it is essential that they should be made get it in school.  I do think, no matter what view points are put up, that the age of six is not too high.  I think that the child of that age must have some knowledge of the first rudiments, and I am inclined to oppose the amendment. I do it not from a party point of view, but from my experience as an ordinary member of the community.</P>

      <P>I feel inclined to oppose Deputy Heffernan's amendment, and this point appeals strongly to me:&mdash;If you make seven years the compulsory age for children going to school, with many types of parents it will happen that a child will not be sent to school until he or she is seven years of age, and I think that would tend to create a chaotic state in the infants of the fourth standard of the school.  You will have a large number of people who will send their children to school as early as five years of age. I think, in considering this amendment, it bears in an important way on the question.  I do not know whether it will be argued that children of six years of age are not able to stand the physical strain of going to school less than two miles and back in the day. I believe they are able to do that, and that it would help us to understand that matter better if we understood what were the average hours a child of six or seven had to spend daily in the primary schools.</P>

      <P>I do not attach so much importance to what the child learns beyond the question of being trained in good habits.  There are very few houses in which attention can be given to a child of that age to train it to do things regularly.  I think it is of little importance what particular subject a child of that age is to be taught, but I think the other thing is of great importance with a view to regulating its habits afterwards.  I think it would be unfortunate if we were not to maintain the age of six, and, with Deputy O'Connell, I would prefer to make it earlier.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement with this amendment.  I believe it would be all right to define a child under the Act as a child of six years of age, if it only applied to urban towns or cities, but I feel to compel a child of six to go two miles, badly clad, and to enter a building, which is not suitable in the great majority of cases, and to be kept in it for hours, would be dangerous to his health.  I think it would be doing a wrong to compel children in rural areas to go to school and stay there.  I think a child under six is better looked after under the <Col N="479" /> care of his parents, whatever class they may be.  I do not say that parents are lax in regard to children of such an age.  Some children under six will go to school, undoubtedly, but I would not compel children under seven years of age.</P>

As Deputy McGoldrick has said, it is all very well for children in urban areas to have some compulsion, but other children of poor parents, who will have to go out perhaps on wet mornings, will have to attend school and soak the wet all day long.  To compel a child to do that would be bound to have a debilitating effect, and whatever it may do for education it will not help the physical development of the child.  I would be a party to compulsion in the summer months, but I would be against compulsion in the winter months.</P>

      <P>It strikes me that the real argument in favour of this amendment is an argument against compulsory attendance.  The Bill, which passed its second reading, contained the principle of compulsory attendance and if the principle of compulsion is accepted by the Dáil then a question arises as to what age it should begin. It is said by the supporters of the amendment that six is too young.  Deputy Wilson suggested that seven is not too young.  Deputy Dr. Hennessy uses a different argument which would apply to seven as well as six, to eight as well as seven, and to nine as well as eight.  We are really hitting the principle of compulsion.  The statement that the position in England does not apply to Ireland because England is urban and Ireland is rural and that it might be convenient and satisfactory to compel children of six to go to school in urban areas, has been made.  It is not so satisfactory in rural areas, but experience is that it is at five, and <Col N="480" /> somebody said at four years of age, that children go to school, not compulsorily, I grant.  Still six is one of the best ages for attendance.  That is the experience. It is not a matter of theory at all.  At six there is the best attendance, even in the winter, and in rural areas.  We are asked not to compare Irish conditions with conditions in England.  May we compare Irish conditions with the conditions in Italy, Norway, Switzerland, or France, all agricultural countries?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it is a question of rain.  They have to live in Ireland, whether as children or men and women, and people have survived in a rainy climate.  Is it suggested in this amendment, as it is often suggested by the oldest inhabitant, that the country is getting wetter and wetter?  That does not affect the argument.  It is quite possible to say&mdash;in fact it is provided in the Bill&mdash;that recognition would be given to non-attendance in extraordinary cases or in cases where there is reasonable impediment.  These factors must be taken into account, but you must fix an age, and the only question is whether it is going to be five, or six, or seven, or what other age.  Practice shows that six years of age is rather higher than lower in other countries, and that, as a matter of fact, the best average attendance is round about six years of age, so that the contention of the opponents of the age of six, on the score of inability to attend because of the age, obviously does not hold.  I would strongly press the necessity of not agreeing to raising the age from six.  Whatever consideration will have to be given to non-attendance should include consideration of the youth and physical condition of the child.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether in the new section which he intends to propose he does not take power which would, in a sense, meet Deputy Heffernan's point of view.  He is asking for power to limit the application of the Act to particular parts of the Saorstát.  In this way local representations might be considered in such places as, for instance, <Col N="481" /> portions of Deputy McGoldrick's constituency.</P>

      <P>I was rather surprised at the remarks of Deputy Dr. Hennessy.  I would like to know whether we are to take his opinion as authoritative and as being the result of examination and experience.  If we are to do so, I desire to point out that they are quite contrary to the experience of those who are charged with the medical inspection of children in parts of the rural areas in England.  I spoke of the position in England, and I was met by the statement that England is thickly populated and that there is no analogy between the two countries. This age of five holds good for rural as well as urban areas in England. There are areas in England where the children have to travel two or three miles to school, and I believe that in certain portions of rural areas in England the schools are further apart than they are in this country.  That is true of places like Cornwall, Devonshire, and portions of Yorkshire.  This question of distance was the subject of special investigation by the Chief Medical Officer of the British Board of Education within the past year or two. He asked the various medical officers, especially those in rural areas, to report with regard to the effect on children of having to travel certain distances to school.  The report, generally speaking, was to the effect that there was no physical disadvantage to the children and that, indeed, it was the other way about.  &ldquo;On the whole,&rdquo; he says himself, &ldquo;there is not much direct evidence that the journey to school is of itself a determining factor (in the health of the school child).&rdquo; Dr. Robinson mentions that there is no evidence that distance is a factor in producing poor physique.  Dr. Thomson considers the evidence available as being in favour of the child who lives at a distance, being healthier and more active (than others).  He puts forward a view that such children are, in fact, less susceptible to colds and infectious disease, and this view is borne out by teachers.  The main point is that children are not compelled to travel in inclement weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An inclement day would be a reasonable <Col N="482" /> excuse for non-attendance, but that is not what is asked in the amendment. What is asked in the amendment is that no child, in Dublin, Donegal or anywhere else, would be compelled to go to school until seven years of age.  Anybody who knows the country, knows that children usually go to school at the age of five.  That is the average entering age in rural parts, and they go much earlier in the city.  They go at the age of three or four, and parents are very often glad to get shut of them for a while at that age.  The average age in the country is five, and, in those areas in which compulsion has been adopted for over thirty years, has Deputy Wilson or Deputy Heffernan ever heard of any agitation amongst parents claiming that that age was too low?  Did they ever regard it as a grievance up to this?  I never heard that they did.</P>
    <P>I think that what has been found in practice for over thirty years to be suitable, and what we know is the practice in the countries referred to by Deputy Johnson, should not be lightly departed from, because it happens that in Deputy McGoldrick's area there is an undue proportion of wet mornings. I have always admitted that school buildings are not everything that they ought to be, but I have a doubt as to whether some school buildings, such as they are, are not better than some of the houses in which people have to keep their children.  I think that very often children are better off in the schoolyard than at home.  With regard to the point which Deputy McGoldrick made about taking children away from their parental influence, I would point out that the time during which they are away from parental influence is comparatively small.  If the parental influence is good I do not believe that it will suffer from the fact that children are in school for a portion of the day. I hope that the Minister will not accept the amendment, and that Deputy Heffernan will not press it.</P>

The point which I desire to emphasise is that there is nothing in the amendment preventing parents from sending their children to school at any age they like, but it is <Col N="483" /> when the promoters of the Bill start to deal with the question of compulsion that we differ from them.  Deputy Johnson says that, having accepted the principle of compulsion on the Second Reading of the Bill, we have got to accept the age of six.</P>

      <P>It is customary for two or three children to go to school together from the one house, and if the infants are let out from school at 2.30 the elderly children are generally kept until 3.30 or 4&mdash;at least <Col N="484" /> they were in my time.  Very often the infant child has to wait until the elder children come out, and is then away from home from 9 o'clock in the morning until five in the evening.  There is also the question of sustenance.  The children are not provided with any adequate food, such as they require at that age, between the hours of nine and five.  Generally all they get is a scanty lunch.  If we were able to accompany this compulsion with the provision of school lunches, there might be a good deal of justification for it, but I see no prospect of such provision, nor am I in favour of it in the present financial condition of the country. Therefore I do not see that any strong argument has been put forward in favour of compulsory attendance at six years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to the age at which children attend the town schools.  It is a cause of complaint on the part of many teachers that parents are actually turning the schools into nurseries.  They are getting rid of the difficulty of looking after the children by sending them to school at an age when they are unable to look after themselves and when they should be in charge of the parents.  There is a school of thought at present which maintains that children should not be taught anything until they reach the age of about ten years.  They maintain that children are better left alone to develop naturally, to assimilate the knowledge that they see around them, and that no attempt should be made to deal with them by means of school books until they reach the age of ten years.  The Minister may laugh at me, but I am sure he knows that that is the case.  There may be something in that. I am not inclined to disagree with the argument that children at that age may imbibe from books so rapidly that they make up in two or three years what they lost in the previous four years.  I am only giving that as an illustration; I am not favouring it, because I have given it no study.  I still maintain that seven years of age is sufficiently early to start compulsion. There is nothing to prevent the parents sending their children to school at five or six, or at any age at which they are <Col N="485" /> physically fit, but I maintain, from the point of view of health and general welfare, that we should not impose compulsion before seven years of age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>One's commercial training leads one to look at this question from a somewhat different aspect than that from which it has been dealt. At present we find that children going to school at the age of six leave at the age of fourteen with an average standard of education something between the fourth and the fifth standard.  It is generally recognised that that is too low, as those children are barely able to read and, in many cases, make a very poor attempt at writing.  These boys and girls have had eight years of school life.  The proposal now is to take away one of the eight years&mdash;to take one-eighth away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>What effect is that going to have on the education of such children? Is it not going to lower the standard of education still further?  To my mind it is obvious that it is.  What we want to try and achieve is something that will raise the standard.  It will be generally conceded that the standard of education of the average boy and girl leaving the National school to-day is very much too low and that it wants to be raised.  This amendment is going the other way.  As one who has some experience in this matter, I wish to say that if you lower the standard of education of the average worker you are not alone going to handicap the worker in his or her walk of life, but you are going to handicap the industry of the country that we are all trying to develop.  Some Deputies may question that, but most of our industries and particularly our staple industry of agriculture, are subject to world-wide competition which is getting wider and keener every day.  It has been pointed out in connection with Bills affecting the agricultural industry that a higher standard of education is necessary amongst the workers in that industry in order that it may be able to face competition in the market on the other side.  I would ask Deputies to look at this question from that point of view.  To my mind, it is the <Col N="486" /> most serious point of view.  We want to do everything that will help to develop the trade of the country, and anything that lowers the standard of education of the workers is handicapping the trade of the country.  Therefore, I urgently press on Deputies that instead of raising the school age from six to seven, the tendency ought to be in the other direction, and I trust the amendment will not be pressed.</P>

      <P>We seem to be very much at sixes and sevens about this amendment.  There seems to be very little in the question of one year's difference at first glance, but I think there is a great deal of difference at that age between one year and another. At one time I learned in my Catechism that one reached the use of reason at seven years.  I think it would be a wise thing to send children to school before they reach that age.  I do not see any reason to depart from what has been stated here to have been the age at which most of the children at present go to school.  Having admitted the principle of compulsion by passing the Second Reading of this Bill, the question is at what age shall compulsion be applied?  There is a great deal in what Deputy Good said, that if compulsion is to be applied at the age of seven, instead of at the age of six, it might&mdash;I do not say it will&mdash;deprive the average child of one-eighth of his or her primary education.  As has been stated from the Farmers' Benches, there is, of course, nothing to prevent parents sending their children to school at an earlier age if they so desire. But if the age of compulsory attendance is stereotyped at seven years, I do not think there can be any doubt in the mind of any Deputy that many children will not be sent to school before they reach that age.  I certainly will not support this amendment.</P>

      <P>I hope so. Deputy Heffernan complained with a great deal of heat that his liberty, so to speak, was being infringed because when he voted for compulsion on the Second Stage he wanted to make it quite clear that he voted for the general principle, and not for compulsion in detail.  I think if you look at the general trend, not so much of this amendment, but of the numerous amendments Deputy Heffernan has down, the trend of all is to make this compulsory Bill, as a whole, an absolute nullity, so far as securing better attendance at school is concerned.  He did not accept the very eminent authority quoted by him, namely, that there are educational authorities who think that a person should not be taught anything through books up to ten years of age.  I know that at least one very eminent modern authority thought twelve years was the proper age at which to introduce books to children.  I confess that that same authority did not believe in schools.  I am not quite clear as to whether Deputy Heffernan is a real disciple of his or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the arguments?  They are principally two.  One is the physical condition of the children at the age of six, and the other is the distance. Really, they are not two different arguments, but the effect one consideration has on the other.  As far as the physical condition of the children is concerned, or the distance, I suggest that the place to discuss that is not on this particular section but on Section 4. I do not object to it being discussed here, but I feel that we will have the same discussion in another form when we come to Section 4.  I hope the same arguments will not be repeated.  If there was any doubt in our minds at all as to what age we should fix, our doubts were not between six and seven. We varied between five and six.  The <Col N="488" /> fact is, that in most countries in Europe six has been made the starting age.  I admit that is not an argument why we should adopt it here, but we should consider our own particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>When I was in Norway, they told me it was the wettest country in Europe. I find, for the purpose of this argument, it is apparently one of the driest.  In the same way, apparently, Scotland enjoys a climate that almost rivals sunny Italy for the purposes of advancing this particular argument.  Six is not the age in Scotland or in Norway.  Five is the age in Scotland and Norway.  I admit that is no reason why we should adopt it here.  When we are asked to change the age from six to seven, better arguments should be brought forward than the vague generalities talked here.  As to the suggestion of keeping children at home in the country, I would like to know what kind of a child, at the age of six, does not get twice the amount of physical exercise it would get going two miles to school and two miles back.  If you divide the amount of physical exercise the child gets in at home, it more than covers that distance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson, I think, suggested that the reason for bad attendance was that such an early age was fixed.  As has been pointed out by other Deputies, the bad attendance is not at the age of five or six, but from eleven to fourteen years in all the schools.  I think that shows that there is very little in the argument about the physical difficulties that have to be overcome.</P>
    <P>From another point of view, I am rather sorry we did not put down the age of five, because then I am quite sure we would have got six, just as I am quite sure that if we put down seven, there would be an amendment from Deputy Heffernan suggesting the age of eight.</P>

      <P>There are two languages anyway and the best time for learning these languages is from four to eight.  Deputy Heffernan now proposes to deprive us really of all these years except one, as he says he does not want compulsion.  It is compulsion that we are really discussing in this Bill and nothing else.  There are many reasons why we might have suggested the age of five, and I certainly feel in certain circumstances it may be justifiable, but on the whole it was thought better, and that there is a better chance of getting the Act administered properly, if we took the clean cut at six and made that compulsory. There was no intention in our mind at all of hesitating between six and seven.  It was really between five and six.  Deputy Baxter made the suggestion why not take under this section&mdash;not so much under the section but in reference to the age of six and seven &mdash;pretty much the same power that we propose to take under the new suggested Section 23.  I suggest he would look at it in this way: if there was no suggestion of taking power of that kind it would not apply between the ages of six and seven but between the ages of five and six.  I do not, for various reasons, intend to ask for that power, and I do not think it should be granted. I think you will have a better chance of working the Act if you stick to the age of six and make that the compulsory age.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the section and substitute a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  In this Act, save as hereinafter provided, the expression &ldquo;child to whom this Act applies.&rdquo; means a person who has attained the age of <Col N="490" /> six years and has not attained the age of sixteen years.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person who has not attained the age of sixteen years but has attained the age of fourteen years and has been granted, in accordance with regulations made by the Minister, a certificate that he has attained a prescribed standard of education shall not be deemed to be a person to whom this Act applies for the purpose of the provisions of this Act relating to attendance at a national or other suitable school if and so long as he is under apprenticeship in accordance with a scheme approved by the Minister, or is receiving technical or post-elementary education, or, being in employment, is in attendance at a specified course or courses of instruction approved by the Minister, during a specified number of hours per year.</P>
    <P>I think it will be admitted that this amendment is the most important one that is to be proposed in connection with the whole Bill.  I propose it because I felt that on the occasion of the Second Reading, and on several other occasions on which the matter of education was before the Dáil, that there was a general feeling and a general expression of opinion that the age at which children leave school&mdash;the age up to which they are compelled to attend school&mdash;was too low.  I believe that in proposing the amendment I am giving expression to that general feeling of members in all parts of the House.  At this early stage of these discussions I want to re-echo what Deputy Gorey said: that none of these amendments are put in a party spirit or will be discussed in a party spirit as far as I am concerned in any case.  I feel that fourteen is too early an age to cast a child aside without any care as to its future welfare.  That, in effect, is what the position has been up to this. The two years from fourteen to sixteen are, by the experience of a great many who have made a deep study of educational matters in this and other countries, taken to be almost the two most important years in the child's life.  It is from that period that most can be done towards shaping the child's character and its inclinations especially in <Col N="491" /> the direction of a vocational career.  Up to the age of fourteen the child gets an education of a more or less elementary type without any attempt at specialisation or giving it in any way a vocational character, and it is absolutely necessary, of course, that that should be so.  It is at this age that an attempt can be made successfully to direct the mind of the child towards the occupation which he or she is to follow as a future citizen.</P>
    <P>As regards this amendment, I hope I shall have the solid support of those who represent the principal industry in this country, because it is the future agriculturists of the country who will be mainly affected by it.  Many representatives of the Farmers' Party, Deputy Baxter especially, have from time to time pointed out that the education given or attempted to be given by our agricultural instructors throughout the country is lost to a great extent&mdash;that it is wasted because the child has not reached the stage of education at which he can benefit by that instruction.  It is during these two years that the child's mind, in the rural areas especially, can be most successfully directed towards agricultural education, and towards getting the necessary foundation and the necessary knowledge of the processes of agriculture and of the science underlying it.  This amendment had to be framed in a particular way in order to bring it within the scope of the Bill, but it is not my intention that children between the ages of fourteen and sixteen should be compelled to undergo what is sometimes called primary education.  That is not the intention of the amendment. It will be necessary, to some extent in any case, to reorganise our educational institutions and our teaching power in order to deal specially with those children if we are to get them into the schools.  But that can be done and it does not present any great difficulty.</P>
    <P>If we seek to discover what is done in other countries we will find that the tendency in all modern progressive countries is to take special care of the child between the age of fourteen and sixteen.  In proposing this increase in the school age we are not travelling on <Col N="492" /> unexplored ground.  We have experience on which we can fall back.  A very interesting expriment was made in one of the Canadian States in the year 1919.  There was contained in their Compulsory School Attendance Bill a special provision with regard to adolescent children under which children from the age of fourteen to sixteen were specially compelled to attend school.  Certain exemptions were made. In the case of a child employed in or about the home of its parents or guardian he got what is called a home certificate, and in certain circumstances where a child was in a particular type of employment he got an exemption also, but for these children special part-time courses were instituted at which they had to attend for not less than four hundred hours per year. While that was made compulsory, there was also taken in the same Bill, powers to compel children up to the age of eighteen to attend part-time or special courses for special purposes.</P>
    <P>That was in 1919, and the report of the Minister for Education for that province of Ontario for 1923 tells us how the Act has worked out.  It will be interesting to have that experience before us in coming to a decision on this particular question here.  This is an extract from the report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The friends of education throughout the province have been watching with great interest the operation of the legislation introduced by the Hon. Dr. Cody in 1919, with a view to securing greater regularity of attendance, and to extend the period of instruction.  As he pointed out in introducing his Bill, the efficiency of a school depends very largely upon the extent to which children avail themselves of the instruction offered.  It is manifest that, however good the schools, they have no direct influence on children who are outside their doors. Sufficient time has now elapsed to show results from this legislation. The enrolment in the elementary schools has now risen to 601,485, which is twenty-one per cent. of the entire population of the province.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The population of Ontario is not <Col N="493" /> quite 3,000,000&mdash;it is 2,933,000&mdash;and they have enrolled in their elementary schools over 601,000.  Our population is something like 3,200,000 and yet we have enrolled something less than 500,000 in our primary schools.  Twenty-two per cent. of the population are enrolled in the primary schools.  The percentage here would be about 16.  The report goes on to say that the attendance is at a very high figure.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The enrolment in the secondary schools has risen to 60,395, and shows an increase of 41 per cent. during the two years of the operation of the Adolescent School Attendance Act. The increased attendance since the Adolescent School Attendance Act became operative, particularly noticeable in the upper forms of the elementary schools, and in the lower forms of the secondary schools, would indicate that many juveniles who formerly spent the years of their early adolescence in unnecessary employments, often intermittent and unprofitable, or in actual idleness, are now under systematic training and discipline.  The number of young people between 14 and 16 years of age who have applied for home permits&rdquo;&mdash;That is the special exemption allowed under the Act&mdash;&ldquo;or for work certificates has been relatively small, so small in fact that it has been found unnecessary to establish the part-time classes required under the terms of the Act in all but the largest of the urban centres.  Progress has been made during the year in organising such classes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The classes have been established and conducted with little or no disturbance of employment relations and with a minimum of friction. Employers co-operated freely and willingly with the school authorities in making adjustments for the time required for school attendance.  The pupils themselves have been quick to realise the benefits which they are receiving from the instruction in these classes.  As evidence of this it is pointed out that many of those who are freed from the necessity of attending as they reach the age of <Col N="494" /> 16 ask to be allowed to remain in the classes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the experience of putting into operation legislation such as would be the case if this amendment were accepted, in a country which has a smaller population than ours, with a larger area.  The area of the province is something like three times the size of ours, and the population much more scattered than ours.  The total expenditure on primary education in that province is £8,000,000&mdash;double what ours is.  Now these are the people with whom our agriculturists have to compete in the British market, and they have thought and found that it pays them to educate their young people up to the age of 16 years.  The plea has been made more than once that the children of the rural areas should be taught rural science and the elements underlying agriculture, and I hold that this is specially and eminently the time and the age when that education can be more successfully imparted, and for that reason I expect and hope that the Farmers' Party will be the strongest supporters of this amendment.</P>
    <P>In urban areas there is as great a need for technical education fitting young boys and young girls for industrial occupations.  Now there is the question of cost that was mentioned on the occasion of the Second Reading. That is the only possible objection that I can imagine that can be raised to this amendment.  The Minister for Finance mentioned certain figures.  I do not agree that that amount will at all be necessary, if the reorganisation which is possible in education is carried out. We have in this country, despite what Deputy McGoldrick and Deputy Heffernan said. far too many separate schools, and in consequence of that much of the efforts and much of the time of the available teaching staff is wasted.  We hear of large classes and of the difficulty of dealing with large classes.  The difficulty is not so much dealing with large classes as dealing with a large number of different classes.  That is the real problem we have to meet, and there is room for very great economy in the teaching power in the country.  If there is a suitable reorganisation of our present resources made, I do not believe that <Col N="495" /> there will be that big expenditure foreshadowed by the Minister for Finance in putting this into operation.  Let us take the facts.</P>
    <P>I wonder how many Deputies realise what are the facts with regard to our school buildings and separate schools. There are eighty-three per cent. of the schools in this country taught either by one teacher or two teachers.  They are what is called one-teacher schools or two-teacher schools.  The figures are 4,680 out of a total of 5,636, and there is no doubt, at least in my mind, that one thousand of these schools are superfluous as separate schools.  In many of these schools the teachers are employed dealing with five or six different standards in which the total number of children does not reach 30.  As I say, there is room there for very great economy of teaching power.  Take two adjoining schools where you have 45 children in each school&mdash;boys and girls' schools&mdash;amalgamate them and you have a school of 90.  There are two teachers in each of these schools at the present time, which gives four teachers in all.  The work of the amalgamated school could be more effectively done by three teachers than the teaching is now done in the separate schools by four.  One teacher could be set free to do a particular type of work.</P>
    <P>We have, fortunately, a great many of our teachers specially trained to deal with rural science teaching.  There has been a special effort in that direction for eight or nine years, and teaching staff and power are available with a certain amount of organisation which is necessary.  But I do not think we should allow ourselves to be frightened by any idea that there is a big abnormal expenditure involved in putting this amendment into operation. If there was, there is no shadow of doubt in my mind&mdash;and I am sure this opinion is held by many people here, and in the country&mdash;that there is nothing in which money could be better spent, or that would bring a better return than money spent on education, and especially in educating children of this age, when it can be shown that they are more or less at a loose end. That is the time that children released <Col N="496" /> from school with no employment to go to very often get into mischief, and it is a time that we should be specially careful to keep a watchful eye over them and to guide them in the proper direction with regard to their future welfare as citizens.  I do hope that there will be general expression of opinion and that it will be proved by members of the Dáil that their speeches, which we have often listened to in favour of the betterment of education in the country, will not prove to be merely lip-service to education, but that now that the opportunity is given to them they will avail of that opportunity and support this amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment is, I think it is only fair to Deputy O'Connell to say, certainly very clever.  I want to raise at the outset the question as to whether or not the implications of the amendment are not such as to raise a question of expenditure of money.  In discussing the amendment, I think we cannot leave aside what is included in it namely, that the Minister for Education must make provision for post-primary education.  If you, sir, say that there is no question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Few people are more competent, from practically every point of view, than Deputy O'Connell to speak on a matter of education.  He can speak as a teacher and as one in contact with the teachers; he can speak as a parent and an educationalist, and all round he has a sincere desire to improve the standard of education.  I would be very glad if I could support him in this amendment.  With a good deal of what he said I am in agreement, and I would sincerely desire that conditions in this country at present were such as would warrant us taking <Col N="497" /> this step.  Better education is required. We want to raise the standard of education all round.  Our farmers want it to enable them to compete with the farmers in other countries.  The rising generation want it to enable them to give better services to their country than is possible when the standard of education is low.  But when we consider the question of compelling parents to send their children to school, we have to ask ourselves how far is compulsion in this matter advisable, how far will it give us good results, and how far can the country economically afford to take the step that Deputy O'Connell suggests.  He has made reference to conditions in Canada, what is being done there and what was done there how much Canada is spending on education compared with what we are spending.  I suggest that Canada is spending a very large sum on education because years ago Canada took steps to compel the children to attend school.  The position to-day is that the standard of education all round is considerably raised, the standard of education of the parents as well as the children, and the capacity of the people to do better business and to give better service is improved because of this action taken years ago.  The taxable capacity of Canada to-day is greater than ours for that reason.  Their position is such that they can afford to spend more on education than we can at the moment.</P>
      <P>I agree that we should spend more on education if it were possible, if we could carry the burden, but we have to ask ourselves what is the capacity of the people, and are they able to contribute more to educational services than they contribute at present.  We are up against that, and it would be inadvisable that we should make a decision based on partial knowledge of what a country like Canada has been doing under conditions very different from ours.  If we could afford to spend eight millions on education it would be right that we should do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it would give a return in time, but to ask us to start out to-day to compel the children <Col N="498" /> to attend school up to the age of sixteen in the rural districts in this, our first venture in the matter of compulsory attendance, is, I think, asking something which is inadvisable.  The results will not be satisfactory.  After a time, when the parents have tasted of this, when they will have accepted it, that there is no alternative but to send their children to school, after a few years, when attention on the part of the parents to the intervention of the State will bring satisfactory and beneficial results, the mentality of our people will be altered, at least to some extent, and if we then feel that there is a necessity for going a little further in that direction, such a step would be much more acceptable than at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that that is one strong point that can be urged against the amendment. Deputy O'Connell knows the conditions in the rural districts as well as most Deputies.  These conditions, I suggest, differ from those in Canada. When Deputy O'Connell speaks of the co-operation of employers in Canada with the authorities in the matter of compulsory attendance above fourteen years of age, he must recognise that you cannot speak of employers in the same sense in this country as in Canada.  In our rural districts to a great extent employers are unknown. The parents are the people who are responsible for sending the children out.  They are the people who are demanding their services after school hours and after their time at school is finished, and to ask these people, many of whom were accustomed to get their children to work on their small farms at the age of twelve, and sometimes at eight and ten, to send them to school up to the age of sixteen, is, I suggest to Deputy O'Connell, asking something that is reasonable under present economic conditions.  The small farmer is very hard pressed at present.  He has had the service of his children in the past.  His own upbringing, as a matter of fact, has been such that the first call for his services was at home, and if that is to be changed by one grand sweep I feel that we will have reactions that will be unsatisfactory from the educational point of view.  It would be better to advance by stages.  We will <Col N="499" /> get better results later on from the experience the parents will have from the operation of this measure, the experience of better education and a better chance of education.  If that will not bring us a mentality that will induce parents voluntarily to agree to raise the school attendance age, I do not think the acceptance of this amendment will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that he has approached it from a point of view that must have some appeal to a large number of people, but he has assumed, especially in the last portion of his remarks, that the effect of the amendment was to deprive parents of the services of their boys from 14 years of age and that that is going to be resented.  I think the amendment is of very great importance and that it is of very great importance that it should be accepted by the Dáil. The proposition in the Bill is that the age of 14 shall be the limit at which obligatory attendance at school will be provided for.  That is to say, so far as we are concerned and so far as the law goes, after 14 years of age a boy or girl will be free to evade and avoid all attendance at systematic instruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>No, 14 years of age is the maximum at which there is an obligation in any case.  Our proposition is that the age should be 16, that there should be obligatory attendance at some systematic course of instruction up to 16 years of age, and we are prepared to include in that definition employment, provided that in addition to ordinary employment, there shall be at least a certain specified number of hours' attendance at a certain specified course of instruction in the year. It is for the Minister to say how many hours that should be and what shall be the specified course.  There you have the opportunity of leaving a very large <Col N="500" /> discretion with the Minister, and while accepting the general principles of compulsory attendance at school or at a course of instruction, there is still an opportunity given for boys or girls to go to employment after 14 provided they attend some systematic course of instruction which has the approval of the Minister, for a specified number of hours in the year, that number being possibly in the early stages very small and possibly the course of instruction being of less duration and of less importance in the early stages.  By accepting the amendment the Dáil will be making it clear that so far as we can lay it down, the youth of this country will be better educated in the future than in the past and that the habit of learning will be engendered up to the age of 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is most people's experience that during those years looseness very often destroys all the effect of any previous training in a school.  A few hours of work, very often no work at all, and then idleness, listlessness and carelessness. These are the dangerous periods where very much of the benefit derived during the earlier school age is lost. The alternative to something of this kind is, of course, that after 14, the boy or girl will enter employment if he or she can get it, be employed by their parents if they have anything for them to do, or will not be employed.  It is very largely to meet the case of those who are not employed that we want to provide for some obligation to attend a course of instruction.  I would very much welcome even after 16 years of age&mdash;17, 18, even up to 25 years of age &mdash;where people are on unemployment pay, that they would be required to attend courses of instruction at technical schools.  I would desire that the mind should be occupied even at the ages of 20 and 25, but particularly is that necessary when you come to the ages of 14, 15 and 16.  I do not think that the extra cost upon the State of this provision would be anything like so much as Deputy Baxter seems to suggest. Let us remember that the schools are wasted very largely at present. Much of the time they are empty and not used, and so far as school buildings are concerned, and facilities in respect <Col N="501" /> of buildings, there is plenty of opportunity at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out to Deputy Johnson one very important point in the amendment&mdash;that they must have attained a certain standard. He would compel them to go after 14 if they had not attained a certain standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope everybody would agree to that, even Deputy Heffernan, who is not here.  The standard is again a matter which is in the discretion of the Minister, and if it is found that the prescribed standard is going to create a hardship, then the <Col N="502" /> Minister will reduce the standard&mdash;I hope not too low&mdash;but that is not the point Deputy Baxter need fear. The standard will never be so high I am afraid, and if we have agreed, as we have, that there shall be obligatory attendance up to 14 from 6, I am very well satisfied that the standard will be arrived at by practically all the children likely to be affected.</P>
