    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one or two points to make before the Minister replies on the general question.  Deputy Magennis, and, I think, Deputy O'Connell urged that the training of teachers should include a course in the University. <Col N="450" /> In my opinion, that is a point that cannot be too strongly stressed. Our educational system has to be looked at largely from the point of view of the benefits it will confer on the children of the country through the primary schools.  If the benefits of University education are to be given to our people, these benefits can only come to them through the teachers in the primary schools.  That is an aspect of our educational system that should receive more consideration than has been given to it in the past.  As regards the teachers, the expenses of a University training for them will undoubtedly produce far-reaching results, and I would like to hear the Minister say that this matter is going to receive the consideration from his Department that it did not receive in the past, and that something definite will be done.  On the question of primary education it has occurred to me, and on this I feel strongly, that I am afraid we have not appreciated what it can do for us, nor have we put on a sufficiently high pedestal those engaged in the profession. Some may argue to the contrary, but I feel that on our teachers, whether under the primary, secondary, or University system, everything for good or ill as regards the future of the State depends: on their ability to impart knowledge, and I should say still more on the type of the individuals you get into the profession&mdash;their conduct, personality, and the influence that they can exercise.  That is a thing that has not been fully appreciated in the past, especially with regard to the teachers in the primary schools.  Too much pains, I think, cannot be taken by the State to secure that the best type of individual is selected for the teaching profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment I understand there is a shortage of male teachers in the primary schools.  It is to be hoped this shortage will be made good, but I want to urge on the Minister with regard to the types of candidates presenting themselves in future for training as members of the teaching profession that something more should be taken into account than the mere ability to pass a certain examination.  There may be candidates for teaching who are able on paper to give a very good account of <Col N="451" /> themselves, but who when put into the position of teachers take very little interest in the work of their profession, and are only capable of giving mediocre service, even with the best of goodwill, and generally they do not give the good results which might be expected from them.  To be successful as a teacher, other qualities than the ability to pass an examination are necessary. Those who are to be entrusted with the work of moulding the minds of the rising generation should, from my point of view, be subject to a method of selection before they are finally chosen for training as teachers in our primary schools.  I am not clear as to what exactly is to be done, or if what I suggested will be done under the arrangements in connection with the new training colleges which it is proposed to establish, but I would urge on the Minister that side by side with the setting up of these colleges and the procuring of teachers with a capacity to teach, you must in addition see that people selected for the teaching profession have a personality, and that they are temperamentally fitted for the work if the best results are to be got. The selection of the men and women who are to be the teachers in the primary schools must be given greater consideration than has been hitherto given by the Department of Education.  I would like to mention I have been trying to get some information from some of the University Deputies in the Dáil that might help me on a certain matter.</P>
    <P>While agreeing that the work of a University is work that is supposed, while providing specialised training, to fit students for that wider knowledge which they obtain in a predominantly agricultural country like this, Universities should do something more than they have done to help the agricultural industry.  They could do more than can be done by the new faculties that it is proposed to set up.  What I mean is that in the Universities an effort should be made to turn the minds of the graduates in a more sympathetic manner towards agriculture.  It seems strange, and I think unwise, that we have Arts students of both sexes leaving the University and going out to take up work <Col N="452" /> with very little knowledge of the fundamentals of life in this agricultural country.  Some of these people have passed their examination with distinction. I suppose it is hardly possible that the examinations for Arts students should include subjects connected with agriculture, but I think that a number of papers dealing with that subject&mdash; perhaps half a dozen during the University course&mdash;should be read.  Either that, or it should be provided that students treat of these things before passing their final examination.  My view is that by better education on the part of students as to the country's main industry and its value to the State we would undoubtedly get in the different grades of society which these students will enter a more sympathetic understanding of the problems that confront this country.  The agricultural community would, I think, as a result benefit more than any other section by such an understanding.  They would benefit educationally.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that many of the doctors, lawyers and other persons who leave Universities are&mdash;not because of class distinctions, but for other reasons &mdash;separated from the great mass of the people.  As I say, I do not suggest that is owing to class distinction, but because there is a want of understanding due to a defect in the educational system. I would like to see something done to alter that state of affairs. While I accept it that amongst that class there is an increasing interest in and a better understanding of agriculture than there was in the past, I think we should try and develop that spirit, and inculcate, whenever the opportunity offers, a desire and an inclination to learn more about the industry.  By such means will we get from these people help, counsel and leadership that conditions up to the present have not permitted of.  If something like that could be done in the Universities I feel that the education of the students in the Arts, Commerce, and other courses would be broadened.  Not alone would that knowledge be useful to themselves, but it would give them a sympathetic interest in the conditions under which the people live.  That would be a real help to the agricultural <Col N="453" /> community.  I feel that the tone all round would be better.  I commend these suggestions to the Minister for his consideration.  I recognise that there may be some difficulty in carrying them out.  They may not be feasible, but I feel very strongly that if something could be done in that way it would be a great benefit to the country as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask a question arising out of a reference that the Minister made in his opening statement. I refer to a figure that he gave, £13 19s. 0d., as being the cost of each secondary pupil to the State.  Am I right in assuming that that figure was obtained by dividing the grant for secondary education by the number of recognised pupils in the secondary schools, or did the Minister take into account also the pupils not recognised for whom no capitation grants are paid?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="MINISTER for EDUCATION (Professor O'Sullivan) John Marcus O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EDUCATION (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering from some of the speeches that were delivered after my opening statement, and also from other evidence that rather surprised me, whether I had made it quite clear that I was facing problems rather than offering solutions for them.  I admit in connection with many of the problems I suggested that Deputies, one after another, did bring forward certain solutions.  I hope to refer to these solutions in the course of what I have to say now.  I got into one little entanglement&mdash;not exactly an argument or altercation&mdash;with Deputy Good on the question of standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I hear certain criticism in this House and outside, I often wonder whether Deputies remember that they have had parents who were older than themselves or if not, that they have had relatives and friends who were older than themselves.  If they would cast their minds back for 25 years and try to remember what a man of sixty years of age said to them then about the state of education, they would find that apparently since the beginning of the nineteenth century, not only has there been no advance, but there has been steady retrogression in the matter of education.  That may or may not be <Col N="454" /> true.  It is one of those high philosophical problems that I cannot solve. Not only am I unable to answer it, but I do not even know how to set about getting an answer for it.  If Deputies will just cast their minds back to their early manhood, they will find that exactly the same complaint was made then as is being made to-day.  This is an exceedingly difficult question to answer.  If I am asked am I satisfied with the standard of education prevailing in this country at present, of course I will answer &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  If I were satisfied, the obvious retort would be, &ldquo;What is your job for; it is no longer necessary.&rdquo;  No matter how high the standard reached, nobody could express satisfaction with it.  One always wants to reach something higher.  I hope everybody interested in education, from the Minister up, is really striving for that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good brought forward some figures last day.  I hope I made it quite clear that it was not to Deputy Good's facts that I was objecting, but to his process of reasoning.  He brought forward a number of figures.  It is only fair to say that he had supplied those figures to me earlier.  He has based his attack here on the standard of education on two main pieces of evidence. One was a report of a Committee which sat about the year 1918.  That Committee, as Deputy Baxter pointed out before, could not allege as an excuse for the alleged failure the difficulty of a second language.  The Report of that Committee does say something about seventy-five per cent., but I think Deputy Good will acknowledge that there is not the slightest bit of evidence afforded in that particular report as to the facts alleged.  Who were present at the actual signing of the report is not even clear.  What I would like to get would be the evidence on which that report was founded.  Later on, Deputy Good supplied to me the figures he quoted the last day.  They do not touch the question as to the value of the standard leaving the primary schools. The fact, for instance, that some of those had only reached the first standard is not in itself any indication of what the value of the education in the fifth and sixth standards was.  That is really what we want to know.  We <Col N="455" /> have to make it our aim&mdash;particularly under the Compulsory School Attendance Act&mdash;to see that the highest standard in the schools is reached by the great bulk of the children in the country. If we are successful in that, there will still remain the question&mdash;how it can be answered, I confess I do not know&mdash;as to what is the value of that particular standard.  That is really the question that is in issue here.  Deputy Good took a number of those who were candidates for employment as street traders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Are these typical of the children who leave the ordinary school in the country?  Is the avenue of employment open to the average child who has attended school up to fourteen years of age, street trading, or is it not just possible&mdash;I am not certain but it throws doubt on the value of the conclusion that Deputy Good draws from his figures&mdash;that these children are an abnormal type, that the children who drift into that occupation are those who have not attended school regularly?  I think that is clear from the figures.  Four had reached the sixth standard, fourteen the fifth, twenty-nine the fourth, nineteen the third and nine the second.  I think it is quite clear that those children had not attended school with any regularity and, therefore, these figures are no help to us in trying to evaluate the work of the education given in the schools.  As to the value of that education, I cannot answer, and I do not know what particular test could be applied. All we can hope for is that everybody engaged in education is trying to do his best to make the standard successful.  That is what we have aimed at and that is what, I believe, in the vast majority of cases, we are succeeding in attaining.  It is, I believe, the bona fide and genuine desire of the vast bulk of the teachers of the country to give a satisfactory type of education.  That there has been dissatisfaction, <Col N="456" /> that there has been a low standard in the case of many individuals, may be quite readily explained. One type of explanation is that there had been grossly irregular attendance at school if not complete absence from school.  Deputy Heffernan said that in his young days&mdash;forty or fifty years ago&mdash;arithmetic and geography and hand-writing were in a much higher state of perfection than they are now. When I was a young person&mdash;in a more modern period&mdash;I learned geography and arithmetic and hand-writing.  My hand-writing was always bad, but I was very good at arithmetic and mathematics when I was young.  I was able to solve all the problems, but I confess that I did not understand what they were about.  I wonder does any Deputy remember learning practice?  I observe they do.  I wonder if Deputies recollect learning how  shillings was half a pound, how six and eightpence was a third and that if you divided the lines of £'s by three you got the price at six and eightpence.  One knew that if the addition and division were done correctly, the answer would be correct but it was twenty years afterwards that I saw that that method might have some use.  It was the same, to a large extent, with everything else.  In that way, one learned a lot of useful habits of mechanical calculation.  I do not deny the value of learning matters of that kind, but what is the educational value of it as distinguished from the mere habit of accurate calculation?  I submit that it was not quite as high a type of arithmetic as that which an effort is being made to teach now.  I think every Deputy remembers learning geography when he was young.  Most of them came under the more ancient system. We learned a great deal of geography and we forgot most of it.  I do not think it did us any great harm to forget it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of school-buildings, I stated that the problem of dealing with cases where there are wretched schools was undoubtedly a serious one.  Deputy O'Connell said that there is no justification for putting one-third on the locality, that it is capital expenditure. Of course it is capital expenditure, but there is no reason why capital expenditure should not be local.  Deputy <Col N="457" /> Alton was a little more careful when he said that it was capital expenditure, but that perhaps it ought to be a State charge.  Why should not the local one-third be still insisted upon?  Even if these things are in arrears and if the State has got out of paying its normal proportion of the money in years past, so have the local people.  It is quite clear that Deputies realise the necessity for dealing with this question.  Deputy Heffernan, the great apostle of economy, as he more or less claimed to be the other day, or at least, the man who took the most prominent part in these debates, I think he said, says that here you cannot have retrenchment. Deputy Doctor Hennessy would go a great deal further than we think possible with our limited resources.  He would have hot and cold baths.  That would be desirable, undoubtedly, but I wonder whether the State ought to take the whole up-bringing of the children altogether out of the hands of the parents.</P>
    <P>Occasionally we are asked, not merely to teach them&mdash;we are accused of not doing that very well&mdash;but also to clothe, feed and, apparently, wash them.  I doubt whether we would be more successful in those efforts than we are alleged to have been in the teaching, but whether Deputy Hennessy would also apply the policy of cleaning the individuals to the hygienic treatment of domestic animals as well, I do not know.  There is no reason why they should not come in, but then the cost would be altogether too great.  I feel that more is involved than the mere question of the insistence on the local one-third.  Our primary school system has been essentially, to some extent&mdash;to a less extent than the secondary system, I admit&mdash;not a State system, completely, but a State-aided system, and if you scrap the present system by which, for instance, the manager builds the school, or contributes one-third of the cost, and have it vested in trustees and not in the Board, ultimately passing to their ownership, you will undoubtedly bring about an important change in the prevailing system. That is a serious factor in the consideration of this whole problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell pointed out that there was one problem more urgent <Col N="458" /> even than this one, namely, the problem of maintenance, cleansing, and heating, and of dealing with ordinary wear and tear repairs, as distinct from what I might call big alterations or modifications. He said that schools were allowed to deteriorate, some of them continuing to exist where it was very hard to know how they did, owing to the neglect of them.  Deputy O'Connell pointed out that I had omitted to mention that.  It was an omission on my part.  There were omissions with regard to other matters, and I will refer to these in a moment.  This matter undoubtedly largely enters into the general problem of school buildings. Deputy O'Connell has pointed out that solutions of this question have been offered, and if I was not in a position to give an answer it was not because answers had not been suggested.  He called attention to and read an extract from the Report of the Killanin Committee. In that, as in other matters, various suggestions have been made, and the advantages of these suggestions have been pointed out, but it has been left for me to consider the disadvantages that would be involved in adopting them.</P>
    <P>The Killanin Committee suggested that the care of the schools should be a local charge, that more responsibility and a bigger burden, practically, should be thrown on the county councils.  These are the councils that we have now, but there were district councils then.  It was also suggested that local committees, such as the school attendance committees, should be asked to administer the funds received in that way. Before making up my mind to adopt any such scheme I would like to be convinced, first, that that would be unavoidable, and, secondly, that there would be any prospect that such local committees would deal with the problem successfully.  Remember that we have had to scrap these committees when they were doing the work that they were called into existence to perform, the securing of the attendance of children at school.  We did not think that they were the best means of obtaining a solution of that problem, and I doubt the wisdom, a couple of months after that of practically calling them again into existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister realises that the failure of the Compulsory Attendance Act was not entirely due to the fact that it was administered by committees, but rather that it rested in the machinery of the Act itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite admit that, but the Deputy will remember that the question was raised here as to whether local committees of this kind were the most proper and the best to carry out the new Act, and the Deputy will remember also that when any suggestion was made to extend the sphere of these local committees the attitude taken up by me, and approved by the House, was that it should be resisted, purely from the point of view of efficiency.  In fact, I was more or less put in the position of having to answer as to why I kept them on in certain places, and the answer, the Deputy will remember, was that I could not help it.  It was because the authorities in the places where the committees are retained were not yet ready to take on the new method of dealing with the problem.  I think the Deputy also quoted from the National Programme Conference.  Theirs was merely a statement of the problem.  They did not suggest, as well as I remember, perhaps Deputies will correct me if I am wrong, any particular solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly these are problems, and, as Deputy Thrift suggested, the fact that they are recognised as problems is, in itself, perhaps, an advance.  I, again, must declare that I am ready to try to secure a solution of the many problems as best I can.  I do not possess the extraordinary revolutionary mind of Deputy Good and, therefore, will have to try and make every effort to solve these problems but if possible to avoid too much revolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter mentioned by Deputy Professor Magennis was the question of Advisory Councils.  He said that previously we had boards and no Minister; now we have a Minister and no boards.  He pointed out that in <Col N="460" /> many cases, in the past, the various boards&mdash;the one he particularly mentioned was the Intermediate Board&mdash; had been open to criticism because they ignored and practically never consulted those actually engaged in teaching.  He also pointed out there was danger that we might become, if we had not these Advisory Boards of a more or less permanent character, doctrinaires and notionists&mdash;these were the words he used&mdash;and that the presence of such bodies would be a useful corrective to such an obvious tendency on the part of a bureaucrat like a Minister naturally is inclined to be.</P>
    <P>About that question of an Advisory Committee and the question of the bureaucratic character of the administration, I would like to define my attitude. Deputy Professor Magennis pointed out that the success of the Programme Conference ought to suggest the advisability of having a more or less permanent council of the kind.  I suggest that the success of the Programme Conference points to exactly the opposite conclusion, and that it was because of the fact that a conference of that kind was appointed ad hoc to deal with the specific problem, that its success was due.  Imagine that you have an Advisory Council of this kind dealing with all the problems of this administration.  Is it to be one Advisory Council, or are there to be several for the different activities that come under this Department?  If the latter, you are cutting across the very aim that Deputies have insisted upon here, again and again, namely the effort at co-ordination.  Therefore I take it for granted there is to be only the one Advisory Council.  I think it would be exceedingly difficult to get men who would be able to give technical advice, not merely general advice, on all the problems that the Department has to handle.  I suggest the way the Department has proceeded up to this is the more satisfactory way.</P>
    <P>It has not only an Advisory Council; it has several Advisory Councils. Again and again it has shown its readiness to consult those intimately connected with the problems we are called upon to deal with.  I have mentioned the Primary Programme Conference.  I do <Col N="461" /> not think that anyone acquainted with the facts would suggest that the Ministry is not open to suggestion from organised bodies of opinion in the country. These bodies are always ready to come to the Department and to advise them and sometimes to give them a great deal more than advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Dáil experts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a permanent advisory council, as far as we are concerned, and the Dáil is the body to whom we are responsible.  The Deputy, on the last day, said that the Department naturally is inclined to resent any inclusion in control or management.  That is a hint going far beyond mere advice.  I think a couple of years ago Deputy O'Connell, discussing a matter of this kind, suggested that he did not want a body merely for advisory purposes, but for something else as well.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution gives power to do these things. That is an entirely different matter.  I am discussing the matter from the point of view of its advisability.  The Constitution does not mention that the Minister for Education must have an advisory council.  There are people who think that not only should you have an advisory council of this kind in connection with the national management of education, but that you should have local permanent advisory councils as well.  Now, I think the readiness, and I might say the extreme readiness, that the Department has always shown to consult expert opinion, upon all matters, is a proof that there is no necessity for such a body, and that it might do more harm to the progress of education than good.  Take the Primary Programme Conference. That Conference presented its programme to this bureaucratic Department which put it into force without changing a comma.  I suggest that that is not trampling under foot the opinion of people interested in education outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next important question that was touched upon, if I may still for a <Col N="462" /> moment keep on the question of primary education, was the amalgamation of schools.  There were two different kinds of amalgamation advocated.  I am not quite clear that the type advocated by Deputy Magennis and supported by Deputy Thrift was meant to exclude the other.  We can deal with the particular type of amalgamation first.  That type of amalgamation of schools has not been out of the mind of the Department.  We have made attempts, and it was found to be extremely difficult to achieve success in that particular way.  Some of the attempts have been a complete failure&mdash;such, for instance, as using a van in order to bring the children to school.  How far these difficulties are insurmountable it is difficult to say.  In one case where you would expect it to be a success it was a complete failure.  The same car was a success in a different part of the country altogether, but there are great difficulties in that particular method. It is doubtful whether the experiment would be a success in this country.  The reason that Deputy Thrift brought forward in support of it was the advisability of doing away with as many of the smaller schools as possible and having&mdash;I will not say large schools&mdash;but larger schools, pointing out in that direction the extreme difficulty of getting teachers, or rather, getting the proper timbre for teachers.  I wonder does he say that we ought to go forward with this and do away with the smaller schools in the country; I take it his idea would be that ultimately it would be a large amalgamation, envisaging that by a process of selection you would be able to do with a lesser number of teachers in the future than we have at present, and, therefore, with the prospect before you of getting better timbre&mdash;better timbre, so to speak, for our teachers.</P>
    <P>That prospect would be an improvement but the difficulty is there.  I can realise certain advantages from that point of view.  The difficulties, judging by past experience, are great.  There are financial difficulties and other difficulties, just as it is not suggested that there might not be ultimate economy.  I wonder whether that <Col N="463" /> is actually so or not?  It is a problem requiring, as the Deputy will easily see, careful examination.  But our experience up to the present does not give us much hope that if we were to try to do it on a larger scale that we would meet with very great success.

      <P>If I might interrupt the Minister, I would like to say that I have been informed, for example, that in the North of Ireland in one district where there were three primary schools there is now one large school and the cost is only two-thirds of the three primary schools.

      <P>Yes.  On the other question of amalgamation I asked Deputy Gorey to help us in the matter with his advice, but though he was in the most friendly spirit to everybody on that particular day, he did not give us advice.  He had no advice on the matter one way or another.  A pamphlet was read out by, I think, Deputy O'Connell, which was supplied by Deputy Wilson, protesting against amalgamation !  Undoubtedly there were rather startling statements made in that pamphlet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, I mean in the resolution.  But because these statements were what I may call exaggerated to the point of the ridiculous, it does not follow that they might not represent a very strong feeling in the country that was not open to the charge of being exaggerated, certainly not ridiculous.  There is no getting away from this particular fact, that there is a very strong objection, on the part of those who are entrusted with the moral welfare of the great bulk of the population of this country, to having girls and boys taught in the same school.  The objection is undoubtedly there.  It is very strong.  Attention has been called to the fact that you have a little over 3,000 schools already where boys and girls are taught together, <Col N="464" /> that the Killanin Commission contained the present Cardinal O'Donnell and the present Chairman of the Catholic Managers' Association&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, Dean Macken.  These undoubtedly are facts; but Deputies might remember that even though a certain abuse might be tolerated, there would still be an objection to anything that savoured of an extension unless there was an absolute necessity.  This problem of amalgamation is a serious problem.  Again I have to protest that the rosy side of all these solutions is presented by the Deputies.  It is my unfortunate task to have to present the difficulties that we have to face in the solution of these problems.  Now if circumstances compel us&mdash;financial stringency, shortage of teachers, and also the question of the efficiency of the teaching&mdash;to go into this question of amalgamation, I would like the Deputies to understand the difficulties that there are and will be in the way, and, certainly, whatever the moral objections, the very strong objections there may be to educating in the same school boys and girls under the age of 14, the objection would be insuperable when it comes to the question of educating them between 14 and 16. In connection with this problem, a factor that must be before our minds is that the necessities of the case may in certain instances force us to take a step of this kind.  The extent of it is a matter that will require very careful consideration&mdash;that is, if it is found possible and advisable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the question of securing much greater efficiency in the schools arises.  The problem is an extremely hard and an extremely delicate one in many ways.  If I did not mention that problem of technical education on the last day, the reason was not that that problem was not engaging the attention of the Department and my own attention. Deputy Good referred to the fact that my opening statement contained very little reference to the subject of technical education.  Well I never like to speak at length to the Dáil and there <Col N="465" /> was a prospect of being able to get what I had to say on technical education said when introducing the Technical Education Vote.  But what I am going to say now in answer to Deputy Good will absolve me from making that general declaration of policy on technical education.  It might be as well to deal with that particular matter now. Technical education belongs to this Department only since June, 1924, barely two years.  One of the first things that the Department did when it took over that particular branch of education was to appoint a Departmental Committee to go into the question of the whole position of technical education in the country.  It was purely a Departmental Committee of two inspectors appointed primarily for the purpose of telling the new Department and the Minister what exactly was the position as regards technical education in this country.  They were also empowered to make suggestions as to any difficulties that were there and how these difficulties should be remedied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Has that Committee issued a report?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee was purely for the purpose of informing the Department and the Minister what the position was.  That Committee has not issued a report in the sense that no report has been published, but if Deputy Good means whether the Committee has concluded its investigations, made up its mind as to suggestions, and put them before the Department, I can tell him it has.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy takes a great interest in this matter, but I would ask him to wait a little longer and I will tell him.  It reported as to the situation, and that report, as a matter of fact, was supplied not merely to our Department, but to other Departments, which we thought might be particularly interested in technical education, namely, the Departments of Finance, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, and Fisheries. Our system of technical education is an extremely complicated one.  There is no doubt about that, and the finances of the system are quite as complicated as the system itself.  One thing of <Col N="466" /> which I am convinced as a result of the labours of that Committee, and that is, if I may say so, that I am not convinced that a thorough overhauling of the system is not necessary.  I do not know enough, and I doubt if anybody knows enough, to come to a sound conclusion on the matter.  I do not mean to suggest that because I do not know enough that nobody knows enough about the question, but I doubt if anybody knows enough to state definitely whether a thorough overhauling is necessary, and if it is necessary, what precise lines the process of overhauling must follow.</P>
      <P>I must candidly confess that there may be a lot that is perfectly sound in our technical education system, and there may be a lot that is not sound, but I am not in a position to say what is, and what is not sound, and I doubt if there are many people in a position to say so.  One thing which the Departmental Committee has proved is, that we have not enough information to reach a conclusion as regards the value of our technical education, and as regards the changes which would be advisable to introduce into it.  We cannot say whether there is much scope for technical education in this country, and the interchange of civilities between Deputy Good and Deputy Johnson the other day has not cleared my mind on the question as to whether there is such a lot of scope for technical education in this country.  I am not by any means going to hold the balance between Labour and Capital, or to say which is to blame, or which is as white as snow &mdash;possibly neither is very white.</P>

      <P>If we are asked to provide technical education of an advanced type to train apprentices, the matter which was indirectly under discussion the last day, we should like to know what we would do it for.  Are we to be told, say, in ten years time, &ldquo;Your elaborate system of technical education costs the State so much money; what is it for, for export?&rdquo; Deputy Good will, perhaps, tell me that Deputy Johnson is to blame, and Deputy Johnson will probably tell me that <Col N="467" /> Deputy Good is to blame.  One will say that it is the restrictions put on by the trade unions as regards the question of apprentices and on the number employed in certain trades.</P>

      <P>That problem has arisen again and again in connection with professions in this country, and I hardly care to go into it in detail now, and I hardly think it is necessary. I suggest that it is one of the important features of the situation that will have to be examined.  If we undertake to deal with this problem of technical education, we will have to have some clear idea as to what will happen to those who go into technical schools.  I have not the slightest doubt that Deputy Johnson will throw back the charge as to who is to blame on Deputy Good, and Deputy Good will blame Deputy Johnson, but I want a little more clarity on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, but I want to make it clear that there is that problem, and that it is one of the problems which we have to face.  It must be obvious to everyone that we must appoint still another Commission, that this bureaucratic body has to consult others besides itself before it can take important steps.  It was open to us to appoint a general Committee to inquire into the whole system of post-primary education, but it struck me, after considerable consideration, that that might really not give us the particular type of advice we wanted, as regards this particular narrow problem of technical education.  Therefore, I thought it was better to have a smaller Committee, a Committee composed strictly of practical experts in the matter, and, consequently, we intend, if we can get it together, to set up a committee of that kind.  Its composition would be something like this: one representative of the trade unions and one of the employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> I think I made out a case that they, at all events, should be represented on this particular committee and that the Department of Education (Technical Branch) would also be represented. There would be a member of that particular branch because an intimate acquaintance with the system here is necessary, and it would not do merely to get it by means of evidence, because at every step the committee would be up against the necessity of being made acquainted with the prevailing difficulties. There would also be one representative of the Department of Finance (for very obvious reasons), and one representative of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I am not satisfied that everything concerned with technical education is known in this country or across the water, where, I believe, their system is very much like ours.  I doubt indeed if it is better in many respects.  Therefore, a country, situated as we are, should try to get representatives from a country like Switzerland and also from Sweden.  I think that a committee such as that ought to be able to give us valuable advice on this question.  The terms of reference would be something like this: &ldquo;To inquire into and advise upon the system of technical education in Saorstát Eireann in relation to the requirements of trade and industry.&rdquo;  I could have made these remarks the last day but, as I said, I did not want to speak too long and I thought I might postpone them.  They will serve now, perhaps, as an introduction to the Technical Vote.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan, at the opening of his speech, raised a small question as to the treatment of the older pensioners. As I tried to remind him, that is not a matter for which I have responsibility.  Deputy O'Connell appealed to my parental interest in all teachers, past and present.  It is a matter that is being considered by the Department responsible for it.  The Department in the present stringency finds it difficult to increase an award where obviously there is no return in efficiency to be expected for it.  Deputy O'Connell, I think, referred, when dealing with the national programme, to the question of too many subjects. <Col N="469" /> with the general principles enunciated by Deputy O'Connell, and repeated by Deputy Alton, I agree.  I think it is much better to have a person thoroughly trained, if it were only in one subject, than for him to have a general slip-shod knowledge of a whole lot of subjects.  I think the training he gets in one subject will enable him to deal afterwards with others.  There is that particular question of training.  I think in certain subjects we are getting, and likely to get, a good training of the mind, that is, so far as general principles are concerned.  On the other hand, I do not think even with the addition of rural science that our programme at present is overladen.  I think, from that point of view, that it compares very favourably with most programmes in Europe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan, and afterwards in another speech, Deputy Baxter, returned to the old question of rural bias. I think that is what it was called in the earlier days of this Dáil and in the days of the last Dáil.  I quite admit that I see no reason a priori at all events why an effective training of the mind cannot be given about things at the person's door.  I think it could be done much better than with things far away.  That is a matter that is for our teaching system, our teachers and our inspectors, and they are trying to deal with that particular matter and to bring about a change.  The change may not be perfect.  I remember when the State was first set up that there was a fierce letter in one of the papers.  I used to read the papers then.  They said that questions in arithmetic should be Irish.  That did not mean that they should be written in Irish but should be something as follows:&mdash;Take a question of this sort: One train leaves London at the rate of thirty miles an hour.  Another train leaves Edinburgh at forty miles an hour and the distance between them is&mdash;all my knowledge of geography is gone, I am sorry to say&mdash;. Where do they meet?  It suggested a question of this sort: &ldquo;When a train leaves Dublin and sets out for Cork, where should they meet?&rdquo; There you would get what might be called local colour in the question.  Whether that is of much value I doubt.</P>

      <P>I dealt with the whole question of training to a certain extent in the Supplementary Estimates.  Undoubtedly the question of training and the possibility, if possible, of bringing Universities into closer touch with our present system is very important; but I pointed out to the Deputies on the last occasion that it involves an immense expenditure of money.  One of the Deputies who advocated it said it meant an enormous increase in expenditure.  It would involve, I should say, a couple of hundreds of thousand pounds per year.  That is the particular scheme that was at one time brought forward by a conference in which the teachers, the National University, and other people were represented.  That, I gathered, would possibly involve the State in an additional annual expense. I was quite clear the last day; it was not with any great boasting that I read the figures of the money we were expending in education.  I pointed out the position in comparison with other countries, but I also pointed out&mdash; strange to say, I gather one newspaper, at all events, was inclined to stress this particular portion, namely&mdash;that there was a state of stringency, and therefore that would have to be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that possibly got a little more show in the Press than most of the other matters I dealt with, but it is a fact, even if it is mentioned in connection with a campaign that has been as ruinous to this country as the Irregular campaign.  I think it is a fact that will have to be borne in mind in matters in connection with education, that is, how much can the national exchequer stand?  I can put forward claims to the Minister for Finance for more money, and Deputy Dr. Hennessy will say that I should be master of my own household, and that every Minister should be master of his own household in connection with this matter of expenditure. I am afraid that if the Minister for Finance were not there it is not a Budget of twenty-five millions we would be debating here to-day, but <Col N="471" /> possibly one of double that amount. He is a very effective and necessary bar.  These matters of national expenditure will have to be weighed at present.</P>

      <P>It was Deputy Baxter who brought that up to my mind.  I remembered that I had mentioned a figure of that amount a couple of months ago, and having done so, I presume I had good grounds for mentioning it.  That is a natural conclusion for me to draw.  However, I think it is based on the fact that, roughly speaking, it would cost the State, in the case of each student, close on £100.</P>

Whether it is £100,000 or £200,000, it is a very serious matter, and it is not a matter which, in the national stringency at present, I should care to press altogether too strongly on the Minister for Finance.  I am not going to pretend that the Minister for Finance is the person who is keeping me back.  Everyone has responsibility in this matter as well as he has, and if he were not there to keep us in check we would quite possibly advance a little too quickly. Each Department is not alone.  It will <Col N="472" /> have to bear in mind what the National Exchequer can safely bear.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two matters that I would like to ask the Minister about.  The first is with regard to the system of payment of teachers.  A public servant who is being paid a regular salary every month likes, naturally, to get his salary paid to him on a specific date, and in most employments and in all Government services that is the usual practice. But it is not the case with national teachers.  This present system, of course, has come down to us for many years, and there is a great deal of uncertainty even still as to the date in the month on which a teacher gets his salary.  Returns are sent up at the beginning of the month, and payments begin to issue from the Education Office about the fifth or sixth of the month.  They finish up somewhere about the 15th or 16th, and often about the 20th.  A teacher who gets paid on the fifth of the month in March does not get paid until the fifteenth or twentieth in April.  He is never quite sure as to the particular date of the month on which he will be paid.  I think a system ought to be devised whereby a teacher, like every other public servant, or other person who earns a salary, would know, everything being regular, the day on which he would get his monthly payment.  I quite understand that there are difficulties in the way, but I think it is necessary that these difficulties be got over.  I think they can be got over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter of very great importance at the moment, owing especially to the scarcity of teachers.  It should be known to the Dáil that a teacher has to provide his own substitute in the case of illness, and to pay him.  The substitute must have the qualifications laid down by the Department. In this case the teacher differs <Col N="473" /> from the civil servant.  His salary is not payable beyond a month's illness unless he provides a substitute at his own expense.  Owing to the fact that there is a great scarcity of qualified teachers it has been found, within the last year especially, that teachers who become ill and who are bound by the rules to provide substitutes have been unable to provide them, and, because of their failure to provide substitutes, their salaries have been stopped for the period in which they were supposed, by the rules, to have the substitutes employed. That is a very great hardship, indeed, on teachers.  It is quite unfair to hold up the salary of a teacher because he is not able to do what is impossible in the circumstances of to-day, when there is only a limited number of teachers.  The person concerned makes all the efforts possible, by advertisement and in every other way open to him, to find a teacher to act as substitute, but he is unable to do so.  Surely the Minister will recognise that it is not fair, in the circumstances, that the teacher's salary should be withheld, especially at a time when he would want his salary most to meet the expenses of an illness.  I do hope the Minister will be able to say that he has devised some plan whereby in the circumstances either the full qualifications that are required by the rules will not be insisted upon, or if he is satisfied that the teacher has made a genuine effort to provide a substitute, and has failed, that his salary will be allowed.  I think it will be necessary, while the present stringency exists, that some relaxation of the existing rules must be made.  Otherwise great hardship and great injustice will be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question raised by Deputy O'Connell was as to the irregular payments to teachers.  That has to do, largely, with the number of teachers that has to be paid.  A number of the returns do not come in until the 1st of the month. Approximately about 50 per cent. come in on the first of every month.  By the fourth of the month possibly about 90 per cent. of the returns are received. The remaining ten per cent. of the returns come in later.  Under the former <Col N="474" /> system of payment which was by Money Order the first issue of salary in any month was made on the 12th of the month, and from 50 to 70 per cent. of the salaries were included in that particular issue.  A portion was issued about that day week; that is on the 19th, and the remainder a week later, on the 26th.  That was the older system, after the introduction of the monthly payments.  With the introduction of the system of paying by an Order on the Paymaster-General it was found possible to advance the dates of payment and also to expedite the actual payments themselves.  But the actual payments issued on any particular date in a particular month would be affected by a number of circumstances.  A general issue takes place on the 5th of one month, then on the 9th, then on the 12th and another on the 16th.  Some months are much harder to deal with than others.  In the first two months there is a definite sum in pounds given. Whatever there are in the way of fractions of pounds must be set right in the third month.  Similarly, there is one month in which income tax is deducted. Also there is a month&mdash;I forget whether it is the same month as the income tax month or a different month&mdash;in which is a question of deducting the necessary percentage for the Teachers' Pension Fund.  Then there may be certain individual cases held up by the failure of the returns to arrive on the first of the month and also possibly by some irregularities of attendance at school, and so on, on the part of individual teachers.  I take it for granted Deputy O'Connell is not referring to exceptional cases of that type.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay is due to that and due to the fact that the Paymaster can deal effectively with an issue of about 4,000 at the time.  Something like that occurs in the different months.  For instance, in the month in which there is no trouble through the various complicated questions&mdash;income tax, the setting right of the previous fractions, the question of deduction for pension, and so on, on the 5th of the month you have, roughly speaking, 4,000 orders issued, four days later <Col N="475" /> 4,000 more, three days later 4,000 more and that leaves about 600 or 700 to be dealt with.  But take a month in which there is this balancing of the quarter to be done, you may have on the fifth only dealt with 1,500, on the 8th about 4,000, on the 12th another 4,000, perhaps, and on the 16th you would have as many as 3,000 to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Matters of that kind which do not occur regularly month by month cause a difference in the actual payments from month to month.  I can, however, further look into the question with the object of seeing whether there is not a possibility, without unduly increasing our staff, or without throwing burdens on other staffs, of having a little more regularity.  As regards the other question raised by Deputy O'Connell, I regret that I am not in a position to give him an answer at the moment. The matter he touched upon is one that is engaging the attention of our Department and the Department of Finance, but as yet no solution has been arrived at as between the two Departments.</P>

There have been different and conflicting complaints from different sides.  We are told that our system of inspection&mdash;our inspectorate&mdash;has <Col N="476" /> not a sufficient grip on the schools.  That is the subject of one complaint.  The other complaint is that they have too much of a grip&mdash; that they have such a grip that the schoolmasters especially cannot breathe and that there is no liberty left.

      <P>Owing to a number of difficulties, principally because of the difficulty of getting suitable buildings in suitable places, there may be put upon us the necessity I indicated in introducing a supplementary Vote earlier in the year, of setting up new buildings altogether.  I should say that probably by September one of the colleges will be actually ready.  There may be some of the others ready, but there is one that I am very clear about because it is one where we had the house actually at our disposal.  I refer to the Dingle College.  On the Burnham estate there is a house that has been pronounced quite suitable for the purpose.  There is a possibility that there will be colleges also ready in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="479" /> When I mentioned one college I am sure I had in mind the colleges that are to be situated in the Irish-speaking districts. There are two colleges, as the Deputy knows, to be set up in Dublin, one college for Catholics and the other for non-Catholics.  I think these two are to be set going by the 1st September. Then there is the question of where the four remaining colleges will be placed.  It is possible that we may be able to set up a college in Donegal and we hope to set one up at Galway. The western seaboard on the whole will be the habitat, so to speak, of the preparatory colleges to be situated in the Irish-speaking districts.  It is possible we might have another college ready to be put into operation in September.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not think that the normal fee of £40 a year, which the parents of children are supposed to pay, is rather high, considering that the period of training will cover four years and the students afterwards have to enter the training colleges?  A teacher, for instance, may like to send a couple of children to one of these colleges, but the normal fee of £40 a year will have to be paid for each child.  Does the Minister not think that the fee of £40 is excessive and is likely to exclude the very material that he would like to get into the colleges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The full fee will be paid by a person who can afford to pay.  I indicated when the Supplementary Estimate was introduced that it was very likely we would have to take in a large number of candidates without any fee whatsoever. What people will pay will, therefore, naturally depend on their circumstances. It will vary from £40 downwards to vanishing point.  It is based on the capacity of the parents to pay as well as we can judge that capacity. I recognise that it is an extremely difficult thing very often to judge, but I think the House will agree on one thing&mdash;that we ought not to exclude any candidate merely because that candidate cannot pay.  Seeing the particular sources of supply that the setting up of these colleges is meant to <Col N="480" /> tap, namely, the Western, SouthWestern and North-Western Gaeltacht, it is obvious that in a large number of cases it would be a mistake to insist on the payment of a fee.  In many of the cases a fee might not be forthcoming. On the other hand, there are many cases in which possibly a fee of £40 might be quite justifiable.  We cannot exclude a poor person from the training colleges, but neither can we exclude a person who is able to pay. If there are people able to pay there is no reason why they should not pay.  I think on the whole the Dáil will agree with that particular principle.  The working out of the details may cause some difficulty.  I am quite prepared to admit there may be some difficulties, but I think the principle on the whole is perfectly sound.  Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll referred to the question of a large fee, but in every walk of life if people send their children to a secondary school they have to pay for them.</P>

      <P>The Minister has indicated that the colleges will be open to people who can pay and people who cannot pay.  In the case of people who can pay, at all events, that means a scholarship.  What qualification does he attach to that?  Is there to be a certain standard that the student has to come up to before he is taken in free?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised another question on the earlier discussion on the Supplementary Estimate to which I wish to refer again.  I take it the Minister will have to be satisfied of certain qualifications before a boy or girl is entered on the college roll.  These will be qualifications as regards health and educational ground-work.  They are going into the colleges at 14 or 15 years of age.  Some will remain in the college for two or three years, free. Some will pay a small fee; some will pay possibly up to £40 a year.  If we take the first category, those who are not able to pay anything but who pass <Col N="481" /> an examination and in other ways are qualified at the age of 14, can it be said that there is any check or test that can be reasonably applied at the age of 14 that a boy or girl is likely to make an efficient teacher&mdash;whether they have the qualities to make a teacher apart from the qualities that enable one to pass an examination? Supposing, after three or four years, that a considerable proportion of the boys and girls have not that particular qualification for teaching, is it then to be expected that they will go on for teaching?</P>
      <P>The question as to whether you are spoiling them for other occupations by training them as teachers when they are not at all fitted for teaching is a matter of very considerable importance. I would look upon it with a good deal of doubt and hesitation as to whether we are justified in sending boys at 14 or 15 years of age to these colleges with what may well be practical compulsion that they shall follow teaching, when they cannot be tested at that age as to whether they have the qualities requisite for teaching.  It may turn out after three or four years that they have not the requisite qualities for teaching.  Presumably, following the lines of Deputy O'Connell's query the other day, they will have been associating with a large number of boys who are also in training as teachers.  This objective will be in the minds of the whole body of boys and teachers, and in that way their fitness for other occupations will be lessened by their particular surroundings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the policy generally is very doubtful, but having been entered upon and approved by the Dáil, I am not going to raise that as a question of principle.  I would like to know what is the plan of the Minister regarding year-by-year tests as to qualifications for teaching, whether the students are of the particular temperament required, or is there to be some system whereby they can be sent to ordinary junior schools for test lessons and the like, such as is done with the teachers in training schools, and at what age is that to begin?  It seems to me that there is a distinct flaw in the proposal, and unless some assurances are given <Col N="482" /> that the qualities of the potential teachers are to be adjudged, the system itself may do a great deal of harm at the same time that it ought to be doing some good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the preparatory colleges, I think, perhaps, a more elaborate explanation is due from the Minister in justification of his policy with regard to the establishment of these preparatory colleges. As I understand it, the greater number of these colleges is to be established in the Irish-speaking districts.  I am not quite sure of the exact number; I think the Minister said that two were to be established in Dublin, but I understand the greater number is to be established in the Irish-speaking districts.  I think the Minister's policy in this regard is one which may be justifiable, but so far I have not heard any reasons which fully justify it from this point of view.  The boys will be kept within the bounds of the college to a very large extent.  That being so, I cannot see what advantage is to be attained from the possibility of coming into contact with the Irish-speaking members of the population as regards getting a thorough knowledge of the language, if that be the intention.  On the other hand, if it is the intention that the boys should move freely amongst the population, I think there is this advantage in that way: if we are to take it that the preparatory colleges are to be in a sense junior universities, my idea of the training and the opportunities that the boys should get is this, that they should be placed in some centre of population and allowed to move amongst the people so that they would come in contact with a greater variety of occupations.  In that way they would, to a certain extent, gain advantages which perhaps they might gain by attendance at a university.  It seems to me that one of the disadvantages with regard to the training of teachers in the past&mdash;I think Deputy O'Connell will probably agree with me &mdash;was that their training had been too narrow.  The restrictions they were confined to were altogether too definite and were imposed regardless of the necessity of giving them a broad <Col N="483" /> outlook on the general affairs of the world.  It has been contended, and is perhaps a fact, that teachers, as a class, are liable to be too narrow in their outlook owing to the restrictive training they received, and to the fact that they have to deal with juveniles and do not come in contact with the ordinary people of the world who have to make their livelihood in the ordinary way.  I think that in training the young teacher some consideration ought to be given to that aspect of the question.  I think they should be allowed to mix freely and come in contact with the ordinary people of the country, and not be confined to the narrow groove that the people in the Gaeltacht would be confined to by reason of the restriction on their occupations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to emphasise the question put to the Minister by Deputy Johnson.  It is necessary, I think, that we should have a clear idea as to what the intentions of the Minister are with regard to these colleges as a whole.  Undoubtedly one of the difficulties of parents is to ascertain, at an early age, and very often at a later stage, what particular bent or inclination a child has.  That is a question that could not possibly be decided at 14 or 15 years, or even later in life. With regard to university education, one of the difficulties in the past was that universities, up to a certain point, catered largely for the professions, and to that extent I think they limited the outlook of boys entering college.  As regards the colleges it is proposed to set up, apparently the intention of the Minister is to take on some boys with fees.  In that case we may assume that the parents or people responsible for the boys may at a certain point find that they are not inclined to go forward for the profession of teacher, and may feel inclined to alter their vocation at a later stage.  With regard to the boys entering the colleges who are not able to pay fees, the question of the tests they are to be put to in the first instance and at various stages later is a very important one for the Minister to consider and decide in view of the fact that the only outlook for these <Col N="484" /> boys entering these preparatory colleges is in one direction and one only.</P>
      <P>I think we must all recognise that until a person gets into the actual operation of teaching, it is almost impossible to ascertain that the bent of that person is distinctly in the direction that the teaching profession would lead him to.  We all know that there are many singularly able men who do not possess the qualities that go to the making of a good teacher as some people possess who would not be so gifted.  That being so, I think it magnifies the question of the training of teachers in this particular way in that it may be a very expensive operation for the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat has just pointed out that the difficulty about training teachers according to him is that at an early age you cannot determine whether they have an aptitude for teaching or not. He said that even at a later age you find it difficult to ascertain whether a person has an aptitude for teaching. The natural conclusion to be drawn from the Deputy's argument is, do not train teachers at all, and scrap the colleges you have for training teachers. You will have to run a risk in any system of training.  If I could think of any system of getting what is known as a born teacher, that would certainly be the system to adopt.  How to find that particular system, or how to invent it, I confess I am not able to do I quite admit it very often happens that a person has been teaching for a number of years before you can say whether or not he has an aptitude for teaching.  We have to face, not an ideal condition of things in which you might have some métier to determine a person's qualifications.  We have to do the best we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not claim that this system is perfect. All I do say is that in the difficult situation with which we are faced it is the best we could think of.  I quite agree that there is a lot of truth in what Deputy Hewat said.  There is a lot of sound truth in what he said, but I cannot for the life of me draw any conclusion from it.  I could not quite follow Deputy Heffernan.  I do not know whether he wanted us to keep the <Col N="485" /> pupils inside the colleges apart from contact with people outside or that they should move freely amongst the people or whether he wanted the pupils in these colleges to move in a less restricted atmosphere than you find in the Gaeltacht.  If you are to place the colleges any place you will have to place them somewhere.  If you place them in the Gaeltacht the pupils may be able to get into some touch with the people there, but if you place them in the most anglicised district in Ireland then you may be expected to have excursions all over the country for the pupils.  I had not a very clear idea as to what the Deputy meant.</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting that it is not debatable whether it is wise.  We did debate it on the last occasion.  The question was raised by Deputy Johnson or by Deputy O'Connell.  But there are advantages and disadvantages.  All I can say is that life is that way, and the problems put forward and the solutions to them are rather difficult.  We believe strongly that on the whole the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.  The education <Col N="486" /> in these colleges is not intended to be a narrow education.  It will, I hope, be a more liberal education for the great bulk of the pupils who will get into our colleges than they would get if they did not go into these colleges. I hope they will get there a good, sound, liberal secondary education. There is undoubtedly in the West a large source of ability from which we can draw, and which requires a secondary education perhaps more than in other places in the country, and this may be some help indirectly towards some solution of that particular problem.  A choice has to be made some time, and what I have to say in this regard applies to the point raised by Deputy Johnson as well as to the point raised by Deputy Hewat, and the combination in this respect illustrates once more capital and labour in alliance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that point.  If he shows himself unsuitable for teaching, the Deputy will notice that in the White Paper issued on the Supplementary Vote we pointed out that in the fourth year he would have to devote three or four hours a week to the practice of teaching, <Col N="487" /> and if he failed there he would have to be scrapped so far as we are concerned.  Deputy Sir James Craig shakes his head.  Well, he will have got at all events a secondary education he otherwise would not have got, and that is a matter to be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>He goes into the college and does not pay anything: why, then, should he be provided with secondary education at the expense of the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not doing it for his sake, primarily, but for the State.  It is accidental that a person of that kind will get the education, but we are not doing it in order to give a person who is not fit for teaching a secondary education.  We have a choice of forcing him to go on if he is found not fit, or else cutting our loss.  Then remember that the choice is made&mdash;I think Deputy O'Connell will bear me out&mdash;in the case of monitors.  In this particular aspect, at any rate, we are not very revolutionary.  They are not to be trained as teachers in the preparatory colleges.  They will get there, we hope, a secondary education, not of the Latin and Greek type, but none the less it does not follow that because they will not get the Latin and Greek type of education, therefore, the education will be in any sense narrower than the Latin and Greek type of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talking of the narrowing effect on the pupils, if they never went to one of these colleges, would their outlook be less narrow than if they lived on their own mountain side until they reached the age of eighteen years, attending a small school with a limited amount of accommodation, a school of the type that has been mentioned in the course of these debates, and where they would be associating with one or two others going on for the same profession as themselves?  Here they will have, perhaps, one hundred to associate with. When they go into the training colleges proper they will associate with people drawn from the Easter examinations, and pupil teachers.  Deputy O'Connell, I think, made the suggestion that it might be better if we sent these people to the ordinary secondary schools. These preparatory colleges will supply <Col N="488" /> only a portion of our primary teachers as candidates for the training colleges. There is still the pupil teacher system. For these we will use the ordinary secondary schools where these schools are suitable, by means of scholarships. For instance, for any student that has passed the leaving certificate examination we intend reviving the pupil teacher system. Any pupil that has passed the leaving certificate examination will be offered a scholarship to enable him to go on for teaching, and we intend utilising the ordinary schools as far as they are suitable in other respects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not these ordinary schools provide you with all the material you want?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not.  Deputy Hewat, I presume, was here when this was debated before. This is forced on us to a large extent because of the break-down of the old monitor system, and the pupil teacher system, as it existed, did not supply us with the material.  Then I would remind the Deputies that there is also an entirely new problem that we are presented with here.  We have to provide not merely ordinary teachers, but teachers capable of dealing with two languages.  We are trying to solve that problem now.  I made that perfectly clear on the last occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to Deputy Heffernan's question, why should they be in the Gaeltacht?  Because we hope to draw from the people there to a larger extent than from people anywhere else. The question has been asked: &ldquo;Why not send them to County Tipperary; why not have a school there?&rdquo; We hope the atmosphere in which they live and the opportunities they will have of coming in contact with the people will help them.  There is the further point, if you can bring children to a college comparatively near them, why bring them away into the rich plains of Tipperary or elsewhere? Parents will be more ready to send their children to a school that is near at hand than to send them to a school at a distance.  Deputy Heffernan dissents.  I am speaking of ordinary parents as I know them.  I say there is an attraction in sending children to <Col N="489" /> places that are not far removed from home.  Hence the advantage of having these colleges in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>There is a question of utilising the secondary schools.  Remember that it is difficult at present to place some of our scholars in the secondary schools, because there is no room for them, especially in the residential schools.  In the city of Cork certain of our colleges could not take our scholarship holders as they had no place for them.  Lodgings had to be found for these pupils in the city.  I prefer to solve it in this way: We intend to deal with the pupil teacher system, and that will supply us with about 200, of whom two-thirds will be resident in the ordinary secondary schools, provided these schools satisfy our requirements.  We have to face the actual situation as it exists, and though it might be desirable to be able to postpone the age, and though I recognise a certain disadvantage in not postponing it, still I think the advantages seriously outweigh the disadvantages.</P>

The total fees from pupils of model schools for 12 weeks ended September, 1925, were £1,327.  I would like to have some explanation from the Minister as to how these fees are fixed, whether the amount goes into any Exchequer account or whether it is paid away without that formality?  What is the method of payment of the teachers?  Does it apply only to those special teachers for drawing, music, elocution, etc.?  In general, I would like the Minister to give some explanation of this method of charging school fees in model schools.</P>

These fees still continue to be paid and actually do go ultimately to the teachers.  I understand the whole system is very complicated.

      <P>Under sub-head C (1) is included a Vote for salaries in schools paid by capitation. I would like the Minister to tell us the condition under which lay teachers engaged in Christian Brothers' Schools have been placed, as regards scale of salary, consequent on the taking over of these schools under the system. Complaint is made that several of these teachers have not got full credit for their years of service.  I do not know if that complaint is justified or not. Two classes of teachers are concerned. One class is trained and qualified and the other class consists of those who are not trained but have been engaged in the schools and have given efficient service for a number of years.  I would be glad if the Minister would explain what his intentions are with regard to these teachers; if all of them have to begin at the minimum salaries, irrespective of whether they have served a number of years or not, or if they will take their proper place consequent on that service?  Has the matter been settled yet?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not yet decided what credit they will get.  Take the case of the untrained teacher.  The Deputy may be under the impression that we will simply start him off as an untrained teacher at the lowest salary and leave him there with the increments of an untrained teacher. Undoubtedly, that would mean a very exiguous salary indeed for that man, after a number of years' service. There are a number of lay men at present <Col N="491" /> engaged in the Christian Brothers' Schools, and there were a number before they came under our system. Some are very young and there is no reasonable ground for taking them over.  They have an opportunity of going on for training and there is no reason why they should not.  Take the case of those who have a number of years' service.  I think, on the whole, we may be able to lay down the rule that something on the lines of the Teachers' Agreement might be applied. I think there were provisions in that for the recognition of untrained teachers and, perhaps, something substantially of the same kind, though not fully, might be applied in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>More or less on those lines.  I think that would be fairest all round.  Of course there is a question of the number of years' service to be taken into account.  I think, roughly, about half, was the suggestion.  The ordinary teacher comes out trained at 20 or 21, but in the Christian Brothers they often start earlier.  Whether you will allow them any credit between 16 and 21 is a matter to be considered.  I hope to be able to work out something on the basis of the agreement I mentioned.</P>

I understand that they were given the option many years ago &mdash;the golden days that Deputy Heffernan referred to when education was sound&mdash;but did not avail of it.  Provision <Col N="492" /> has been made again and again for their retirement.  They were relieved by not going into the pension scheme and they escaped paying their contributions to it.

      <P>Comparatively little interest has been manifested in the discussion of this sub-head, but the local people seem to be relieved of all responsibility in connection with the provision of schools.  In other countries I think it is usual to throw a larger amount of responsibility on the localities concerned.  The provision of teachers' residences, and of schools, should be borne to a greater extent locally.  In that way greater interest <Col N="493" /> would be taken in the work of education. I think the tendency in all these matters in the country is to throw too much responsibility on the central authority.  Now that we are starting a new era, I think that the responsibility should not be centralised but should be more fully shared locally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a big problem.  The country is inclined to relieve local bodies and have the charges thrown on the central authority. I think I referred to it already. That is the whole tendency.  We spent a couple of nights discussing the very same thing in connection with the roads.  A very strong appeal was then made by Deputy Good that we should advance more quickly in the direction of having that work done by the central authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only using that to show that the country is advancing in that direction.  Undoubtedly it is the fact that the tendency is to put all these things on the local rates.  As I pointed out, in Denmark half these charges are borne by the rates.  Here about one-fifth or one-sixth is borne by the local rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>On sub-head D I would like to get some information from the Minister concerning the superannuation of teachers.  I would like to know if any progress has been made with regard to the superannuation of teachers engaged in convent schools and junior assistant mistresses. I have put the claim of these teachers to receive superannuation allowances before the Dáil so often that I do not intend to go into the merits again.  The Minister knows the situation.  I only want to ask him now whether he is in a position to say if any decision has <Col N="494" /> been come to in the matter.  In reply to a question of mine some time ago he stated that the matter was being considered by his Department in connection with the Department of Finance. It is high time that a decision was come to.  The second point is that raised by Deputy Heffernan, the possibility of doing something for old pensioned teachers.  In a reply which the Minister for Finance gave to a question of mine some months ago it was stated that there were 629 pensioned teachers with pensions under £52 a year, and that their average service was thirty years.  I think I need not add anything to these figures to show what the condition of affairs is.  On several occasions the case of these pensioned teachers has been pleaded here, and I have said that so far as any claim which the existing teachers have on the Pension Fund is concerned, they are quite ready and willing to agree to grants being made from the existing fund to bring the pensions up to something that would keep these people in existence, even.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that more than once. The amount payable from public funds would then be almost negligible.  I think we should be ashamed of the fact that so many of these old teachers are trying to drag out an existence on such miserable pensions, while under various pensions schemes that have been adopted since the Free State came into existence, we see comparatively young men drawing very substantial pensions, indeed.  It is too bad that those who have given their lives to the service of the State should be trying to drag out an existence on such miserly pensions. The sum involved would not be a very large one.  All of these people are old, and they cannot live very long.  A sum of £5,000 or £6,000 annually, or less, would meet the case, but whatever the amount, it would be gradually decreasing, for these people are old, and many of them will not live long.  I refer only to the people who retired before the new salary scheme came in, those who retired before 1919, 1920, or 1921.  No claim is being made on behalf of any who retired after that date, or on behalf of any who are already in receipt of fair pensions.  The claim is made on <Col N="495" /> behalf of those who have pensions of under £52 a year.  I think the Minister will agree that it is a reasonable claim.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thrift dealt with a matter with which I also wish to deal, only by way of emphasising it.  That is the question of allowing for pension purposes the years of service of teachers who have been appointed inspectors. Many teachers have been appointed to the inspectorate, but though they enter the Civil Service they are not allowed to count for pension purposes their years of service as teachers.  I know that that very fact has resulted in keeping many fully qualified teachers from entering the inspectorate, because they did not want to lose these years of service.  The principle of allowing service in one capacity to count towards pension in another capacity has been accepted in the Local Government Act, and there is no reason why it should not be in this.  It is not fair that a man who serves twenty years as a teacher, and then enters another branch of the administration&mdash; for that is all it is&mdash;would have these years denied to him so that he can only count for pension purposes from the time he took up his appointment as an inspector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell has practically covered the ground that I intended to cover in regard to these pensioned teachers, but as the matter was put before me in correspondence by the secretary of the Pensioned Teachers' Union I would like to give my views on it.  I would be slow to suggest that the Government should make advances which would be a charge on the Exchequer, but I believe that we must have reason in regard to matters of this kind, and that economy carried too far may be very unjust and very unfair.  We have passed Acts from time to time which gave pensions to different people that the State was under obligations to. Some of these have been given to people in the prime of life and some of them are very liberal.  In regard to this matter, having swallowed the camel we are straining at the gnat.  We have swallowed the camel of millions spent in pensions, but we are straining at the <Col N="496" /> gnat of a few paltry thousands in regard to these pensioned teachers, who certainly have as good a right to considerate treatment on the part of the State as any other class of people that I know of.  Deputy O'Connell made the matter very clear to me when he stated that the existing teachers have no objection to having their Pension Fund called upon with this end in view, provided that the State gives its portion. I think that meets the case very fairly, and in view of that approach by Deputy O'Connell, representing the Teachers' Association, I think that the Minister ought to reconsider the whole position and see what can be done.</P>
      <P>The fact that these people retired before 1921 was their misfortune.  If they had continued for a year or two longer they would have been entitled to pensions based on a very much higher salary scale, and I think that that is palpably unjust.  The number concerned is very small.  The gentleman who communicated with me on the subject stated that only a few hundreds are living of the original number who came under some Act of 1923 that he refers to.  As has been pointed out, the expense of doing what is asked would gradually decrease.  The scale of pensions paid in cases of retirement before 1921 is certainly very low.  I have a statement showing that in the lowest scale, class 3, teachers have only £35 per annum male, and £25 female and the scale goes up to £60 as regards men in the first class, and £47 as regards women, after 40 years' service. From an actuarial point of view I believe that the Teachers' Pension Fund is in a sound position, and that it could afford to meet this demand upon it without any danger to its financial stability.  The expenditure of public money would be very small, and I do not think it is the kind of expenditure that we ought to cavil at in view of the services given by these people, and of the fact that their numbers are decreasing year by year, and I would ask the Minister to consider whether something could not be done to increase their pensions to such a level as would give them a sufficient amount to live on, having regard to their standard of life before retirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year I also spoke on the claims of the lay teachers in convent schools for inclusion in the pensions scheme for national teachers. I briefly put forward a number of points and I shall repeat them now. Lay assistants in convent national schools claim the right to be included in the national teachers' pension scheme, and I base their claim upon the following grounds:&mdash;They are full certificated national teachers, most of them having their training diplomas, and all of them eligible for appointment in any national school.  They received their qualifications through the same examination test as all other national teachers.  They teach the same programme and are subject to the same inspection marking as all other national teachers.  They are appointed under the same agreement forms and are paid directly by the Education Department as all other national teachers are. When one of these lay assistant teachers secures an appointment in a non-convent national school she, automatically, becomes entitled to pension rights.</P>
      <P>Were the nuns to vacate any convent national school and the lay assistants, employed in that school, to remain as the staff, then all these lay assistants would, automatically, secure pension rights.  In case nuns vacated a convent school and the lay assistants remained on the staff, no change whatever being made in the programme, the methods of teaching, or the inspection of the school, the lay assistants would secure pension rights.  It is clear, therefore, that the presence of nuns in a school is the sole reason for refusing pension rights to lay assistants warranted by the Education Department's rules regarding average to teach in that school. The Northern Government, realising the injustice of this extraordinary victimisation of convent lay assistants, hastened to include, retrospectively, their convent assistants in the teachers' pension scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An example will best illustrate this injustice.  Two teachers go through the training course together.  Both are appointed as assistant teachers upon the same day, one in a convent school and the other in an adjoining national school.  During forty years both have <Col N="498" /> taught the same programme; their efficiency has been reported upon by the same inspectors, they have received the same increments and promotion, and both are ordered to retire together. Does it not seem incredible that one of these teachers will receive annually a sum amounting to 40/80ths of her salary as pension while the other is cast adrift without one half-penny?</P>
    <P>That is the case made, and I do not see any argument can be advanced in furtherance of such an injustice.  Last year I instanced the case of a lay teacher of a convent school about to retire after having had almost forty years' service.  It was hoped that this Irish Government would make haste to treat a case of that sort, and it is to deal with a case of this sort that I ask the Government to speed up the consideration of this question which has been so often brought before the House by Deputy O'Connell.</P>

      <P>I would like to support again what has been said by Deputy O'Connell with reference to the comparatively very few very old teachers who are left in receipt of exceedingly low pensions.  We have been putting this forward for three years now without success, and although there were nine hundred teachers when it was first put forward, only six hundred now are left.  As Deputy Heffernan has stated the facts I need not go over them, but it is sad to think that there are many people who served for thirty or forty years and more and who are now dragging out an existence on receipt of £40 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the point I raised before, I think the Minister was right in saying it would more properly come up on the Vote for the Department of Finance.  I only want to refer to it here for the purpose of getting some information.  The point stated by Deputy O'Connell is that an inspector on retirement has his service calculated only on his actual years' service as an inspector, no matter whether he served as a teacher before or not.  If he were serving as teacher before he became inspector he loses his years of that service notwithstanding that during the time he served as teacher he contributed <Col N="499" /> towards the pension fund. What I want to know from the Minister is what happens to these contributions.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to the appeal made by Deputy O'Connell and others to the Minister to do something for those old teachers on pension.  It certainly seems to me that we ought to do something.  I am sure the Minister for Finance would think it would be wrong to charge the State with ingratitude, still it looks to me as if we were ungrateful when we reward a person with forty years' service with a pension of £30 or £40 a year.  That does not seem to be in keeping with the policy observed in the Civil Service and elsewhere of taking into account the cost of living.  We should at least frame some kind of cost-of-living bonus to meet the case of these old teachers.  They were very few when this appeal was first made, and they are fewer to-day.  The other point, too, I think, is a good one, though perhaps this is not the place to raise it.  That is that we ought to recognise the teaching years of service in the case of teachers who join the inspectorate.  It would certainly do much to recruit better men to the inspectorate.  I think, perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, that in the North of Ireland they do recognise such years of service in the case of a transfer from teacher to inspector. But whether the North recognises it or not, I think it will appeal to the Minister's sense of equity.</P>

      <P>I desire to reinforce what I have so often over a long period of years advocated both here and outside.  When I first advocated the reform it was not altogether feasible because there was no unity of control in the educational world.  We have that unity of control to-day and it ought to be possible to make the situation right as regards the pensioning of education officers throughout the entire Department of Education and the teaching and inspectorate sides. The model is there.  It exists in the Scottish Superannuation Act.  Under that Act it is possible for A.B. to begin his career as a primary teacher.  He may then be promoted junior inspector, pass thence to the head of a secondary school, again become master of a secondary school, return into the inspectorate, and reach still higher office, and all these years of educational service count to him in computing his superannuation allowance.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that a time comes in the life of a man when he will refuse promotion if that promotion is to be bought at the sacrifice of pension rights that have accrued to him through the earlier years of his service. The result is that while obviously the best man is there and the position waiting for him, he is not available because he cannot afford to make the financial sacrifice that is demanded.  The result is that public education suffers.  Now it is not as if I were proposing some theory, something speculative, to which objection could be made that it would not work.  It exists.  It works in Scotland, and it seems to me that the Minister would do well now to attach to the history of his period of office as Minister for Education the fact that he had made this development and co-ordination that makes for greater efficiency.</P>

      <P>A number of matters have been raised&mdash;the lay teacher in the convent school, the junior assistant mistresses, the old retired teachers on pension, and the rather wider class that Deputy Magennis has in mind&mdash;he had all teachers in mind.  There is no doubt about the desirability of all these things that have been mentioned.  That is quite <Col N="501" /> clear, but again it is a question of finance.  Undoubtedly the Minister for Finance is always faced with the extreme difficulty not so much of rejecting a scheme that is unsound&mdash;there would be no trouble about that or about the rejection of a plea that is obviously unjust&mdash;but the difficulty here is as between two different Departments. I have put that point of view before.</P>

      <P>No.  Already, before the Deputy came in, I explained.  I firmly believe that were it not for the hard-headedness, or, as some Deputies would probably put it, the hard-heartedness of the Minister for Finance, it is not the newspapers that would be saving us from a Budget of £60,000,000 a year.  I rather think that with the exception of an occasional relapse on their part they would shove us on to a Budget of £60,000,000 a year.  I doubt very much if it is the Dáil would save the country from £60,000,000 a year, or that the other Departments in the State would save it.  The most effective obstacle we have to reaching that possibly desirable figure is the Minister for Finance. When putting up this case to him, and when arguing with him, he has to bear all that in mind.  I would ask Deputies, no matter how desirable all these things are from the educational point of view&mdash;and not altogether from the point of view of humanity&mdash;to consider that there is from the educational point of view undoubtedly an advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has to weigh the different claims of the different Departments, and try to fit them all within his Budget.  That is the psychology of the matter.  If the Minister did not do that, we would be very far from the twenty-five million Budget that we have now.  It is not the newspapers that prevent us going far beyond that particular Budget.  It is this very unpopular attitude that the Minister for Finance must take up. Now, of these cases that have been mentioned, there is a very strong case undoubtedly to be made for the lay teacher in the convent schools.  It is <Col N="502" /> almost an accident that that particular teacher has to be deprived of her pension. I understand that it requires legislation to deal with that matter, but I did not like to make that particular objection when the Deputy was speaking and ask to have it ruled out of order.  The junior assistant mistresses are not quite in the same position. I notice that the Killanin Report, which Deputy O'Connell is so fond of quoting from, was not quoted by him in this particular instance.  But leaving that aside these two classes are not by any means in the same position. They are not on all fours.  The lay assistants in the convent schools are a very different class from the J.A.M.'s.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'CONNELL Mr. T. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not in the same position as the others. The lay assistants in the convent schools are fully-trained teachers, and if they were employed elsewhere they would, undoubtedly, have pension rights.  That is a fact.  But before a definite decision can be reached on this matter it must be borne in mind that suppose you grant any of these mentioned pensions or increases of pensions, you will first have to make up your minds as to where it is to come from.  It will come partly from the State to the extent of 15 per cent. of the total sum granted in the previous year in pensions.  To that extent it comes from the State directly.  Then there is a fixed grant from the State. Next there is the Teachers' Pension Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recognise, looking at it from that point of view only, from the purely financial point of view, even taking the strongest case, the case of the lay teacher in the convent schools, that the suggestion of putting them on the pension list raises immediately a question that has been causing anxiety to the Minister for Finance.  That is whether or not the Teachers' Pension Fund is in fact solvent.  That fund was built up and it was capable, perhaps, of meeting the situation when the teachers had a smaller salary.  The pensions were smaller, and also the <Col N="503" /> amount paid by the teachers was smaller.  The ten per cent. deducted off the teachers' salaries is one of the items that go to build up this fund. The pensions in the future will be much higher.  That will necessitate an increased grant from the State, increasing for the next 20 years until a sum much larger than 15 per cent. will be needed; that is an annual contribution roughly of £30,000.  Whether that will meet these claims in the future is the question.  That will have to be ascertained before any definite answer can be given, and the Teachers' Pension Fund must be examined by an actuary first so as to determine whether or not it is in a solvent position.  I hope that that examination will be undertaken within the next four or five months. That seems to be necessary before any new class of people can be put on this fund.</P>
    <P>I mention this matter as Deputy O'Connell said that there was no objection to new classes being put on the fund, but the Minister for Finance must take into consideration whether the fund is solvent and, if it is not solvent, what steps will be necessary to meet the situation.</P>

      <P>As regards sub-head E, with reference to appropriations-in-aid, I just desire to point out that one of these appropriations-in-aid consists of fees from candidates for admission to training colleges. Candidates who go to training colleges pay an annual fee of £22 10s. under present regulations.  Taking the cost of clothes, books, and incidental expenses which a student has to bear, it may be taken that the annual cost of <Col N="504" /> a student to a parent would be in the neighbourhood of £40.  It strikes me it would be advisable if attention were called to the fact that county councils give scholarships every year to young men going from their districts to a university to become doctors, engineers or, sometimes, clergymen, but no provision is made whereby county councils can give scholarships to persons going on to be teachers.  If it were possible that that could be done, the money which county councils would have to spend on scholarships would be, at least, as usefully spent in making teachers as in making doctors or engineers. The teacher goes back to the district where he comes from and gives full value to that district, whereas that cannot be said of the others.</P>
      <P>There have been cases brought to my notice this year in which young men leaving secondary schools with a leaving certificate were entitled to county council scholarships in universities. One boy, however, chose to enter a training college at the invitation of the Ministry, and, because he went to a training college and not to a university, the county council refused to give him a scholarship.  I think that is a great injustice.  I know another case in which a boy, a tradesman's son, also got a university scholarship, but, because he chose to go on for teaching and entered a training college, the county council refused to give him a scholarship.  That, at least, is my information. I do not know whether there is anything in the university or county council regulations by which this can happen, but, if that is so, the Minister for Education, in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government, should arrange to see that the county councils are at liberty to give scholarships to encourage young men to enter training colleges.  There are many young men who would go forward for the teaching profession if they could afford it, but everyone cannot afford to keep a boy, educate him until he is eighteen years of age, and then pay forty pounds for two years at a training college.</P>

As he did not do so I assumed he was going to deal with them on the introduction to the Secondary Education Vote.  I refer to questions relating to the tenure and pensions of secondary teachers. Perhaps the Minister can give the Dáil some information on this subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated I was not in a position to give the Dáil any further information than that already at its disposal on either of those two particular matters.  The question of tenure is one in which not merely the State and the teachers are involved, but also the people who own those secondary schools and run the secondary schools, who are in a certain sense the proprietors of the secondary schools.  As regards the question of tenure, I understand a certain offer was put up by the headmasters to the Association of the Secondary Teachers of Ireland allowing them in the case of, say, dismissal from diocesan schools the same appeal as exists in the case of the national schools.  There is in the case of national teachers dismissed, an <Col N="507" /> appeal under the Maynooth Statute. The teacher has an appeal.  I am speaking of the Catholic manager.  There is an appeal from the manager to the Bishop.  A similar appeal was offered to the secondary teachers.  In the case of religious orders of men the appeal that was offered from the headmasters was from the head of the college to the head of that particular Order.  In the case of convents in most cases I think the appeal suggested would be an appeal from the head of a convent to the Bishop.  The Association of Secondary Teachers were not satisfied with that particular form of appeal, and no further advance has since been made in that matter.  Naturally in this as in other matters our Department would be glad if some solution of this particular problem could be found.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of pensions, I indicated that some time ago I received a deputation from the Association of Secondary Teachers.  I say in this at all events they are at one with the headmasters that in this matter they can reach agreement, namely, that there should be pensions.  There was no indication even on the part of those advocating such a scheme of what amount it would be likely to cost the State, and at present, before actually putting anything up to the Minister for Finance or saying whether anything could be put up to the Minister for Finance, I should like to have rather a clear idea of the sums involved. At present we are still engaged in trying to find out, considering the age of the individual teachers who are registered, what sum they would cost, that is without prejudice to the future.  In neither of those two matters has any real advance been made since the time I last spoke to the House on this matter.  I think I indicated in the very brief statement I made with reference to secondary education on the first Vote I have charge of that that was one of the outstanding problems under the Vote for Secondary Education, and that is the reason I referred to it in that opening statement.</P>

      <P>So far as I understand it, we have got to this stage that the Minister for Finance some two or three years ago stated that it was his view that pensions came as a logical consequence of the incremental salary scheme.  We now have the Minister for Education&mdash;I think without definitely pledging himself&mdash;not requiring to have arguments put forward to him to urge the desirability of a pension scheme.  But in one form or another he is anxious to avail himself of the tree of resource which he has already climbed with agility on various occasions. These various claims have to be weighed against one another, and it is very good indeed that we should have the Minister for Finance to weigh those claims.  Further, we have got so far as to make the necessary calculations.  In order to find out what the cost is to be, some considerable time is going to be, spent.  I am not going to argue again on the real need for a pension scheme in order to put the secondary teachers into anything like a proper position.  I think it has been argued so often that it would be very difficult to argue on the other side.  But I would suggest to the Minister that some action is really urgent and that what we have going on in many schools is the continuance of teachers who have been serving long years and have really got past their work.  They are suffering by having to continue to work.  They cannot be thrown out, so to speak, on the street without anything to keep them in their old age, but the children are suffering as a consequence of having these teachers teaching when they are really past their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister seriously to consider what I believe has been put up to him as a partial but very inadequate scheme, to get over this period that will have to intervene before any final solution is arrived at.  It is a scheme which on the face of it does not immediately cost anything.  It is based on the idea that a teacher who <Col N="511" /> has served his maximum period and who has got really to the stage when he could not do efficient work any longer might have his increment continued to him by the State as a pension and his place filled by a new teacher coming in who would not be entitled to increments.  Coming in that way it would, at any rate, be a very gradual accumulating charge.  There would be very few teachers who could retire on the pension that would give them, but there would be the most aggravated cases.  I think a real good would be gained by even a partial scheme.  I do not claim in any way that it is a satisfactory solution, but it is a transitory step that will allow of a better scheme being worked out, and it will tend to alleviate what is really at present an aggravated evil.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head A, I want to draw attention to the Minister's figures as to the cost of secondary education, particularly in so far as it arises from the capitation grant.  I think it is worth while drawing attention to the fact which was brought out in the Minister's reply to Deputy Alton, that that figure as to the cost of secondary education is very largely misleading, if you take it as a basis of comparison with other countries or with other States.  As the Minister pointed out, it was calculated from the total cost of secondary education, taking account of the pupils recognised by him for the purpose of this capitation grant.  At present we are in a very disadvantageous position with reference, for example, to the North of Ireland, inasmuch as the State pays no capitation grant for children up to the age of twelve.  I think I am right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You could hardly call education up to the age of twelve secondary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes, I would, certainly beyond what is normally regarded as the standard of primary education.  In Northern Ireland the schools teaching such children would regularly get a grant of £5 per head.  If there was a similar scheme in operation here the total sum paid would be larger, but not in a ratio at <Col N="512" /> all that would correspond with the increase in numbers, and if you were paying capitation grants at the same rate as they are paying in Northern Ireland your figure of £14 would come down very substantially indeed.  I do not know how the numbers would compare, but a rough calculation would show that if they were anything like equal the figure might be reduced from about £14 per head to under £10 in order to put it on a basis of comparison with Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The schools certainly suffer from the fact that these capitation fees are not paid.  Again, it is a question of money, but it is important to bring it out so that we will all understand exactly what the position is.  The schools suffer and the teaching suffers.  The teachers suffer because it is largely owing to the fact that the Ministry is unable to insist on the basic salary being paid in all cases.  The schools are not able to pay owing to the limit of capitation grants.  There is no doubt that our system of capitation grants is lower than that in other countries, and much lower than would appear upon the comparison of expenditure that the Minister gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that in secondary schools you have what may be termed preparatory classes and a pre-secondary type of pupil; but they are not really secondary and they would correspond largely to those that get the national school education elsewhere.  These schools will not come in under the national system.  So far as the misleading character of the figures is concerned, they are not quite as misleading as Deputy Thrift might suppose because in other countries we were calculating the average figure for pupils from the age of 12 onwards, and Northern Ireland was not one of the countries I actually quoted.  Therefore, the comparison still holds good.  We would have to make a similar correction in other countries if we made this correction here; that is merely for the purposes of comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Thrift said was undoubtedly the case&mdash;that for children up to 12 in these non-national schools there <Col N="513" /> is no capitation grant paid.  That matter was actually put before me by the deputation of headmasters, but I pointed out to them that it would mean an extra cost to the State on the actual figures they put before me.  I cannot at the moment recall the exact figures, but I think we worked it out that it would mean anything up to £60,000 a year extra.  It is merely a matter of memory again on my part, but I know when they did put forward this demand I asked them had they calculated what the demand for increased capitation and this combined would come to.  I pointed out it would come to something in the nature of £60,000 or upwards at the present moment.</P>

      <P>I was gratified to hear from the Minister that it is his intention to set up a Commission to inquire into the relationship between technical instruction and the training of those <Col N="514" /> who propose to take up industrial careers.  I was also glad to note that in the constitution of that Commission it is intended to give representation to countries outside Great Britain and Ireland.  Might I make one suggestion to the Minister in that direction?  He mentions the two countries he proposes to give representation to, Switzerland and Sweden, but I think he will find, on inquiry, that those countries are not generally recognised as the most up-to-date countries in connection with technical education.  The two countries that stand out most prominently in connection with this type of educational work at the moment are Germany and America.  If the Minister could see his way to get representatives from these two countries rather than the two countries he mentioned, I think it would strengthen the constitution of that Commission.  There are one or two questions I would like to raise when we come to deal with the subheads.</P>

      <P>It strikes me that there was a rather remarkable omission from the representation on the Commission to be set up to deal with the technical instruction scheme.  I refer to the absence of a representative of the Department of Agriculture.  I am quite clear that the Minister's intention is to concentrate entirely on technical education.  It is not in order to deal with aspects of technical education as they bear on agriculture that I think a representative of the Department of Agriculture should be on the Commission, but because I feel it would be unavoidable that matters would be discussed at this Commission that will bear on agriculture, and if it were only for the purpose of keeping a Commission like this from discussing matters that were really outside its sphere, and in order to help it to concentrate on its own work, I think it would be advisable to have a representative of agriculture there.  That representative would show what the outlook of the policy of the Department of Agriculture is with regard to any matter that might arise.  I think it would be very advisable, also, that the work of this Commission should not be so entirely <Col N="515" /> divorced from our agricultural industry as to be without a representative of agriculture.  The Minister has laid a certain amount of emphasis on the fact that certain matters as arising between trade unionism on the one hand and capitalism on the other hand ought to be more or less solved by this particular Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, he said those matters would have to be kept in mind by this Commission.  There are large numbers of our people outside the aristocracy of labour and capital who are very keenly interested in having the benefits of technical education spread through the country.  I think it would be a very great pity if there was too great a concentration in dealing with the general scheme of technical education&mdash;if there was too great a concentration narrowing the scope of our scheme of technical education to these particular matters on which labour, as such, and capital, as such, are interested. I feel a representative of agriculture on a technical Commission like this would see that the ordinary person gets the consideration due in this matter.  What one feels very much is that just as the home industries of spinning and weaving and work of that kind have decayed in the country, the trades, too, have decayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any general consideration of a scheme for technical education will have to take into account the position of, say, ordinary trade in such areas as rural areas or small town areas, where organised trade is not at present existing and where the individual tradesman is becoming more and more nonexistent, if one may put it that way. It has a particular bearing, I feel, on the position of the smallholder.  It will have a bearing both in matters affecting building, in matters affecting woodwork, and in matters affecting machinery. He is up against the question as to whether he is going to be dependent <Col N="516" /> on tradesmen or whether he is going to be emancipated from that particular dependence.  Any scheme of technical education will have to face whether in rural areas you are going to have trained carpenters, trained masons, and trained mechanics of one kind or another, or whether the smallholder is going to get an opportunity of training himself in that type of work to the extent that is necessary for a small holding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Mulcahy has raised this point about the personnel of the Commission which is to inquire into technical education as we know it to-day.  It seems to me that it will be really difficult to have an inquiry into technical education, to hear evidence to enable it to come to a decision and leave out of account agriculture.  Technical education at present caters at least to some extent for agriculture.  We have under some County Committees of Technical Instruction agricultural classes.  I cannot see how you can hold an inquiry into the system and disregard that fact.  As regards the other point made by Deputy Mulcahy regarding technical training in the matter of trades, carpentry, etc., under some of our technical committees we have classes in woodwork given in rural districts at present.  From the point of view of the rural dweller and agriculturists there is very urgent need indeed for an extension of this branch of technical education, and my experience up to the present is that wherever opportunities have been given, young men in the rural districts availed to the very fullest of the services placed at their disposal.  I certainly suggest to the Minister that he would be well advised to have agriculture, in so far as it is to be influenced by technical education, represented on the Commission. It certainly will not overload the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any system of technical education here that will disregard agriculture to the extent that it will only accept it that there must be technical education in the science of agriculture itself, disregarding the fact that skill in trade is something beyond the <Col N="517" /> bounds or the possibilities of farmers and rural dwellers, and can be no asset to them, should not be countenanced. Undoubtedly our economic independence can in the rural district be very considerably improved by giving the talent, ability and skill we have in the people of the rural community an opportunity for development.  We can hardly estimate what this might lead up to.  Undoubtedly we find in the rural districts a considerable number of people with skill as craftsmen, but with very little training.  The possibilities for development undoubtedly are great, and they should do a great deal to alter the whole industrial revival movement in the country given a chance and given an opportunity.  There are branches of technical education that appeal particularly to the people in rural districts. I say again that I am glad that Deputy Mulcahy has raised this point, and I urge on the Minister the consideration of the suggestion that a representative of agriculture should be given a place on the Commission.</P>

      <P>As the question of representation on this Commission has been raised, I would like to urge on the Minister, when he is giving representation, as he naturally will, to the technical branch of the Department, that he should not confine that representation to a member of the administration staff&mdash;that he should see that the outdoor staff&mdash;either through one of the inspectors or teachers actually engaged in carrying out the work&mdash;will be represented because naturally a man who is engaged in the office is not always the best to understand the problems one is up against in putting these schemes into practice. Either a member of the inspectorial staff or one of the teachers, who has experience in carrying out the scheme, should be on the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>On historical grounds I would like to support Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Baxter in their plea that agriculture should be represented on the Commission which is to inquire into technical instruction. Technical instruction in Ireland is the child of Sir Horace Plunkett and one <Col N="518" /> of the main reasons he put forward for the creation of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction &mdash;for the linking together of agriculture and technical instruction&mdash;was that technical instruction would teach the farmers to do small jobs on their farms without calling in tradesmen, so that when the farmer wanted to make a new gate or mend a door or that kind of thing, he might acquire sufficient knowledge to do so without going outside and bringing in a tradesman.  That was one of the basic reasons why technical instruction was created in this country, and if the Minister is going to uphold it, I think it is only reasonable that that class for which it was created should be represented on the Commission that is to inquire into the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time that this whole question of technical instruction was overhauled.  The opinion that I have formed recently of technical instruction is that it is not serving as useful a purpose in the country as it ought to.  A good deal of the technical instruction that is being given in the country is largely wasted.  If there is to be any future development of our industries they will not benefit to any extent by the type of technical instruction that is being given.  A great deal of the money that is being spent on it as well as a great share of the energy and time of the teachers are, as far as I can see, devoted to the teaching of such subjects as shorthand and typewriting. The result is that the market for shorthand-typists is completely over-stocked at the present time.  A great many young girls can be got to do this work for next to nothing.  They are going out from their homes and taking up this work at very small salaries.  Many <Col N="519" /> of them are doing it to make pin money, In that way they are making it extremely difficult for girls who want to earn a livelihood from this kind of work to exist at all.</P>
      <P>My view of technical instruction is that it should not be given along those lines to any great extent at all.  I think technical instruction in this country ought to be given with the idea of turning the minds of numbers of our youths to a course of early training which would fit them to engage in the work associated with any new industries that may be established, or, in the case of existing industries, to enable them to take a part in any mechanical improvements that may be introduced.  While I am an opponent of the policy of protection, I am at the same time willing to do all that I can in the direction of fostering industries in the country.  Apart from the question of giving the taxpayers' money for that purpose, I think that even more money might well be spent on technical instruction if the effect of it were to train the young people who would fall into these industries, and in that way form the nucleus of useful and technically trained staffs to be used in the building up of industries.</P>

      <P>We have been told that a lot of money is being spent on agriculture and on the teaching of agriculture.  It was suggested that we in the Farmers' Party were rather narrow in that regard, and did not want to have money spent on anything else. I think it would be much better business for the country to spend money on technical instruction than to attempt by subsidies or by protection to foster industries.  With regard to the suggestion put forward by Deputy Mulcahy that the farmers should be represented on this Commission, I think that is one that should receive the attention of the Minister.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good wants to know apparently whether my heart is wedded to Switzerland and to Sweden in this particular matter.  Well, no.  If I were convinced, and I do not say that I am, that the two countries he mentioned would give us better services for our particular point of view, I would be quite ready to put representatives from these two countries on the committee. That is a matter I will have to inquire into very carefully, because remember that though it is quite true that technical instruction may be in a more advanced state in Germany and America than it is in either of the two countries I suggested in my concluding statement to the opening Vote, there is this factor that is not without some importance from my point of view, namely, that these two countries are as unlike as possible to this particular country.  Two large, rich, long-established countries like America and Germany are not quite on the same footing.  I am not ruling out, and I want to make this clear, the possibility of taking the two foreign representatives from the United States or Germany if, on consideration, I find that the advantages to be gained by doing so outweigh what might be the disadvantages that would flow from the size or the great difference&mdash;the great gulf in some respects&mdash;that divides us in the technical, industrial and economic way from these two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Deputy Mulcahy's point, which was stressed by Deputy Baxter, Deputy Cooper and Deputy Heffernan, I think in the statement I made a few hours ago, I explained that, while I was hesitating as to whether it might <Col N="521" /> not be better to set up a Commission to inquire into the whole question of post-primary education, including technical education, after some consideration I came to the conclusion it was more desirable to limit the inquiry as much as possible.  So far as this country is concerned, we may have to face that problem soon.  We shall have to face it some time, and provide a scheme of post-primary education for country districts.  That would cover children from, say, 14 to 16 years.  There is then the further question as to what technical education they should get for the agricultural side of their work&mdash; that is to say, from 16 onwards.  That would come more within the type of education that would be offered by the Department of Agriculture than by this particular Department.  There is the further fact mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Baxter, and Deputy Cooper, namely, that apart from the particular type of education suitable for agriculturists, there is also a type of technical education, which they might find useful.  I gather it is on that account they are making the plea that the Department of Agriculture should have a representative on this particular Commission.  I do not like to make the Committee too unwieldy. I think the smaller we can keep it the better.  I promise not to leave out these considerations adduced by Deputies, before coming to a final decision on this particular matter, and to see whether on the whole it is advisable to include such a representative on this particular Committee.  As regards the point raised by Deputy O'Connell, the intention at the moment is more or less on the lines he has just suggested.  We had intended to put on what I may call one of the higher inspectors to represent the technical side of our Department. Into the question of protection versus technical instruction, I do not intend to follow Deputy Heffernan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister for Education will not lose sight of one aspect of this technical instruction question, and that is that it is part of the educational process, and not merely the training of a wage-earner or of a <Col N="522" /> profit-earner.  It is part of the educational process to enable a boy or girl, a young man or a young woman, to realise the importance of the material things around him or her, and that is something different from a mere training for a position.  I am afraid that most of the comments rather assume that the work of the technical branch of the Department of Education is merely to train boys and girls for the trade they are to follow at some future time.  I do not think that that is the whole business of the technical instruction branch of the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>I want to bring to the notice of the Minister and the Dáil a matter apart from technical education, but concerned with the administration of the Minister's Department as it affects the Technical Instruction Committee of the Dublin County Council.  I refer, in the first instance, to the appointment of a commercial teacher for the Balbriggan classes.  Some correspondence has taken place between the Dublin County Joint Committee of Technical Instruction and the Minister and his Department, which began on 26th October last.  A letter was sent to the assistant secretary of the Department, informing him that Mr. T. Derrig had been appointed part-time instructor of commercial subjects (bookkeeping, business methods, commercial arithmetic, shorthand and typewriting), and Miss Teresa Pleimeann as whole-time clerk.  Then it proceeded:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have to request your sanction for these appointments at your earliest convenience.  Mr. Derrig has already been sanctioned as commercial teacher under the Mayo County Committee of Technical Instruction.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was on the 26th October, 1925. A month later, on the 24th November, 1925, a further letter was sent referring to the previous communication, and saying:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The classes for which Mr. Derrig's services are required have been held up, first by the failure of the Committee's advertisement for a whole-time instructor of Commerce and Irish to produce a suitable <Col N="523" /> candidate, and then by delay in obtaining sanction for the appointment of Mr. Derrig.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, a month later, on the 17th December, a further letter was sent saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by my Committee to inform you that they regret that no reply has yet been received to my letters of the 26th October and the 24th November last, asking for approval of the appointment of Mr. T. Derrig, B. Com., as part-time teacher of commercial subjects.  As I pointed out in my second letter the delay in obtaining approval of this appointment has prevented the opening of commercial classes in Balbriggan, and they cannot now be started this year.  My Committee considered this as a grave injustice to those pupils who were prevented from attending Skerries Technical School by the promise made to them that the classes would be provided in Balbriggan at the beginning of the present session.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, on the 25th January, 1926, a letter was sent saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have to inform you that my Committee consider the delay in the opening of the commercial classes in Balbriggan so serious that they decided at their last meeting, on the 11th instant, that if no reply had been received in the meantime from the Department they would consider the advisability of opening those classes under Mr. Derrig without the sanction of the Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 17th February, 1926, a further letter was sent, this time to the Minister for Education, in these terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the above Committee to direct your attention to the failure of the Technical Instruction Branch of the Department of Education to approve of the appointment by them of Mr. T. Derrig, B. Com., as part-time teacher of commercial subjects, or to send any other reply than a formal acknowledgment to repeated letters requesting them to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The letter further goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In these circumstances, the above <Col N="524" /> Committee, having fully considered the consequences, decided at their last meeting, on the 10th instant, to open the classes immediately, and to apply directly to approve of Mr. Derrig's appointment in view of the failure of the Technical Instruction Branch either to grant or refuse such approval almost five months after his appointment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 3rd March a further letter was sent to the Minister referring to the previous communication of the 18th February, and saying that they had not received a reply.  On the 31st March a communication was sent by the Department's Secretary to the Secretary of the Technical Instruction Committee, stating:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to an entry in the Minutes of the proceedings of the County Dublin Joint Technical Instruction Committee at their meeting on the 10th ultimo, relative to the appointment of Mr. Derrig, B. Com., as part-time commercial instructor, I have to state for the information of your Committee that in view of the order previously made for the dismissal of Mr. Derrig when employed in County Mayo, sanction may not now be given to his appointment under the County Dublin Committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That letter, which appears to have been the first intimation to the County Dublin Committee that the Department was not prepared to sanction the appointment is dated the 31st March, while the first intimation sent to the Ministry was dated the 26th October, informing them that Mr. Derrig had been appointed.  That is a state of things I cannot understand, and I can appreciate the view of the Committee when they instructed their secretary to write to the Department stating that as the Committee had no knowledge of the order referred to, he was to ask on what grounds sanction for Mr. Derrig's appointment was refused, as he possessed the qualifications required by the Department.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that the delay has militated seriously against the Committee's work in Balbriggan. It seems very difficult to understand <Col N="525" /> why, if there was any objection to the appointment or to sanctioning the appointment of Mr. Derrig for this position, that the Co. Dublin Committee could not have been informed of the matter earlier than five months after the first notification had been made of this appointment.  Practically no sanction and no refusal of sanction &mdash;in effect, no decision one way or other&mdash;was conveyed to the Committee until the season had come to a close. I do not know what the strict position may be regarding salary but I assume that that is a matter of difficulty if finally it is stated that the appointment was not sanctioned.  The fault for not having received sanction certainly does not seem to lie with the Co. Dublin Committee.  They did, to all appearances, all they could be expected to do in regard to the notification of the request for sanction.</P>
    <P>Somewhat associated&mdash;no doubt, the Minister will say very closely associated&mdash;with the refusal to reply to communications from the Co. Dublin Committee in respect of Mr. Derrig is the question of the requiring of technical teachers&mdash;teachers under the Technical Instruction Committee of the County Dublin&mdash;to make declarations in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act.  The question arose in November in respect of the appointment of teachers of Irish.  A letter was sent by the Assistant Secretary, Mr. Fletcher, to the Committee on 2nd November.  This letter had reference to a list of teachers of Irish submitted to the Department.  The letter says:</P>
    <P>I have to acquaint you that the Department approves of the engagement, for the current academic year, of the teachers named and on the conditions stated in the accompanying memoramdum.  I am to remind you of the necessity of obtaining from Mr. Duke a declaration, which should be transmitted to the Department in accordance with, and in the form prescribed by, Section 71 of the Local Government Act, 1925,&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 71 provides for the declaration being made by officials</P>
    <P>and to direct your attention to the duty which is imposed upon you, as Principal Executive Officer, by Section 61 (2) of the Act, in the event <Col N="526" /> of any illegal payment being proposed at a meeting of your Committee.</P>
    <P>In response to that, a letter was sent by the Secretary of the Committee to the Assistant Secretary of the Department. This letter is dated 16th November and stated that the letter from the Department was considered by the Committee and that he (the Secretary) was</P>
    <P>directed to point out to you, in connection with the declaration referred to in the second paragraph, that it would appear to my Committee that this declaration applies only to officers for whose appointment the confirmation of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is required.  As it has been the custom of the Committee, in accordance with the conditions on which their scheme of instruction has been sanctioned each year, to submit appointments made by them to the Ministry of Education only for confirmation the Committee would be glad to learn whether confirmation of such appointments by the Ministry of Local Government and Public Health also is necessary.</P>
    <P>Further on in the letter, it is pointed out that Mr. Duke was appointed for the present session on 10th March, of 1925.  He took up duty for the present session on 1st August, and had been paid his salary since that date in the usual way, as shown on Form 70.  Table D., submitted to the Department after each ordinary meeting of the Committee. That is followed by a letter from the Assistant Secretary of the Department, in which he adverts to the previous communication and to the Minutes of Proceedings, and he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I have to inform you that while it must be distinctly understood that Mr. Duke holds a temporary whole-time appointment co-terminus with the period of the current session, the Department note that your Committee regard his appointment as having been implicitly made by them in the financial provision for the third year's scheme of technical instruction as formulated at their meeting held on 10th March, 1925.  In the circumstances and as this date was previous <Col N="527" /> to the date of the passing of the Local Government Act, 1925, the Department will not insist upon the application which would otherwise be necessary of the terms of Section 71 of the Act to Mr. Duke's temporary appointment for the current academic year.</P>
    <P>On 12th December the Department informs the Committee that in respect to Mr. Duke they will not insist upon the terms of Section 71&mdash;which is the section requiring the declaration to be made&mdash;in view of the fact that Mr. Duke's appointment had been made earlier in the year.  But in March of this year, a communication is sent to the Committee referring to certain doubts which appear to have arisen in the minds of the Department as to whether the section applies to part-time teachers employed by these Committees as well as to whole-time teachers.  In that letter it is stated that: &ldquo;The Department is now advised that part-time teachers are, in the circumstances specified in the first-mentioned section, obliged to make a declaration in accordance therewith.&rdquo;  Further on in the same letter they say: &ldquo;Where this period (a month) has already expired, it will be necessary for your Committee, at their next meeting, to reaffirm the appointment or increase of emoluments, and for the teacher concerned to make and subscribe the Declaration within the prescribed period thereafter.&rdquo; The letter concludes: &ldquo;I have to add that the Department will not, after the date of this letter, be in a position to make a recoupment to your Committee in respect of temporary additional remuneration paid to any part-time teacher, from whom a declaration of allegiance is required, until such declaration has been received in these offices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course that is a direct contradiction of the communication of the 12th December.  The financial consequences of that to Mr. Duke I cannot speak of, as I have not been informed.  A further question arises in respect to this.  The Ministry has laid it down that the servants of local Technical Instruction Committees must make this declaration in accordance with Section 71 of the <Col N="528" /> Local Government Act.  There is no question that these Technical Instruction Committees are local authorities within the meaning of the Act as defined in the definitions of Section 1 of the Act.  But the declaration which is required to be made by officers of local authorities seems not to apply to the teachers of the Agricultural Committees, inasmuch as the declaration has special reference to appointments being confirmed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. Inasmuch as these appointments are not confirmed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and as this is the only declaration set out in the Act, there seems to be a fault in the Act.  The local authorities in question are in a quandary, of their own making if you like, or shall I put it the other way, that they desire to put the Department in a quandary, and I think they are entitled to do so in the terms of this resolution.  The Minister, acting on his own initiative, I presume, has endeavoured to alter the law, and he directs that officers of Technical Instruction Committees shall make a different declaration from that set out in the Act.  The declaration they are supposed to make has reference to the appointment being confirmed by the Minister for Education, and not by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, as in the Act.  It may be said that that is a legal quibble.  I do not know whether the Minister has statutory authority for this course. That is a matter for the lawyers, but it seems to me that the obligation to impose this declaration upon technical instruction teachers is injuring technical instruction and generally damaging the whole system, especially the classes connected with the teaching of Irish.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that, but the Statute lays it down that a particular <Col N="530" /> form of declaration shall be taken, which form, obviously, is one that cannot be taken by such a person because his appointment is not confirmed, never has been confirmed, and is not likely to be confirmed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  The Minister suggests that if a declaration which is different from that in the Act is taken, he will be satisfied.  Then we are brought to this position: It is not because it is required by the Act that a particular declaration is made, but because the Minister desires before he will sanction the appointment that a particular declaration of an amended character should be made.  Therefore, the Minister is putting it to this Committee that they must require their officers to make a declaration not in accordance with the law, but in accordance with what the Minister thinks desirable.  It is because he takes that view that I am criticising his action. I criticise that action because I believe, first, it is not required by law, and, second, it is detrimental to the interests of technical instruction.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I would not be allowed to go into the question of the policy embodied in the whole scheme of oaths and declarations of allegiance, and I do not wish to do that.  I say that for the Minister for Education to require all the officers under local authorities, working under his Department, to take a declaration which is not required by the law is obviously stretching what should be the ministerial function, and I think ought not to be the policy adopted by a Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that he is not required by law to do this.  If he were bound by the law he would be bound to insist upon the formal declaration in the section, and as that is not fitting to the case at all, because it refers to an entirely different Minister, one cannot conceive that there is any obligation upon him to insist upon that particular declaration being taken.  I therefore ask the Minister, and I would ask the Committee to agree, that it is not conducive to the educational scheme that the Minister has put before us that barriers of this kind should be placed <Col N="531" /> in the work of his Department, unnecessary barriers, barriers that have no value and that undoubtedly prevent competent teachers from carrying out their work.  I leave it at that, and I can only leave the matter for other Deputies, if they are interested, to raise their voices in condemnation of this decision of the Department to impose a declaration of this kind upon the teachers of County Dublin, and, inferentially, upon other teachers throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson is, I think, referring to a circular issued some time in the month of November which states that a somewhat modified form of declaration would be sufficient.  He argues from that that therefore there is no obligation on the part of the committee or on the part of the appointee to fulfil the law as it actually stands.  It is quite true that there was a mistake in suggesting that the name of the Minister for Education should be substituted for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, but it is none the less true that all officers of local authorities, are, under the Local Government Act, bound to make his declaration.  For the benefit of those who are not aware of the exact terms of the declaration I will read out the whole section:</P>
      <P>(1)  Where after the passing of this Act a local authority passes a resolution either appointing a person to be an officer of that local authority or increasing the salary or emoluments of an officer of that local authority, such resolution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  shall have no effect until such person or officer shall within one month after the date of such resolution have made and subscribed a declaration in accordance with this section, and</P>
      <P>(b)  shall be wholly void if such person or officer fails to make and subscribe such declaration within such period of one month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The declaration to be made as aforesaid by such person or officer as aforesaid shall be made and subscribed by him before a Peace Commissioner <Col N="532" /> and shall be in the following form:</P>
    <P>The ...................................... (Set out the name of the local authority) having on the day of 19, passed a resolution appointing me A.B. to the office of ............................. (or increasing my salary or emoluments as .......................... as the case may require), I, the said A.B. do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare that I will bear allegiance to the Irish Free State and its constitution as by law established and that, in the event of such appointment being (or whether such increase is or is not as the case may require) confirmed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, I will to the best of my judgment and ability duly and faithfully perform the duties of the (or my as the case may require) said office and will observe and obey such orders and directions in relation to such duties as shall lawfully be given to me.</P>
    <P>(3)  Nothing in this section shall prejudice or affect the operation of any enactment requiring the sanction or confirmation of any such resolution as aforesaid by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson has argued that because the Minister for Local Government and Public Health did not exercise any function in connection with the appointment of these particular officers that this section as a whole is inoperative as regards these appointments. That is not the case.  It is quite true that so far as the bulk of the appointments with which this Local Government Act deals is concerned, not merely that declaration would apply to every officer, and would quite obviously apply, but it is also certain that even though the last portion of the declaration might not apply to an officer, still, the first portion does, and even if the latter portion is inoperative, there is no reason why the whole declaration should not be taken and there is no reason why an officer should be or could be exempt from making the declaration.  That is the best legal advice that we have got. <Col N="533" /> We are advised that if all officers of local authorities, whether they be part-time or whole-time, within one month after their appointment do not make this declaration, the resolution appointing them has no validity.</P>
    <P>That is the law as it actually stands. The most that could be argued was that if anybody made the declaration the Department of Education had no right to insist on that particular form of declaration.  We did not.  But apart from the declaration, I suggest that there would be nothing wrong in asking any officer appointed under us to promise to discharge his duties to the best of his ability.  Even though there was a technical error in suggesting that the amended form of declaration would suffice, it is easy to understand why such a suggestion was made.  The law does require such a declaration from all officers.  Therefore, we are putting no unnecessary barriers in the way of the advancement of technical education in this respect.  Whether they be teachers of Irish or of any other subjects under the technical scheme, they are bound to make this declaration, that is, the actual declaration as it stands in the Act.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there is no reason why this declaration cannot be taken.  It does not make nonsense to take it. First of all, they make a declaration of allegiance to the State, a thing that no loyal subject of the State would hesitate to do.  Civil servants have to do it, and the various other officials of local bodies have to do it.  That is so far as the first portion of the declaration is concerned.  The rest, it is quite true, have to be confirmed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  But if they are not so confirmed by him, there is no inconsistency and no nonsense in signing it. The declaration has a very definite, full meaning.  That is the declaration that all officers of public bodies have to take.  There are undoubtedly often, when Acts are passed, certain doubts as to their exact meaning. There may have been certain doubts in the Department and with some of the bodies as to the exact meaning of this Act.  The point I know was raised, at one time, that this particular Section <Col N="534" /> 71 did not apply to part-time teachers, but, as I said, we have been advised that that is not the case.</P>
    <P>We have been advised that the legal position undoubtedly is that this declaration applies to part-time teachers as well as to anybody else, and unless the Act is amended we cannot get away from the fact that that is the position, and that the Act binds.  As regards the alleged inconsistency about Mr. Duke's case, I have not the actual file before me, but, as well as I remember, Deputy Johnson suggested that there was inconsistency in the fact that Mr. Duke was sanctioned, and that that was inconsistent with the general declaration of 31st March.  From Deputy Johnson's reading of the file the case was sought to be made that Mr. Duke was sanctioned, and was held not to be liable to this declaration because he was actually appointed before the Act came into force.</P>
    <P>There were two difficulties in connection with Mr. Derrig.  Owing to his activities against the State he was dismissed from the service in County Mayo, and there was, also, the fact that he did not make this declaration. Deputy Johnson argues that we tried to impose a different form of declaration upon him from that in the Act. My answer is that we did not try to impose any such declaration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not make any reference to a declaration in respect to Mr. Derrig.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Deputy Johnson did not make any reference to Mr. Derrig, that is quite true; but what he did do was to use Mr. Derrig's case which arose in the transition period.  His concluding remarks were that he anticipated I might raise the question of the declaration in Mr. Derrig's case.  If Mr. Derrig's enthusiasm for the strict letter of the law prevented him from signing what I may call the changed declaration there was nothing to prevent him obeying the law fully and taking the actual declaration.  He was bound to know the law, and so were the local committees, quite as much as the Department.  There was undoubtedly delay with reference to the <Col N="535" /> reply to the Committee in connection with this case.  In partial extenuation it might be urged that during a great deal of the time this was under consideration there was actually no Minister, and that during the other portion of it, before there was a vacancy in the actual Ministry itself, my predecessor was, as it was well known, absent for quite a considerable time in connection with the Boundary Commission. I am pointing that out only as a partial explanation of the delay, but there were questions of policy raised in connection with this case even different from those that arose in the other cases.</P>

There is a difference of £13,792, which is due to the change anticipated that after the first <Col N="536" /> half of the financial year the College of Science will be dealt with under the Bill which it is proposed to introduce and which it is hoped the Oireachtas will pass.  There is, therefore, financial provision made in this Vote for only one-half of the sum, and that explains the decrease of £13,000 in this particular Vote.

I would like if the Minister would inform us if the change, the anticipated alteration by the establishment of the Faculties of Agriculture&mdash; the transference of the work from the College of Science which is to be dealt with under the new Bill&mdash;is going to mean a reduction in the present staff of the College of Science, and if it means the superannuating of any of the existing staff; or if it will in any way impose any additional burden by dispensing with this staff, and getting additional staff because of the proposed change to be brought about by the introduction of this Bill?</P>

      <P>This is a matter that has been before the Dáil for a number of years.  The policy of the Government on that matter was declared two years ago.  Since then the question of the future of the existing College of Science has been under the attention of the various authorities &mdash;University Authorities and of the <Col N="537" /> Ministry.  Naturally, it was open to any of the existing officers of the College of Science to refuse to transfer, but I do not think that any of them have refused.

      <P>This is what used to be the normal staff of the Museum.  At present there are not three keepers; there are only two.  You have in page 177, under the heading &ldquo;National Museum,&rdquo; an estimate for three keepers.  That would have been the normal staff.  But at present there are only two&mdash;the keeper in whose control are the general artistic side and the general education side of the Museum, and the keeper who is dealing with the Irish Antiquities.  There is a vacancy in connection with the Historical Section. The posts of the two assistant keepers are at present vacant.  Of the seven assistants, only three are at present functioning.  Now, it may be asked why we have not filled up those posts.  We do not wish to cause any undue inconvenience to the public, but a certain amount of inconvenience may have been caused to the public as the non-filling up of the vacancies may have interfered perhaps with the proper arrangements in the Museum.  But before we proceed with the filling up of these two posts, the Department and the Minister for Finance wanted to be quite clear as to what is to be the <Col N="538" /> future position of the Museum&mdash;I mean as to how the Museum would fit in with our general scheme of education in the future.  We thought it well that we should be clear on this matter before we proceeded to fill up these posts. That is the reason for the vacancies I have now referred to.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister the extraordinarily low salaries that are being paid in those various institutions under this Vote, although we have no right to ask for an increase in the Vote.  This Vote, Science and Art, is supposed to represent the efforts of the State to promote and defend culture and civilization in this country.  When we look upon the Sub-head A (1) we notice that the salaries for all these officials are extremely low, compared with the salaries that are paid in other Departments. I do not know if the Minister has any means of remedying such a situation.  In the National Library and the School of Art the salaries should in my opinion bear some proportion to the capabilities and to the general culture of the persons who fulfil these functions.  Now as the State has become stabilised so far as the financial affairs are concerned, it is time that these persons should be paid a higher salary than they are paid at present.  There is another matter that I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to.  It is in Sub-head A (8) page 179 with reference to the School of Art.  It is very essential I think for success and development in the School of Art that it should be supplied with the latest ideas from all countries, particularly with regard to modern ideas in decoration and so forth.  I notice that there is a small sum of £350 allocated for the supply of a large amount of drawing and painting material, instruments and text books for the school library.  Of course I am not in order in suggesting an increase in this Vote, but I would suggest to the Minister that next year when he tackles that dragon, the Minister for Finance, on this Vote that he should insist on a more adequate sum being provided to increase and keep up to date the National Library and the School of Art.  The same thing applies <Col N="539" /> to the whole vote here.  I think this Vote is not sufficient for the present financial position of the State.  I hope that next year it will be considerably augmented.  The sums that are now being voted are sums which might be voted in war-time or in times of great financial stress.  They are not suitable for a country which is financially solvent, and which is on the threshold of further development in national civilization and national culture.  I hope the Minister will be successful next year in increasing this Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know that he is going to alter the heading, &ldquo;Institution of Science and Art&rdquo;? In the minds of ignorant people the College of Science is the headquarters, the general father-in-law and mother-in-law, so to speak, of all these organisations, and that college is about to disappear.  That is why I say that this Vote is going to undergo a considerable change, or metamorphosis.  In one's ignorance one would anticipate, perhaps, that the work of the Geological Survey is one of considerable national importance under the new régime.  If that is so, one would like to know what exactly is the work carried out by the Geological Survey, and whether there is any real future for it regarding the development of industry and commerce.  I would suggest to the Minister, from my point of view at all events, that the Vote under the heading, &ldquo;Geological Survey of Ireland,&rdquo; might come under the Vote of the Department of Industry and Commerce. No doubt, the Minister for Education would be pleased to get rid of any responsibility in regard to it, and I throw out the suggestion as a sort of bait at which, I have no doubt, like a hungry fish, he will readily jump.  It seems to me that the importance of the Geological Survey is very considerable.  I do not know whether the Minister, in his new capacity, has had time to look through all his departments and examine them critically in the same way as we wanted the Minister for Finance to examine all his accounts in detail, but as I am really in an educational humour, I would like to get all the information he can give me.</P>

      <P>I do not like to say that this Vote should not be transferred to the Department of Industry and Commerce. When Deputy Baxter raised this question before on the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce <Col N="542" /> he was referred to me, so that I can hardly refer the matter back now to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. At the moment I have responsibility for it.  There is a good deal to be said undoubtedly, especially in view of the future development of the country, for the suggestion that the Minister responsible for that development should have this particular Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hewat asked what is the actual work of this particular Department. It is a very small Department, I will admit, and therefore the amount of work accomplished during the past twelve months could not, from the very circumstances of the case, be very large. As regards the allowance to the Professor of Geology for directing the survey, that was an allowance which was paid to the late Professor Cole.  Therefore, at present it is in abeyance in connection with his work with reference to the geologicol survey.  The field staff of this particular little sub-department consists of one senior geologist and three geologists.  Two of the latter are employed in a temporary capacity. The post of director has been vacant since the death of Professor Cole.  Like various other matters of this kind, the survey came into my Department some two years ago.  During the year 1924 and part of 1925 the field staff continued the survey of the superficial deposits in the upper Liffey basin.  That obviously was in connection with the hydraulic development for electrical purposes of the upper Liffey.  In the Autumn of 1925 revision work was undertaken in connection with the Leinster coalfield.  It had been undertaken before and the work had been interrupted.  It was now resumed, and that particular work is being continued in the present session.  One member of the staff is at present engaged, at the request of the Department of Industry and Commerce, in correlating the coal-bearing strata of Sliabh i nEireann with those of Arigna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, of course, owing to the smallness of the staff, to concentrate from year to year the actual work of the staff on areas in which it is suggested that useful results from the industrial <Col N="543" /> point of view might be brought forth.  These investigations, as Deputies can easily imagine, occupy nearly all the time of the staff, and anything of course like a detailed revision of the geological survey of the whole country is out of the question with a staff of that kind.  It is true, probably, that in the original survey work, thirty or forty years ago, there was a little haste so far as the concluding portion of that survey was concerned.  That was a matter that was referred to by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when Deputy Baxter raised this particular matter before.  A similar type of work we have dealt with during the year would be an examination of the geological character of the district round O'Brien's Bridge which those members who were present at the Shannon debates may remember is one of the cardinal points in the Shannon Scheme.  There were various other similar investigations, such as the investigation of some phosphate deposits in Ennistymon, County Clare, an examination of the barytes deposit of King's Mountain, County Sligo, and other small investigations of that kind.</P>

      <P>The principal matter that I call attention to on this Vote is that for some time past there has been before us the not altogether satisfactory financial position of these reformatories.  I think, on the whole, there is hardly justification for two reformatories at present, and the question has arisen, therefore, as to how that particular matter could be dealt with.  The two principal reformatories that I am referring to are the reformatory at Glencree and the reformatory at Dangan, Philipstown, in Offaly.  There were considerations of various kinds for the closing of the one or the other.  Of course these reformatories are, to a large extent, in private hands.  The State simply gives a certain contribution&mdash;a kind of capitation grant: so does the local authority.  Though the duty is largely on the local authority of providing places of detention for youthful offenders, in recent years most of the local authorities have not been very eager to, shall I call it, meet their obligations in this particular respect.  Consequently, there has been some financial stringency in connection with reformatories. There are many reasons, when this question comes up for ultimate decision, that might be urged in favour of keeping on what might be called the Glencree reformatory rather than that of Dangan.  One is the comparative nearness of Glencree to the city of Dublin.  Another is that the boys there are within measurable distance of their parents who on holidays can go out to visit them.  That is a facility of which <Col N="545" /> they can avail.  The same consideration would not apply so readily to such a distant place as Dangan.  Glencree is near Dublin, and Dublin because of its size supplies the largest number to these reformatories.  We may later on have to refer to this question of the Vote for these particular reformatories.</P>

      <P>What I have said is that because of the length of the statement I consider it necessary to make this year I will have to cut down the statement it was customary for me to make in Irish.  I think the amount of work left of late to the Department requires a very detailed statement, and as I appreciate the fact that the time allowed for Estimates now is curtailed to a certain extent, I have therefore abandoned my usual practice in that respect.  I should also like, before I go on to the statement, to say that I regret that I have not been able to fulfil the half-promise I made to certain Deputies that I would try and arrange that this Vote would not be taken on a Monday. There are several Deputies from far-distant places who are particularly interested in this Vote, but who find it impossible to come here on a Monday, or at least can only arrive here at a very late hour at night.  However, I had to fall in with the arrangements made for the Parliamentary procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As promised last year, when this Estimate was before the House, details are appended to the Estimate showing for the various schemes, how the Vote will be allocated during the year. Before explaining in detail the figures before the House I think it is necessary for me briefly to explain the functions and the scope of the Department.  That is perhaps all the more necessary in view of the criticisms to which I referred, and which I am satisfied are mostly very ill-informed.  The principal function of my Department is to carry on the regulation of the national fisheries both as far as sea fisheries are concerned and inland fisheries.  In the regulation of sea fisheries, for instance, which we have to supervise, we have to make, in some instances, bye-laws curtailing fishing in certain areas along the coast, and to see that these regulations are carried out.  As far as inland <Col N="547" /> fisheries the same thing applies.  We have to see about the carrying out of the existing laws with regard to fisheries.  There are some twenty-four or twenty-five Acts governing them. We have to look after the Boards of Conservators to whom the details of these things are entrusted.  We have to supervise these Boards and regulate their elections and watch their activities generally in respect to their financial arrangements.</P>
    <P>I may say this work forms a considerable portion of the work of the Department.  Arising out of this duty of the regulation of the fisheries, my staff must hold public inquiries and these are on the increase in recent years, because since the Department was formed, many people who had not raised certain questions with regard to existing bye-laws or regulations for perhaps a generation, think that now is the time to raise them, and where there is a good prima facie case put up, we can hardly refuse to grant such an inquiry.  The inquiries cover a very wide range of matters affecting the fisheries, for instance, the fixing or arranging of times for the opening of seasons on certain rivers, lakes and so on, in which it is competent for me to make regulations.  In order to carry out these inquiries properly it is necessary to have some knowledge of the habits and so on of our commercial fishes, and in order to obtain that, we have to keep a trained staff of scientists for four of whom, in fact, you see provision in the Estimates.  It is the principle at present to work in conjunction, as far as sea fisheries are concerned, with the International Council for the Study of the Sea, of which this country is a member.</P>
    <P>The remaining function of the Department with regard to fisheries is put down under the head of Development. It is principally with regard to this part of our duties that we have received the severest criticism.  I think it is right, in looking into that, that I should lay before the house a brief history of the activity of government in the past in the way of development and also to state my views of policy as to the legitimate action which I think a <Col N="548" /> Government Department may reasonably be expected to take in developing this particular national resource.  Now, perhaps, it is well first of all to point out&mdash;and this is important because of the very many statements that in Scotland and England the taxpayer is not called on to find money for the development of fishing, nor, as a matter of fact, in the past, have those countries expended any money in fishery development, as such&mdash;they have spent money by way of provision of harbours and certain minor marine works.</P>
    <P>In recent years there was a loan provided, after very considerable agitation from Scotland and Scottish M.P.'s in the British Parliament, by the British Government for Scottish fishermen, but the conditions surrounding the loan were such as to render the thing absolutely useless.  The loan made was nominally £150,000.  As a matter of fact, because no loan would be given unless the applicant was able to put up an equal amount to the amount asked, the whole thing fell through, or practically fell through.  There were, I think, about twenty-five loans altogether granted, and they did not amount to £10,000.  The great development of the industry in Scotland is due to the fact that it has been financed and maintained by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Some things that have been done in other countries are canvassed a great deal in the arguments put forward as to what we are doing.  Take, for instance, Norway, France and Denmark. They have given a certain amount of assistance by way of tariff, by subsidising transit or making some arrangements for cheap transit, and by placing funds at the disposal of certain organisations which gave, or had been in the habit of giving, loans to fishermen for the supply of boats and gear. In Ireland the policy that was pursued was the policy pursued in the then United Kingdom, of leaving a fisherman to work out his own salvation.  That policy prevailed until 1891, when the Congested Districts Board was formed. Prior to that there was some help given in the way of loans to Irish fishermen for boats and gear, but these loans were given from certain charitable funds.  There was one fund, the Reproductive <Col N="549" /> Loans Fund, I think it was, which was originated by certain friendly Quakers in London.  There was another fund, also a charitable fund.</P>
    <P>In 1891 the C. D. Board was formed, and one of its functions was the development of the fishing and rural industries along the western sea-board, in what were defined as congested areas at the time.  Eight years later, about 1899, the Department of Agriculture was formed.  That was endowed with a fixed amount, allotted by the statute endowing it, of £10,000 a year for fishery development.  In addition to the fishery work proper of the Department, rural industries were passed over also, as you can see from the Estimate, by the Ministers and Secretaries Act.</P>
    <P>It would be just as well to mention here that the kelp industry is a matter that has always been considered to be the function of our Department.  We can at least claim that we found the kelp industry in practically an extinct condition, and now, by the co-operation of certain persons interested, we have brought it to a very live condition, and it bids fair to become still more flourishing, so long as the persons who make the kelp play square&mdash;perhaps it would be better to say exercise care&mdash; in dealing with kelp, so that the stuff, when put in the market, will be what it purports to be.</P>

      <P>I pass from that subject to consider how far a State Department should interfere in the development of an industry such as our national fisheries.  The industry can be developed perhaps in two ways.  Regulations and legal enactments have proved here that a good deal can be done towards development without any expenditure of State funds.  I can here instance the Dairy Produce Act and different measures governing our agricultural products last year and the Fisheries Act of 1925, which is undoubtedly improving and will continue to improve our inland fisheries very considerably.  The second method of getting industry going is by development schemes on a large scale, that is, from the State point of view.  Development schemes on a large scale from the State point of view are, in my opinion, very risky propositions.  They are propositions on which we would be liable to lose very large sums of money.</P>
      <P>I mention that point so as to lead up to the proposition which, I am sure, most people will agree with&mdash;that is, that the expenditure of public money is not an index of the rate of progress in development work.  For instance, we could go forth and comply with every demand for building a harbour here and a pier there, and thus lay out what might look on paper schemes of fishery development, when, as a fact, they would be sheer waste of public money.  It will be within the knowledge of many people that this has often occurred in the past, that harbours have been built for herring fishing where a herring has never been landed, even to this day.  There is one instance, in my mind, Helvick, in County Waterford, where upwards of £50,000 were spent.  Herrings are still being landed in Dunmore and Ballinagoul, where they were landed before. This lovely harbour, erected at State cost, is still there in all its virginity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the proper policy to follow in this matter is to try and set before ourselves the principle of helping fishermen to help themselves.  A great deal of what was done in the past was undoubtedly tantamount to spoon-feeding, and that spoon-feeding <Col N="551" /> has not helped to build up a self-reliant type of fisherman.</P>
    <P>When dealing with that kind of expenditure we might also refer to costly boats.  Costly boats are purchased at heavy loan prices, and the men will never have the faintest chance of being able to make them pay, because in many cases they are not trained to those boats.  We have the experience of the last few years that the men are rather inclined to use these boats as they used the smaller boats and the canoes&mdash;for in-shore fishing.  They will not stay away as is the necessity of the case if you try to make a big boat pay. They will not stay away from their little homesteads even for a few days. Therefore, bursting forth into heroic expenditure just for the sake of spending on what might be called development does not appeal to me, and I believe it is not practicable.</P>
    <P>I will confess, of course, that many of our fishermen who acquired these large-power boats in the boom years of the war after they had been making the smaller boats pay, and pay very considerably, were hit very hard. Many of them had sunk all that they had saved in the boats as a contribution in order to get from the Congested Districts Board or the Department of Agriculture the further amount necessary to purchase these boats.  The war ended; markets fell; the boats were laid up and in many cases were left derelict.  The men became discouraged; they were so discouraged they had not even the energy to look after their gear, which became absolutely rotten and useless.  In the case of power boats they did not look after the motors.  In many of these cases, especially where there was very obvious neglect of engines and so on, and where there was no attempt and no hope that the men were going to re-undertake fishing, I was constrained to take over a considerable number of boats&mdash;something like thirty, I think.  As a matter of fact, we have something over thirty motor and steam fishing vessels on hand which we had to take up.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will wait until I come to it under the sub-heads, he will hear all about it.  The Deputy will learn in a few minutes that there are a great many of them around Tirconaill. Some of these are hardly worth repairing.  Most of them are, and as a matter of fact are being, repaired.  As far as we can dispose of them to fishermen who find the necessary solvent security, we are disposing of them.  The usual process followed is this: We have the boats; they are supposed to be State property; a fisherman applies for a loan to the State to buy a boat which belongs to the State. That is really the process by which we sell.  Therefore, the cry that has been raised in various quarters about supplying fishermen with better boats has not very much behind it, unless, of course, the Dáil or the people generally think that it would be good business for the State to give loans to fishermen without any solvent securities, to give away these boats, for instance, as was done considerably in the past, by the Congested Districts Board, to the fishermen merely on the security that you can take up the boat if the fisherman fails to pay his instalments.  I do not think that was ever a good system and it is not a system that I could recommend for acceptance to the Dáil. Even if I were to recommend it, I am perfectly certain that the Minister for Finance would not see his way to agree to any such procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go into the details of the Estimate I think it might be well that I would review as shortly as possible the position of our fisheries during the year 1925 and to indicate the prospects of the year we are now entering upon.  Our freshwater fisheries, in which I include the salmon fisheries in the estuaries and even in the open sea, showed a very satisfactory improvement last year.  The values of our exports of all kinds of fish increased by about 30 per cent. over the 1924 exports, and our imports, which I consider also healthy, declined, even though to a small extent.  They declined by five per cent.  That our exports increased by 30 per cent. is all the better sign when we remember that the boats of our one Saorstát steam trawling <Col N="553" /> company were laid up for a very considerable period last year, that will be within the recollection of Deputies, during the labour troubles here.  The steam trawlers were laid up for something like six weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the Dublin Steam Trawling Company.  The value of the catch of our sea fisheries also increased over the 1924 figures. The chief sea fisheries in the Saorstát are the herring and mackerel fisheries. In the case of the herring fisheries in 1925 the value of the catch was £168,605 as compared with £111,272 in 1924 or an increase of over £57,000.  The value of the catch of mackerel for 1925 was £84,224 as compared with £47,779 in 1924 or something over £36,000 of an increase.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got them but I can get them probably before the debate is over.  One of the most encouraging things about the herring fishing of last year was that in the case of the Downings Bay herring fishery, the fish were sold in the German markets for 128/- per barrel while the herring cured at the same time in Scotland were sold for 68/-, a difference of £3 per barrel.  Our herring is getting a name in the European market that we hope will continue to improve to the benefit of the fishermen, and the several persons interested here.  That is with regard to the Downings Bay industry. Howth and Dunmore herrings last year were of such a superior quality that every available curing place in these ports has been booked up by Irish and Scotch curers for the present year.  Already there are very heavy catches reported in Dunmore with record prices to the fishermen, prices that I think were never heard of before&mdash;over 80/- per cran.  As a matter of fact in Deputy O'Doherty's constituency there are very high prices also prevailing for the herrings being landed there.  At Dunmore there are <Col N="554" /> five kippering houses erected.  One of these was erected in the last year by this Department in order to deal with any surplus or at least to let, because it was felt in the case of big landings there was not sufficient accommodation there to deal with them.  The Dunmore kipper herring is highly esteemed and we wish to develop the industry as far as possible.</P>
      <P>The mackerel fishing last year was successful, mainly because early in the year the American market was calling out for pickled mackerel.  Good prices were consequently offered by the curers and about 25,000 barrels of spring mackerel were exported to the United States.  As I mentioned more than once before, spring mackerel is not the most suitable mackerel for pickling.  The autumn fish are of a much better quality, but when they were ready for marketing there was not a demand for them chiefly because of the big and unusual export of spring mackerel, and secondly because of the fact, and this is a thing which I think we will have to face very seriously, in the future, that there is competition now of American fishermen at mackerel fishing.  Last year cod and white fish catches showed a considerable improvement. That was due chiefly to the enterprise and energy of the Arklow and Howth fishermen.  Of course they have the advantage of having a very good market near them in Dublin.  Since I mentioned the word &ldquo;market,&rdquo; it is something to regret that in the whole Saorstát there is only one fish market. There is no fish market in cities of the size of Cork, Limerick or Waterford, and this of course has retarded the development of the home consumption of our fish products very considerably. Cork at the moment gets most of its supply of fish from England, but I might mention that at the moment we are in negotiation about the establishment of a fish market for Cork.  We hope that from there Limerick and Waterford and other big places in the South will be supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you come to consider the establishment of a fish market, one of the necessities is a steam trawler plying to places near which that market is situate.  In the case of the Dublin market, you have the Dublin Steam <Col N="555" /> Trawling Company supplying its requirements. We hope that something in the nature of a Cork Steam Trawling Company will also be developed, or at least that some people in the south of Ireland will invest their money in that direction.  We have been told from the platform and the Press of the fortunes that are being taken from the sea around our coasts by foreigners coming along.  I believe that is so because otherwise they would not come. It is rather a pity that some Irish people who have money to invest should invest it abroad rather than put it into something of this kind&mdash;something of the nature of a steam trawling company.  At one time, as a matter of fact, we circularised the Chambers of Commerce all over the Saorstát, and while I would not say that we did not even get an answer to our communication we certainly got nothing more than a mere acknowledgment.  I think I said before that I could not recommend the blossoming forth of the State into steam trawling.  The Australian Government when they attempted that some years ago dropped a few million pounds and had to drop the scheme as a hopeless one.  I believe that the thing has to be done by private enterprise, very closely controlled, and after very careful consideration beforehand with regard to shore organisation and apart altogether from the running of the boats.</P>
    <P>Now, I come to the different sub-heads in the Estimate.  Sub-head A. deals with salaries, wages, allowances, and so on, clerical staff, technical outdoor staff, messenger staff and so on. There has been comparatively little change in this sub-head since last year. We actually did not spend what we asked last year.  We spent £21,057. The explanation of that is that there were some vacancies on the establishment which were not filled, and we provide for them this year.  A certain amount of the increase that we are asking for this year is due to the ordinary Civil Service arrangements as regards annual increments.  Sub-head B. deals with travelling.  That sub-head provides for the expenses of inspectors who go around holding the <Col N="556" /> inquiries that I spoke of earlier, as well as for the travelling expenses of our superintendents whose duties are mainly in the country.  Incidental expenses include such things as advertising, the purchase of fish papers, and so on.  The item for telephones and telegrams requires no explanation.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E. is the important one.  It provides the money to carry on the development work to which I referred before.  The amount asked for is £34,025 while last year the amount was £39,225.  As a matter of fact all that money was not asked for last year.  The figure has been reduced from what we did ask by something like over £7,000. The principal cut was one of £3,000 under the scheme for loans, boats and gear.  I asked for £10,000, and as you will see from the sub-head, £7,000 has been allowed.  If you look at the Appropriations-in-Aid, Sub-head J., you will see that I expect back in repayments from fishery and industrial loans a sum of £10,000.  I am really only asking to be allowed to expend this year in loans what I expect to get back.  I must say that I regret that we are not allowed more under this heading, because I expect that with the improved outlook and the brightening up that there is at the moment in the fishing industry, that there will be a larger number of applications for loans this year than there were last year.</P>
    <P>The revival of fishing will mean far more applications for these loans.  If the money is not available, of course it cannot be helped, but I feel that it will be rather hard on some of the poorer people who have been badly hit, and who might now be enabled to take up the fishing calling again, and to pay off their former indebtedness.  Last year there were 417 applications received for loans; 278 of these applicants were given loans, the advances amounting to £6,942.  Thirty applications were refused for various reasons.  The remaining 109 have since been dealt with in the present financial year.</P>

      <P>I could circulate the list amongst Deputies, but surely the Deputy is not serious in asking me to read out a list of 278 loans granted, of 30 refused, and of 109 which have been allocated during the present financial year.  If the information is seriously required I can have it circulated. There is another side to this question of loans which, I think, it is well the House should be made aware of.  It is this, that I regret very much the extent to which the arrears are increasing. From a sum of £5,000 in the years 1919-20, the arrears reached the very substantial sum of £85,177 in the year 1925. Of course there are many causes for that which are obvious, but at any rate the present position of affairs is that many of these arrears will have to be written off as bad debts, while there are several cases of borrowers who could pay but will not pay.  As far as we are able to do so, we are going against these persons and their securities, and will insist on repayment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now coming to sub-head E, dealing with fishery development, we have item 2, &ldquo;fishery requisites for re-sale.&rdquo;  I am asking for £2,000.  That is a provision we are making in certain outlying places like Downings Bay, Baltimore, in the Arran Islands, for Departmental stores where we keep barrels of salt, gear, and so on.  We have found this an extremely useful service in the past, especially in remote places, where supplies may be needed at a moment's notice. I regret also that there was a cut of £1,000 from what I asked for here. For &ldquo;Vocational Instruction,&rdquo; item 3, there is a sum of £2,250.  That is required to pay the staff of instructors employed to teach the sons of fishermen and other youths as to the driving of fishing boats, the building of boats, net-making, and so forth.  In addition, we often employ instructors to teach proper methods of curing for export in areas where in the past there has been curing for local consumption only. They are also occasionally employed to teach fishermen to use the new forms of gear, such as the ring-net, in County Donegal and County Mayo.  In connection with this, the Department runs three establishments in Downings Bay <Col N="558" /> and Galway.  There is a boat-building school at Galway, and also a marine motor school.  In addition to these three we subsidise industrial schools at Killybegs and Baltimore.  We also help in a small way in getting boys trained as coopers, and in fact we are assisting two boys who are learning the coopering trade in Dublin.  Any person living along the sea-board of Tirconaill, or in any mackerel-curing place, will know the necessity of having well-trained coopers in connection with curing.  The amount spent on the fishery instruction scheme is £1,952.  I am asking for a further sum this year, for it is intended to start navigation schools for fishermen and net-making classes in some areas.</P>
    <P>Item 4 refers to the insurance of power-boats.  I think I mentioned last year that we inherited this particular liability but that we were winding up our liabilities in this respect.  These boats used to be insured in a certain mutual insurance association and the premiums were becoming extremely heavy.  We were obliged to put some other proposition regarding this to Finance.  We have withdrawn from this, and the proposition to replace it is before Finance.  Items 5 and 6 go together.  They relate to the building and repair of fishing boats in the Department's yards at Galway and Downings Bay.  As I have mentioned before, there were several boats we had to take up.  They were in a very neglected condition and required considerable repairs.  Of course that expenditure can at least be recovered in part when the boats are disposed of. Item 7 requires rather more explanation than most of the other sub-heads because it is new.  The Department, as I have said, had certain boats lying on their hands.  We found ourselves with twelve serviceable boats that could be easily commissioned.  We had nets in our stores and the fishermen were there idle, and unable perhaps to get loans under the terms that we had to stipulate, or perhaps they were unwilling, but at any rate they were not coming forward looking for loans for the acquisition of these boats.</P>
    <P>It was put up by the Chairman of the Gaelteacht Commission last year <Col N="559" /> that something should be done with these boats rather than have them lying idle, and, with a certain amount of doubt as to the value that would result from the scheme, I agreed to go with a certain deputation from the Gaelteacht Commission to the Minister for Finance with a scheme for the utilisation of these boats.  We got the consent of the Minister for Finance to that scheme.  In connection with that money was available last year from another sub-head, so that it did not require a new vote from the House.  It was available from savings as a result of ten motor boats and one steam drifter we put into commission in September last.  It was not the fault of the scheme or the fault of the men but it was not a success&mdash;because of the speculative nature that will always surround the fishing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>It happened that the herrings were scarce, and very far from the shore, and the weather was bad and the boats could not go to the fishing beds.  The result from the point of view of the fishermen was a failure. The fishermen were more or less in the nature of share hands&mdash;deck hands on the share system.  If the boat worked well they would get a certain amount out of it, but as it turned out the fishing from the point of view of the fishermen and the State was a failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it was entirely due to conditions over which nobody had any control.  We felt that the scheme should not, on that account, be dropped.  Those boats, as well as a few others on hands, have been fitted out again for the present herring fishery in Donegal, and they are actually working.  The sum of £2,500, mentioned in the Estimate, is the amount we are asking in order to carry out that scheme.  We hope, with successful fishing this year, that that money will be recovered by the earnings of the boats.  The estimated receipt is <Col N="560" /> included in the Appropriations-in-Aid (Sub-head J.)  As to the scheme, I do not think there is the element of development of the fishing industry in it, because the man engaged is only a deck hand.  He can never become proprietor of the boat himself, and I am afraid it will not help us very much.  But it is, at least, an experiment and, in a sense, it means a saving of the boats, because they are not lying up and deteriorating.</P>
    <P>Item 8 is an item well known to Deputies from the West.  It represents the annual subsidy to the Galway Steamboat Company for keeping up a steamer service to the Arran Islands. This is a heritage we have received from the C.D.B.  It would be a great hardship on the Islanders if they were deprived of this service.  The service is being run at a very serious loss at the moment, and I understand it is very likely to close down.  I have put up a proposal to the Minister for Finance for-increasing the subsidy by £500.  That, however, does not arise on this Estimate, because there is no financial sanction for it.</P>
    <P>The next item is in connection with dredging operations.  This is a very useful service.  It operates chiefly in connection with the few East-coast fishing harbours.  Silting occurs a good deal, especially from the operation of certain winds, at Arklow, Balbriggan and Howth.  The harbour bars have to be very frequently dredged to allow safe passage out for the fishing boats.  To a lesser extent, that also prevails at Courtown.  Deputy Corish raised a question quite recently with me regarding the position there, and we are trying to arrange to get a dredger sent there in the near future. We, of course, have no dredgers.  The Board of Works run all these dredgers and we contribute from our Vote towards the cost of work which is purely of fishery importance, and which is done at our request.  Very often, demands for assistance in this respect are held up because we insist, more or less, on local contributions, which are not always forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Item 10 refers to fish curing.  This is an item which appears about almost every year.  It is purely an emergency <Col N="561" /> provision.  It was from this sub-head that we made a saving last year which enabled us to carry out the suggestions of the Gaelteacht Commission in connection with Tirconaill.  The idea is that when there is a big glut of mackerel or herring at any particular place, the State should step in, rather than see the catches dumped back into the sea, and that they should cure the fish themselves.  Last year it was not necessary to do that, and I think normally it will not be necessary.  At all events, it will not be necessary to the extent represented by the amount in the Estimate.</P>

The inspection for the brand was carried out by one of our fishery superintendents, in accordance with the regulations issued by my Department.

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>Germany chiefly.  With regard to the branding of mackerel, I was advised some years ago that something should be done in this direction. I agreed with that.  The suggestion was that, for a time at any rate, the branding should be optional.  We drew up regulations and advised the trade. Some of the traders were quite friendly and some were quite the opposite.  Some of those engaged in the trade were perfectly <Col N="562" /> honest in their opinion about the proposal.  They said that their own brand was sufficient testimony to the quality of the stuff in the American market, and that they did not want a State brand.  That might be so with regard to certain curers.  There are some very good curers of mackerel for export to the United States, but there are many who are not.  To the good curers, a State brand may not mean very much, but I think they will find eventually that it will, in the sense that the inferior curer who is exporting to the American market is lowering the general demand for Irish mackerel and lowering the price obtainable.  This year we had a complaint from our trade representative in New York, Mr. Lindsay Crawford, that American importers of cured mackerel complained a good deal about certain mackerel received from Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt there was justification for that.  We tried, at the time, to give as much publicity as possible in America to the fact that there was a State brand, and that American importers who wished to have an absolute guarantee of high quality in regard to the mackerel they imported should look for that brand.  If, after a certain amount of supervision this year, it comes to my notice that bad methods of curing continue to prevail, I shall have to come to the Dáil and ask for power for compulsory inspection of all mackerel for export.  Legislation will be necessary.  I have little doubt that it will be necessary for me to come to the Dáil in connection with this matter.</P>
      <P>Item 12 refers to the Scientific Investigation of the Sea.  The amount set down provides for the purchase of instruments and appliances required in making the investigations by the scientific staff.</P>
      <P>Item 13 refers to Upkeep of Stores and Stations.  That amount is required to meet the cost of repairs, improvements, rates and other matters connected with the various store-houses, to which I already referred, curing stations, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Item 14 refers to Shell-Fish Development. This is a small item of £300, which provides for a certain bacteriological <Col N="563" /> examination of mussels, transplantation of oysters, and other matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>The next item deals with collection of statistics and a sum is put down of £600 for that.  This work does not in any way overlap the work of the Statistics Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  These statistics are built up by means of small payments of from £3 to £10 a year for local fishing information which we could not get otherwise and which we find useful.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the sub-head for the development of inland fisheries.  The total estimate for that is £9,525 out of a total of £34,025.  Grants to boards of conservators and local fishery associations absorb a sum of £5,000.  Very considerable improvement can be seen in our salmon fisheries in the last year or so.  I attribute that improvement to three things.  In the first place, the Fishery Act of 1925 placed more funds at the disposal of the boards of conservators than they formerly had and this enables them to employ a better type of bailiff than they were able to employ before and to employ more bailiffs.  In the second place, I attribute the improvement to useful co-operation with us and with the local fishery conservators of the Gárda Síochána.  I have no hesitation in saying that their work in the protection of inland fisheries is invaluable.  In the third place, I believe there is a better sense of citizenship in this regard arising in the country.  I believe the people generally are beginning to regard these inland fisheries as a national asset and to deprecate many of the things which used to be done in the past which were destructive of this asset.  There is no doubt that the legislation of 1924, which was directed against offences during the close season, and the Act of last year are making it far more difficult for the poacher and for the illicit dealer in poached salmon to dispose of their catches.</P>
    <P>I believe that legislation has done a great deal to check the abuses which have existed.  Out of this £5,000, I propose to encourage as far as possible various angling associations in the <Col N="564" /> Saorstát.  These associations are usually formed by trout anglers and they have more or less, perhaps naturally, been neglected by the boards of conservators.  Technically, of course, a Board of Conservators of any particular district is supposed to look after the protection of all classes of inland fisheries in their district.  But as the only revenue-producing fish in their district was the salmon, their minds were turned chiefly towards salmon protection.  That involved a good deal of neglect of trout fishing. The persons who form these angling associations are usually a very good type of citizen and they are anxious generally for fishery protection.  They are very often the tradesmen in the towns&mdash;the carpenter, the shoemaker and the blacksmith&mdash;who go out angling on Saturday or Sunday.  The associations are well worthy of support and we propose to give them grants from the Vote in order to encourage them.  They are creating a spirit which will have a great effect in protecting the spawning rivers.</P>
    <P>The second item under this heading of inland fisheries refers to hatcheries. The amount there set out provides for the upkeep of certain salmon and trout hatcheries.  The estimated cost is £2,250.  One of these hatcheries is at Lismore and it is operated under an agreement with this Department.  We give it a subsidy and we get in return ova for stocking rivers.  The other hatchery is at Glenties, and it is managed directly by the Department.  It has recently been enlarged and improved and it has a capacity of 2,000,000 ova. Last year we planted fry on the Innisowen and South Donegal rivers from these hatcheries, as well as stocking the Oweneagh, which is State property. We hope to extend our hatcheries so as to have at least one on the East Coast and one on the West or South-West Coast.  We are, as a matter of fact in negotiation with a proprietor on the Boyne and on the Maigue rivers.  There are also hatcheries conducted by local bodies which we encourage.  These hatcheries are desirable not so much for any value they give in the way of stocking rivers as for the spirit they create in the district concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> Item 3 under this Sub-head refers to State Fishery Rights, for which a sum of £2,000 is set down.  The management of these State-owned fisheries is conducted by this Department.  The cost of upkeep includes cost of superintendence, wages of bailiffs, fishing crews, etc.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> I now move that the Committee Report Progress.</P>
    <P>Agreed.</P>
    <P>The Dáil went out of Committee.</P>
    <P>Progress reported.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until Tuesday, June 8th.</P>
