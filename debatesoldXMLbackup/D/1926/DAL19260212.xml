      <P>I am in a difficulty in regard to private Deputies' business.  I do not see present the Deputy responsible for the Shop Hours (Drapery Trades, Dublin and Districts) (Amendment) Bill, 1925.  If the Dáil were agreeable not to take that Bill to-day, I would suggest, if no objection is raised, that we consider the School Attendance Bill until three o'clock, and then, at three o'clock, we could take Deputy Heffernan's motion &mdash;Item 6 on the Orders of the Day.  I do not think the Shop Hours (Drapery Trades, Dublin and Districts) (Amendment) Bill will be much affected by that.

I presume we may take it that Deputy Heffernan's motion will not occupy more than three-quarters of an hour.  I think there should be some accommodation in that matter.  If we could assume it would occupy that period, fifteen minutes would then be available for this Bill.  I suggest that the Dáil should now take up the School Attendance Bill and that the consideration of it be not interrupted until three o'clock.</P>

    <P>SECTION 8</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move Amendment 29 (a), standing in the name of Deputy Heffernan, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any officer of a School Attendance Committee for a school attendance area situate in a county borough or urban district mentioned in the Schedule to this Act shall be empowered to initiate and conduct prosecutions under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obvious intention of this amendment is to permit a school attendance officer to conduct prosecutions and to take reasonable steps for issuing summonses, etc., before the District Justice in a Court of Summary Jurisdiction. The obvious intent is not to have it obligatory to employ legal assistance, as it is felt that the cost of such prosecutions would perhaps fall in an unduly heavy manner upon the delinquents. It is felt that it is desirable that the school attendance officer should have power to conduct these prosecutions.  I anticipate that there will be an objection.  It may be contended, from various sides of the Dáil, that this officer would act on his own, independent of the wishes of the Committee. But we are all agreed that the Committee should determine whether a prosecution is desirable or otherwise in those eight boroughs and urban districts <Col N="782" /> given in the Schedule.  There is no desire that the officer should stand out on his own, and it is only on the direction of the Committee that he should be at liberty to proceed before the District Justice to conduct a prosecution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would give us his advice that the passing of this motion would mean that the school attendance officer would have a statutory right to appear before the Courts, and conduct his case.  I would be inclined to approve of it.  I think the practice in vogue in respect of other particular functions and Departments&mdash;that the officer of the Department conduct the case in court&mdash;is quite a good one when the officers are specialists in the matter.  It should not be obligatory upon every such official to employ counsel and solicitor.  I take it that that is the purpose of the amendment. I am not sure that it will be fulfilled by the passing of this amendment, but if the Dáil will agree that that is a desirable thing, then I should hope that it would be embodied in safe phraseology on the Report Stage.  On the other hand, it seems to me that the section as it stands, indicating that the School Attendance Committee shall be the enforcing authority, implies that it shall act through some person, that person being the officer.  I do not think it would be desirable, if there is to be a School Attendance Committee, that the Committee, as a whole, should be required to attend Court.  They must do their work through the officers.  I would be inclined to agree that the officer should be given statutory authority to attend the Court and plead, whatever the Rules of Court that are yet to come may say.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EDUCATION (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first read this amendment, I misconceived its purpose. I thought that it was simply an effort to make provision so that the Committee need not have every individual case brought before it, and that, in fact, the Bill would delegate powers to the school attendance officer to prosecute without the case coming before the Committee.  The point that Deputy Connor Hogan now raises is a new one, <Col N="783" /> so far as I am concerned, and I cannot answer it.  I would prefer if it were left over to the next Stage, and I will, in the meantime, get information as to what the legal effect of the amendment, as now explained by the Deputy, would be.  I think it would be more advisable to leave it over.  I am not capable of dealing with that aspect of it at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have some views expressed by the Minister and other Deputies as to whether in the scheme of the Bill there could be embodied some local committee which would be in a position to consult at least with the Gárdaí.  The Gárdaí, as the enforcing authority, is accepted by the majority of the people concerned, not because it is ideal, but because the circumstances, more or less, compel us to accept it.  Some of us feel that it would be well if there were a local civil opinion available to which the Gárdaí could apply for assistance, consultation and advice&mdash;without taking from the Gárdaí the discretion, that there would be an authority set up dealing with educational matters to which the Gárdaí might have access, and which would be advisory to the Gárdaí in regard to such matters as prosecutions.  In the Bill as it stands, there is no provision for such a thing.  Speaking for myself, I feel that there ought to be some provision made whereby committees acquainted with the local circumstances and local feelings could be applied to by the Gárdaí and consulted by them in regard to the enforcement of the Act.  I have no specific suggestion to make, but I should like to have the views of the Dáil expressed on the matter, if there are any views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of the same opinion as Deputy Johnson so far as the enforcement of this Bill in rural areas is concerned.  There ought to be a civil committee in each rural district. The tendency of the section is the setting up of an autocracy or a bureaucracy. The whole trend of government in this country, as far as I can see, is towards autocracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised that Deputy O'Connell does not give his views on this matter.  I am wondering whether they are in full agreement with Deputy Johnson's.  I notice that Deputy Johnson was very careful on a couple of occasions to explain that he was speaking purely in his personal capacity at the moment.  The difficulty I see in this matter is that I am afraid it would interfere very seriously with the effective administration of the Bill.  However you might try to avoid it, it seems to me you would have a divided authority over the Gárdaí in this particular matter.  There would be the ordinary authorities on the one hand, and there would be this advisory committee on the other hand.  They could not consult them in many of the individual cases.  School committees would probably not meet frequently enough, and even if there was any necessity for consultation, it seems to me it would be loss of time.  On the ground of loss of time, and on the ground of this divided authority, in practice, I am not favourably inclined to the suggestion.</P>
      <P>The difficulty, of course, so far as Deputy McBride is concerned is that when it comes to enforcing the law you have to enforce the law.  That is not pleasant, and it is easy to condemn it as autocracy.  If we pass this Bill, and if parents do not send their children to school, they are evading the law and the enforcing of it is a matter undoubtedly for the enforcing authority. There is no more autocracy about that than there is about enforcing a proper respect for any other law that we pass.</P>

      <P>While there is no one in the Dáil more anxious to see the local people associated with the working of the schools and education <Col N="785" /> generally than I am, I believe that if the enforcing of this measure were entrusted to local authorities it would not be a success, and we might as well not pass it.  The danger that would arise from Deputy Johnson's suggestion is, as has been mentioned by the Minister, that the Gárdaí would not have the same sense of responsibility as if they were entrusted entirely with its administration.  Whatever the theory on the subject might be, from inquiries made all over the country from people who are in a position to speak &mdash; not entirely teachers, but others; even some members of school attendance committees&mdash;the general opinion I have got is that if it is to be a success in the rural areas, or as a matter of fact in all the areas, it must be enforced by the Gárdaí.  I should like to see a local committee in connection with every school, to look after the school and the school-building, etc., but in a matter of this kind, where the keeping of a child at home must be regarded as something in the nature of an offence or breaking of the law, the proper authority to enforce it would be the Gárdaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>In theory it sounds all right and proper that school attendance work should be overlooked by a school attendance committee, but having sat on a committee in my own county from the time the Act came into force, I long ago came to the conclusion that it did not work as satisfactorily as it ought to have done.  In my time on the committee the general feeling was that the Act was not enforced satisfactorily, and that a change was required.  As things are, I think no other body of men can enforce the Act better than the Gárdaí, although it is not an ideal state of things.  For instance, if they meet children picking blackberries along the road at eleven o'clock in the morning they can inquire why they are not at school.  A member of a school attendance committee does not consider it part of his duty to interfere with people outside the meetings of the committee.  It is not his business to go round and hunt up children.  It is the business of the Gárda Síochána to do these things, and the people would not, I think, <Col N="786" /> resent it in the same way as they would a private person coming into their house and making inquiries.  As things are, I think there is no better plan for scattered districts than that embodied in this Bill, and I hope it will be carried out.  My opinion is that it will work quite satisfactorily.  I know that a great many clergymen are of that opinion.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will explain what special reasons he has for retaining school attendance committees in the places set out in the schedule.  If committees can enforce the law in places like Pembroke, Blackrock and Rathmines, why could not they enforce it in other urban areas? It seems to me peculiar that school attendance committees appointed by public bodies that have been dissolved, because it was alleged they were unable to do their business efficiently, are to be retained, while committees appointed by bodies which it is acknowledged have been doing their business efficiently are to be abolished.  I should like the Minister to explain that.</P>

      <P>Deputies may remember that it was suggested during the early stages of the discussion of the Bill that the Gárdaí would not be able to take up these duties, and that it would be necessary to appoint school attendance committees.  Undoubtedly, a number of these committees have worked well.  A number of the committees that we are keeping on worked well, and that is a consideration.  But there was another consideration, and perhaps that is what Deputy Morrissey is anxious to get at, the Gárdaí could <Col N="787" /> not undertake the working of this Bill in certain districts.  In the districts actually scheduled, the Gárdaí have definitely stated that they are not in a position to take over the administration of this Bill.  I do not want it to be taken as in any way a slur on the actual committee who are continuing to do this work.  In most cases, it is not so.  There is one particular case scheduled, and possibly, afterwards, I will have to introduce an amendment to deal with that case.  I do not know whether it is properly met in the Bill. One of the places scheduled is Limerick. From Deputy Morrissey's point of view, it is one of the strongest cases he could put forward.  We have no anxiety at all to set up a school committee there. A school committee does not exist there at present.  We would prefer if possible that the Bill should be administered by the Gárdaí, but, unfortunately, at the moment we have to schedule Limerick. I am not quite sure if we have power under the Bill to appoint a supervisor straight away.  I am afraid what we have got to do is to dissolve the committee and appoint a supervisor.  How we can dissolve a committee that does not exist, in order to appoint a supervisor, may present some legal difficulty. It is not denied at all that some of the committees we propose to dissolve have been excellent committees.  Our idea would be to have this Bill administered all over the country by the Gárdaí, and, where that is possible, we have provided for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been compelled, by the evidence of the need, to agree to the general proposition that the Gárdaí as a body will have the enforcing of the Bill, as local committees have not been rigorous enough, and there does not exist a civic spirit, the spirit of responsibility that Deputy McBride urged in connection with such a matter as school attendance.  As a matter of fact.  I think it was almost generally accepted that it was not correct to say that civic spirit was excessive in this country.  I think unfortunately, the contrary is the truth, but I believe we are moving towards a better state of things in that respect. I am bound to take into account the <Col N="788" /> fact that the Gárdaí, as a body, are organised from a centre, and that the individual officer is responsible only to a Commissioner and to the Minister for Justice, and that no local influence is allowed to operate in respect to the administration of the law.  That is the theory.  In respect to school attendance, the position ought to be, and, perhaps, some day will be, different: that local interests, local spirit, and local knowledge should have some say in the matter of how the law should be administered, and that it should not be all in response to pressure from Dublin.</P>
      <P>That is why I feel that we should, at some time, aim at the ideal of a local enforcing authority, and some day a local police force, responsible to local public opinion for the enforcement of the law, and particularly in the keeping of order rather than in the correction of criminals.  I think there ought to be, and I hope there will be, even in respect to the Gárdaí, the view that their business is the maintenance of order and not merely the correction or arrest of criminals.  Unfortunately, in the public mind at the present time, a policeman is merely a person who has to deal with criminals.  I think that is an entirely wrong view, and I hope that the contact between the Gárdaí, the children, and the people in regard to a matter of this kind will gradually lead to a different appreciation of the functions of the Gárda Síochána.  I feel that that state of things would be accelerated if we could in some way&mdash; frankly I am unable to propose any definite scheme&mdash;associate a local committee or local opinion with the carrying out of this law, and not let it be thought that it is something done merely at the instigation of the Department of Justice or the Police Commissioner, and so going against the wishes of the local people.  As I say, I am not able to propose any practical alternative, but I think it desirable that that view should be expressed, that some local body responsible to the people should be associated with the Gárdaí in the enforcement of the Bill.</P>

    <P>(1)  Each of the county boroughs and urban districts mentioned in the Schedule to this Act shall be a school attendance area, but the council of any of the said county boroughs and urban districts may at any time, subject to the approval of the Minister, divide such borough or district into two or more school attendance areas.</P>
    <P>(2)  In every school attendance area in the said county boroughs and urban districts there shall be a school attendance committee consisting of either six, or eight, or ten members as the council of the county borough or urban district in which the area is situate shall determine.</P>
    <P>(3)  Subject to the provisions of this section, the members of every such school attendance committee as aforesaid shall be appointed as to one-half thereof by the council of the county borough or urban district in which the school attendance area is situate and as to the other half thereof by the Minister, and every member of any such committee (other than a member appointed to fill a casual vacancy) shall hold office for three years from the date of his appointment.</P>
    <P>(4) If and so far as such persons are available, not less than one-half of the members of every such school attendance committee shall be managers or patrons of schools in the school attendance area, and in the case of a school attendance committee of a school attendance area in which a Juvenile Advisory Committee established by or under the control of the Minister for Industry and Commerce exists, at least one member of such Juvenile Advisory Committee shall be a member of such school attendance committee.</P>
    <P>(5)  The first school attendance committee in each of the said school attendance areas shall consist of the persons who immediately before the commencement of this Act were members of the school attendance committee appointed under the Irish Education Act, 1892, for that area and such persons shall hold office as members of the first-mentioned committee for <Col N="790" /> the period for which they would respectively have held office as members of the second-mentioned committee under the said Act if this Act had not been passed.</P>
    <P>(6)  The Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, may by order prescribe the times and mode of appointment of members of school attendance committees by the councils of the said county boroughs and urban districts and by the Minister respectively, the time and mode of filling casual vacancies in such committees and the period of office of persons appointed to fill such vacancies, and the times of meeting, quorum, conduct of business, and keeping and audit of accounts of such committees.</P>

      <P>The object of the amendment is that teachers may be appointed members of school attendance committees in such areas as they operate.  It is at present the practice to appoint teachers on these committees, and it is admitted that they are very useful members of them.  Up to 1922, the attendance in Cork was not everything that it should be, and a move was made by a local body, as a result of which the committee was reconstituted and teachers got special representation.  As a result of the teachers' efforts, the attendance at Cork is now, I believe, about the best in the country.  I do not think there will be any objection, but if the matter is left as it is, it might be <Col N="791" /> argued that it is open to the Department to appoint them.  It has been put to me in this way: suppose the local authority appointed, as they have a right to do, one-half of the committee, and that on that half there was no teacher, then it would be necessary to appoint the other half entirely of managers or patrons of schools, so that no teacher could get representation unless he was appointed direct by the local authority.  I do not know why patrons are put in.  Patrons are a disappearing body, as far as I know.  It is a term that was much used in the old days, when landlords were patrons of schools, but I do not know that it is necessary to take them into special consideration in this matter, and perhaps &ldquo;managers and teachers&rdquo; might meet the situation.</P>

      <P>I rise to thank Deputy O'Connell for his information that I am a disappearing body.  I wish that the process could be accelerated. Before the Minister accepts this amendment, there is one difficulty that he should consider.  With the principle that a teacher should be eligible for membership of a school attendance committee, I am entirely in agreement, but this sub-section (4) is mandatory. Not less than half of a committee must be patrons, teachers or managers.  Suppose the local body appoints the largest number on a committee that they can, because they want to have five members on it themselves, there would in some cases I know be only two managers available, and with them you would require to have three teachers, though there might be people whom the Minister would very much wish to appoint, because of high qualifications, educationally and otherwise.  Then, if you add teachers to this section, it means that you must have on a committee of ten, if there are only a Protestant and a Catholic clergyman available, three teachers, regardless of the fact that the Minister may want to appoint other people.  I suggest that the principle that Deputy O'Connell is pleading for is in the main admirable, but that it might be met in some other way than by this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would put the matter this way.  I recognise the difficulty Deputy O'Connell was under in actually wording his amendment, because the Bill does not secure that there would be any teacher on the committee.  It leaves it completely in the hands of the Minister.  Apparently, the Deputy thought that the Minister would not be willing to diminish the number of managers.  Supposing that I was willing to consider an amendment of this kind: that amongst the half appointed by the local body at least one must be a teacher, would that meet the Deputy's point?  So far as the Minister is concerned, his hands may be tied very much at present by the action of a local body.  They may appoint no manager or teacher, and if they were bound to appoint at least one teacher&mdash;they may appoint more&mdash;I think it would go far to meet the Deputy's point of view.</P>

      <P>That would be very undue interference.  Deputy O'Connell is introducing a new element <Col N="793" /> into the matter.  In these areas, where a school attendance committee is functioning, it is provided that the first school attendance committee shall be continued.  That is natural enough. The same kind of committee will continue to operate as long as committees of this kind are in existence, and I think that if there is a question of imposing restrictions of this kind on the local authority, the more natural way would be when you are introducing the new element.</P>

      <P>I am not inclined for the moment to accept this suggestion.  I think it would be better met in the way I have pointed out.  If the local authority put on a teacher, it would meet the position all right, but I would not like to have something in the Bill to say that they must put one on. If they do put a teacher on, the Ministry would not, of course, need to make any nomination; it could nominate all managers.  But suppose they put on no teacher, as may be the case, I think it ought to be open to the Ministry to put on one.</P>

In the case of the drainage committees, it was pointed out that we should insist that at least one of the people appointed on a committee by the county council should be a payer of the drainage rate of the district, and if I might for the moment equate the teacher, owing to his particular connection with education, with the man who had to pay a drainage rate&mdash;because both are particularly interested in these matters&mdash;we have a precedent.  The point with regard to the drainage committees was eloquently argued from, I think, all parts of the House, so that we are not doing anything very revolutionary in what I am suggesting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Subject to the approval of the council of the county borough or urban district and with the sanction of the Minister, every school attendance committee for a school attendance area shall have the same powers of granting superannuation allowances as are conferred on local authorities by the Local Government Act, 1925, with the substitution of the Minister for the Minister for Local Government and Public <Col N="796" /> Health, and the amount of such superannuation shall be treated as expenses of the school attendance committee.</P>
    <P>The intention of this amendment is to empower school attendance committees retained by the Bill to grant superannuation to their present officers who reach an old age or who have long service.  As a member of a Dublin school attendance committee for a number of years, I have had an opportunity of noting the duties performed by these officers, and I believe they have given general satisfaction.  They performed the same duties that are performed by other public officers and servants.  They work the same hours. It may be argued that they have accepted their positions knowing that they were not pensionable, but you must consider that it is only within the past few years that an improvement has been made in regard to conditions of service under public authorities, and that while every other servant in public institutions has been advanced, school attendance officers have been the sole exception.  I might point out that in the P.R. Act of 1919 and the Local Government Act of 1924 provision was made for a pension allowance to all employees, with the sole exception of the school attendance officers.  There are, I understand, about 31 of those officers at the moment, that is, those who will come within the scope of the Bill. Twenty-four of those officers are in the City of Dublin, so that it cannot be argued, I think, that the charges that would come under this heading for superannuation would be very heavy.  I trust the Minister will favourably consider the inclusion of this amendment.  If there are any words necessary in the amendment that will make it clearer they can be inserted, but I trust, at any rate, he will accept the principle of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word in support of the general proposition advanced by Deputy Doyle. It will be remembered that on the occasion of the passing of the Local Government Act an amendment was <Col N="797" /> moved to have this provision included. There were not any arguments, as far as I remember, put up by anybody on the Government Benches to justify the non-inclusion of these officers, except this, that as they were not already pensionable they should not be included in that particular Act.  The Minister at the time said, I think, that it was not his intention to make any people pensionable who are not entitled to pensions already.  That was the only argument put up against it.  There was no attempt made to argue the case against their inclusion, on its merits. I think it is an anomaly that these thirty odd public servants should be left out of the scope of a general pensions scheme applicable to local public servants.  There is no reason why they should.  They are whole-time officers, discharging a very onerous and important duty, and doing it satisfactorily. The vast majority of them are in the City of Dublin, and, as Deputy Doyle points out, the burden on the rates of the country to provide pensions for the remaining eight or nine will not be very heavy.  I do hope that the Minister will see his way to accept this amendment, and see to have these whole-time officers included in the pension scheme.</P>

      <P>I also beg to support Deputy Doyle's amendment. As Deputy O'Connell has pointed out, it is really an anomaly to have such a useful body as these officers not entitled to pensions.  I would point out to the Minister that if he wants this Act administered successfully he will do something to get them pensions.  At present they are not entitled to one penny pension, and if things remain as they are no school attendance committee would really think of dismissing them, even supposing they were past their work, and that they were too old and decrepit to do the very active work required.  They have to visit houses of the poor mostly. Of course, parents who have the interests of their children at heart would not require the attendance or supervision of these officers.  I submit that if the Minister wants the Act administered successfully he will include these <Col N="798" /> officers in the superannuation scheme and accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Deputy Doyle, and I do so as a convert. When this scheme was first put up to me, I was inclined to oppose it, because I did not approve of the principle of people who were appointed to certain posts on certain conditions, knowing these conditions, and knowing that the positions were not pensionable, trying to obtain pensions from them.  At the same time, when I came to look a little more closely into the history of the question, I discovered that originally hardly any posts in the municipal employment were pensionable, but that gradually one class after another has acquired pension rights until only the school attendance officers are left unpensionable. People who joined on the same conditions as they did were granted pensions, and I see no valid grounds for making an exception in this case.  I am told&mdash;I hope my information is correct&mdash;that posts of this character are pensionable in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  If that is the case I do not know why the school attendance officers in the Saorstát should be placed at this disadvantage. The sum involved is small.  The number of officers involved is small, and I do not think it would be too heavy a burden to place on the shoulders of the ratepayers.  In particular, I would like to stress Mrs. O'Driscoll's argument as to efficiency.  Any body employing a person who is not pensionable, is tempted to retain that officer as long as is possible, even when he is no longer able to do his work satisfactorily, because they do not want to throw them out on the street.  The result will be, unless some provision is made in the way of pensions, that you will have school attendance officers not up to the work which they are supposed to be doing.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to the amendment for a very important reason.  These men took up their position at a certain time under certain conditions, and because their numbers now are small they are to get pensions. From all parts of the country, we hear complaints about the heavy burden <Col N="799" /> imposed on taxpayers.  We also hear complaints about the lack of a sense of civic duty.  Then we are told that the Dáil should give a lead on these matters to public bodies against whom the ratepayers are justly crying out. Those who accepted these positions under certain conditions knew at the time that they had no pensionable rights.  No matter with what public body we are connected, we find these people and their friends coming along and trying to add to the everlasting and increasing burden on the ratepayers. Why should these officers, knowing that they have no pensionable rights, now come along and try to get in by the back-door?  I am opposed to the general principle of this amendment. If you do a thing, do it because it is right, and, if it is not right, do not do it.  Why should these people get pensions when there is neither right nor justice in their claim?  If the Minister is going to consider the amendment, I think he should take into account what duty has been done by these officers, and in cases where officers should have been dismissed, because they did not do their duty and did not earn their salary, I think it would be unfair to give them pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy D'Alton in this matter.  We are continually hearing from all parts of the country complaints about the increased burden that is being placed on ratepayers. Probably the heaviest handicap from which this country is suffering is the burden of pensions of one kind or another, which has unfortunately been placed upon it, but which cannot, to a great extent, be helped now.  That is no reason why we should add to that burden.  When a similar proposal was before the Dáil in connection with the Local Government Bill, it was defeated by 42 to 16 votes. Some Deputies seem to have changed their minds since then, but I see no reason why they should.  These committees are not committees of local authorities and I do not see why the burden should be placed on the backs of the ratepayers.  The Ministry of Finance is usually a stone-wall around which it is difficult to get, and people <Col N="800" /> think that it is easier to achieve their object by attacking the funds of the local authorities.  The ratepayer is generally a very easy individual to deal with.  He is something in the nature of a milch cow to which everybody thinks he can go when he wants to get something.  The ratepayers' milch cow can, however, go dry the same as any other cow, and I think it is very near that stage now.  This amendment proposes to make school attendance officers pensionable, and it is retrospective in its effect.  That, as Deputy D'Alton pointed out, is unfair. When these officers took up their positions, they realised that they had no pensionable rights.  That being the case, they are not now placed in any unfair position by not conceding that right to them.  If they were appointed under conditions which would have given them pensionable rights, the terms of their appointment would have been much stricter.  To a great extent, these were something in the nature of charitable appointments, given to widows and people of that kind who were almost at a pensionable age when appointed.</P>

      <P>I wish to oppose the amendment, and to support the Minister for Local Government and Deputy D'Alton for the reasons which they gave.  It was stated here the other day that hard cases make bad law.  That is the very thing which we have here.  There are hard cases, and there are many school attendance officers with whom, individually, we may have great sympathy, but we are dealing with local funds, and as has already been pointed out, the condition of local finances is very poor, and the position of the ratepayers to meet the demands upon them is very weak.  The total amount of expense involved in this amendment, if it is accepted, may be very small, but it is to the principle of the thing that I object.  These men entered into a definite contract knowing perfectly well what the contract meant.  If we continue&mdash;because we have already started&mdash;changing contracts for the benefit of one party to those contracts, there will be no end to the thing.  Every class will come along, one wanting this and the other wanting that, and will use every means in their power to force Deputies and local bodies to improve their position either by superannuation or other means.  An effort of this kind to retrench may be unpopular, and we may have to face a certain amount of odium from these people and their friends, but I think it is high time that the country put its foot down and decided that this cannot be carried further.  We call upon local bodies to retrench and cut down their expenses, salaries, and pensions, and surely it looks very unreasonable for us to be asking them to do things of this kind when we in this assembly are doing exactly the opposite.  I ask the Minister not to be moved by these appeals to his goodness of heart, and to steel himself against these demands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment, and trust it will be accepted. <Col N="802" /> Deputy D'Alton spoke about economy.  We could all agree with him generally, but when we talk about economy we ought to be consistent, and ought not lay down the principle that all economies must be made at the expense of one section of the community. I would like to refer to an instance recently where the principle of giving pensions was endorsed by the Dáil with much less justification than is contained in this proposal.  A short time ago we had a Bill introduced here to give pensions to two men who had service under the old courts for something less than a year, and who, I presume, took office without any hope of a pension. I think it was argued that they were promised permanent positions.  It was, however, thought desirable to introduce a Bill to provide them with pensions.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the case of school attendance officers is much more deserving. I was interested to hear the Minister for Local Government speak about the crushing burdens on the people.  I suggest to the Minister that he has foisted on the country a system of workhouses and poor law reform that has added to the burden the people have to bear.  It is, so far as the reform of poor law is concerned, only penalising them further.  He has advocated very desirable sentiments, but his Department has not carried out economy in regard to the services he is responsible for; he has carefully carried out that policy where other interests are concerned.  Many of those men have given long and useful service, and I suggest that opposition to this amendment is entirely inconsistent.</P>

      <P>I must thank Deputy Cooper for one word. The word &ldquo;convert&rdquo; is much nicer than the word &ldquo;inconsistent.&rdquo;  I am in the same position as Deputy Cooper, and that is the reason I have been pleased to get that particular word. The principal reason it appeals to me in this position is a reason that has been mentioned by Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll and Deputy Cooper.  Although I have no great objection to the amendment as it stands, I do not think the exclusion of the Minister for Local <Col N="803" /> Government, in a matter of this kind, is possible.  The claim was made that this is a local body.  The claim was made against that that it was not a local body but a hybrid body, and, therefore, a distinction should be made between these officials and other officials, who were being pensioned in the case of the last Bill.</P>
      <P>So far as school attendance officers are concerned, this Bill affects them in two ways.  School attendance officers in cities are going to be abolished.  The officers will be removed.  We are not discussing them; we are only discussing pensions for the school attendance officers of the committees in the scheduled areas.  It refers then only to Dublin and its surroundings, to the city of Cork, to Waterford and Limerick. The Deputies will remember that the essence of this was argued when the Local Government Bill was before the House, and the House, in a very marked manner, turned down this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from any free vote, both this House and the Seanad, which is very free in what it does, turned down this proposal.  The reason they turned it down was because some Deputy said it was not the place to discuss a matter of this kind, and that the best place we could discuss it would be in the Compulsory School Attendance Bill.  The main reason was that this Bill involved a burden on the rates and that it was not the time to put a burden on the rates.  I want to make clear what the attitude was and what were the arguments against the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, so far as the matter of justice is concerned, it has been argued that these school attendance officers entered into a contract, and, therefore, should be bound by the strict letter of that contract.  That is one type of justice, but there is another type of justice. When you are pensioning those who are doing a similar class of work to whole-time officials, you pension most of them, and you, so to speak, take out a certain class.  That offends against <Col N="804" /> another principle of justice.  So much from the point of view of mere justice.</P>
    <P>What especially appeals to me is the argument put forward by Deputy Mrs. O'Driscoll.  There are a number of those men.  You are keeping them on and expecting them to do work, and you are hoping that more strenuous work will be done.  Are you likely to get effective work out of men, over fifty&mdash;approaching sixty and sixty-five&mdash;in enforcing this particular Act if they have nothing to look forward to after their term?  That will be met in one of two ways.  Either those officers will have to try to find other means to supplement what they are getting, to the neglect of their duty under this Act, or else they will be kept on under the school attendance committee beyond the time when they are fit for work.  That is the danger of the present position here.  They will be much more easily dismissed if they are pensionable.  A number of those have rendered long years of service. Some of them have twenty-six years' service, and they are still far from a pensionable age.</P>
    <P>There are very few of these men over fifty-five, and most of them have already rendered long service.  It cannot, therefore, be alleged that at the time of their appointment they were beyond the age of service.  The service they have rendered does not suggest anything of the kind.  In Dublin, and I think still more in Cork, they have done a great deal in order to render a rather ineffective Act, to some extent, effective.  Their labours resulted in an increased attendance at the schools in Dublin and in Cork, and the work they have to do is not pleasant work.  They have to start their work at 10 o'clock in the morning.  They visit the schools and also the parents whose children are reported as being away from school, and in Dublin or in Cork that is not pleasant work.  Reference has been made to the age of these men. One of them is possibly between fifty-five and sixty years.  He has had long service, and when he was appointed he had to serve in an area in Dublin for which it would not be advisable to choose a very young man.  That is a consideration that ought to be taken <Col N="805" /> into account.  What principally appeals to me is the danger that if you do not in this particular case make the men pensionable you will not get effective work out of them as far as this Act is concerned.  That is the principal reason why I am proposing that the House itself should decide on this matter as it likes.  Again, it is another free vote, as it is called.  If Deputies think that there is a case for reversing the decision that the House took some time ago, let them do so, having heard the arguments.  As to whether this should be retrospective, that undoubtedly is the intention of the mover: that if the House decides to pension them their past service should be taken into account.  I understand that where non-pensionable officers are being made pensionable, and the thing occurs very frequently, the rule is that where the service is continuous&mdash; I mean the same type of service&mdash;in that case I think the rule is&mdash;I am speaking now under correction&mdash;that the past service counts.</P>
    <P>Now, as regards the future, what the Minister for Local Government has said is quite true.  If these men are to be made pensionable, then they will have to undergo the same tests both as regards the health qualifications&mdash;I am speaking now of future appointments&mdash; as any other pensionable officer has to undergo.  Therefore, even if the principle of this amendment is accepted, it can be easily seen that we will have to redraft the amendment and consider it carefully.  If the House in its wisdom decides to vote for this amendment it does not necessarily follow that this is the precise form that the amendment will ultimately take.</P>

I think the Minister hinted that people are not fit for work in the public service at 50 or 55 years of age, and that they ought to be pensioned at that age.  I think he mentioned that people were unfit for duty at the age of 50 or 55.</P>

      <P>There are a great many people in this country who are not paid a salary and who have no prospect of getting a pension who give better service to the State than any public official, and these are the people who have to pay.  The policy here, and I think here more than anywhere else, is to divide the people of this country into two communities: the people who receive a salary and pension, and those who pay.  It would seem as if the general tendency is to array these people in two camps&mdash;to put those who draw salaries or pensions from public or semi-public bodies in one class, and to put the people who have to find the <Col N="807" /> money in another.  If it is to be a general all-round system to remunerate every citizen in the State for faithful public service, that is another matter, and we will discuss that on its merits. What I say is, that the people in the country who are not receiving a salary and who have no public appointments, give as faithful service and are as much entitled to a pension as those who are drawing salaries and pensions.  If we were to face the position and tell the actual truth and what we believe, we would have no hesitation in saying that those who get no pension or salary give the best public service.  I would like to know how the country could carry on if it were not for the people who are drawing no salaries or pensions&mdash;the people who are trying to eke out an existence without any pension whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case has been made for a pension for every class in the community other than the ordinary weekly employee engaged by public bodies.  The case for pensions for the ordinary weekly wage earning employee under corporations and urban councils, has been strenuously opposed.  A man in receipt of a weekly wage has not yet been taken into this pension category, but I believe he is the only one omitted.  When appointments are being made and men enter into them&mdash;in fact they canvass very hard to get them and use a lot of influence and sometimes a little money to get them&mdash;an attempt is at once made to have a pension attached to them.  We all know that is the custom. As soon as they get appointed to a position their friends begin to pull the strings, and as soon as the person is nicely placed in a position an attempt is made to add something else to the appointment, so as to make it carry a pension.  We who are dealing with public money ought to have some advertence to the capacity of the public to pay, but there is no such advertence at all.  I hold that one section of the community deserves as much consideration as the other.  If you are prepared to adopt the principle that every citizen in the State must get a pension for his public services, I am prepared to discuss that from that point of view, but <Col N="808" /> I am not prepared to admit it here on this section.</P>

      <P>I would like to know whether the effect of this amendment would be to invest the school attendance committees with the power to grant pensions without reference to the local council, which is the rating authority, and the only authority legally empowered to grant pensions. That is a point, I think, that requires to be cleared up.  It seems to me, reading the amendment as it stands, that the power of granting pensions would belong entirely to the school attendance committee without any reference whatever to the rating authority.  That, I think, needs to be cleared up.</P>

I think it would be most objectionable that any of the local authorities or local corporations who have school attendance committees, and who provide the money should be deprived of the right of granting the pensions in favour of the committees. I think it would be most objectionable. I think it would be quite sufficient if the local authority was given the power to grant the pension.  If the House rejects the amendment, well, of course, that puts an end to it, but if the House accepts it, then, I take it, it will be the general wish of the House that I should provide another amendment, at a later stage of the Bill, embodying the principle of this amendment. I think it would be possible to do that.</P>

Their constituents can reckon with them if they disapprove of their action.  Not one penny of this money will be paid by the people of Carlow or of Kilkenny or of Tipperary, yet we are confronted with a Tipperary veto to tell the people of Dublin and the representatives of the city of Dublin that they do not know the interests of their own constituents.

In the meantime, they will have time to consider whether they might not put down a further amendment providing that officers under such committees shall not be pensionable.  Evidently the reason we get these arguments from the Farmers' Party and Deputy D'Alton and the Minister for Local Government is, that on a question of principle they object to people not in pensionable appointment receiving pensions.  Then why do not the Farmers' Party bring in a Bill dealing with this matter? Every other party in the House has brought in Bills, but the Farmers' Party never brought in a Bill.  Let them bring in a Bill forbidding all people appointed to non-pensionable positions receiving pensions.  Perhaps the Minister for Local Government would draft it for them.  He is in favour of that principle, but I think if such a Bill were brought in it should be applied all round.

      <P>I think this question of salaries and pensions has been put in an altogether false light.  Salaries which carry pensions are always paid at a lower rate.  When a man is offered a position with a pension the pension is always in the nature of deferred pay. If a man were offered a salary without a pension for the same position the salary would be much larger, and one of the effects of attaching a pension to a salary is to make the position more attractive.  One would imagine from what has been said that pensionable officials and civil servants and others who receive pensions pay no taxes at all.  It would be very interesting to get a return showing the taxes, both income tax and municipal taxes, paid by such persons.  I think the amount of it would astonish many critics.  Even farmers, and I am one of them myself, benefit from the work of those overtaxed officials.  As a member for Dublin, I support this amendment because I believe the citizens of Dublin are essentially a just people above everything else.</P>

      <P>I am encouraged by Deputy Cooper's reference to Dublin Deputies to get up and occupy the time of the House for a few minutes on this question.  I observe that in the course of the debate there has been a constant reference to the men concerned in this matter.  I would like to remind the House that there are some women school inspectors, too, who are also concerned, and who I may say do very excellent work, and I hope that under this amendment their position, equally with that of the men, will be advanced. I claim to speak with some experience on this matter for the reason that I was privileged to be President of the Children's Court in the City of Dublin for a period of three years.  During that time I came in contact with practically every school attendance officer, man and woman.  They attended in the court over which I presided for four <Col N="812" /> or five hours on a Monday to give evidence in the case of children who were reported to be remaining away from school, as well as in connection with children who were engaged in street trading before they had reached the age of 14.  Their job was not by any means a sinecure.  They had very onerous duties to discharge, and from my experience of them I must say that they carried out their duties in a very efficient way.  It always seemed to me that it would encourage these school attendance officers to put their heart into their work if they were made pensionable. It was not pleasant for them to contemplate that, after giving long years of service in their office, when they became infirm they would have no pension.  If the Minister for Local Government and Public Health insists on pensions for officials in the various departments under his control, I do not think it is fair to single out a number of servants, such as those covered by this amendment, and treat them in a different manner.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to a statement made by Deputy Cooper. Deputy Cooper is usually very accurate in his statements, but he was extraordinarily inaccurate to-day in several statements he made.  I pointed out, by interjection, that he was inaccurate in the statement that the Farmers' Party has not introduced any Bills.  If Deputy Cooper took the trouble to ascertain the facts he would find that there is a Bill under consideration in the Seanad, introduced by the Farmers' Party.</P>

      <P>Another Bill will be introduced by the Farmers' Party soon.  I think Deputy Cooper should withdraw his statement.  There was one argument put forward by the Minister which I consider is scarcely fair.  He suggested that already the Dáil has given pension rights to certain officials, and he indicated that, having given such rights, a precedent is established for the giving of further pensions. My recollection of what was done by the Dáil is that we gave no new rights; we merely continued rights that were already in existence; we simply continued rights which came down to us from the British Parliament. That is my information as to what we did in regard to pension rights.  I contend that we are not bound to any precedent established already by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>One aspect of this question has not been touched upon. If this amendment is carried it will produce great dissatisfaction all over parts of the country where officers have been dismissed and committees broken up.  These officers, I believe, are to get one year's salary.  In many cases the officers in the non-scheduled areas have quite as long a service as some of the Dublin officials who have been alluded to.  If this proposal is carried in regard to Dublin, I believe it will be an incentive to other officers throughout the country to put up a case for pensions.  That is an aspect of the question that has not been touched upon, and I submit it is a very serious aspect.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Farmers' Party as a whole could not support such a proposition. If the amendment is carried, the officers throughout the non-scheduled areas who will lose their situations will feel they have just as good a right to put up a fight for pensions as the people to whom reference has been made.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation.  There is no comparison between the two cases.  The Dublin officers are whole-time officers. Their duties commence at 10 o'clock in the morning and end at 5 o'clock in the evening.  These hours apply from <Col N="814" /> Monday to Friday On Saturdays they work from 10 o'clock in the morning until 1 o'clock in the afternoon.  They are in a different position from the officers Deputy Doyle refers to&mdash;the officers working in the country districts. The issue was confounded; even the Minister for Local Government and Public Health was not quite clear on the matter.  I desire, also, to correct a statement that the Minister made.  I was here when the Local Government Act was being discussed. The matter was not pressed to a division. When the Minister says that the proposal was defeated by 42 votes to 10, I do not know what he could be thinking of.</P>

      <P>We are leaving the road open to the imposition of this burden.  Dublin Deputies are entirely in favour of the Bill, but there is one aspect of it that they should consider.  We have to consider the actual terms under which those men entered into employment.  Where is the provision indicating that they would be pensionable?  As far as we are aware, it is non-existent.  As Deputy Gorey and other Deputies pointed out, when those appointments were vacant there was great canvassing and great intrigue.  At that stage there was no suggestion of making the office pensionable.  Men have no cause for complaint if they are held strictly by the terms of their agreement.</P>
      <P>It has been stated that our policy is &ldquo;to hell with contracts.&rdquo;  I have seen that as a caption in a periodical representing the views of those functioning under the Government in the capacity of paid servants.  In connection with school attendance officers, where can the cry be raised?  Where does the validity of the cry &ldquo;to hell with contracts&rdquo; arise?  The school attendance officers never contracted that their offices would be pensionable.  It is not a just complaint in their case to say that the Farmers' Party policy is &ldquo;to hell with contracts,&rdquo; because no contracts for pensions ever existed.  We are resolved that as far as possible pension rights will not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated also, by way of argument, that civil servants have to pay a great deal in income tax.  Have <Col N="816" /> they not earned&mdash;obtained&mdash;this money from the public?</P>

      <P>We have to oppose this thing on the grounds of the capacity of the people to pay.  Through the length and breadth of the country the people are suffering from distress. The hardships they have to undergo to make ends meet are appalling.  And as far as we on this side are concerned, we cannot directly or indirectly give any countenance to anything that will impose any fresh burdens on them. Every one of us in the Dáil would respect the application of that principle to his own constituency.  Then, that being the case, we cannot differentiate in the case of other constituencies; and, speaking in a legislative capacity, none of us should deviate from these principles which we support in the case of our own constituencies.  The ratepayers of Dublin may not have protested against this amendment, but we cannot, on principle, permit the extension of that principle of imposing fresh burdens, which may be applied to our own cases to-morrow.  I must vote against the amendment.</P>

      <P>I would not have risen to speak again&mdash;as I am anxious to get this settled now&mdash;but for the persistence on the part of the Farmer Deputies and others in saying that because a person occupies a certain position at a certain salary that that person is for all time strictly bound to continue under those conditions. I object to that principle altogether. There is no sanctity about it so far as I know.  If it were always acted on, where would the farmers of Ireland be to-day?  They would be where they were&mdash;under the landlords. If Deputy Connor Hogan's principle were carried out and strictly adhered to, the farmers of Ireland, <Col N="817" /> bound by a contract, would have to accept that, and they would not be permitted to seek for any extension of their rights.  To me that seems to be the logical conclusion of Deputy Connor Hogan's arguments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">

      <P>But the Deputy is trying to impose this principle on them, and I say, therefore, that he is following in the footsteps of the Irish landlords and the Tory Party of England, who contended that the Irish tenants had no right to seek their rights.  Now, if that were accepted, there would be no progress on the part of any section or any body of men.  If the position were taken up that because a man accepts a contract or accepts certain conditions, that he is not to look for any improvement of his position later on, them there would be no progress at all.  Deputy Connor Hogan says that his main reason for opposing the amendment is, because it is imposing a burden on the people, and he says that it is because of the incapacity of the people to pay that he is opposing this.  I do not know that that argument is put up seriously in the case of these particular officers.  I do not think the burden on the ratepayers of Dublin caused by paying a pension to half a dozen of these officers would be such a terrible one for the people to bear.  I believe that a half a dozen would be the very most who would be drawing this pension at any time.  In any case, I would prefer to accept the evidence of the representatives of the people of Dublin on this matter than any statement of Deputy Connor Hogan.  On the principle of getting effective service from these men, I am in favour of the amendment.  And I hold that the country and the ratepayers will get better service from these officers if these officers know that when they come to the end of their term, and are unable to do their work, they will have something to sustain them in their old age.  If they know that there is such provision to be made for them, they will put their heart into their <Col N="818" /> work and do better work.  It is for that reason I am supporting the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies, I wish to answer the argument advanced by Deputy O'Connell just now.  He states that those officers have the same rights that other local officers in this country had on taking up their appointments.  The cases are not parallel at all.  Deputy Hennessy stated that numbers of these officers took up positions because they were pensionable.  Were these offices not pensionable, they would not have taken them up at all at the salaries attached to them, and it was because they were pensionable they took the rate of salary at the time.  In the one case, there is the question of where people went in at a given salary, knowing that at any rate there would be a pension.  I think these are not on all fours at all with the others.  In the latter case, people took up a certain position knowing that there were no pension rights.  Now, is it just to the men who took on a salary at a lower rate, knowing that there would be a pension, that others who accepted a salary at a higher rate, because it was not a pensionable office, should now be given pensionable rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say if those officers who are affected by Deputy Peadar Doyle's amendment are not paid a proper salary for the work they are doing, then they should ask to be paid a proper salary, and in future they should be paid in proportion to the work done.  I believe that is at the root of most of the evils in this country&mdash;that some men are paid a salary for work they do not do, and that others who do the work are not paid sufficiently.  Now, if these officers are not sufficiently paid I say they should be paid and their salary should be increased.  But I do not believe in this method of acquiring a certain position under certain conditions, and then, after a short time in office, getting people to hand in a notice of motion to have the salary increased.  Unfortunately, the ratepayer has to pay for all this.  It is not just, honest, nor straightforward that this should continue. <Col N="819" /> If a person earns a certain salary, give that to him, but do not come on at a later date and say that this man ought to get a pension in addition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy D'Alton has very effectively destroyed his own argument.  At present the local authority, without being given any new powers, may, with the sanction of the Minister, raise the salaries of those school attendance officers.  Now, Deputy D'Alton says he is agreeable to that&mdash;he is agreeable that power should be given to the local authority, with the sanction of the Minister, to raise the salary of these officers.  But he will not agree to give the local authority powers to add to their remuneration by another method, by the method of pension or deferred pay.  One argument used&mdash;and I think it is a very sound one&mdash;is that giving these officers these rights will ensure their content and ensure better service by the fact that they can look forward to the time when, unable to carry on their work satisfactorily, they can retire.  I am only dealing with that particular point.  Deputy D'Alton enunciates the <Col N="820" /> view that the salaries of these officers shall be increased if it is desirable to increase them.  The local authority has power to do that with the sanction of the Minister.  Well, that is all that is desired in this amendment&mdash;that they should have power to increase the amount by the method of pension, rather than by the method of yearly salaries.  That is all that is sought for &mdash;that the local authority, with the sanction of the Minister, will have power to give this pension.  Passing this amendment is not giving these officers pension rights.  It is putting these officers in the same position in relation to the question of pensions as the other salaried servants of the local authority are in.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Corish, I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 7, lines 8 and 9, to delete the words &ldquo;by order dissolve such committee and shall by such order either,&rdquo; and substitute the words&mdash;&ldquo;either remove from office any or all of the members of the committee and require the council of the county borough or urban district by whom such members were appointed to appoint other persons to be members in their stead or, if the persons so removed from office were appointed by the Minister, himself appoint other persons to be members in their stead, or alternatively, the Minister may by order dissolve such committee and by such order either.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is desirable to specify that the Minister may have power to remove any or all of the members of a committee and to appoint other ones in their place.  It is well that that should be specifically included even though sub-section (1) (c) says: &ldquo;make such other provision as he may think proper for the discharge of the duties of such committee.&rdquo; That might be said to include this.  I think it ought to be assumed that there are other methods of dealing with a committee which is not doing its work than by dissolving it, and that the method of appointing a new committee, or new members of a committee, or requiring the council to do such a thing, is a desirable one and should be indicated in the Bill.</P>

It gives a free hand to the Minister to do anything he likes, and the rest of the section is worthless in the event of that sub-section being included.

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Whenever a parent fails or neglects to cause his child to whom this Act applies to attend school in accordance with this Act and, so far as is known to the enforcing authority <Col N="826" /> of the school attendance area in which the child resides, there is no reasonable excuse for such failure or neglect, such enforcing authority shall serve on such parent a warning in the prescribed form&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  requiring him within one week after such service either to cause his child named in the warning to attend school in accordance with this Act or to give to the enforcing authority a reasonable excuse for not so doing, and</P>
    <P>(b)  informing him that in the event of his failing to comply with the warning proceedings will be instituted against him under this Act in the District Court.</P>
    <P>(2)  If a parent does not comply with a warning duly served on him under this section, he shall, unless he satisfies the Court that he has used all reasonable efforts to cause the child to attend school in accordance with this Act, be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable in the case of a first offence to a fine not exceding twenty shillings and in the case of a second or subsequent offence (whether in relation to the same or another child) to a fine not exceding forty shillings.</P>
    <P>(3)  If in any proceedings against a parent under this section the parent satisfies the court that he has used all reasonable efforts to cause the child to whom the proceedings relate to attend school in accordance with this Act or the parent is convicted of a second or subsequent offence under this section in respect of the same child, the court if it thinks fit may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  order the child to be sent to a certified industrial school, in which case the provisions of Part IV. of the Children Act, 1908, so far as applicable shall apply as if the order had been made under that Part of that Act, or</P>
    <P>(b)  may in accordance with the provisions of Part II. of the said Children Act, 1908, order the committal of the child to the care of a relative or other fit person named by the court, and in such case the provisions of that Part of that Act shall, so far as applicable, apply as <Col N="827" /> if the order were an order made thereunder.</P>
    <P>(4)  Whenever a parent is convicted of an offence under this section in respect of a child, no warning shall be served on him or other proceedings taken against him under this section in respect of the same child within fourteen days after the date of such conviction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before sub-section (1) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  If a child to whom this Act applies fails to attend school on any day in accordance with the terms of this Act the parent of such child shall, not later than the day following such failure to attend, notify in writing, the principal teacher of the school at which the child is in attendance, of the cause of absence.</P>
      <P>This, at first sight, might appear to be put down in pursuance of my Cromwellian method of rigidity in connection with the parents, but in reality it is with a view to the protection of the parents from unnecessary prosecutions. I feel that for the practical working out of the Bill there is a gap that this amendment will fill.  The child is at home from school and nobody is in a position to know whether there is or is not a reasonable cause for his absence. No notice has been received, and the Guards may set about issuing a warning. They will not know whether they should take action or not, or whether the child has reasonable cause to be at home.  I now feel that if it is put as a duty on the parents in such a case to send notice to the teacher, the teacher will be in a position to know whether or not there is a reasonable cause and can give that information in the prescribed way and in the prescribed terms according to Section 15.  I feel that there would not be any difficulty about that.  It is the practice in most well-managed and well-run schools at present for notice of this kind to be sent whenever a child is kept at home.  I believe that this would fill a gap that requires to be filled for the practical working of the Bill.</P>

Deputy O'Connell is not aware that some parents may have to go two miles to serve such a notice, and I think it is very unfair to ask parents to do that. I believe that most of them are in favour of sending the children to school and I think it would be very unfair to ask them to go a mile or two to notify the teacher as to why a child has been kept at home.

I think that is too drastic, and some of the school attendance officers that I have consulted say that even in the city of Dublin it would be found to be a little on the drastic side.  Shall I say &ldquo;not later than the third day following&rdquo;?  Then there is another matter, the question of notice in writing.  Of course, notice in person would do in that particular case.</P>

I quite recognise that this is the custom in well-managed schools, and that in the majority of houses writing materials are available.  But there is a good deal in the statement of Deputy Bolger.

      <P>Exactly; that would be a penalty, but if he chooses to send a note to the teacher to say that his child is at home for a reasonable cause he is avoiding that difficulty. These difficulties that the Deputy speaks of are in the Bill.  I am rather trying to help the parent.  If this is not done, nobody will know why the child is at home and the Guards will come down on the parent by sending him a notice or by summoning him.  If it is known that there is a reasonable excuse, there will be no trouble.  I think that the Deputy is taking a wrong view of it.  If my amendment is not inserted, nothing will happen and these penalties will follow if the parent fails to do what I suggest.</P>

Why, in that case, should any extra time be given?  If there is reasonable excuse, of course it settles the matter.

    <P>I dare say the Minister will say that this amendment is not necessary.  I am not quite sure it is, but even if it is not necessary it would be a good thing to have it.  The purpose of it is to prevent this kind of thing happening. That is one of the great drawbacks at present.  The child is absent from school, a warning is sent, things go on all right for a month or so, and then the irregular attendance begins again. How will those who are in charge of a district proceed?  Will they have to start to warn the parent a second time? <Col N="832" /> I think that that should be prevented, and that is the explicit purpose of the amendment.</P>

      <P>This sub-section proposes that the onus or the burden of proof showing that a child attended school on a specified day shall lie on the person prosecuted&mdash; therefore, on the parents.  I am inclined to think that is asking a little too much, and that the onus of proof should rather lie on the teacher, who is in a position to bring proof of that kind.  He has the roll-book showing the number of attendances, and, therefore, the onus of proof that the child attended should lie on the teacher rather than on the parent.</P>

After all, we are bringing the charge, and the charge is that the child has been absent.  I think we will have to establish that in the first case and the onus of proof should fall on the parents only to prove an excuse when excuses are brought forward for the child being absent.  The first thing we will have to bring forward is that an offence has been committed, and we cannot assume that the party is guilty of the charge before we prove it.  I accept the amendment.</P>

The provision is an obvious one when the parents would not be in a financial position to pay for the certification.</P>

      <P>I have had considerable correspondence from the Town Clerk of Clonmel, which is backed up by the School Attendance Committee and, I think, also by the Corporation, asking that their town be included in the Schedule.  Many reasons are given why that should be done. One reason is that the present committee carries on the work of child welfare and the provision of meals to school children as well as other useful work of that kind.  The school attendance in the borough has been very high. I think the percentage is over ninety The town of Tipperary also asked Deputies to propose a similar amendment, but I did not put it down.

      <P>&ldquo;To add at the end of the Schedule the words `Tipperary Urban District'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan has stated the reasons why Clonmel should be placed in this position.  There they have a Committee of Management, consisting of the managers of schools, the Catholic Dean and the Protestant Dean, with some members of the Corporation. They are identified with child welfare, medical service, dentistry, and all the work of the Board of Health, which covers a good deal of the work connected with the children in school and otherwise.  They have knowledge, through their various officers, of the conditions that prevail in all the houses. This Bill was brought in, to my mind, for the purpose of enforcing the law when it became necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the children had been sent to school as they should have been, and if the late Act had been carried through by the Committee and the officers there would be no necessity for this Bill at all.  This Bill was introduced to meet the <Col N="841" /> cases where children were not attending school and where no steps were taken to see that they did attend, and where it was necessary for the law to be carried into force.  In Clonmel the attendance is 95 per cent.  In Tipperary the attendance is over 95 per cent.  At one time the attendance in Tipperary was as low as between 50 and 60 per cent.  The work is being done by the local Committee.  They are going from house to house.  These children are attending school.  I think it has been the feeling of the House that the less compulsion there is the better.  As Minister for Education, Dr. MacNeill dwelt on that point.  We want to get the children to attend by moral suasion, by teaching the parents their duty towards the children.  When you get Committees to do work which cannot be done better by any new system I do not see why they should not be allowed to carry on the work, the veto to remain in the hands of the Minister.  If a Council is not doing their duty the Government can send a Commissioner there.  In the same way it will be in the Minister's hands to do a similar thing if he feels the duties are not being done effectively.  The schools have maintained their percentage in the last two years.  I think they are doing their work properly, and I think it is better to allow those who are doing certain work well to continue in that work.</P>

I made that clear to Deputy Doyle and Deputy Morrissey when the question was put me as to why we are employing the Civic Guard.  There may be other centres as efficient as Clonmel, and in many cases there may be some not as efficient.  It is not a case of the <Col N="842" /> merit of Clonmel or any other place. The idea is to get rid of as many places as possible from the schedule and not to add to it.

    <Title>BANKING COMMISSION. - MOTION BY DEPUTY HEFFERNAN.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that agricultural interests in the Saorstát should have been given direct representation on the Banking Commission and that the Terms of Reference should have specifically provided for an examination of the agricultural credit problems of the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to enter into a long or elaborate argument to show that the agricultural credit problem of the State requires careful and minute examination. I do suggest that the Commission appointed by the Government is not composed of men who are in a position to deal adequately with the credit problems of the Saorstát.  So far as one can judge from the names of the gentlemen who have consented to act on the Commission, they are mostly identified with the banking profession or with business interests.  There is <Col N="845" /> not on the Commission any member who could be regarded as having a complete knowledge of the theory and technique of banking and at the same time a thorough practical knowledge of agricultural credit problems in the Saorstát.  The only man on the Commission who might be said to have a knowledge of agricultural credit problems is Mr. Smith-Gordon.  All I have to say about him is that although he may be an expert on theoretical agricultural problems, it is not possible that he could be regarded as an expert on the practical agricultural problems that exist in the country at the present time.  When it was suggested from these benches that the banking system of this country required to be inquired into, particularly in view of the changes which have taken place in the Government of the country, we had in view a totally different kind of Commission. We were aware of the fact that agriculture is the main industry of the country, and that upon its prosperity must depend the prosperity of the whole State.  We believe that the banking system in existence in the country must be modelled so as to suit the peculiar conditions that exist in this State.  In the past the banking system in Ireland was modelled to a very large extent on the system existing in England.  We do not believe that that system, in all its ramifications, is the one that is best suited to the conditions that exist in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>The Terms of Reference given to the Commission may be regarded as fairly wide.  They are: &ldquo;To consider and to report to the Minister for Finance what changes, if any, in the law relative to banking and note issue are necessary or desirable, regard being had to the altered circumstances arising from the establishment of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; The Minister may argue that these Terms of Reference can cover almost any matter which the Commission may see fit to inquire into.  My idea of these Terms of Reference is that they point directly to an inquiry into a certain line of banking business rather than into general bank problems relating to the agricultural conditions existing in the country.  I fear the inquiry <Col N="846" /> will, to a large extent, apply itself to technical questions of banking, such as banking law, note issue, currency and matters of that kind.  In my opinion the inquiry should be a comprehensive one into banking and credit conditions, having particular reference to the agricultural conditions peculiar to the Saorstát.  It is not my intention to make an attack on the banks or on the banking system, because I have no desire or wish to make charges which I am not at this stage prepared to prove.  It is my idea that this Commission should be set up for the purpose of making a full inquiry into all these problems, and that everyone who has a case to put forward in regard to this banking question should be in a position to call witnesses: that the Commission should be regarded as to a certain extent, judge and jury inquiring into the methods by which work is carried on by the banks at the present time.</P>
    <P>There is a crying necessity for credit in the agricultural districts, and we hear day after day that some change will have to be made to provide the farmers of the country with a better and freer system of credit than exists at the present time.  I need hardly point out that the agricultural conditions are not good; they are worse to-day than they have been for many years, and the financial position of agriculture is at a lower ebb to-day than it has been for a long time.  Proofs are beginning to come forward, now, that the farmers of Ireland are living, and have been for some time past living, upon their capital, and are actually drawing upon their capital. The great increase in the adverse trade balance of the country represents, to a certain extent, the capital drawn from the banks of Ireland.  Those who have deposits in the banks are withdrawing them, and evidently the effect of this is that the investments of our banks in England are being reduced, and it will be found on examination of the balance sheets of the banks last year that there has been a reduction of the sterling holdings in the banks in England.  Now that is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs if it is coming into existence, and if it continues it will have the <Col N="847" /> effect of bringing the affairs of the State into chaos and bankruptcy, that is if the rural community is existing on its capital as I maintain it is.  The effect of that will be ruinous to the economic condition of the country if it is allowed to proceed.  Now complaints are made that credit is not available to the farmers of the country as readily as it ought to be.  Doubtless a case can be made in the opposite direction. Doubtless people will say credit is available for those worthy of credit.  I doubt if that is the case.  I am inclined to think that the present system of banking in Ireland is such that it is found too easy by the banks of this country to make their profits by taking deposits from Irish depositors, and mainly rural Irish depositors, and investing these deposits in England rather than using them for the purpose of providing credit in Ireland.  We find, on examination of the bank balance sheets, that a very large proportion of our bank resources are invested in England.  We find that only 46 per cent. of the bank resources are invested in Ireland, and in regard to some banks the percentage of investment in Ireland is very much less.  Of that 46 per cent. in all probability, only comparatively a small proportion, perhaps not more than half is invested by means of loans to the rural community. Now I am aware of the fact that the first requirement and duty of banks is to see that the money of its depositors is safe.  I believe that under modern conditions, and in view of the privileges which joint stock banks enjoy, this must not be regarded as the only duty that they owe to the people.  They owe them other duties, and the question the Commission will have to inquire into, amongst other things, will be whether or not they are efficiently performing the duties which should be expected from them in the financial interests of the Free State.</P>
    <P>It is found in the country districts that credit of a kind which is very urgently required by the farmers is not available.  The only credit available is what is known as short-term credit. That credit is granted only when the farmers are prepared to provide good <Col N="848" /> personal security in addition to their own security; otherwise the banks will not make those credits.  It is well known to anybody connected with agriculture that short-term credits do not meet requirements.  What really is required is a system of medium or long-term credits.  Such credits would be more useful to the agricultural community than short-term credits.</P>
    <P>The banking system in this country is such that the banks must keep their resources readily realisable; they must keep their assets in a liquid condition and must not lend out money that they would not be likely to get back within a reasonable time.  They have to see that a very large proportion of the money lent is readily realisable.  The bank investments in England can be regarded as actual cash, because they can be turned into cash on a few days' notice.  With banks in Ireland it is quite different.  It is evident, if there is a rush on the banks&mdash;if the banks are forced to make a demand&mdash;that people to whom they have lent money will not be able to produce the cash at the moment of demand.  Such being the position of the banks, they endeavour to keep as large a proportion of their capital as possible in a readily realisable form.  It would appear that the amount available for making advances to agriculturists forms a comparatively small proportion of the total resources of the bank.</P>
    <P>I believe there will have to be some new institutions devised and established in this country.  There is a real need for the establishment of some form of institution, either directly or indirectly connected with the banks or disconnected from the banks altogether, which would provide loans for the farmers on medium or long terms.  That there are such institutions in existence in other countries must be known to the Government.  The Commonwealth of Australia has established a bank which is providing long-term credits for the farmers and great hopes are expressed as to the advantage which will result to the farmers in the Commonwealth through the work being done by this bank.  In Germany the German Government is making arrangements whereby money can be advanced to farmers. <Col N="849" /> The money is provided by means of bonds issued to the public.  The bonds are regarded as almost gilt-edged securities.  The land in itself is reregarded as the best possible form of security, and on that account the bonds have not to bear a very high rate of interest; the rate is about seven per cent.  Some system will have to be instituted in this country whereby credits of this kind will be made available for the farmers.</P>
    <P>The whole system of credits was examined with great care in this country in the past.  There was a commission which examined the system of agricultural credits and which made a very valuable report some years ago.  There was also an examination into the matter by the Agricultural Commission.  I regret that the Government has not seen fit to carry out the recommendation of the Agricultural Commission.  It is my opinion that, somewhat along the lines suggested by the Agricultural Commission, credits can be devised which will meet the requirements of farmers.  If credits are to be provided they will have to be provided through existing institutions, or institutions of a similar kind, rather than that some attempt should be made by the Government to provide credits.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to show that there is an urgent necessity for an examination into the credit problem in Ireland.  There is a still more urgent necessity for an examination into the credit system as applied to agriculture. Agricultural conditions at the present time are not at all as satisfactory as we would like them to be.  There is a demand from the farmers for more credit than is available.  It is stated that the ordinary farmer is not able to get sufficient credit to carry on his everyday business.  I have tried to show that the banking system as it exists does not provide for anything but the short-term system of credit for farmers and that medium or long-term loans are not available.</P>
    <P>I have tried to show that the personnel of this Commission is such that it is more likely to deal with the technical details of banking than with the broad general problems peculiar to an agricultural country, and that the <Col N="850" /> personnel is such that we have not on this Commission any man whose knowledge of agriculture is such that we, the farmers, are prepared to rely with confidence upon its findings.  I have endeavoured to show that the Terms of Reference are such that the inquiry of the Commission will be diverted rather away from the lines of agriculture and credit problems and into the technical details of banking.  If that is the intention of the Minister in setting up this Commission I would say to him that he is wasting the time of the Commission, and that he is appointing a Commission which will not have the confidence of the Farmers' Party in the Dáil nor the confidence of the people of this country.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to reconsider the personnel of this Commission, and to meet us by agreeing to appoint some further members on the Commission who will have possibly a knowledge of banking and at the same time a knowledge of practical farming problems.</P>

      <P>It might be said that there are not many people who would be available and who have the qualities that we should look for in those who compose that Commission, but we hold that there are to be found such people and that the Minister would not have much difficulty in securing men of the kind that we think shoult sit upon a Commission of this kind.  I beg to move the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to make it perfectly clear, in putting down this motion, that we are entirely in sympathy with the action that the Government has taken in the matter.  But we will admit that we are to a considerable extent perturbed by the fact that the personnel of the Commission does not include any man from the country who can be said to combine with a knowledge of finance, a close and intimate knowledge of the problem of agricultural credit as affecting the ordinary farmer in the Saorstát.  I think the country, as a whole, has been looking forward to the establishment of this Commission with expectations of good coming from it and from its <Col N="851" /> work.  One cannot go through our country to-day without realising that the problems that the farmers will have to face in the future will be solved, at least to some extent, by whatever change is made in the system of credit that obtains now.  With regard to the first part of the motion moved by Deputy Heffernan, we have to ask ourselves can we possibly expect from the body of men put on this Commission, composed very largely of individuals who have made their name in the banking world, a report favourable to a change in the banking conditions that obtain here?  Can we expect that they will suggest alterations in the laws of banking or that they will suggest the establishment, for instance, of a new institution different from the existing institutions in certain respects, and which institution, if it is to be a success will, at least to some extent, take from the existing organisations a considerable amount of the trade they have had up to the present?  That is a point with which I have some difficulty myself. I am not inclined to think that the representatives of the Irish banks, as they stand at the moment, will advise in the report that a new institution will have to be created that may in the process of time take the place to a considerable extent of the banks doing business here now.</P>
      <P>Accordingly we question if this Commission can be expected to view the problem of credit in Ireland in the impartial manner that it is necessary for them to view it, if they are to make out a report that will be satisfactory to the country and to the economic conditions that exist.  The Terms of Reference read:</P>
      <P>To consider and report to the Minister for Finance what changes, if any, in the law relative to banking and note issue, are necessary or desirable, regard being had to the altered circumstances arising from the establishment of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On reading those Terms of Reference I confess that I cannot see any reference whatever to the economic conditions in the Saorstát.  I want the Minister to tell us in what way the economic conditions have altered for the farmer anyhow <Col N="852" /> through the establishment of the Saorstát.  From the farmers' point of view in this country the question of the altered circumstances arising from the establishment of the Saorstát cannot be interpreted as having allusion to his economic position at the moment.  It may be said that the Terms of Reference are so wide that the economic conditions of the farmers can be taken into account.  But what we would like to see on this Commission is an addition to the personnel that would include men who would combine with some knowledge of finance and an intimate knowledge of the difficulties the farmers of Ireland labour under at present.  We do not suggest from what party those men may be drawn.  We do not suggest that it is necessary that they should have the technical knowledge of finance that, say, one of the directors of the Bank of Ireland would be expected to have.  I wish to point out that the farmers of Ireland labour just now under difficulties because of the restricted credit conditions that are imposed on them through the present banking institutions.  We are one of the last of the European countries up to this to face the problem of agricultural credit.  France, Germany, and the northern European countries have long ago established institutions, or in some way established systems helpful to the farmer in his time of need.  A report from the New York Federal Bank a couple of months ago told us that Germany was there in New York negotiating a loan for the assistance of agriculture in Germany.  We know what America has done and we know what Australia has done in the way of helping the farming communities in those countries.  They have established State assistance and other assistance for their farmers, and yet against all this State assistance the farmers of this country are expected to live and compete and to progress.  We have to meet these people.  They are our competitors in the markets of the world.  We are expected to meet them, and if we do not beat them at least to hold our own against them under the restricted hampered conditions in which we, the farmers of this country, have to carry on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> This Commission must have a definite end in view if it is to supply a solution for the economic difficulties of the country.  The greatest trouble of the farmers at present is restricted credit.  The farmer who desires to increase his area under tillage has to face the problem of employing additional labour and of procuring seeds and manure.  That raises the question of cash or credit.  He has to invest money in the land, and in order to get the best results from it he must feed his cattle with the crops he raises.  He has to wait twelve months before he realises one penny from the capital invested.  If he goes to a bank to raise credit he meets with very great difficulty. He will find it very difficult to get a loan, and if he gets it, he has to go in every three months and renew the bill.  Conditions such as that may be all right for big business concerns with a quick turn-over.  Such methods of banking may be suitable to an industrial country where the borrowing would be for short periods.  In a predominantly agricultural country like this, however, we should have a system of finance which would make money available for our main industry.  Very little finance is available at present for agriculture.  If this Commission is to be of any service to the State as a whole, the personnel should be such that it will look at the problem as a whole and suggest remedies.  That is why we think the personnel should be either altered or added to.  The Terms of Reference should have a specific, definite reference to the agricultural industry, because any change suggested in that respect means more to the future of the country than anything else.  The Commission might suggest the establishment of a system of agricultural credit.  If they do not do that, I agree with Deputy Heffernan that the fruits of their labours will not be what we expect or would like to see coming from them.</P>

      <P>I generally agree with Deputy Heffernan when he addresses the Dáil, but I always think it a pity that he does not stop at a certain point.  I agree with him in moving this motion, but I still have the same objection.  As regards the seconder&mdash; Deputy Baxter&mdash;I could not help picturing him as taking up a sturdy Cavan farmer in his arms and saying to the Minister, &ldquo;Do not strike this child,&rdquo; or, in other words, set up a Commission against him.  Although, as a representative of farmers, I can support this motien, I am doing it from a different motive.  Much as the farmers are hampered by the banks&mdash;particularly by the banks calling themselves Irish, which have not their headquarters in Ireland&mdash;the commercial community, particularly small business men, are hampered still more by these vampires.  As I might be betrayed into using unparliamentary language, I will leave it at that.  Nobody was more astounded than I was, when the Minister announced the personnel of this Commission, at some of the persons nominated on it.  I am entitled to speak of this, because I have personal knowledge. Some of these persons should be standing in the dock instead of being appointed on a Commission set up by a Minister.</P>

      <P>Deputy Heffernan's resolution could be condemned on his own statements, and if he puts it to a division I am not going to go to the trouble of voting for it as it stands.  He said the Commission should be regarded as a judge and jury.  If that is why he wants to put some member representing his own party on the Commission, I would prefer the matter to be considered by a tribunal that did not include any of the alleged financial experts who sit behind the Deputy.  I <Col N="855" /> think the Minister has taken the correct line in the appointment of this Commission.  At the same time, I feel that the inclusion of a number of people representing the alleged banking institutions in this country that could not be justified, might be regarded as prejudicing the findings of the Commission.</P>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister if it is his intention that evidence can be given before the Commission by expert agriculturists from Denmark, Belgium and other countries where the conditions more nearly approach those existing here than in the countries from which some members of the Commission are being brought.  The Minister for Agriculture, particularly, always holds up Denmark to us as an example for this country.  The agricultural communities in Denmark, Belgium and other countries are not suffering from the same lack of credit facilities as agriculturists are here, and I think it would be very helpful to the Commission, who will have to come to a decision on the evidence given, if they had evidence from some experts from the countries I have referred to. I also want to know if it is possible, or, if it has been arranged, that evidence will be given before this Commission by representatives of the Department of Lands and Agriculture and by representatives of the Department of Industry and Commerce?  I know civil servants in these Departments who, I believe, are capable of giving very useful evidence.  I want to know if any restriction will be placed upon civil servants going before the Commission and giving evidence, unofficial evidence if you like, as to the banking system most suitable for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am correct in assuming that the Terms of Reference are sufficiently wide to allow of recommendations being made for the institution of a State bank.  If that is so, I hope Deputy Heffernan and members of the Farmers' Party, before the Commission concludes its labours, will give that aspect of the matter serious consideration. I believe that is Deputy Heffernan's idea and not so much as to press for a representative of the Farmers' <Col N="856" /> Party.  He does not say that in so many words.  The farmers have a splendid opportunity now, if they take advantage of it, and it is up to some of their financial geniuses to go before the Commission and put up a case for what, in their opinion, is the best system of banking suitable to the needs of the agricultural community.  I hope that hundreds of farmers who rightly complain of restricted credit facilities will have the courage to go before the Commission and give evidence in proof of that complaint.  If Deputy Heffernan regards the Commission as being judge and jury I only hope the members of it will come to a decision on the basis of the evidence produced by the farmers in order to bring about an alteration in the present banking system.</P>
    <P>The Minister will, I hope, deal with the right of civil servants to give official or unofficial evidence, and also as to whether the Departments of Lands and Agriculture and Industry and Commerce will be officially represented before the Commission by selected officials.  I realise that this is the most important Commission that has been set up since the establishment of the Saorstát.  Anyone going through the country will realise that its future prosperity and progress will depend very largely on what happens as a result of the operations of this Commission. I agree with the Minister in going outside sectional interests and in looking for men for this Commission who, I assume&mdash;and I do not know anything to the contrary&mdash;are experts in this matter in their own country.  I would like if the Minister would say if evidence of an expert nature will be given before the Commission by agriculturists from Denmark and other countries somewhat similar to Ireland.</P>

      <P>Before the motion is put, can the Minister give us any information as to the position of the Bills that have gone from the Dáil to the Seanad?  For instance, we had pressure brought on us to pass the Land Bill and one or two other Bills.  I think the Medical Bill is another.  I read in the newspapers that the Seanad had adjourned until February 24th.  I do not <Col N="858" /> know what can be done in the matter now.  I suppose nothing.  The Seanad presumably is master of its own procedure but it is somewhat anomalous that the Dáil should be pressed to give effect to certain legislative proposals which are then sent to the Seanad, and that without consideration, and not on the ground that they have been overworked in any way, the Seanad adjourns for practically a fortnight without giving consideration to these Bills which were passed through the Dáil under stress of urgency.  I should like to know if there is any means of dealing with this matter or as to what will be the position of such legislation.</P>

      <P>On the question of remedy I am not clear that there is any remedy.  I do not know of any special circumstance which would explain the decision of the Seanad to adjourn until the 24th instant.  There are seven Government measures and Senator Linehan's Land Bill, in various stages, before the Seanad.  It is right to say that no special representations were made to the Seanad on behalf of the Executive Council with regard to the importance or urgency of any of these measures.  Personally, as Minister in charge of three of the measures in question, I thought I was safe in assuming that the Seanad would resume its work next week.  Apparently that is not to be the case, as the adjournment is from the 11th till the 24th instant, and I think we must only submit to the inconvenience which that occasions.</P>

      <P>On the question of the Land Bill I want to stress the fact that in the Dáil the matter was dealt with as one of urgency, and while agreeing that there were perhaps circumstances of an exceptional kind which, in the normal course of things, would not be approved of without long discussion, the Dáil agreed&mdash;and it was very generally recognised through the country&mdash;to deal with it as a matter of urgency.  The fact that consideration of this Bill has been postponed in the Seanad for a fortnight indicates to me at any rate that at least they are not so much concerned <Col N="859" /> with the position of this State as I think they ought to be.  Whatever may be the result, if there is any result or consequence of this adjournment or refusal to discuss the Bill, which in effect <Col N="860" /> it is, I hope that the Dáil will insist that all the value that would have been got out of the Bill, had it been passed immediately, will be got out of it.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.5 p.m.</P>
