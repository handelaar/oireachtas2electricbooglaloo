    <Speaker pid="MichaelEgan" hpid="Mr. MICHAEL EGAN Mr. MICHAEL EGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MICHAEL EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that certain flour mills in Cork City and County have closed down during the present week, resulting in four hundred hands being disemployed; whether in the case of the remaining mill the hands have received notice terminating their employment; whether he will investigate at an early date the causes responsible for the serious position of the flour trade in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>According to my information the depression in the flour milling industry, which has become accentuated recently, is not confined to Cork, but is fairly general. As I stated in reply to Deputy Hennessy on the 28th January, the position of the whole industry is now under consideration, and I do not think that a special investigation is necessary in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelEgan" hpid="Mr. M. EGAN Mr. M. EGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is in consequence of the dumping of surplus foreign flour, and is he also aware the millers maintain that the unfair dues charged are responsible for the closing down of the mills in Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewOShaughnessy" hpid="Mr. O'SHAUGHNESSY Mr. O'SHAUGHNESSY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'SHAUGHNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the dues on flour over wheat at the following ports are:&mdash; Waterford, 55 per cent.; Dublin, 60 per cent.; Limerick, 140 per cent.; Belfast, 60 per cent.; Liverpool, 129 per cent.; while Cork inverts the incidence of dues by charging 122 per cent. on <Col N="504" /> the raw material over the manufactured article?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Up, Cork!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that allegations have been made that the present position is due to the dumping of foreign flour, and I have seen considerable correspondence in Cork newspapers with regard to what are described as unfair dues and charges.  I am in this difficulty, that even if a charge of unfairness with regard to the incidence of dues was proved, it does not seem that any special action should be taken, now that a Harbour Commission has been set up which can immediately investigate the conditions at Cork, if Cork so desires.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Shaughnessy's question is much on the same lines.  There, again, I would like to point out that the powers under which charges are made were obtained by private legislation, and the proper way in which they can be changed is by a Private Bill, or else by a Provisional Order.  In both cases the initiative would lie with the Cork Harbour Commissioners.  For some reason or other they do not seem willing to take the first step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to the threat that the Dublin mills may be closed down shortly for a somewhat similar reason?  Perhaps he would see whether it is within the competence of the new Commission to inquire into the charges made for various items in the way of port dues at the several harbours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the reply to the question was intended to refer to the situation at Dublin as well. I said that there was depression in the flour milling industry which has become accentuated recently, and it is not confined to Cork, but is fairly general. I know that similar complaints to those made by Deputies Egan and O'Shaughnessy in regard to Cork have been made in regard to Dublin.  I do hold that the terms of reference of the Harbour Commission will include inquiry into such matters; if not, the terms of reference <Col N="505" /> will be enlarged so as to include it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMacBride" hpid="Mr. McBRIDE Mr. McBRIDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the closing down of the mills more or less attributable to want of enterprise on the part of Irish millers, and is it not also a fact that the mills are closed down with an eye to shoving on the tariff that people &mdash;millers, not consumers&mdash;are crying out for all over the country?</P>

      <P>The local inspectors in charge of all relief works under the supervision of the Land Commission have had instructions since the beginning of the works to be most careful that in carrying them out they should avoid the giving of any grounds for a suggestion of preference to any particular party or body, and the Land Commission is not aware of any case in which these instructions have not been adhered to.  As to the statement that able-bodied men who are in receipt of home assistance from the Leitrim Board of Health have been refused employment on these schemes, the Commissioners have no information that men in receipt of home assistance have been refused work, but inquiries are being made and instructions have been issued that applicants of that type should receive special consideration.</P>

      <Col N="510" /> Section 2, Amendment 2, resumed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment, as I tried to explain last night, will be to set forth that so far as the Legislature is concerned, it is to be enacted that every person up to sixteen years of age will be expected to undergo a course of instruction.  It is not an amendment which will prevent boys or girls from obtaining employment for pay after fourteen years of age.  Some of us may wish that that will, eventually, be the case, but the effect of this amendment will be to require that every boy and girl shall undergo a systematic course of instruction of some sort, up to the age of sixteen years; that is to say that, if employed after fourteen years, they will be required to undergo some instruction of a systematic kind, of a kind approved by the Minister, for a number of hours per year, notwithstanding the fact that they are in employment.  If a boy or girl is apprenticed to any trade or business or profession, then also that would be taken to be a course of systematic education and they will not be required to attend the ordinary school.  If attending a technical school or a post-elementary school, that also would be considered to be part of the instruction which is required for every boy and girl.  The effect will be&mdash;what I think everybody in theory supports&mdash; that systematic instruction shall be the lot of every boy and girl, up to sixteen years of age at any rate.  It also requires, if this amendment is carried, that being allowed to leave school at fourteen should be subject to a certain standard of proficiency in education being reached.  That, I take it, is a matter of very general acceptance. We are not going to assume that children who have attended school up to the age of fourteen are in a position to leave school without having attained a moderate standard of efficiency. Otherwise no advantage is being derived from any proposal to compel children to attend school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is accepted, very generally too, that the years from 12 or 13 to 16 or 17 are the years when it is <Col N="511" /> particularly necessary, for the fuller development of the character and brain of the child, that there should be regular instruction, and that the habit of learning&mdash;if one may put it that way &mdash;the habit of application should be and can only be engendered during those years.  It is because we have been loose in that regard that so many of the boys and girls of the elementary schools in the past have lost all touch with tuition and educational methods, and when, at the age of sixteen, they come to trades or occupations, they are found to have lost very much of the education they acquired up to the age of 12 or 13.  It is during those three or four years that retrogression takes place.  I hope that it will be generally accepted that a different standard should be the normal.  We know, as a matter of practice, that very large numbers of the boys of the country do go to school up to 16 years of age, especially in rural areas.  In practice, this particular provision will have effect more in the towns than in the rural areas.  There is no hardship entailed upon anyone by this unless you are going to argue that boys of 14 to 16 should be allowed to run wild or free, whether they are employed or not.</P>
    <P>The real effect of this amendment would be to ensure that if boys are not in employment, they will be at school, and if they are in employment that they should, in addition, be receiving some systematic instruction.  I think that that proposition should commend itself to the Dáil, and I think that it is of the utmost importance that it should be laid down in this enactment that that is the intention of the Legislature. It is better to do it by that means and leave any remissions or adjustments to meet the particular state of the country and to meet the educational facilities of the country, to be relaxed somewhat by the Minister for Education, rather than, as has been suggested, that we should limit the compulsory attendance to fourteen and then allow tightening up at later stages.</P>
    <P>It is much more important that the Legislature should lay down that the <Col N="512" /> normal period of systematic instruction should continue to sixteen years of age and then if, to meet temporary and local circumstances, there is any modification of the rigid application, it should be by the Minister's action rather than the other way round.  I hope the Dáil will affirm this proposition that in the future the children of this country will be expected to undergo systematic instruction until they arrive at the age of sixteen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have long held the opinion that the age of sixteen is the minimum school-leaving age which the Department should insist upon.  I foresee, however, great difficulties in carrying out a compulsory Act enforcing attendance on children of that age.  Your buildings will not be suitable, and I doubt if your teaching powers will be sufficient. Nevertheless, I am satisfied to vote for the extension in this Bill of compulsory attendance up to sixteen.  I know many of the parents in the country send their children to school until they are sixteen. I know it is more the rule than the exception; but, unfortunately, it is chiefly those who are the children of the poorer element of the community and for whom instruction is more necessary than the children of those in a fortunate position, whose education is neglected at present.  If by the extension of the age to sixteen you will be able to get in those now neglected, I think it will tend to the production of better citizens in the future.  The call of the age is for more education.  From those benches we have pointed to the necessity for better education, and we still shall support the efforts of the Minister to establish, in rural areas, suitable technical schools.  We will support any expenditure in that direction, limited as the resources of farming are at present.  We know it is essential, and possibly improvements will be made which will make it unnecessary for the inhabitants of rural areas to expend forty to sixty pounds on each child in order to send him up to the secondary schools in Dublin.  If you provide us with this secondary education in the country we will support and help you.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to say that, although I do not differ from my colleague, Deputy Wilson, in the ideals to be aimed at, I differ from him with regard to the practicability of enforcing such a law if it were passed.  I think it is one thing to be idealistic and it is another thing to take cognisance of the actual financial conditions of the country.  My view is, that we should start off with the minimum of compulsion in every direction, and as we gain experience in time in the working of the Act, and see the advantages we are to gain by the Act, then there is nothing to prevent our expanding if the necessities of the case require it.</P>
      <P>As I read this amendment it means that in effect all children, unless they have been granted a certificate of proficiency and have also been apprenticed to some trade, are forced to attend school.  This means in effect that the children of the farmers, who would not be apprenticed in the ordinary course of events, who would be employed at home on the farm, or if they happened to be workers' children they might be employed as paid workers on the farm, would not come within this category and would be obliged to attend school. I maintain that is not an economic proposition. Parents in this country would be unable, in most cases, to keep their children at school beyond the age of fourteen.</P>

      <P>The amendment is quite clear, but the Deputy is under a misapprehension.  If the boy is employed he would be required to attend a course of instruction.  It may be a series of lectures by a departmental instructor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard that as practically the same as attending school.  If the course of instruction were not available there would then be no option but to attend the ordinary school.  We heard arguments yesterday from Deputy O'Connell and statements regarding school attendance in other countries, with particular reference, I think, to Ontario.  I have gone to the trouble to look up the school attendance ages in many other countries outside the continent of America. I find in a great many cases the leaving age is fourteen.  In some cases it <Col N="514" /> is thirteen, and in a good many other cases the compulsory commencing age is seven.  If we are to regard this matter in its proper perspective we ought not to pick out special cases, but consider the problem as a whole and deal with a good many of the places affected.  I found that in Columbia the limits of age were seven and fourteen; in the province of Manitoba they were seven and fifteen; in New Brunswick they were seven and twelve; in Nova Scotia they were seven and fourteen; in Prince Edward Island they were seven and thirteen, and in Saskatchewan they were seven and fourteen. Most of the ages I have quoted are within the limits I have suggested in my amendment of seven and fourteen.</P>
      <P>I maintain, in dealing with an agricultural country as this is, it is not extravagant to ask that the age be confined within seven and fourteen. When we take European countries, we find in Austria the limits are six and fourteen, and in Bulgaria seven and thirteen.  In Denmark&mdash;the country we are told to look up to and to emulate in our agricultural, co-operative and educational methods&mdash;we find the limits of age are seven and fourteen. In Denmark the Danish farmers have been able to attain to the great heights of agricultural prosperity to which we are told they have attained, despite the age limit of seven to fourteen. Then you have in Finland seven and thirteen.  In France you have six and thirteen.  In Germany it varies according to the provinces, but in Bavaria you have six to thirteen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I can read out a list of places showing that the compulsory ages do not exceed thirteen, and in some places fourteen.  There are circumstances in which children would have to attend school compulsorily up to sixteen.  If they did not attend compulsorily they would have to attend continuation or other classes of that <Col N="515" /> type, or in the alternative be apprenticed to some employment or trade. Those who are not in a position to attend those classes or who are not apprenticed to an employment or trade, will be by compulsion forced to attend an ordinary school up to sixteen years of age.  I think we are trying to advance too quickly, and I ask the Dáil not to support this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a wrong conception in the Dáil with regard to this amendment.  I think that that has been made quite obvious in the speech we have just listened to. May I read the amendment again?  It says:&mdash;&ldquo;To delete all words after the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; at the end of line 2. and substitute the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;who is not more than 16 years of age&rdquo; and to add at the end of the section a sub-section as follow:&mdash;(2) A child who has attained the age of fourteen years and has attained the sixth standard shall not on producing satisfactory evidence of having obtained suitable employment be called upon to attend the Primary school while so employed.  Where satisfactory evidence of employment is not forthcoming the pupil shall when the Minister so directs be required to attend either a primary school, a continuation school or a technical school up to the age of sixteen years.&rdquo;  That, in essence, means that attendance at a primary school is compulsory until a certain standard of education is attained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>If that standard has not been attained at the age of 14, it has to be attained, and a certificate to that effect has to be got before a boy or girl leaves a primary school.  I think every Deputy will agree with that.  If a standard is fixed it will be the object of every boy and girl to achieve it at the earliest possible moment.  If no standard is fixed, there is no object in view.  I think that in education, as in everything else, an object, or policy, is an essential factor to success.  Having so far tried to make the amendment clear, let me further point out that <Col N="516" /> the fixing of the age provides, to my mind, one of the most important matters that we have discussed in this Dáil.  On it depends the standard of education.  On our standard of education depends the efficiency of our young people, and on the efficiency of our young people the whole prosperity of the State is dependent.  The Minister for Finance may tell us that the prosperity of the State depends upon tariffs.  On the other hand, Deputy Johnson may tell us that the prosperity of the State depends upon the payment of high wages.  I am satisfied that neither of these policies will bring prosperity.  Prosperity can only be obtained by high efficiency, based on a high standard of education possessed by our workpeople.  Further, on high efficiency depends low costs of production which are the most essential factors to-day.  As I pointed out yesterday and on previous occasions, our country has to compete in the keenest markets in the world, and its success depends upon its ability to beat all comers in those markets.  As I said, efficiency is the basis of low costs of production, and I am satisfied that if our country, and those who are engaged in agriculture, are to hold their position in those markets, they can only do so in one way, and that is through a higher standard of education and through a higher efficiency consequent on that standard of education. There is no use in telling us that it can be done this way or the other way. I am satisfied from my experience in industry&mdash;the same is true of agriculture&mdash;that you cannot compete against other countries which possess a higher standard of efficiency amongst their workpeople.  The only way you can compete successfully is to try to attain to the same, if not to a higher standard than that possessed by those against whom you have to compete.  I would like to hear the views of Deputies on the Farmers' Benches on that particular statement.</P>

I am satisfied that the falling-off in our export trade is attributable to the causes I have mentioned.</P>

America is an outstanding example of efficiency based on education.</P>

      <P>What is the position in regard to our own city in relation to this amendment.  A report of a conference which was held in Dublin in 1917 states amongst other things:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;No doubt was left in the mind of any member attending the conference that the great question to be solved before technical education could accomplish its work was to secure that the student received a more thorough primary education. Employers and technical education authorities were unanimous in stating that 75 per cent. of the lads entering industrial life were unable to pass the simple qualifying examination necessary to enter technical schools.  Employers testified that skilled tradesmen were often unfit to be sent to work in the country because of their inability to keep the <Col N="518" /> simplest accounts or to write legible letters clearly expressing their business, not to mention shortcomings in other directions essential to their efficiency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, that the efficiency was retarded by the low standard of primary education which they had.  That was in 1917.  I am glad to be able to read that report, because it shows the state of things that existed before this Government came into existence.  I do not blame our Government for the backward state of education to-day. What is the position to-day in our city, having this amendment in view?  Over 6,000 boys and girls leave our primary schools every year about the age of fourteen.  Of those, some 6,000 register for employment at the labour exchanges. The labour exchanges are only able to find employment for something less that 1,000.  Let us assume that another 2,000 find employment by other means.  It is a fairly optimistic estimate to take, when the labour exchanges can only find employment for 1,000.  Taking that optimistic estimate, what does it mean?  That 3,000 boys and girls are set free in our city every year for whom there is no employment, with the result that we hear complaint after complaint from parents about these boys and girls getting into bad company and acquiring bad habits with disastrous results.</P>
    <P>What will this amendment do for those boys and girls?  For those in employment, it will mean that the Minister will decide upon what classes or what further course it is desirable that they should follow up to the age of 16. For those who are not in employment, the Minister will also settle what hours of attendance they shall follow up to the age of 16.  I have only given the figures for Dublin.  Deputies can get the figures for their own areas and apply exactly the same argument.  With regard to Dublin I would ask: is it a desirable thing that those boys and girls, upon whom the future of the country depends, should have their education continued during those important years between the ages of fourteen and sixteen, or should they be set free to go to picture houses, to get into bad company, to give trouble to their <Col N="519" /> parents, and to make wretched citizens?  To my mind, this is one of the most important matters in connection with education.</P>
    <P>There is only one other remark that I should like to make in connection with this amendment.  The Minister for Finance yesterday drew our attention to the large expenditure that will accrue if the proposals in the amendments to this Bill were carried out.  He mentioned a large sum; I suppose he has some basis for that, but he has not given us that basis, and I should like to see it.  Deputy Baxter yesterday told us that a higher standard of education is necessary and desirable, but that we cannot afford it.  I have tried to point out, as one who has some experience of business, that depression in industry is largely brought about by the low standard of education.  If that depression continues, are we likely to be in any better position to afford the expenditure that is necessary to reach that state of efficiency, which Deputy Baxter says is desirable, in a few years when trade is in a very much worse position than it is to-day?  Deputy Baxter says it is desirable to reach that efficiency, but that the country cannot afford it.  Are we likely to be in a better position to afford it five years hence, when the trade of the country is further depleted, and we have possibly lost the market on which our basic industry is dependent?  These are factors that must be considered.</P>
    <P>No Deputy is more convinced than I am that rigid economy is necessary for the welfare of the country.  There are things to which economy can be applied usefully and successfully.  On the other hand, there are things to which economy must be applied with the greatest care, and education is one of these.  We must avoid waste in education; we must see that we are getting value for the money expended on it: but a campaign of economy with regard to education will not have my support.</P>
    <P>We have been told about what has been done in the United States of America. One outstanding factor in connection with the prosperity of the United States is that the State that spends most on education is the most <Col N="520" /> successful.  I am satisfied that if this country is to be successful in future a considerable expenditure will be necessary on education.  I ask Deputies, if they are satisfied that that expenditure is necessary and desirable in the interests of the industrial development of the country, not to hesitate to embark on it, in order to put the country in that state of efficiency in which it will be able to compete successfully with all-comers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken attributed all the evils that exist in the country to want of education.  He alluded to our export trade.  It comes as a surprise to me to be told that the falling off in exports is due to want of education.  I would rather say that it is due to the conditions which farmers have to meet, such as high freights and unsatisfactory service from the systems of which educated men like Deputy Good are at the head.  It appears to be the fashion now-a-days for Deputies to decry their own country in every respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>And to point by way of contrast to what has been done in other countries.  I suppose Deputy Good will be surprised to hear that it was stated not very long ago in an American periodical of high standing that the greatest percentage of illiterates in any Expeditionary Army in the Great War came from the United States.  We are also taxed with lack of efficiency.  A few months ago I saw agricultural work being carried on in Belgium that no Irish farmer would stand over.  He would not stand over it in this sense, that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture would put such a farm up for sale.  I think we should abandon the idea of decrying everything Irish and booming everything done in foreign countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good also asked for an expression of opinion on education from the Farmers' Benches.  I think I am expressing their views when I say that they are in favour of an improved and extended system of education.  They have never stood in the way of that <Col N="521" /> desire.  But I deny that an improved system of education is going to make us rich quickly.  It may tend in that direction after some years, but we cannot expect great results at once.  I have great sympathy with Deputy O'Connell's amendment, inasmuch as it seems to be a step in the direction of continuation courses.  I take it that it is not ordinary school subjects, or the three R's that are going to be taught to boys and girls from 14 to 16 years.  Would it be possible to link up the system of technical education at present existing with the education given in the primary schools?  We have a system of technical education that is costing a good deal of money. I believe that the teachers are very competent in their particular subjects, but I am sorry to say there is not a very good response on the part of the people for whom the instruction is intended. As far as my experience goes, the attendance at these classes is poor. I have heard several complaints about the difficulty of securing proper attendance. If it were possible to link up that system of education in which rural science, as affecting agriculture, is included as well as domestic economy, which would be suitable for girls, with primary education, I think it would be a change that would be welcomed throughout the country.  There is a slight diversity of views regarding the amendment, but for my part, I intend to vote for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. COLE Mr. COLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment, but I am afraid Deputy Good has taken the cream of my arguments.  However, I would have felt more nervous if Deputy Conlan had not spoken before me.  Deputy Conlan seems to think that any criticism which we may offer is towards decrying everything Irish.  That is not a fact. We do not want to decry anything Irish but rather to stimulate it.  At the present time it may be a difficult matter for farmers to carry on without the assistance of their children.  On the other hand, too many of their children are used in a kind of white slavery at the present time.  Their children are often expected to do work which the farm labourers would not do, and even <Col N="522" /> if the farm labourers did consent to do it, the Labourers' Union would come in and say, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  At the age of fourteen our children do more beneficial work at school than probably they do there for a couple of years previous. It is in their latter school-days that a decision is taken as to what mode of life the children will follow.  If the dreams which we have of higher education for the farmer and the agricultural community in general are really genuine, is it not in these latter years that we should try to assist the children?  I intend to deal with this case of the farming class generally, as I would with any other calling.  People in urban centres can generally follow up their earlier education in technical schools, but when the farmers' sons and the farmers' daughters leave school, more particularly the daughters, it is almost impossible for them to get any further education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fear that the country has not yet realised how much depends on agriculture. Perhaps this is because in the past we have been linked up so much with a partner under whom so many industries of different kinds were carried on.  Now, if we have really grasped the fact that this country depends for eighty-five per cent. of its income upon agriculture I think it is about time that we should try to appreciate the value of the agricultural industry. It is about time that we looked upon our agricultural calling, which is such a prime necessity, in much the same way as the medical or any other profession is looked upon. It is time, I think, that we got rid of the idea that farmers are only out for toil and labour; because not only have they to work nine hours a day, but the great majority of them are engaged in labour for fourteen and sixteen hours a day, and this on Sundays as well as on week-days.  I say, therefore, let us try and fill the rising generation with brighter hopes as regards the agricultural calling.  Let us give it, what it has not had in the past, a scientific and college standing.  Then, and not till then, shall we be able to cope with our young people who fight shy of what should be made honourable work, and who at present seem only too anxious <Col N="523" /> to emigrate to do menial work in foreign countries.  It is only by raising the standard of education that we can accomplish all that.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EDUCATION (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, perhaps, I might point out what exactly is the difference between the mover of the amendment and myself, and between those who support the amendment and those who oppose it.  We are not at all divided on the advisability, where it is practicable, of compelling people to attend school up to the age of sixteen.  That is not the question. Deputies who have read the amendment which I had circulated last evening, and which I propose moving at a later stage of this Bill, will see that we are quite alive, so far as it is humanly practicable, to the necessity of raising the compulsory age from fourteen to sixteen.  That is not the question.  It is not the question whether such a state of things is desirable, because we are as anxious as any other party in the House to see that carried out.  It is not the question as to what you should aim at.  The aim we have before us is quite definitely in favour of raising, wherever possible, the age to sixteen.  That aim is as clearly before us as it is before those who have spoken in favour of this particular amendment.  The whole matter is really a question of method.  What is the best way of attaining the end that is common to our party, to the Labour Party, to the Independents and to Deputies who sit on the Farmers' Benches?  We all have that particular aim before us, as far as I can judge from the speeches that have been made up to the present.  The only point we differ on is as to the best method of realising our aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very glad to hear from the various expressions of opinion that have come forth from the different parts of the House that there will be no objection to increased expenditure in education in the future.  I hope that does not mean, as very often happens in this House, that on each particular vote Deputies will get up and support a demand for increased expenditure, and that only when the question of <Col N="524" /> providing the increased expenditure comes on that the criticisms will begin to be heard.  There is a general tendency, I presume every Deputy is familiar with it, of moving for increased expenditure on every individual vote, and then to move for a reduction on the total.  I hope that will not be adopted and will not be the attitude in the future, especially so far as this particular department is concerned.</P>
    <P>The financial difficulties are not the only ones.  I admit that the financial considerations at the present moment are important, but they are not the only ones that make me prefer the particular amendment I have circulated to the one now before the House.  It is really a question of feasibility; how far an amendment of this kind can be put into operation at present.  I think more damage can be done by passing legislation of this kind which is not meant to operate and which from the very circumstances of the case cannot operate, and then relaxing. Deputy Johnson says he prefers the system of relaxing to tightening up. I am of the opposite point of view. I think if you legislate you ought to enforce the law.  There ought not to be any relaxation.  I would prefer a gradual tightening up to an initial relaxation.  I think if you get into the habit of initial relaxation your whole system is vitiated from the very start. That is really what I feel in connection with this particular amendment: if you pass it you are really not legislating with full responsibility, but you are making a gesture.  That is the difficulty, and I do not think it is the business of legislation to make gestures. It is the business of legislation to enact provisions that are meant to be enforced, and that is why I much prefer&mdash; I am not accepting this amendment&mdash; the particular form of amendment that I circulated last evening.  The amendment which was circulated last evening is the method that I prefer to reach the same end.  The difficulties that we would have immediately to contend with, if the amendment on the Paper were passed, are too great to allow us to think of even accepting it at present. Deputy Good has spoken of the backward state of the whole system of <Col N="525" /> education.  That is precisely it.  We have not that system of post-primary education, of continuation classes and so on and of technical education that this amendment contemplates, if this amendment is to be a reality.  I admit there are financial difficulties, but what I have just mentioned now is really one of the principal difficulties.  On examining the situation as a whole, we have felt bound to oppose this particular amendment.  In the amendment circulated last evening we suggest a method by which we intend to attain the same end.</P>
    <P>There are tremendous difficulties, and so serious is the situation we are only able to give a rough estimate of what these difficulties are likely to be. There are economic difficulties.  I am not now referring to the question of the amount of money which it will cost; I am referring to the difficulty, I may say almost the impossibility, of enforcing the ages of fourteen to sixteen in many parts of the country.  It may or it may not be desirable that parents, and especially poorer parents with large families, should wish to get something from the employment of their children between certain ages. That may or may not be desirable, but in the economic situation in certain large districts in Ireland I think it is a fact that we will have to recognise. You cannot ignore it.  To do so and to try and enforce a provision such as is now proposed would be, it seems to me, to court disaster from the start.  We will have great difficulty, I am convinced, in enforcing the age even up to fourteen at the initial stages.  These things will have to come, but an effort will be made, and no effort will be spared to see that the age of fourteen is observed.  But, as a Deputy pointed out in the course of the debate yesterday, the most difficult ages, apparently, to secure attendance at school are not between six and seven, but between eleven and fourteen.  We shall have great difficulty in enforcing that, especially in the country districts. I feel certain of that.  But our difficulties would be tenfold increased, and I think there would be grave injustice imposed upon the agricultural community, especially the poorer parts of Ireland, if an attempt of that kind <Col N="526" /> were made.  It would be a premature attempt, unless we know definitely where we were.  In fact it is only gradually we can go forward.  But supposing this amendment is rejected, and the amendment I propose is accepted, we can only go on gradually enforcing the extension of the age limit from fourteen upwards, but to do so a thorough inquiry on our part will be necessary to see how far it can be imposed in each particular district.  It will probably be more easy to impose it in the towns, for instance, than in the country districts.  We cannot expect, taking the situation as it is, with what I might call the educational preparation of the last generation, for this Bill, being such as it is, uniformity all over the country in this particular matter. That is the reason why, in the proposed amendment&mdash;that is, in the proposed new Section 23&mdash;such wide powers are asked for in that particular matter, so that where the situation is ripe for it the necessary extension will take place.</P>
    <P>There are other difficulties.  Where are we, if we carry through a system of this kind?  We will have difficulty, and great difficulty, in getting the increased number of teachers even for the compulsory attendance legislation we are now proposing.  We probably will, in the course of a few years, require in addition to the ordinary number of teachers, to replace those who automatically go out, anything up to 1,000 as an extreme limit, but it will certainly be more than 500, and I do not think the suggestion made by Deputy O'Connell about the amalgamation of the smaller schools, if that were practicable, would meet the situation.  It will go portion of the way to meet that situation, but not entirely.  We will be already faced with the grave difficulty of finding the necessary number of teachers to deal with the compulsion Act even limited to the ages between six at the one end, and the higher limit of 14 at the other.</P>
    <P>Then there is the financial case.  I am not stressing it now.  Our estimate is that it would cost to enforce the Act up to the age of 14, at the beginning, and initially, in or about £120,000 a year, and afterwards we may put it at about £200,000 a year.  These figures, if they err at all, probably err on the low side.  They were figures not intended <Col N="527" /> for this House, but figures intended to be put up to the Department of Finance.  We do not generally exaggerate the cost when putting things up to the Department of Finance.  They are generally the lowest figures, but, of course, I do not say that they are not the correct figures, but we certainly do not exaggerate.  Then we calculate that if we were to extend the limit from 14 to 16 years of age, the cost initially would mean an additional £110,000 or £120,000, and might go up to £150,000.</P>

      <P>It certainly would not come into this financial year, because before the end of it the Bill will hardly be passed, and it certainly will not be in operation.

      <P>I think that, taking the whole educational situation, the economic condition&mdash;and I want to make it quite clear that I am not referring to the necessity of the finances for the Bill&mdash;taking the economic condition of the country and the educational preparation, it would be unwise that we should get into the loose habit of having an Act and not enforcing it.  I think, so far as the real situation is concerned, the real purpose we all have before us is much more likely to be achieved, and achieved more effectively, by the amendment standing in my name than in the amendment we are now discussing. There is nothing to be gained by pretending that we are in a position to carry out measures that we are not in a position to carry out, and I feel that if we were to pass this amendment that is the attitude we in the Dáil would be taking up.  It would be a mere gesture, and however much might be said in favour of gestures of that kind and the moral effect they are likely to have on the country, I do not think that we should legislate merely to have fine gestures.  The amendment that stands in my name meets the whole situation of the case in a much less objectionable way than the amendment we have now before us.</P>

      <P>When the Dáil gave a Second Reading to this Bill it definitely declared itself on the side of civilisation.  I know that there are people in the world, a small, dwindling faction perhaps, who object to education and who decry civilisation.  Even in this country we have had a number of such cranks.  But still I contend that sensible and progressive persons who want to proceed in the march of civilisation are in the ascendant, and are resolved to see that these cranks will not have their way.  If we are resolved upon having education at all, does it not seem the logical and proper thing to see that within our resources&mdash; and I quite admit that resources are a paramount consideration&mdash;we must have the fullest and most complete system of education that it is possible to obtain?  I am wondering why the Government did not incorporate this <Col N="529" /> amendment circulated in the White Paper yesterday in the Bill when it went to the printers.  The Minister's explanation is scarcely satisfactory.  He says that it is a question of ways and means, a question of feasibility.  But I am really indifferent as to whether the object that I want to achieve is secured either by the amendment on the White Paper or by that of Deputy O'Connell. I, at least, want to support the underlying principle.</P>
      <P>I have always maintained, and still maintain, that we have a very poor standard of primary education, and that it is essential, not alone for progress but even for the maintenance of our present condition, that that standard should be raised and raised speedily.  We have a definite social system especially with regard to the ownership of land, that is, peasant proprietorship. What does that mean?  It means that instead of having big estates under unity of control and direction, we have the land broken up into a number of autonomous parts, and if there is an uneducated people possessed of these parts, in possession of certain rights and enjoying certain privileges, what is the position?  You must either have a Government on the one hand acting as a sort of semi-military organisation, enforcing obedience in trade and business matters if you leave your people in complete ignorance, or it must be your aim to awaken the intelligence of these people and to make them move forward on business and scientific lines for the development and the cultivation of their holdings. Knowing what the position is to-day, more education is essential for the people in many parts of the country. The people know nothing about the constituents of the soil, they have only a very rudimentary and superficial knowledge of its potentialities and capabilities, of how they can increase its yield in an economical manner and thereby retain their place in the markets of the world.  That is, to me, the supreme consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the age of fourteen is normally far too low for leaving school.  I quite admit that there are conditions and circumstances&mdash;economic distress, for instance&mdash;which may <Col N="530" /> compel the withdrawal of a child from school at fourteen, but I think it must be of universal application to the country that these children should get a post-elementary course, a system of night schools must be established, and we must establish these post-elementary courses in every hamlet.  The Minister said that the greatest difficulty in enforcing compulsory attendance would be in rural areas.  I question that.  I submit that small towns and villages will be the worst, and that ninety per cent. of the activities of the Guards will have to be exercised in these towns and villages. Take the case of the town of Ennis.  I am prepared to say that the children in the slums there&mdash;and I suppose we have almost the worst slums in the country in Ennis&mdash;are three-fourths of their time from school.  I have met several teachers who always complain of the bad attendance in the towns. There is a reasonable amount of attendance in the rural areas, but the villages are hopeless, and it is in these places that the Minister will have to exercise and put in force the powers that are to be conferred on him by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I quite admit the force of his argument that it is difficult to achieve this desideratum at the moment.  But is it not essential that steps be taken so as to secure the supply of teachers that would be necessary?  I look forward to a situation wherein we will have established in the latter years of the school-going age something approximating to technical education.  I am indifferent as to whether you make the ages between fourteen and sixteen for post-primary schools, or whether you make attendance at a national school or day-school obligatory up to the age of sixteen. But it is essential, I say, that these courses must be inaugurated, and the money must be found from some source or other.  If we are to achieve anything it will be through education but what kind of education?  I visualise an education that will provide an incentive to work, to progress, and to well-being.  I am certain that the system that we have at the moment has unfortunately turned out&mdash;and I regret to make this statement&mdash;perhaps <Col N="531" /> the most ignorant democracy in Europe.  On the question of money, I submit that we have to take the long view.  No one in the House or in the country is more insistent than I am on the need for economy, but still, with Deputy Good, I believe that to stint and starve education is false economy, that it is doing a great injustice to the present generation and that it is ruinous and destructive of any hope for the forthcoming generation.</P>
    <P>We are hard pushed, as Deputy Good put it, to retain our hold on our markets.  You know how badly off agriculture is, and I see the one hope of agriculture in scientific training, to have the young men disciplined and brought firmly and resolutely to the task of having to give work, not alone work, but skilled work, and not alone skilled work, but work that is directed by a superior intelligence.  These must be our considerations.  I am indifferent as to whether we gain this end by Deputy O'Connell's amendment or by the amendment of the Minister, but it is essential, I believe, if we are not to fall out of the pale of civilisation altogether, that the whole system of education and all the ideas underlying it must be revised and re-organised, and if Deputy O'Connell forces his amendment to a division I cannot see how any Deputy can refuse to support it.</P>

      <P>The Minister went so far in stressing the difficulties which he foresaw, as the result of his short experience in the Department of Education, in putting my amendment into practice, that we were inclined towards the end of his speech to forget what he said at the beginning, namely, that he was strongly in favour of the principle underlying the amendment.  I just want to remind Deputies of that again lest, as I say, the manner in which he stressed the difficulty might cause them to forget that he was in favour of the principle.  I am very pleased with the general expression of opinion in regard to this amendment and this proposal to raise the school-leaving age to 16.  Yesterday, in submitting this amendment, I made a special appeal to the representatives of <Col N="532" /> agriculture because I felt it was those who were concerned in that industry who would benefit most by an extension of the school-leaving age.  I am very pleased indeed to have this expression of opinion in favour of the amendment from the Farmers' benches.  Of course, I did not expect support from Deputy Heffernan.  Deputy Heffernan is clearly against the Bill altogether, or I should say&mdash;he protested yesterday when the Minister said he was against the Bill&mdash; he is in favour of the Bill with all those amendments in it that he is proposing. I take it that is his position.  In that way he reminds one of the atheist who said he was in favour of the Ten Commandments, with, he said, of course, a few little amendments.  Asked what the few amendments were that he desired to have in the Ten Commandments, he said that he wished to remove the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; wherever it appeared. That seems to be Deputy Heffernan's attitude on this Bill.</P>
      <P>There was a line taken up by most of the speakers that I would like to say a word on.  It was stressed specially by Deputy Good&mdash;that it was the material prosperity of the country we should have in mind in considering an improvement in our education system. That is very good and all very fine, but I think there is something more to be said.  I think there is another side to be stressed.  I think that, apart from the question of material prosperity and material success, the advantage is generally on the side of the person possessing the best education, although we may have, as Deputy Baxter says, some educated &ldquo;good-for-nothings.&rdquo; But education in itself should be something worth striving for from the spiritual side.  Education opens up for the individual wide fields, and I cannot conceive any man, whether he is engaged on a farm, in a factory or in an office, who is not a better citizen because of an extended education; and from that fact alone, apart altogether from the question of material prosperity, which it is bound to bring in its wake, I think the idea should be supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to an amendment which he circulated here yesterday. <Col N="533" /> I did foresee that there would be certain difficulties in putting this into operation immediately, and in drafting the amendment, I thought I had made it as easy as possible to put it into operation, as I left a certain discretion with the Minister in the matter.  However, I quite realise that conditions very in various parts of the country.  In some places I believe it would be quite feasible to put this provision into operation almost immediately, and in some other districts it might take a very considerable time.  I think the Minister especially exaggerated the difficulties with regard to providing staffs in the matter of the ordinary school-going age up to fourteen.  We know that there are practically 4,000 two-teacher schools, and in many of these schools, as the Minister will find out if he makes inquiries, the second teacher is barely kept on.  The average attendance at these schools is scarcely sufficient to maintain the assistant.  In these schools what will happen will be that the average attendance will increase by 10, 15, or 20.  That is putting it at a liberal figure for these 4,000 schools all over the rural districts. There will be comparatively few places where the putting of the Bill into operation will mean the employment of an extra teacher.  It will not at all reach in any case the figure mentioned by the Minister.</P>
    <P>As I say, the putting into operation of my amendment all over the country might have certain difficulties and it might be necessary for the Department to make a more thorough examination of the situation, but if I am to understand, as I believe I am, from the Minister, that he is prepared to move this amendment, and if I am further to understand that there will be general agreement so far as the acceptance of the Minister's amendment is concerned, I am prepared to reconsider my position with regard to my amendment. The idea I had in putting down my amendment has been achieved.  The Government came along with a Bill in which the upper age is 14.  That was clearly unsatisfactory, and there was a strong expression of opinion from many Deputies, on the occasion of the <Col N="534" /> Second Reading, that the age was too low.  Deputy Connor Hogan wanted to know why they did not incorporate the amendment in the Bill at first. That will be for themselves to answer, but I would say that their reason for bringing forward this amendment now is because they felt that the amendment on the Paper would be carried.  There was a general call from all parts of the House for the raising of the school age, and if the Minister in his wisdom thinks this is a much more advisable way to adopt at the moment, in order to get over administrative difficulties, as there is no difference between us on the question of principle, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment.</P>
    <P>I would like, however, to get a personal guarantee from the Minister that, as far as he is concerned, he will do everything it is possible for him to do, to make the necessary examination into the conditions and to put this into operation where he thinks it could be put into operation, and to such extent as he thinks it could be put into operation, because there is always this danger, that the Minister takes power to do a certain thing, and then, when he proceeds to put that into operation, from one Government Department or another&mdash;possibly from the Finance Department or in some other way&mdash; there may be certain difficulties placed in his way, and the easy way to get out of it is to say: &ldquo;We will let the thing slip.&rdquo;  That has been done in other ways where Ministers took powers such as these, and various things cropped up which prevented them putting them into operation. We know we cannot foretell what will happen in the future, but I would like the Minister to give us some assurance &mdash;assuming this amendment is put into the Bill&mdash;that he will leave nothing undone and that the necessary steps will be taken to put this into operation.  On that understanding I will be prepared to withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell, speaking last night, made one remark which intimated that he did not intend the discussion on this Bill to be from the party point of view. I think that the very admirable case he <Col N="535" /> made for his amendment and the support he got from various parts of the Dáil&mdash;possibly parts from which he did not expect to get support&mdash;have amply proved, if proof were necessary, that he certainly had not approached this in any party spirit whatsoever.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I refuse to be driven into the position of being against education.  It is one thing being against education.  It is another thing being against extreme compulsion in education.  I have preached over and over again the doctrine that I believe the future of agriculture in Ireland must depend, to a great extent, upon our educational system, but I am a firm believe in trying to inculcate a spirit and desire for education.  I do not believe that any amount of compulsion will produce an educated race, unless you get the spirit and the desire to achieve real education.  We all know that in the realms of education Scotland may be said, perhaps, to have led Europe for many years.  At the time when Scotchmen were going to the Universities with their sacks of meal and a few bawbees, they were not going there because they were compelled to go.  They were going there because the desire for education existed.  The desire to advance themselves and to advance their race existed amongst the people.  Until we can get that spirit in our people I maintain that no form of compulsion will produce the educational results which we are aiming at.  It seems to me, listening to a number of the speeches made here, that we are placing ourselves in the position of sitting down to make legislation and ignoring, to a certain extent, the conditions that exist throughout the country. We seem to think that by passing legislation and arranging for money that the money is to be found.  While I do not stand against the expenditure of money on education, provided it is wisely expended.  I am not in agreement with the ideal which appears to <Col N="536" /> prevail that dear education is necessarily good education, and that the expenditure of money on education is bound to produce results.  With one statement of the Minister for Education I am in strong accord, and that is that we should not pass legislation which we do not intend to enforce.  In my opinion, that is a danger which a new State of this kind runs.  It is a serious danger passing legislation which in actual practice will not be enforced. That is a thing that is done in many of the smaller States throughout the world, where we find all kinds of extravagant legislation with regard to school attendance, working hours, and conditions of labour passed, and where these laws are never enforced.</P>
      <P>I want to see, as the Minister for Education does, that when we pass laws these laws are carried out to the letter and that they do not remain simply as gestures on our Statute Books as to what we desire to have carried out.  Apart from the question of finding the money, there are the economic conditions which exist in the country.  If we pass legislation here, without regard to those economic conditions, we are doing something which we are not authorised to do by the people who sent us here.  We must recognise that if we either establish by this Bill a general compulsory school-leaving age of sixteen, or if we give power to the Minister to establish it where he desires it, the parents and children in those districts will have to keep those children and maintain them until they reach the age of sixteen, and that until the age of sixteen is reached the parents will be unable to gain any advantage from the work of the children either on the farms or outside the farms.  Is the State prepared to take the full implications of that law if it becomes the law?  Is the State prepared, where parents cannot do so, to provide those children with the wherewithal to exist while they continue going to school until they are sixteen years of age?  I say that until the State is prepared to shoulder such a burden they have no right to compel people to send their children to school when these people are unable to maintain the children at school.</P>

      <Col N="537" /> We have had a great many lectures on the desirability of the improvement of agricultural methods, and we have a great many people making individious comparisons between the agricultural methods prevailing in this country and the agricultural methods prevailing in other countries.  I am not prepared to say that there is not great room for improvement in agricultural methods. But if education is to be the foundation of our agricultural developments, and if compulsion is to be the foundation of that education, I will ask Deputy Good why is it that in Denmark the compulsory age is only seven to fourteen, and why is it that we have been told that the educational system in Denmark, particularly in view of the agricultural conditions, is the best educational system in the world?</P>

I do want to see the farmers' sons attending those schools, but I maintain that it is not by compulsion or by dragooning or by Prussianising, as we are trying to do in this country, that that can be done.  We are forcing the people to do everything by law.  I maintain that it is by inculcating the spirit and the desire for education that it can be done.  If we can make the people realise the value of education and foster the desire for education and bring about a realisation that their own future and the future of their country depends upon education, then it will not be necessary to pass extreme compulsory laws for school attendance.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is desirable that the Dáil should be kept informed by the Minister responsible, by means of statements made from time to time in the Dáil and by the publication of relevant documents, as to important developments in international affairs with which the Saorstát is, or may be, concerned either through its membership of the League of Nations or of &ldquo;the community of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion which I have put down is not expected to be controversial.  It is desired that it shall express the views of the Dáil that information regarding relations between the Free State and other countries shall be discussed in the Dáil, and that information in respect of these matters shall be made known to the Deputies, and that Ministers shall be invited occasionally, and as often as circumstances require, to convey to the Dáil such information as it is important that the Dáil should be made acquainted with.  The paper that was circulated two or three days ago gives some indications, at any rate, of the kind of thing that I think is desirable should be placed at our disposal.  When the Free State entered into the League of Nations it entered with the personal pledge of the President that Ireland joined in a solemn covenant to exercise the powers of her sovereign status in promoting the peace, security, happiness and the economic and cultural well-being of the human race.  The <Col N="540" /> exercise of these powers requires at least that the people of this country, apart from the Ministers themselves, should be made acquainted with the method and manner in which those powers are being exercised, and in which the influence of the State is being used, if that influence is being used.</P>
    <P>The entry of this State into the League of Nations&mdash;the exercise of the powers of the State in relation to the League of Nations&mdash;implies that the people of this State, and particularly the Parliament, should have knowledge of the matters which are being discussed by the League of Nations.  It is well known that within the last two years there have been discussed matters of the utmost importance to the world, to the well-being of the human race, and to this country, but we have had very little information in regard to them.  Neither the Dáil nor the people have been supplied with information as to the policy that is being pressed forward, acceded to, or opposed by our Ministers.</P>
    <P>We had discussions on what was known as the Protocol to the Covenant. Beyond the statement made by the Minister in the Dáil, we have had no information except what we could glean from the British Press.  In other countries, even in countries that are component parts of the British Commonwealth, documents have been prepared, published and discussed in their Parliaments.  We have had no information of that type laid before us. Then there was the later Pact resulting in the Locarno Treaty.  Again, we are dependent entirely on what appears in the British Press, copied into the Irish Press.  We have had no information as to the line taken, if any line was taken, by our Ministers in regard to that Pact.  I surmise that there must have been communications between the Governments, communications which involve matters of general public policy with which the Parliament is involved, not merely matters of a private and confidential character.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that the Dáil should know exactly what the position is in regard to those Treaties and obligations <Col N="541" /> that have been entered into on behalf of this country.  Those Treaties were ostensibly Treaties associated more or less with, and dependent upon, the League of Nations.  In so far as they affect the League of Nations, we, as members of that League, are definitely affected, and it is important that we should know what the policy of our Government is in regard to those Treaties and obligations that were entered upon.  There have been obligations other than the obligations implied in the Covenant of the League of Nations.  By the very nature of the Locarno Treaty, there is contemplated some possibility of war, let us say, be tween Britain, France and Germany, in which those countries might be involved. That is a matter which it is important we should have some information upon.  To what extent are we involved?</P>
    <P>It has been made public, again through the Press, not through the House, that the terms of those treaties specifically state that the Irish Free State and other British Dominions, or to be more correct, the Irish Free State and the British Dominions, are not parties to the agreement except by their express consent, but that does not leave us entirely free and unconcerned. I think it is an occasion for the Minister here to raise, with the other countries and the League, or with those countries through the League, a question of the responsibility, or, shall I say, the freedom from responsibility, of any warlike action in the case of a war in which Britain is involved over a Treaty to which we are not parties.  If it is expressly implied in those Locarno Treaties that we are not involved, except through our express consent, there is the implication that those other countries, France, Germany and any other country that might become involved, have no right to consider and must not be allowed to consider that the Irish Free State, merely by virtue of the fact that it is a component part of the British Association of Nations, is to become a party to a war in which Britain is engaged.  I know this raises a question of the utmost importance, and I am not intending this afternoon to press the matter <Col N="542" /> or to discuss it with any fullness.  I think it will be necessary at some opportune time in the future, to raise the whole question, but I am only touching it now in the light of the Locarno Treaty and the implication that has been suggested that we are in no way involved unless we expressly put our signatures to those Treaties.</P>
    <P>Then we had, as I mentioned, the discussion which took place in the last assembly, a summarised report of the proceedings of which has been circulated. Again, this very important question arose, and I congratulate the Minister for Justice in having made clear, or shall I say comparatively clear, the position of the Free State to those assembled at that meeting.  It will have been observed that the representative of the British Government made a statement in regard to proposals for arbitration when disputes possibly involving war arose.  Sir Cecil Hurst, the British Minister, said among other things,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Other States might well be in a position to accept so extreme an obligation as to pledge themselves in all cases to refer their legal disputes to the Court of The Hague, even though they might affect the vital interests of their country, but the British Empire at the present moment was a very composite and peculiar political unit.  It did not consist of one Government alone; it consisted of a partnership of six nations standing on a footing of equality.  In a matter which affected the vital interests not only of Great Britain, but of any one of these six partners, there had to be solidarity of action.  In a matter which affected either the vital interests, the independence or honour of any one of the six nations, there must of necessity be unity of action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister, in response to that, pointed out that Sir Cecil Hurst was not announcing to the Committee the considered attitude of any other Government, or at least was not announcing the considered attitude of all the six Governments towards the principle of compulsory arbitration.  So far as the Government of the Irish Free State was concerned, that was not the decision <Col N="543" /> on this important matter at which the Irish Free State had arrived. It is of very great importance that some demur should be entered against the phraseology of the British representative's statement when he speaks of the British Empire being a very composite and peculiar political unit, consisting of a partnership of six nations standing on a footing of equality, and that there must be solidarity of action in any matter which affects the independence or honour of any one of the six.  When we entered into the League of Nations we entered into obligations as an independent State.  I understand that when the term British Empire is used in the discussion at the Assembly and in all the phraseology of the official documents of that Assembly it refers to Great Britain, her dependencies and Crown colonies, and not to the British Dominions or the Irish Free State.  The representative of the British Government speaks in that statement as though these States, though independent members of the League of Nations, all comprise one political unit for purposes which might involve war. My view is: it is of the utmost importance to our security and to our freedom from liability to attack that the freedom of our citizens should not be involved in a war when the independence or honour of any one of the six nations is in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>I put it to the House that they must consider that if Great Britain or any other of the signatories to the League of Nations Covenant, who are independent members of the League of Nations, followed a policy which led to differences between the League and that country, and that if we were called upon to fulfil our obligations, we might conceivably be obliged to take action of an economic or other kind, according to our obligations, against that country which has flouted the authority of their Covenant with the League. We must not allow this view of what is called the diplomatic unity of the Empire to prevail.  Otherwise, the pretence that we are independent members of the League goes for nothing, and one of the American objections to <Col N="544" /> the League is supported, which says the British Empire has six votes while they would only have one.  If it is assumed that it is a single diplomatic unity and that it has six votes, then there is no future for the League of Nations, and no hope for the possibility of permanent peace, because it will simply mean that this diplomatic unity of six nations is going to have supremacy in any discussions which involve votes.</P>
    <P>There is another matter of smaller account, though of great importance, about which, I think, the House should be informed, apart from what can be picked up from small and unsatisfactory reports in newspapers.  I am referring to the discussions with respect to noxious drugs.  It is known that in that matter the Irish Free State representative, to its credit and to the credit of the representative, acting, no doubt, on instructions from his Minister, took a very strong part in supporting the United States view of the course that should be taken, against what happened to be the British view.  I say that the action of our representative on that matter has been very highly appreciated in the United States.  It was, undoubtedly, the right action, but the Dáil and the country should have been apprised of the position and should have had some official knowledge of the line of action taken by our representative on a matter of moral concern, a matter affecting vast numbers of the world's population, and, undoubtedly, affecting the well-being of the human race in a very important degree.  We ought to have been informed of the line of policy that was taken by our representative on that important matter.  So it is with all other questions in which whether we like it or not, we are concerned, and we are obliged to ask ourselves whether, having entered the League of Nations, we only entered it with a view to possible protection, or whether we have actually, as was promised by the President, entered into a covenant to exercise our powers of sovereign status in promoting the peace, security, happiness, and the economic and cultural well-being of the human race.  Those undertakings imply responsibility, and my plea is that we should be informed <Col N="545" /> of the work that is being done on our behalf, that the people of this country, and particularly the members of the Dáil, should be frequently taken into confidence and be asked to express their views on any line of policy adopted by our Ministers, so that Ministers may thereby be fortified in any action they may think well to take.  Let us understand whether we are taking part in the work of that assembly or simply allowing other people to do the work and to involve us, without protest, in future commitments merely by implication.  I am asking the Dáil to agree to this motion with a view to ensuring that in future we shall be informed very much more fully and more frequently than we have been in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the motion.  The Dáil and the country have been kept completely in the dark for several years as to what policies have been pursued by the Executive Council so far as our external relations are concerned.  On very rare occasions the Minister responsible has consented to inform the Dáil or acquaint the country of what he is doing.  In fact, in a very marked manner, so far as this side of the Government activities is concerned, that particular Department has not justified its existence either to the Dáil or to the country, and a Department which does not justify its existence should be suppressed, as this country cannot afford luxuries of such a kind.  Not only should the House and country be kept acquainted with matters connected with the League or with the Commonwealth of Nations, but there are also many other congresses and conferences of a national character about which we should be informed. Some of these congresses are of great interest to the national life.  Congresses have already taken place on questions such as emigration and matters of that kind in which we were represented and in which.  I presume, a certain line of policy was followed, but we were never informed as to what that line of policy was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson has referred to the Locarno Pact and to our position in that respect.  There is one point which I should like to mention in connection <Col N="546" /> with that Pact, as it seems to affect our position under the Treaty of 1921, I think it is Article 9 of that Pact which states that it imposes no obligations of any kind upon us until we adhere to it.  But under Article 7 of the Treaty between Ireland and Great Britain we find that:</P>
    <P>The Government of the Irish Free State shall afford to his Majesty's Imperial Forces.  ...(b)  In time of war or of strained relations with a foreign Power such harbour and other facilities as the British Government may require for the purposes of such defence as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>Supposing, as Deputy Johnson has supposed, that Great Britain was involved in strained relations or in a state of war as a result of the Locarno Pact, is it the opinion of the Executive Council that we would be obliged to give those harbour and other facilities under Article 7 of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, in spite of the fact that Article 9 of the Locarno Pact states that it imposes no obligations of any kind upon us?  That is a point on which we would like to know the opinion of the Government, as to whether they consider the Locarno Pact supersedes the Anglo-Irish Treaty, or whether the Anglo-Irish Treaty, although it came previously, is superior to the provision of the Locarno Pact.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters which arise of great importance and interest to the country, and, apparently, the Minister concerned does not consider that the Dáil deserves any information on them, or is in any way interested in them.  The numerous Conventions which have been signed&mdash;some of them signed on our behalf&mdash;at the League of Nations, which have never been brought to our notice, affect many questions which have a very vital and actual interest to large numbers of people in this country.  For instance, there is the Convention which was signed on our behalf, and which has never been ratified, for the suppression of obscene publications.  That was signed in 1923. and I do not know why it has not been ratified.  The Dáil has never been informed as to what the policy of the Government is in that respect.  I do not know whether the ratification of that agreement would <Col N="547" /> involve any change in existing legislation as regards the suppression of obscene publications.  There are also various interesting points in that Convention, in Article 3, I think, dealing with the actual means whereby we could assist in the suppression of this traffic.  There is an obligation resting upon the Government to appoint some central authority in this country for the purpose of dealing with the suppression of obscene publications. There has been a great outcry, to which great prominence has been given in the Press, from many sections of the community protesting against the growing influx of obscene publications into this country, and the Minister for Justice said he could not legislate ahead of public opinion.  Why is it that this Convention, which was signed on our behalf nearly three years ago, has not yet been ratified?</P>
    <P>All these are matters of interest to the Dáil and the country, and are matters on which we should be consulted, but apparently it is the policy of the Department responsible that we should be kept completely in the dark and that no justification of any kind should be given why this Department should be kept in existence. That is already having its effect in different parts of the country, and different sections of the Press are demanding the suppression of this Department, on the ground that it has not justified its existence either to the Dáil or to the country.  I think that the motion of Deputy Johnson is very reasonable, and it is a pity it was not passed several years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Johnson has rendered valuable service in bringing forward this matter. It is of more than exceptional importance.  Deputy Esmonde professed to support him, and in doing so he made one criticism on the Department of External Affairs which, before I go further, I desire to comment upon.  He said that the Department has not justified its existence, and that a Department which does not justify its existence ought to be suppressed. The Department may not have fully justified its existence in one special <Col N="548" /> sense, but I contend that to exist at all is to justify its existence, and that it would be altogether a fatal blunder on our part to propose, or give countenance in the smallest measure to a proposal, to abolish this Department. It is rather a significant fact that all the quarters from which demands for the extinction of this Department proceed are precisely the quarters from which the agitation emanates against the Irish language and against every effort that we are making to make the Irish people Irish.  I think it is a sinister coincidence, even if it were only a coincidence.  I am rather surprised to find Deputy Esmonde, even by inadvertence, joining in that cry.</P>
      <P>It does appear from Deputy Johnson's criticism that this Department has been doing good by stealth.  I wonder does it blush to find it fame. I might quote from &ldquo;Twelfth Night&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Wherefore are these things hid?&rdquo; It would undoubtedly have been not merely better in the sense of a fuller recognition of responsibility to the Dáil, but in the popular phrase would have been &ldquo;better business&rdquo; on the part of the Department to have reported its activities, more particularly those which have met with the unanimous and unqualified approval of other States.</P>
      <P>It is well that the people of this State should recognise that very peculiar position, constitutionally, in which it stands, and what that peculiar position involves, or may involve, for it. Deputy Johnson has drawn the attention of the public to this consideration in a way that may be called a vivid way.  The British Minister, speaking of the proposed acceptance of arbitration, declared, as Deputy Johnson quoted, that the British Empire is a very composite political unit.  Undoubtedly that statement is exact, and yet its very exactness contains an error which will be likely to blind the representatives of other States who heard it, and who are not so familiar with the intricate details of our relation to the other constituents of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;British Empire&rdquo; is a very unfortunate term, and it is all the more awkward for us when that unfortunate <Col N="549" /> term occurs in the first Article of our Treaty, where Ireland is declared to be a co-equal member of the British Empire.  Possibly that was a slip on the part of the draughtsman and possibly it was a deliberate statement made with design.  At any rate, what Deputy Johnson has declared to be the proper interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;British Empire&rdquo; is undoubtedly correct. Yet, there is an acceptance of the term which makes it cover a much wider area and gives it a greater scope and application.  Strictly speaking, of course, the British Empire is merely Great Britain with its dependencies, its colonies and its possessions. The people to whom the once familiar name of the present dominions and colonies of England is still, in a vague and loose sort of way, a name, think, when one speaks of the British Empire as containing the colonies of England, that the dominions are included in that.  They fail to realise, what very recent years have evolved, that those nations that were once merely colonies are now States that have joined the League of Nations in their own right, and have signed the Treaty of Paris in their own right.</P>
    <P>It is repeatedly enunciated, and I think it is a fairly correct statement on the whole, that, in addition to the League of Nations, there is a combination sometimes described as a smaller League of Nations, to wit, the British Commonwealth.  That British Commonwealth is not the British Empire, but it is frequently described, even by British statesmen, as the British Empire. Obviously, it was that phraseology that came to the lips of the British Minister at the League of Nations when he said that the British Empire was a very composite and political unit, and he went on to say that it was a partnership of six nations on a footing of equality.  That partnership of six nations, on a footing of equality, is not the British Empire strictly speaking, but the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Then again, to speak of it as a partnership of nations and of political unity, in a context and in circumstances that would convey that the character of that unity is such as to necessitate common action, in total <Col N="550" /> solidarity, where the vital interests of any one of the partnership was in danger, is to say the thing that is not true, because it is to forget one of the very important elements of our Treaty.</P>
    <P>On the other hand are we free from attack?  Supposing one of the co-equal members of the Commonwealth went to war, was embroiled with some other State, we are not free from attack. Paper guarantees in this matter are of no use.  By one of the Articles of the Constitution we are, to all intents and purposes quasi-belligerents, if not fully belligerents in case of England being at war.</P>

      <P>I was wrong.  I thank the Minister for reminding me.  It is the Treaty and not the Constitution I was referring to. We are obliged to provide Great Britain with naval bases and facilities. Does anyone believe that a great power at war with England, knowing that naval bases and other facilities are provided, would refrain from attack?  Therefore, it is very necessary that our position in this matter should be defined and made very clear, that it should be well understood that the Free State regards itself as on precisely the same international footing as was claimed by South Africa for South Africa, and by Canada for Canada, in the deliberations preceding the fact of their signing the Treaty of Paris, signing it in their own name, in their own right.  It was declared afterwards by, I think, the late Lord Milner, acting as British Commissioner, that they were on the same standing in that matter as France or Belgium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson recalled a fact that is beyond dispute, that, at the time when the demand was made for membership of the League of Nations for the constituents of the British Commonwealth, <Col N="551" /> objection was made that that would be, in effect, to multiply the vote of Great Britain and give her an unfair predominance in the League. That objection was made and enforced with great insistence by Japan amongst other nations, and it was one of the things that made me feel, and feel very strongly, that the reception of the Irish Free State into the League of Nations was of tremendous value and importance, as indicating and securing our international status, because it indicated that Japan and the other objectors realised that those States which form the elements of the political unit, the British Commonwealth of Nations, were entering in their own right; that they were exercising their own sovereignty, and that they were not committed by their being components of the Commonwealth to endorse and follow, as of necessity, the foreign policy that might be initiated by Great Britain.  I think that is the case, and that is the great value of membership of the League of Nations, whatever else it may entail, or whatever cost it may involve for us on other questions.</P>
    <P>I hold that those who believe in Ireland's right to be a nation among the nations should be gratified to find that we have that membership.  But then the corollary or the sequel to that is that we should see to it&mdash;I admit it has been seen to&mdash;that our position is not misrepresented there: that we are not committed, or rather that we should not be committed to endorsing everything in the way of foreign policies which Great Britain either initiates or adopts.  We should stand on our own feet and make our own decisions, and if this is to be a democratically governed State these decisions should be the decisions of the people, arrived at through the appropriate instrument for reaching decisions of the people. Otherwise, we get back to secret diplomacy and bureaucracy, exercised in external affairs, so that the nation may find itself some day committed to something which it abhors.  Therefore, I agree thoroughly with Deputy Johnson that in all these matters of external affairs, for which the Minister has <Col N="552" /> charge, the fullest publicity as to what is proposed, what attitude our representatives are taking, and what is the policy of the Executive Council, which includes the Minister for External Affairs, should be put fully before this House for discussion.  If we do not take up that attitude, if we do not insist on that attitude being taken up, we are in effect tacitly assenting to secret diplomacy and to secret covenants secretly arrived at.</P>
    <P>I do say that the Department of External Affairs is a valuable part, and an exceptionally valuable part, of our organisation of government, and that no consideration of economy should be pressed so far as to demand its abolition. True&mdash;I have stated so publicly&mdash; it is susceptible of better organisation. It has a career of greater usefulness, nationally, open to it.  If it has hidden some of its excellent transactions from the public view, that is not a reason why its usefulness should be diminished.  On the question of the Estimates, the subject of its better organisation can be more appropriately discussed.  I only refer to it here lest it might seem that in repudiating any proposal to have it abolished I was at the same time leaving myself open to be taken as endorsing everything that the name covers.</P>
    <P>It ought to be made clear beyond all doubt how the operation of the working of that stipulation in the Treaty is going to affect our safety from a military and naval point of view.  That is a matter for negotiation surely.  That is a task cut out for the Department of External Affairs and more particularly for the representatives that it sends to the League of Nations.  It is quite possible that we may receive some guarantees. It is more than possible that the dominions, particularly of South Africa and Australia, in their own interests, would stand by us in this.  It is of the last importance that we should not be only entitled a Free State, because titular freedom and actual freedom are very different things.  If the results, as they work out in practice, of the stipulation referred to, be that we are necessarily objects of attack for any enemy that is at war with Great Britain or the British Empire, the position <Col N="553" /> would become very serious.  It seems, therefore&mdash;I hold this fully with Deputy Johnson&mdash;that what goes on in our name at the League of Nations should receive the fullest and the earliest publicity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support very much this motion of Deputy Johnson.  A note of criticism, no doubt, of the management of the Department of External Affairs must creep into speeches made on this particular subject, but I really think they have nothing to do with the motion that is at present before the House.  The motion means a desire to help the Department of External Affairs to realise how it can help itself.  The community of nations known as the British Commonwealth are supposed to be an association of nations bound together, say, by common interests, and in the same way the nations that form themselves into the League of Nations would say that they are bound together also by common interests.  I suppose the whole tendency in that direction is that the different nations may exchange as systematically and as efficiently as possible ideas, policies, plans and helps of various kinds to better the general condition of their own peoples.  Now, a lot of matters are covered by what is referred to here as &ldquo;important developments in international affairs.&rdquo;  We have our interest in all these&mdash;in matters that tend to intellectual and social advancement as well as in these matters which are intended to prevent us being engaged in wars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot help being struck particularly with the interests and the desires of our people not to become engaged in wars, but from statements made from time to time by British Ministers we cannot help being suspicious of the possibilities that lie in our particular connection with Britain from the point of view of involving us in a war.  There will be very few of our people who will go abroad to international conferences of any kind that will not have to question here and there a statement of some British representative implying a certain status and certain commitments on our part in regard to British intentions and British policy.  We had it at Washington, where on this question <Col N="554" /> of codifying national law and outlining in a systematic way the rights and duties of nations, Deputy Johnson raised the question of what was involved in the consideration of these matters by the status of certain States, States that belonged to the British Commonwealth of Nations.  In reply, we had a statement made by the responsible head of the British Delegation of 40 members there that it was inconceivable that if Great Britain were at war, the party that was at war with her would agree to recognise the neutrality of any member of the British Commonwealth of Nations simply because that member crossed its fingers and said &ldquo;I am not playing.&rdquo;  Now, when in an international assembly the responsible British representative can make a statement like that apropos of our status here or the status of Canada, and when we are considering the way in which Britain has from time to time found herself at war, we cannot help but be suspicions of what the future may contain for us in connection with our relations with Britain.</P>
    <P>If Deputies will refer to a document recently circulated by the Minister for External Affairs they will also see the official summary of the British representative which contains the statement, &ldquo;No Government of the British Empire, up to the present, considers it wise to pledge itself to refer to the permanent court all cases affecting the vital interests of the nation.&rdquo;&ldquo;No Government of the British Empire&rdquo; means no single Government of the British Empire.  But there you have the question again obscuring the position as to what exactly the British Empire is, and then you have one of those little phrases that are such very effective dope in colouring the minds of people as to what the British Empire is, or as to what the Commonwealth of British Nations is, and what is the supposed position of those nations that go to make it up with regard to one another.</P>
    <P>We found ourselves at Washington regarded by representatives of States with a considerable amount of international experience, as being in the position, with regard to England, that one <Col N="555" /> of the States of the United States is in in regard to its own country, and statements such as this, to which I have referred about the Government of the British Empire, and statements such as Deputy Johnson has drawn attention to, are the things that create, amongst external peoples, the idea that the Irish Free State occupies, towards Britain, the same position that one State of the United States occupies to the United States as a whole.  That appreciation of things, or misappreciation of things in the minds of outside peoples does create very serious dangers for us, because when we find ourselves on the threshold of being involved in war, through British policy, we will find ourselves in that position, perhaps, knowing very little of the circumstances that have led up to that position, and it is most necessary for our own people here that we should have all the information possible on international development that will enable them to realise thoroughly their position, and to engage in such discussion from time to time as will clear their minds as to what they intend, internationally, in respect to Britain and the other nations of the British Commonwealth in any international crisis of whatever kind.  It is only by information here, and such intelligent discussion here, that we will be able to dispel the ignorance that prevails outside with regard to this country in the minds of our people.</P>
    <P>In discussing, many years ago in the British House of Commons, a Coinage Bill and the question of decimal coinage, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this was a matter on which the opinion of a mere Minister was of no importance at all compared with the opinion of the people.  I think it will be readily agreed on all sides that in this matter of possible war for our country, or of possible critical diplomatic relations of any kind, the opinion of a mere Minister cannot be any great help to himself in dealing with it, and ought not to be the thing upon which the country would be made to act, but in such circumstances the Minister can only act effectively on the consolidated opinion of the people, and <Col N="556" /> that it would be very unfair to the people, and disastrous to them and to the Minister himself, if he acted on anything else.  It is in order to help the Minister himself and to help Deputies in this Dáil, and to help the people in the country generally, that I feel that the Dáil should very strongly support this motion of Deputy Johnson's that will ensure that we get the information that it is necessary for us to get if we are to be prepared for the future.</P>

      <P>I receive the motion made by Deputy Johnson with appreciation and a great deal of sympathy, but the very circumstances of the Ministry that I hold afford me very few matters to bring before the Dáil and make it rather difficult for me to come before the Dáil very often to explain things in details.  Our present arrangement with regard to the activities in the League of Nations, the International Labour Bureau and other Conventions organised by the League of Nations, is that we will give the House a report on them.  That will add considerable work to my Department, which has but a very small staff.  Deputy Johnson expressed some doubts about Locarno.  I am glad to have this occasion of making a statement on Locarno, because although we did not participate in the conference at Locarno, and had not any part whatever in it, at the same time it is of interest for us.  Arising out of it may arise wars, and wars may be prevented by it.  We are a small State and, in practice, a disarmed State in Europe. We are a State, remember, of that community of nations referred to sometimes as the British Empire, and we are a State with very intimate economic relations with Great Britain.  Therefore, it does happen, as one might say, that Great Britain has an interest in participating in the Locarno Pact by the fact that the development of modern war has put her interest further East than formally, and in the same way when it affects Great Britain there is also the possibility that it will affect us.  For that reason I shall be happy to give a general history and to some extent my own opinions also <Col N="557" /> about Locarno.  Deputy Johnson referred to a statement by a British representative at the League of Nations which implied, or appeared to imply, that he was speaking on behalf not only of the Government of Great Britain but of those other States which are co-equal members of the Commonwealth. I think that in view of the statements made here to-day by Deputy Johnson, Deputy Esmonde, Deputy Magennis and Deputy Mulcahy as to the lack of understanding of our position amongst other States, I may say that it was almost as well that the British representative made the mistake that he did make, because the Minister for Justice was able then to make clear in a way which otherwise he might not have had an opportunity of doing, exactly what the position was, and with the permission of the House I will read the statement he made on that occasion.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I claim the indulgence of the Committee for a very few moments not with a view to putting forward a proposal for the consideration of its members, but simply for the purpose of guarding against a misapprehension which might easily arise&mdash; and which seems in fact to have arisen in certain newspapers&mdash;from the speech of Sir Cecil Hurst on Friday last.  Portions of that very able and interesting address might be considered to bear the construction that Sir Cecil Hurst was announcing to the Committee the considered attitude not of one Government but of six, towards the principle of compulsory arbitration and the question of adherence or non-adherence to the optional clause of Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court.  I wish to make it clear that so far as the Government of the Irish Free State is concerned that is not the position.  My Government has not as yet arrived at a decision on this important matter. Sympathetically inclined to the principle of arbitration, it would wish to give to the question of the practical application of that clause to our special circumstances a closer consideration than has yet been found possible.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice there made <Col N="558" /> it perfectly clear that the Irish representatives, and they only, were in a position to speak on behalf of the Irish Government, and that the British representative did not speak on behalf of the Irish Government and the Irish people.  That is a matter beyond argument, that only the Government of the Irish people is able to do any act in any way committing the Irish people to anything.  We have done no act; we have not participated in Locarno, and therefore in Locarno we have taken no juridical responsibility whatsoever, although, as I say, our geographical position, our association with the British Community of Nations and our economic associations with England make it a matter of interest to us. That statement of the Minister for Justice was reinforced by a statement of the British representative, saying that the case explained by the Minister for Justice was exactly a clear statement of the case and that the British quite agreed with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson asked if we had entered the League of Nations merely to get protection, or to exercise our power to promote peace, etc.  I think that our activities in the League of Nations have been made perfectly clear.  We need not claim particular credit for it, because we had no interests to protect. We have stood always on the side of the Ten Commandments, not represented by Deputy O'Connell's friend. We have done that consistently, because our peculiar position enables us to do that without loss.  I am not suggesting that we are a more highly ethical people than other people.  I am not saying that we have not considered other matters apart from the exaltation of the Ten Commandments, but it does happen that so far our interests and the interests of the Ten Commandments are identical.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde said that the Dáil was kept completely in the dark.  I think that that is an unfair statement. From time to time, not very often, relatively seldom, I have here made certain statements, and I think that on those occasions I gave as frank an explanation of the circumstances as could possibly be given.  Deputy Esmonde also referred to statements in the Press <Col N="559" /> with regard to the abolition of my Department, statements which are of no interest to me, because I consider them neither enlightened nor honest.  The existence of my Department is merely the implementation of the position created by the Treaty, and the position created by the Treaty was the position to a large extent desired by the Irish people.</P>
    <P>With regard to Article 7 of the Treaty, it is very hard to say anything definite, but I might make a slight reference to it, and also a statement on Locarno.  Every Convention which we propose adhering to is brought before the Dáil for ratification. We do not propose to commit the Dáil to anything without the Dáil's consent.  A certain number of Conventions have been brought here from time to time.  We have not ratified all of them, but considering the length of time we have been members of the League I think we have ratified more than most members.  Possibly it may happen that some members are quite willing to ratify every Convention, without considering their feasibility or their intention of actually maintaining the provisions of the Convention.  We do not propose to ask the Dáil to ratify any Convention which we are not determined to maintain in its fullness. Deputy Esmonde referred to the Obnoxious Drugs Convention, and complained that no member of the Dáil knew the reason for the delay in ratifying that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>The Obscene Literature Convention, yes.  I think that Deputy Esmonde for one has a very good idea as to what the reasons for the delay are.  In connection with the use of the phrase &ldquo;British Empire,&rdquo; terms like these are difficult because the whole position of the community of nations has not been created by statute; it has not been created by definition; it has been created by growth.  As I have said here before, it is full of illogical positions and illogical phrases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the one hand in statutory documents <Col N="560" /> and in international instruments, the words &ldquo;British Empire&rdquo; have been used in the past meaning all those dependencies and dominions and everybody else.  On the other hand, since the coming into existence of the League of Nations, the independence and the sovereignty of those States, sometimes referred to as Dominions, have been made more and more clear, and it is clear that as the British Empire is a member of the League of Nations, and as Canada is another member of the League of Nations, and the Irish Free State another member, the definition intended of the British Empire is the definition made by Deputy Johnson, namely, that the British Empire is Great Britain and all these States and dependencies directly or indirectly administered by the Parliament of Great Britain.  I think the fact that the &ldquo;British Empire&rdquo; is the phrase used there rather helps us to clear up what the British Commonwealth is.  The British Commonwealth is the British Empire plus all those independent States, including the Irish Free State. I may say that I think since we, the Irish Free State, came into existence we have done more than anybody else in making it perfectly clear what the position is.  It has been suggested that my Department has not justified its existence.  People are quite entitled to hold that view, but I am quite prepared to argue and maintain that the Irish Free State Department of External Affairs had made more progress, more clarity and more precedence in the right direction than the Department of External Affairs of any British Dominion during that time.</P>
    <P>Somebody referred to economy. Well, I plead guilty myself to too much economy.  My Department has, possibly, not done all the work it might have done, but certainly for its cost to the country it has given more return, I think, than the similar Departments in a great many other countries.  Incidentally, I might mention that we are a revenue-making department.  We are told that the whole taxation of this country could be reduced immensely. I take a word used in the cinemas&mdash;&ldquo;featuring&rdquo;&mdash;and I say that the daily newspapers might advertise themselves <Col N="561" /> by featuring a leading article on the External Affairs Department.  We are a revenue-earning Department, but even if we were not I do not see that the relatively small sum of money we get would make the difference between commercial ruin and commercial prosperity. Actually we receive an extraordinarily small sum, out of which sum we maintain not only the office here, which controls all communications between this Government and the Government of Great Britain, but we maintain also the office of the High Commissioner in London, the office of the Minister Plenipotentiary in Washington, the Passport Control Office in Washington, and trade representative in Washington, and trade representatives in Paris and Brussels, and our representative at the League of Nations. Our estimate was £46,000, and with the machinery we had, and on that expenditure we earned a revenue during the year of something over £20,000.  On economy, I might say that everybody should economise.  Newspapers and banks should economise, but I do not think there is very much ground for economy in my Department.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Mulcahy who referred to the fact that every Irish representative that goes abroad has to challenge or question a statement made by a British representative.  That is natural.  As I say, this position is not the result of definition.  It is the result of growth, and naturally there are people whose mind is always a few years behind.  They have grown up in the habit of thinking in one way, and it is not easy for them suddenly to realise all the connotations of their words in the changed circumstances and to use the exact words.  In Washington this year you had Deputy Johnson and Deputy Mulcahy, who, I think, were well able to dissipate any errors or any erroneous conceptions that might arise from the statement of any other representative.  We made our position perfectly clear in the League of Nations or in any other International assembly in which we participated. Of course, it is only as time goes on, after constant rectification, only slowly and gradually does the right conception enter people's minds generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> I have been asked about Locarno. With the permission of the House, I will read a general statement of the history of the Locarno Conference.</P>
    <P>The Conference of Foreign Ministers for the negotiation of a Security Pact opened at Locarno on October 5th, with Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Belgium participating. The request of Poland and Czecho-Slovakia to participate in the main Conference was refused, but towards the end of the proceedings those two States negotiated with Germany, the Eastern Arbitration Treaties.</P>
    <P>The final negotiations that led up to the Conference were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The French and British notes of September 15th.</P>
    <P>(2)  The German note of September 26th, and the note verbale delivered simultaneously.</P>
    <P>(3)  The French, British, Italian and Belgian notes of September 29th.</P>
    <P>The French and British notes of September 15th, couched in identical terms, referred to the completion of the work of the preliminary conference of jurists at London, and suggested that the Security Conference be held in Switzerland not later than the beginning of October.  The German note accepted the invitation and fixed October 5th as the date.  The accompanying note verbale stated that the entrance of Germany to the League of Nations &ldquo;should not be interpreted as a recognition of allegations containing a moral charge against the German people&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the prolongation of the occupation of a large part of German territory is considered as an injustice by the German people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Allied replies did not accept the contention embodied in the note verbale.  The British note of September 29th, after expressing satisfaction at Germany's acceptance of the invitation to the Conference, went on to state that the question of Germany's responsibility for the war was not raised in the projected pact and that His Majesty's Government were obliged to observe that the proposed negotiations could not modify <Col N="563" /> the Treaty of Versailles or alter the judgment of the past.</P>
    <P>On September 20th the Government of the Czecho-Slovak Republic informed the German Foreign Minister of its readiness to enter into negotiations for the conclusion of an arbitration Treaty.  This was the first occasion that direct contact was established between Berlin and Prague.  A week or so before the opening of the Conference the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs of the U.S.S.R., Mr. Tchicherin, visited Warsaw and Berlin.</P>
    <P>On October 16th the Final Protocol of the Locarno Conference was signed and the following instruments, which were initialled by the delegates, are to be signed in London on December 1st, next:</P>
    <P>(1)  Treaty between Germany, Belgium, France, Great Britain and Italy (commonly called the Security Pact).</P>
    <P>(2)  Arbitration Convention between Germany and Belgium.</P>
    <P>(3)  Arbitration Convention between Germany and France.</P>
    <P>(4)  Arbitration Treaty between Germany and Poland, and</P>
    <P>(5)  Arbitration Treaty between Germany and Czecho-Slovakia.</P>
    <P>The principal intrument amongst the foregoing is the Security Pact, destined to maintain the status quo territorial and the inviolability of the frontiers of France, Belgium and Germany such as they have resulted from the Treaty of Versailles.  In negotiating this pact, two important shoals had to be avoided.  In the first case it should not touch the Treaty of Versailles, in which an important part of French public opinion see its safeguard, and in the second it should not be contrary to the Covenant of the League of Nations nor in any way infringe on its authority.</P>
    <P>Articles 2 and 6 of the Pact reserve formally to France all rights arising out of the Treaty of Versailles, including that which considers a violation of the demilitarised zone as an aggression on the part of Germany. Judicially, therefore, the Treaty of <Col N="564" /> Versailles has not been touched.  Its text rests in its entirety.</P>
    <P>The Covenant of the League is provided for in Article 7 as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The present Treaty, which is designed to assure the maintenance of peace and is in conformity with the Covenant of the League of Nations, shall not be interpreted as restricting the duty of the League to take whatever action may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of the world.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This sounds very much like the Protocol of Geneva, whose object was the pacific settlement of international disputes and the effectual organisation of a coalition of pacific States against an aggressor.  Such also is the object of the Pact of Locarno.  Conflicts which cannot be resolved by arbitration between the parties are taken before the League Council in accordance with Article 3.  The Council will then determine the case in which assistance is to be given, even in the case of aggression of a flagrant character.  Such is the meaning of Article 4.  The Council shall also propose the measures to take (Article 5) in the case where one of the parties refuses to execute the arbitration sentence.  It will also determine by a two-thirds majority the date when the Pact shall cease to have effect (Article 8), that is when the Covenant of the League of Nations shall in itself be considered a sufficient guarantee for the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>The League of Nations, therefore, intervenes in several Articles and may be considered as the keystone of the whole edifice.</P>
    <P>In the preliminary negotiations the question of the determination of the aggressor was a particularly difficult one.  It was proposed that its appreciation should be left to the Council of the League of Nations, but France reserved to herself the right to act without any delay in the case that Germany had manifestly violated her engagements.  Article 4 recognises this right in case of flagrant aggression, but on the other hand it authorises the League Council to <Col N="565" /> suspend operations in case it should decide that, contrary to the judgment of the parties, there had been no aggression.  The functioning of this, in practice, may be doubtful, but then one must not lose sight of the fact that all the work of the League of Nations is of a preventive character.</P>
    <P>From our point of view Article 9 of the Pact has a special significance. It reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The present Treaty shall impose no obligation upon any of the British Dominions, or upon India, unless the Governments of such Dominions, or of India, signify their acceptance thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On this I want to say that I am merely giving an opinion that may be argued.  I am not saying that what I say here should be taken as established.</P>
    <P>From this it may be argued that in case of a war arising out of the Pact in which Great Britain is obliged to participate, the Dominions could not be considered to be in a state of war, unless their respective Governments so decide.  In other words, they remain neutral, as the Treaty imposes no obligation on them, not even that of passive belligerency.  This Article also raises the very delicate question as to whether the second clause of Article 7 of the Anglo-Irish Treaty could be legally enforced in such a case.</P>
    <P>It may even be a question on that whether the second part of Article 7 of the Treaty should be enforced.  However, I am not venturing to give an opinion.</P>
    <P>The Arbitration Treaties negotiated at Locarno play an essential rôle in the whole system.  It is not always an easy matter to prevent the growth of conflicts. Men and peoples can never be unanimous in their opinions for any long time.  What is required is to prevent at all costs the settlement of their differences by violent methods, or in other words to organise the means of regulating them peacefully.  At the fifth assembly of the League of Nations, France declared her willingness to submit all disputes without exception, whether juridical or political, to compulsory <Col N="566" /> arbitration.  Germany, however, prefers that political conflicts should be submitted to a procedure of conciliation, in which case the decision would not be compulsory.  This method has the great advantage of being more supple and less formal.  Conflicts which could not be resolved in this way should afterwards be submitted compulsorily to the Council of the League of Nations, in accordance with Article 15 of the Covenant.  This latter method would not necessarily exclude violence, but it would render a resort to war very difficult.</P>
    <P>What is most remarkable in the Franco-German Arbitration Treaty is that it contains no reservation concerning the Treaty of Versailles.  There is, however, a provision to the effect that it does not apply to disputes arising out of events belonging to the past.  The Treaty has not a retroactive effect, but all the conflicts that should arise in the future are placed on the same footing, whatever their juridical origin may be.  Germany has certainly obtained a great concession here, which modifies profoundly in practice as well as in spirit the Treaty of Versailles.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Arbitration Treaties differ only in minor details from the Western.  There are no special guarantees beyond those already concluded between France and her Eastern Allies, or between those Allies themselves envisaging the case of Germany breaking her engagements and the application of Article 16 of the Covenant.  Some States interpret this Article 16 as having only a moral character, but France, Poland, and Czecho-Slovakia, in their relations, consider it to be entirely of a juridical nature.  On the other hand, France, Britain, and Belgium have, in a separate letter, accepted in their relations with Germany the restrictive interpretation given to this Article by the latter.  This letter runs as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These obligations should be interpreted in the sense that each of the signatory States is held to loyally and effectively collaborate in respecting the Covenant of the League of Nations, and in opposing any act of aggression in the measure which their geographical situation and the special conditions of their armaments would permit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> This letter, which seems to lend itself to different interpretations, evidently convinced the German delegation that Article 16 of the Covenant does not oblige them to do anything that they would otherwise be obliged to do unconditionally in their own interests.</P>
    <P>I may say this was written some time ago.  I think that most of the statements made there, and the notions one had of Locarno, have been more or less proved correct so far.  Deputy Johnson raises a rather difficult constitutional question.  In our Constitution Article 49 sets out:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Save in the case of actual invasion, the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) shall not be committed to active participation in any war without the assent of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is an important point.  In the event of a great European war, as one Deputy said, paper guarantees are worth nothing; they are actually nothing. It is a matter that I cannot pretend to know more about than anybody else.  In the case of a great European war I think this country, and nearly every other country, is going to be directed in its policy by brute facts.  What these brute facts are going to be I do not know.  I have often regretted that one of the results of the Reformation was the decline of that science known as speculative theology.  I think it was probably a much more valuable science than speculative politics.</P>
    <P>I think the constitutional position will be cleared up as time goes on. That is not the only thing which is anomalous or contradictory.  The whole position is full of anomalies and full of contradictions.  During the last few years we have done our best, and we have been successful in various directions, in clearing up some of those anomalies.  There is a possibility that an Imperial Conference may be held some time within the next year.  I hope that that Imperial Conference will assist in clearing up various anomalies that still exist.  I do not think it will clear all the existing anomalies up, because what has taken many generations to build up is not going to be defined <Col N="568" /> and formalised in all its particulars within a year or so.  I do not think I can deal any further with that point. Other points may arise.  I think I have dealt with most of the points that were raised.</P>
    <P>As to the frequency of statements here, I cannot promise that statements will be very frequent.  Often there are laid on the Table of the Dáil reports of conventions and international assemblies in which we take part.  I have no doubt that from time to time, either of my own volition or the volition of some Deputy, as is instanced by this motion to-day, an occasion will arise when it will be advisable to make some statement here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister deplores the decline of the science of speculative theology.  I speak as one uninstructed in this matter, but I believe one of the problems that concerned speculative theology was as to how many angels could stand on the point of a needle.  Apparently the Minister seems to think that if that science were still in vogue it could be applied to the question of how many Dominions would stand on the point of a bayonet.  I think that without referring to theology, and without referring to speculation, we can deal with this matter on a satisfactory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my humble opinion, with regard to external affairs we have really too much speculation and not enough facts, and I am not sure that the Minister's speech meets the case.  I would suggest that instead of having, from time to time&mdash;infrequently, as the Minister suggested&mdash;statements made, or of having laid on the Table of the Dáil certain draft conventions and draft schemes to which we are a party, it would be better to set up a committee corresponding to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies in France, of the House of Representatives in the United States, which should, at regular intervals, receive not merely reports of conventions and official documents, but official information as regards our relations with other States.  It should be a Committee of the Dáil, representative of all parties. Then those parties would have sufficient <Col N="569" /> knowledge and sufficient information to enable them to place a motion on the Paper to have one or other aspect of these affairs discussed.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Johnson's motion, while I am in favour of its spirit I am not in favour of abstract resolutions and discussions in the Dáil. We should have a discussion only on a definite motion.  There might very often in foreign matters be a state of affairs in connection with which a motion would be undesirable.  If all parties of the House were fully informed of the case, they would not want a motion and they would not want definitely to express upon it the opinion of the legislature of Saorstát Eireann.  They would want to know something, of course, and I think that could be achieved better by keeping representatives of all parties informed and instructed, as is done in the French Parliament and in the Parliament of the United States.</P>
    <P>I could elaborate this thing, and point out the advantage of having our own news.  I do not think the English papers colour their foreign news, but I do think that very possibly they omit many features that would be of more interest to us than to British readers. I do not think the Canadian or Australian news emphasises the movement of Canadian and Australian opinion in the direction of a wider autonomy.  I do say that we ought to have such information as we can obtain from our own official sources.  It cannot always be published.  I realise that, but a Committee of responsible Deputies representing all parties could be educated and informed and could act as an invaluable force to move public opinion in the direction in which the Government thinks it ought to go.  I do not think the Minister or the Government need fear factious opposition. They have had very little opposition in regard to external affairs; what they have had was purely on principle and not for the sake of discrediting the Government.</P>
    <P>I urge the President and the Minister for External Affairs to consider the advisability of setting up such a committee, which should have free discussion and full knowledge.  I do not want <Col N="570" /> to intrude on Deputy Johnson's right to reply and therefore I will say no more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to think that, notwithstanding the Minister's disavowal of making any change, the result of the discussion will bring about some change.  At least I hope if the motion is passed that it will be taken as an indication of the wishes of the Dáil in the matter, and that we will be kept informed to a greater degree than we have been in the past, of the policy of the Ministry in respect of matters affecting the State, whether in relation to the component parts of the British Commonwealth or in relation to other States.  In the latter particular, it essentially means action taken by the League of Nations and discussion in the League of Nations assembly and so on.  The circulation of the document that had been placed in Deputies' hands does indicate one of the lines which I desire the Minister should follow in future.  I do not want to be taken as urging that we should be fussily poking our noses into all kinds of things and pretending to be more powerful or influential than we are, or will be for a very long time. But I want the people of this country to feel that they are units in a League of Nations and that they are not merely carried away by a stream without any say at all in the direction of that stream.  I want to make the people conscious of the fact that we are a constituent part of that League of Nations, a State independent of other States, and that the very acceptance of this State into that League involves a great constitutional change not only for us but for Great Britain, and not only for Great Britain but for those other States in relation to Great Britain and in relation to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter has been touched upon perhaps more fully than I had intended, because though I realise that the whole question of neutrality impinged upon the discussion.  I thought perhaps it would have been better to have a discussion on that subject alone.  But as it has been touched upon, both by other Deputies and the Minister, I think it is important for me to state my point of view and the point of view of many others on this matter, and I think probably <Col N="571" /> the point of view of the Ministry. Notwithstanding Article 49&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Save in the case of actual invasion, the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) shall not be committed to active participation in any war without the assent of the Oireachtas&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;it is not recognised by the other States of the world as ensuring that we shall be deemed to be neutral.  It is undoubtedly the fact, in international law up to the present time, that if England were at war, then Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and Ireland would be at war.  It is true also that public opinion in Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand desires and intends that these States shall not in future be automatically involved in war with any country with which England is at war, but that their Parliaments or their Governments shall have a deciding voice in such questions.  That course is stated specifically in this Constitution.  I am very strongly of opinion that inasmuch as these various constituent parts of this British Association have evidently laid it down by their public opinion, and in some cases by definite and formal statement, that they will not be involved in war without the previous assents of their Government and Parliament, our endeavour should be to persuade the other nations of the world to accept that position in time of peace.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the facts of war and war-time would wipe away any paper treaty or commitment.  Unfortunately, one has to admit that that has been the case in the past and possibly will be the case in the future, but that very statement rather implies that treaties and obligations and covenants and leagues are all useless and we need not and should not enter into commitments of any kind because in times of crisis these paper commitments and obligations will not be honoured.  I am not such a cynic as to accept that in toto.  I think, as a matter of fact, that the growth of public opinion in time of peace helps to sustain countries in a rational state of mind in time of war or in time of crisis. But we are members of this League of Nations, and the League of Nations has, as one of its endeavours, the limiting <Col N="572" /> of the area of the war conflict, the limiting of the number of States that will be involved in war conflict, and as members of the League of Nations it should be part of our duty and obligation to endeavour to limit the occasions on which we can be involved in war to absolute zero, if possible, and that the other nations of the world should be induced, as far as we can do it by diplomatic means and educational efforts, to arrive at that same conclusion. That is to say, if the evil thing happened, if England became involved in war with the United States, Japan, or any European country, those other nations would recognise beforehand that neither Ireland nor Canada nor Australia nor South Africa is automatically a belligerent merely by the fact that Great Britain is a belligerent.</P>
    <P>I think that it should be one of the functions of our Department of External Affairs to endeavour to persuade other countries through the League of Nations to accept that position.  If that can be done, and I believe it can with the assistance and co-operation of those other Dominions, or many sections of their people, I think we can arrive at the stage when the realities of independence and the values of free association with Great Britain will all accrue.</P>
    <P>I want to say in regard to one or two of the matters that have been raised, that so far from criticising the Department of External Affairs from the point of view that it is unnecessary and wasteful, and should be suppressed, I am entirely of a different opinion.  Whatever may be the constitution of a Ministry, a Department of External Affairs is absolutely necessary. So far from limiting its activities, I believe that it will be essential that these activities must be enlarged. There is undoubtedly a great ignorance even amongst influential politicians in the countries of the world as to our constitutional relationship with Great Britain, Canada, and Australia, as well as with the League of Nations.  I believe that it is one of the functions of the Department of External Affairs to enlighten the statesmen, politicians, and people of other countries as to our constitutional position.  Now, as the Minister <Col N="573" /> claims, much has been done.  I believe that that is true enough, to show how much more there is to be done.  I will certainly stand by the Minister in his claim that the Department of External Affairs is an essential emanation from the Treaty obligation, and that it should be used to the fullest possible extent to ensure that the countries of the world will realise the constitutional position of this country.  Again, I am ready to admit with him, as everybody who has studied the matter to any degree must admit, that this whole constitutional position is one of growth and development, and it is the acceleration of that growth and development that I want to see accepted as part of the work of the Department of External Affairs.  I think that the development which I have indicated will be in the direction of persuading the other nations to recognise what we claim to be our constitutional position, and to recognise that constitutional position in time of peace in relation to matters which might involve war.  I think we should insist, in season and out of season, that this country is not, and will not be, <Col N="574" /> automatically involved in war, merely because Britain is involved in war, that this diplomatic and military unity of the British Empire does not exist, and that we will prevent it existing.  I think that should be the position, and I think it would be a position that would go towards the maintenance of peace and the prevention of war.  It would also be a position which would go towards the development of real association in matters of peace and civil development, and would show that there is no antagonism between the position which continues diplomatic amity but supports the movement towards educational, personal and civic liberty.  From what the Minister has said, I take it, that the motion is not being opposed, and that it will result in future in more frequent efforts at informing the House and, through the House, the country, of the position of Ireland and the Free State in relation to the countries of the world.</P>
