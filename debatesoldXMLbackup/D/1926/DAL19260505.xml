      <P>asked the President if the Executive Council, having in view the general strike in Great Britain, proposes to take any steps for the purpose of conserving the supplies of imported foodstuffs and fuel in the Saorstát, and if they will take steps to provide against an increase of prices of these articles to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Supplies of foodstuffs and fuel in the country are, according to the information available to the Executive Council, quite equal to normal demand for a reasonable period. There is no reason to apprehend that traders will find difficlty in replenishing stocks of essential commodities.  It is, however, possible that abuse may arise by way of hoarding or profiteering or otherwise.  Against these malpractices there is at present no statutory power in the hands of the Executive Council.  The Government has legislation prepared to enable the Council to deal with such abuses and to ensure the due supply and distribution of the essentials of life to the community. This legislation will be introduced if and when it is considered necessary.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask if the President or Minister for Agriculture is in a position to make any statement by way of advice to farmers, in view of the dislocation of trade that must inevitably take place as a result of the strike in Great Britain, urging the inadvisability of farmers rushing their stocks on to the market when the market is not capable of absorbing <Col N="1084" /> them&mdash;particularly perishable commodities.</P>

      <P>With regard to the President's reply, that the Executive would take action with reference to an increase in prices when and if it would be necessary, is the President aware that many coal merchants have already increased the price of coal?  I know myself that coal has been increased 8/- per ton in one town, and I am informed that somewhat similar increases are taking place in other towns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As to Deputy Prior's question regarding the conserving of foodstuffs from foreign farmers, I do not know that that question arises out of the present situation.  I did not mention anything about foreign farmers. There are foodstuffs coming in here from foreign countries which are considered essential, and it is in relation to these that I understand Deputy Heffernan addressed the question to me.  It is of these foodstuffs that we would wish to have a sufficient supply. The information we had from the coal merchants is to the effect that there is a reasonable supply, and I presume that they are taking reasonable steps to <Col N="1085" /> ensure that undue hoarding will not take place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In the country generally there is a sufficient supply for a very reasonable period.  There is no necessity for an increase of eight shillings per ton in coal.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies made observations which were inaudible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer questions and listen to interruptions at the same time.  If, however, the interruptions are sufficiently clear I will answer them.  There is no earthly reason why people should pay eight shillings a ton more for coal.  It may be possible in certain cases where there is a desire to hoard that the price does not matter.  If people are going to hoard and are prepared to pay the price, we cannot set up expensive machinery to deal with that.  There ought to be sufficient public opinion in country towns, where the population is not very large, to deal with a situation of that sort.  In my reply I said that abuse may arise by way of hoarding or profiteering or otherwise.  The information that we have at present is not sufficient to satisfy us that the abuse has reached an acute stage.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of Deputy Cooper, I am aware that as far as the salmon industry is concerned the export trade is at a stand still and that it will be the cause of serious loss. At the moment, however, I cannot say what amount of coal storage is available, but I shall cause information to be published in the Press of its extent and whereabouts.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Baxter's point was that farmers were inclined to rush produce on to the market and sell it at a low price, and asked <Col N="1086" /> whether the Department would be inclined to give any advice to the farmers on that point.  Speaking for the Department, I may say that I would advise the farmers not to lose their heads in this crisis and to refuse to part with their produce except at reasonable prices.  I am of opinion, so far as anyone can come to any conclusions in a situation which is shifting from day to day, that if farmers exercise ordinary care and discretion in regard to the time at which they go to market, they will be able to obtain a reasonable price for their produce, and they should not be tempted to part with their produce at an unduly low price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if there is any justification for the prices that have been offered, especially for bacon, according to today's papers&mdash;if the tendency rather should not be for the prices to rise instead of fall?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I explain, in answer to Deputy Prior, that I was dealing with foodstuffs which are not produced in this country&mdash;for instance, tea, sugar, rice, and things of that kind&mdash;and the President quite understood the meaning of my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I can hardly answer the question as to whether there is any justification for the prices ruling yesterday for bacon.  I would point out that farmers had notice since Sunday of the strike in Great Britain; that as a result of that it was, at least, likely that transport would be held up; and that, consequently, buyers would be scarce and extremely cautious.  It was bad business from the farmer's point of view, if he could have held over his produce for a week or a fortnight or a month, to market it, say yesterday, after he had got notice of that kind. The point of my advice is this: Farmers should realise that nobody can say for certain when this strike will end, but that there is a possibility that it will end at a reasonable time. Therefore, they should not get panicky and rush their stock and produce on to the market, if they are in a position to hold that stock or produce over for <Col N="1087" /> a week or a fortnight or three weeks and clear it on a market which may be perfectly free.  It is not quite fair to put all the blame on the buyers if, after having notice given on Sunday and Monday, farmers yesterday came into the market with large quantities of pigs and pork.  The buyers, of course, did as buyers always will do: they bought the produce at the cheapest price, and farmers should have foreseen that that would occur immediately after a very big strike had been declared and when no one was in a position to measure its duration or possible reaction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The exact point I want to get out is that the Irish farmers have less to fear than the farmers of any other country that supply England. We are nearer to England, and we must anticipate that some service will be opened up between the two countries in order to supply the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point.  If the English markets open for food supplies, the Irish farmers may take it for certain that they will have an advantage as against any other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is due to the coal merchants to say that they have been in touch with the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the information conveyed to me goes to show that they have been very just and equitable in their dealings.  They are willing to conform to any reasonable requirements of the Government and they have maintained the very highest traditions of business rectitude since the strike began.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the President has said with regard to the action of the coal merchants, is he aware that in Wicklow notices have been placed in the windows of the coal merchants stating that there will be an increase of 10/- per ton from Monday next?  The President said that there was no reason to put up prices, but where the coal owners are working in co-operation, as they are in this case, there is no alternative for the buyers except to pay the increased price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer was <Col N="1088" /> concerned with coal which had been in stock prior to this trouble.  I do not know what the relative price will be in connection with coal brought in from other countries since the trouble&mdash; whether it will be cheaper or dearer. But with regard to the commodities in stock prior to the trouble there is no reason whatever why there should be an increase in price.</P>

The proprietor of the hotel in which I stay had to pay 7/- per ton extra for coal in the last day or two.  Can the President do anything to prevent profiteering of that kind taking place?</P>

      <P>I cannot answer any question like that of an individual instance, nor can I answer the complaint of any individual letter that appears on the situation.  I am dealing with the general action of the coal merchants in Dublin.  There may be a particular coal dealer who charges in excess of the normal prices.  I am dealing with the Coal Merchants' Association, and they have not increased the price.</P>

    <Title>FINANCIAL RESOLUTIONS&mdash;REPORT. - RESOLUTION No. 7 (DEBATE RESUMED).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 7.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>This Resolution concerns wine, and I would like to ask the Minister for Finance why he has not taken steps to prevent profiteering by wine merchants by charging the increased price on wines which they had in stock prior to the passing of this Resolution?  I would also ask the Minister whether he has seen a letter in the Press from a parish priest concerning the increased price of altar wines.  When the Minister for Finance introduces Resolutions like this, increasing the duty on wine, he should make it quite clear in regard to any commodity on which an extra duty has been placed that the stocks in hands of merchants which had not been subject to the duty should be sold at the usual price.  In his letter to the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; on Monday last, the parish priest says: &ldquo;I called yesterday on my grocer to order my supply of altar wine as usual.  The grocer informed me that owing to the new tax on wines the price of altar <Col N="1090" /> wines were advanced 5/- per dozen or 5d. per bottle, and I had to pay 35/- per dozen for what I bought for 30/- before the tax.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A great deal of wine is used on altars, and I think the Minister for Finance should have instructions issued to wine merchants that they should not increase prices on the stocks in their possession prior to the tax. Altar wine is not manufactured in the Saorstát.  Indeed I do not know why a tax should be put upon that particular wine at all.  I think it would be useful information if others besides this P.P. would write to the Press and show where profiteering was taking place.  It is not right that wine merchants should get this advantage which gives them an opportunity for profiteering.  I should like to know whether the Minister has anything to say in regard to the wine already in hands of those merchants before the tax was imposed.  Are the wine merchants entitled to charge the extra duty to the public on wines which were in their hands prior to the imposition of the tax?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put the case to the Minister that altar wines should be exempted altogether from tax.  I take it that the tax on wine is a tax on luxury, and I suggest to the Minister that it would be only right that altar wines should be exempt from any tax.  It is not in keeping with the principle upon which the Minister imposes taxes that altar wines should be covered by them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not practicable to exempt altar wines.  They have always been charged.  As I said when introducing the Resolution, there is no reason why the price should be advanced on wines.  The prices charged to the public bear no relation at all to the cost at which they are bought plus the duty.  The rate of profit is simply enormous, and this extra tax is no reason at all for any increase in retail price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BEAMISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that there is no need for a committee at all? The competition in the wine trade&mdash; and I know a little about it&mdash;is so great that no man will unduly raise the price of wine.  If he did there would be fifty others ready to sell it at a cheaper price.  Deputy Lyons is naturally a kindly man, and I hope his fear will be dismissed by the knowledge that the competition would be too great, and that if I cannot make a shilling I am satisfied with sixpence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the point of view that Deputy Beamish expresses that raises doubts in my mind as to the Minister's position on this wine duty. We are all familiar with the contention that competition between traders or merchants or manufacturers will, in the long run&mdash;and perhaps not too long a run&mdash;bring down prices to a normal economic level.  That is the theory. But the Minister for Finance, three times since the Budget speech, has told us that there is an inordinate profit on wine, and I am prepared to accept the Minister's judgment on this matter because I have no doubt he has made specific inquiries.  Why has this competition not affected the price of wine in the past?  How does the abnormal profit result?  Is it because there has been a sudden drop in the import price, or is it not a fact that this abnormal profit on wines has been existing for a long time, and that the effects of competition in the trade have not been such as to bring down the price to a normal level, that is to say, the wholesale price, plus a normal profit?  I want to find out where the truth lies between Deputy Beamish and the Minister.  I invite the Minister to give us some more information as to the rate of profit on wines and to do what Deputy Lyons suggests a profiteering commission would do, at very much less expense than a commission would involve.  If the Minister has information regarding the rate of profit on the various kinds of wines made by the merchants for whom Deputy Beamish makes himself the spokesman, the public would know <Col N="1092" /> what would be a reasonable price to pay for wine, and we might have effective competition.  Deputy Beamish would not object, I am sure, to this effective competition, inasmuch as he says that it already exists.  But if the Minister can prove to us that it does not exist I am sure Deputy Beamish would enter the trade and help to bring down the price to a normal level.</P>

That is within the scope of the Committee that is now sitting, and I hope that they will report on it.  I have had certain instances before me of what I regarded as inordinate profits in wines, but I will not produce these instances because they might happen to be isolated instances. I do not think they are.  I am satisfied that they are not, but it is not my function to carry out an inquiry into the profits in the wine trade.  I think it is pretty generally known that the same class of wines may be sold in one shop at twice the price that is charged in another shop, and I believe that the reason why the competition in this <Col N="1093" /> trade has not been effective is that to a very large extent it is looked upon as a luxury trade, and the public do not buy very keenly.</P>

      <P>Owing to the idea that prevailed in the Saorstát for the last three or four months that the Minister was about to reduce the duty on spirits, a considerable number of merchants did not withdraw from bond the quantity of whiskey that they wanted for their trade during the summer.  They are now prepared, if they can get permission, to withdraw the five years old whiskey that is now specified.  If the Minister does not give them permission to do so a number of them will run dry during the summer and there will be no singing.  On behalf of a great number of members of the licensed trade who would be at a considerable disadvantage under these circumstances, I would ask the Minister to allow them to withdraw the five years old whiskey, but not the other that he is almost justified in stopping the sale of.  I would be very grateful if he would make that concession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very doubtful whether that could be done with our present powers.  There are powers in the Immature Spirits Act for restricting the issue of the allowance of spirits out of bond, but I do not think that we could allow unlimited withdrawals of one class of spirits and restrict the issue of another class.  The position is, I think, that for the present, until the legislation which will be introduced in a day or so becomes law, carrying out the promise I made in my Budget statement, we will have to pursue a policy of a general restriction of the issue of spirits from bond.  But I am quite prepared, if the restrictions at present in force seem to be undue restrictions, to consider any facts that may be put before me, and I might increase the allowance.  The present issues are based on the issues of the first three <Col N="1094" /> months of the last financial year.  It would be possible to add a percentage to the amount that might be issued, if that were thought desirable.  But we have to take care that there is not a big withdrawal of, say, three years old or four years old spirits before the Bill which has yet to be introduced becomes law.  Certain representations have been made, and the position has been explained to those who made them, and I think on the whole they were satisfied that it was in the best interests of everybody that the restrictions should hold until we got legislation on the matter.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the unfair preference that Scotch whiskey has at present.  I want to know if this Resolution is in any way intended <Col N="1095" /> to rectify the preference of Scotch whiskey against Irish in the six degrees of lower strength at which it can be sold for the same price as Irish?  I understand that some time ago legislation was promised to hold up the withdrawal of whiskey from bond until it was three years old, and now the Minister has referred to an increase of duty here on whiskey that is withdrawn before it is five years old.  I think that is a very valuable provision, but how far it is intended to rectify, or whether it will rectify to any extent, the unfair preference given to Scotch whiskey as against our distilling trade I would like to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that there is no unfair preference for Scotch whiskey.  Scotch whiskey is normally sold at 30 degrees under proof.  In order that it could be sold at that strength the bottle has to be labelled so that customers may know they are buying spirits of that strength.  There is nothing at all to prevent Irish whiskey being sold at the same strength under the same conditions. The talk that we hear about a preference for Scotch whiskey is talk without any foundation whatever.  I do not know exactly what effect the proposals about warehousing spirits for five years will have on the sale of Scotch whiskey.  We are introducing these new regulations because we think the Irish whiskey trade will prosper, if it is to prosper at all, on having a reputation for quality as the best whiskey. Scotch whiskey is made under the patent still process which is a cheaper process.  Pot still whiskey, which is the whiskey we are concerned with, is made by a process that is dearer.  It can only compete with the other whiskey if it has the very highest reputation. That reputation is injured if it is sold without being properly matured. We believe that we cannot control all the factors which will affect the reputation of the Irish whiskey trade, but at least we can see that at home conditions are observed which will ensure that its reputation is of the highest possible for quality.  It may be that this will have the effect at any rate for the present, of restricting the sale of <Col N="1096" /> Scotch whiskey, because patent still whiskey does not improve by being matured in the way that pot still whiskey does.  Scotch whiskey is at present matured for three years because the Act of 1919 obliges it to be kept for that period.  I do not know whether any of it is kept for a longer period. If it is, then this particular provision that we are going to introduce will not affect the Scotch whiskey trade.  If, on the other hand, there is little or no Scotch whiskey over three years old, it would, of course, prevent the sale of Scotch whiskey until there is a supply available of the requisite age, 5 years. It is a matter on which there is no precise information.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister has quite answered the point raised by Deputy McGoldrick. You may, of course, purchase a bottle of Scotch whiskey at 12/6 marked 30 under proof, as against Irish whiskey, for which you pay perhaps 15/-.  At the same time if you go into a public-house and order a glass of Scotch whiskey you pay the same price for the Scotch whiskey, as far as my information goes, as you pay for the Irish whiskey.  Therefore there is a great inducement for the retailer to sell Scotch whiskey in preference to the Irish whiskey because he is able to purchase it at a much lower rate.</P>

    <P>In paragraph (1), lines 2 and 3, to delete the words &ldquo;Thirty-three <Col N="1097" /> and one-third per cent.&rdquo; and to substitute the words &ldquo;five per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to reduce the scale of duty from thirty-three and one-third per cent. to five per cent. I put forward this amendment because I think that a duty of thirty-three and one-third per cent. imposed on a new trade, if you like a new luxury trade, is going to kill that trade.  The habit of wireless is not yet fully established in this country.  I do not think there are any accurate or authentic figures but I am quite certain from personal observation that one does not see anything like the same number of wireless aerials in the suburbs of Dublin as one sees in the suburbs of London. Where one does see them, one sees them on the smallest and poorest houses. Wireless is becoming a luxury of the wage-earner, the man who lives in a house rented at not more than 10/- per week.  These are the houses one sees aerials on.  Of course there are some indoor aerials and some frame aerials that one does not see, in wealthier houses, but I do suggest that to put a duty of thirty-three and one-third per cent. on a new commodity, a commodity that has not yet come into general use, will check the use of that particular commodity, particularly when it is a tax-paying commodity or a licence-paying commodity.  We want our wireless broadcasting station to be self-supporting. I certainly do.  I do not think we are going to make it self-supporting by inflicting such a serious charge, a tax of one-third of the value of every article of wireless equipment of whatever kind imported.  This, I take it, is a revenue tax and not a protective tax.  Though Deputy Sears may tell me that there are the greatest possible prospects for wireless manufacturing industry in this country, I doubt if we have the necessary skilled labour, persons equipped with a sufficient technique in electricity to build up a wireless industry.  That being so, I would urge the Minister that for the first year, at any rate, he should take a low revenue duty that will enable him to assess the amount of wireless apparatus imported and that will give him all the information he needs as to the possible expansion of this tax, but that he <Col N="1098" /> should not crush the industry by imposing a tax of £33 6s. 8d. on every £100 worth of wireless goods imported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with an aspect of this question which must strike anybody who has taken the trouble to think about it.  People in the rural parts of the country can have no benefit whatever from wireless developments except through a valve set. If they have not a valve set they cannot listen in.  That is the position of the rural community.  Outside some of the large towns there are practically no amusements of any description.  There are no educational entertainments, and the people have nothing to do after a hard day's work except to take up some work in their own homes or sit down doing nothing.  There are no concerts, no theatres, no cinemas, no music halls, no bands, and they cannot listen-in to the central station as it is not within reach of a cheap wireless set.  To put on a tax of 33? per cent. would aggravate still further the extraordinary position in which the rural population is placed.  I understand that with a crystal set the central station can be picked up within a radius of 20 miles, and that the cost of that set, including the licence, would be under £10.  I am speaking subject to correction as I have no experience in these matters.</P>

      <P>If that is so the case is more aggravated.  I am given to understand that you cannot buy a valve set under £30, so that if 33 1-3 per cent. is added it would make an installation of that kind cost about £40. Is any attempt to be made to cater for the rural population and to give them facilities equal to those living in more populous centres?  I think the Minister must take that question into serious consideration and also the advisability of abandoning this duty altogether. The idea that the rural population should help to build up a fund for the development of wireless is an extraordinary proposition.  In other words, it means that those who have every <Col N="1099" /> advantage are to get every advantage and that those who have no advantages will be left without them.  I do not suppose that is the policy.  We will soon see what is the Minister's definite policy.  It is no argument to say that the tax will bring in so much money, or, to ask: &ldquo;How will you get revenue if you do not put on this duty?&rdquo;  There are other things from which money could be more justifiably got.  I think we have come to the end of all things if it is claimed that it is right to tax everything that produces revenue.  By that reasoning robbery will be sufficient justification if it brings in revenue.</P>

      <P>But you can make it the law just as you are making the collection of this tax law.  One is as justifiable as the other.  I think the two things are on the same plane. Equality is not maintained by the proposal in the Resolution.  I seriously suggest to the Minister that the customs duty should be abolished altogether on valve sets.  I do not suppose it is the policy of any Government to encourage the people to congregate in the towns and to leave the rural communities. But if they want to enjoy the amenities of life provided by the State they have to do so.  If this proposal is carried it means that people in the rural communities cannot have the same services at their disposal as people living in the city.  The proposal seems on a par with that of a merchant or a pedlar who goes to a jail where someone is starving, and says: &ldquo;I can give you food at a price,&rdquo; that price being three or four times its value.  The hungry man has no alternative and would have to pay. In the country it is the same.  The people have no other means of entertainment, and the Resolution is going on the assumption that, because they are in that position, they will pay no matter how unreasonable or unjust the tax is.  The Minister puts himself into the position of Shylock, any tax being justified under the circumstances, because, as a last resort, the man will pay.</P>

      <P>When we had this Resolution before us on a previous occasion I said pretty well what was in my mind.  I do not want to repeat now what I said then, but I feel very strongly that the urgent and important thing is to popularise this new broadcasting. If we want to popularise and to make it pay for itself we should not impose restrictions on its use.  I agree with Deputy Gorey that the desirable thing is to make it accessible throughout the country.  I do not think that Deputy Gorey does the Minister justice in that particular connection.  I think it is quite obvious that the Minister is also anxious to spread the service.</P>

It is not the Minister's wish or view in the matter I am calling in question, but it is his method which, I think, is not a wise method.  It seems to me that this capital expenditure is only to be provided over a term of years, but the urgent thing is to meet the annual outlay by licence fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is hardly representing what I intended to convey when he talks about a capital sum.  I was not thinking of a capital sum. A capital sum could be provided otherwise. My view is that if we put up a number of stations, we are certainly going to lose heavily if we depend on licence fees solely for their maintenance. This tax is with a view to not having a heavy annual charge on the general taxpayers for the maintenance of stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point on which we differ.  My belief is that if we start these stations in chosen places we shall have them in districts where they will not immediately but very rapidly become self-supporting, so far as the annual costs are concerned, by means of the licence fees. It is to the licence fees we ought to look to pay the annual costs.  When we have our system in proper working order in Dublin, I have no doubt we <Col N="1101" /> shall find that the licence fees coming from Dublin and district will pay the cost of upkeep&mdash;if they do not go further&mdash;of the Dublin station.  As soon as this is attained&mdash;or perhaps earlier&mdash;we might proceed to erect a station in another district, where there will be such a number of people paying licences as will pay for the upkeep costs of that station.  The annual costs of a small sub-station will not be very much.  They will be very much less than those of the main station, and you will not require an extremely large number of licence holders in that district to make it self-supporting.  If you want to secure that, sooner or later, you should not handicap the whole industry by this tax.  I oppose the tax as a whole principally for that reason, but partly, also, because of the difficulty there is in distinguishing between apparatus used for wireless broadcasting and apparatus used for general scientific purposes.  It is almost impossible to prove or show that a particular piece of apparatus used for electrical purposes generally cannot be used, or is not going to be used at some time or other, in connection with a wireless set or for some wireless experiment or purpose.  I think it would be almost impossible to separate the two things.  If the duty is a small one, that difficulty becomes of less importance.  But it still remains a source of trouble and annoyance to all purchasers of scientific apparatus who would have to pay a small duty.  It will be inevitable that this tax of 33? per cent. will be paid on articles bought and used for other purposes than wireless broadcasting.  This tax is, to a certain extent, not fair on people who have to buy apparatus for other purposes.  To my mind, it is also unwise, because if you are going to extend or improve the education of the country you should make a matter of this kind as accessible to the ordinary public as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Thrift has covered most of the ground which I had intended to cover, in supporting Deputy Cooper's amendment.  I should like to emphasise the point made by Deputy Gorey as to the unfair incidence of this tax on users of wireless. <Col N="1102" /> It seems to me that those who live at such a distance from the station as to necessitate the use of valve sets will be at a very great disadvantage as compared with those who are living in the immediate vicinity of the station.  I am afraid, if this tax is persisted in, it will put wireless beyond the reach of a great many people who are anxious to make use of it.  Not alone that, but it will have a psychological effect.  People will talk about the tax on these wireless sets and, in their minds, the amount will be magnified.  They will believe that the high price they have to pay will be due to a greater extent than it really will be to the tax.  The man who lives within the crystal set radius of the Dublin station can enjoy the Dublin programme at a cost, including licence, of about £5.  A great many people can afford that sum.  But they are the people who enjoy most of the other advantages.  They are not the people whom one would desire to encourage specially to use wireless.  A wireless set would be of greater benefit to the people of an outlying district. To them wireless would be a boon.  It would brighten the lives of the residents of lonely districts.  If it were a case of getting in a certain amount of revenue&mdash;and that is the only case that has been made up to the present&mdash;I should certainly prefer, if I had the choice, that the licence of the crystal sets should remain at £1 than that this tax should be put on.  It would be fairer if the crystal user had still to pay a tax of £1.  He would still have a great advantage over the rural user of wireless, who would have to pay the same tax and who would have to pay a greater price for a set in order to hear the station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After a careful consideration of the matter.  I put it seriously to the Minister that, if it is a question of bringing in a certain amount of revenue for wireless, it would be fairer to continue the licence fee for the crystal set user at £1 than to use this method of raising revenue.  At all events, I think it would be better to do that and let things continue for a couple of years until he would see what the position was in regard to revenue.  The Minister has said that it is not a question of raising capital expenditure for erecting stations, <Col N="1103" /> but it is a question of the maintenance of the Dublin station.  I believe, if stations were put up in suitable districts, that in a couple of years the income from the licences would be practically sufficient to maintain these stations, especially if the programmes were extended to meet the varying needs of the population.  At present these programmes are limited, but they could be extended to meet needs other than those which they cater for at present. I think the Minister is taking a step in the wrong direction in imposing this exceedingly heavy&mdash;practically prohibitive&mdash;tax at this stage in the development of wireless.  It will be difficult, as Deputy Thrift has pointed out, to collect.  Certain things will surely be introduced which will ultimately find their way into wireless sets.  For instance, wire is one of the component parts of a wireless set.  I do not know how the Minister will make a distinction and charge a tax on that particular type of wire.  I oppose the proposal on the general question that it will strike a blow at the development of wireless in the country and for the reason that, in my opinion, the incidence of the tax would work out in an exceedingly unfair way against the rural population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was unfortunate, A Chinn Comhairle, in not catching your eye in time, because the two last speakers have taken a lot of my thunder away.  As a consequence, I will be obliged to repeat much of what has already been said.  I desire to support the idea underlying the statement made by Deputy O'Connell, namely, that rather than penalise the rural dweller it should be insisted that the £1 licence be paid by the crystal set holder.  The crisis that has occurred in England at the present time affords one a pretty good idea of the advantage that is to be gained by this country from a general use of wireless telegraphy.  Questions arising out of this crisis were addressed to the Minister for Agriculture to-day.  If wireless telegraphy were in general use in the country, it would not be necessary to address these questions to the Minister because the information could be communicated to <Col N="1104" /> the people all over the country from a central wireless station.  By that means market prices and other information of importance to the farmer could also be communicated to him.  Information supplied promptly to him in that way would enable him to make arrangements to meet situations like the present one, and would be of the greatest advantage to him in carrying on his business.  That is one of the underlying reasons, apart from the educational advantages of wireless, why we are opposed to this tariff of 33? per cent.  Wireless has now become a necessary element in civilisation, and in rural areas may be utilised with the most beneficial results When this matter was last discussed the Minister for Finance referred to the furniture tax of 33? per cent., and said that at present we were paying nearly as much in respect of that tax as we will be paying in regard to this new tariff of 33? per cent. on wireless sets.  When the Minister comes to reply I would be glad if he would tell us what really we are paying under the head of the furniture tax for wireless.  The Minister on a previous occasion referred to this furniture tax and used it as an argument in support of this new tariff of 33? per cent.  I am aware that cases, cabinets and other containers used in connection with wireless would be classed as furniture under the present law.  I am anxious, however, to get precise information as to what part of the necessary equipment used in connection with wireless apparatus comes at the present time under the furniture tax. I hold, of course, that the argument put forward by the Minister is no argument whatever for the imposition of this new tariff of 33? per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gorey stated the position very plainly when he stated that the people in the country were running to the cities.  We do not want that.  We wish to keep the people on the land and it is our desire to do everything to attain that end.  We believe that nothing should be set up that would tend to drive people from the country to the towns.  It is our opinion that this tariff of 33? per cent. is going to stop development in the utilisation of wireless amongst the farmers of the <Col N="1105" /> country except, perhaps, the very large ones.  We are told that there is a development in the use of wireless in the case of hotels, club-rooms, bars and so on We agree that these people have already secured wireless installations, but I ask would it be an encouragement for the general run of farmers to purchase wireless sets if you persist in the imposition of this tariff of 33? per cent.?  I say it will not.  If we are to wait until the fund that has been referred to is sufficiently strong to provide the people, generally, all over the country with the opportunity of getting in crystal sets, well then I am afraid we will have to wait a very long time. I suggest to the Minister that he would be very well advised to do away with this tax entirely and to give the rural dweller the same opportunity that is now enjoyed by dwellers in the cities.</P>

      <P>The last speaker, as well as some of the previous speakers, proceeded on the assumption that this tax will impede rather than develop the use of crystal sets.  If we are genuinely anxious that crystal sets should be at the disposal of every citizen in the country, then we should support the proposal before the House, which aims at providing the necessary finances to bring that situation about. Our present position is, that through capital and current charges we have spent, or contemplate spending during the present financial year, something like £45,000.  I am not quite sure of the figure, but it will be in the region of the sum mentioned.  It is very unlikely that our income will exceed £20,000.  It may, perchance, with a good deal of activity on the part of the Detective Department which must necessarily be set up for the purpose, reach the figure of £25,000, thus leaving a net deficit on the first year of £20,000. With a Bill of that kind facing the Minister for Finance, and taking into consideration, as he necessarily must, the agitation in this House for economy, I would certainly be most reluctant to approach him for further big funds essential for the rapid spread of this service.  The proposal here arms me with the necessary courage to do so.</P>

There may, of course, be a belt of country where valve sets will still be necessary, but these will be limited belts.

      <P>I am not aware that you are, but going on the assumption that the wireless station is a losing concern, then all will contribute something.  We are taking steps to ensure that it will <Col N="1107" /> not be a losing concern, and nobody will pay for wireless except those who use it.  That is not an unreasonable proposition.  If a man wants music or entertainment we say he must pay for it, and his next-door neighbour, who does not want this entertainment, must not be asked to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who pay for the wireless sets, and nobody else, that is on the assumption that the station pays for itself.  If it does not pay for itself then the taxpayer must make up the deficiency, but we are taking steps so that the uninterested taxpayer will not have to pay for it.  There is no question whatever of trying to differentiate against the rural user.  That is admitted. It cannot happen.  If the rural user is brought within the crystal circle he would then be in precisely the same position as the urban user, and he would get his crystal set for 15/- or £1, just as the urban purchaser gets his, so that there would be no difference. If it happens that he is on the edge of the circle, or in one of those small, unprovided spaces, then, unquestionably, he has a grievance, but the number of people who will have grievances of that type will be comparatively small.  This question of a tax on imported wireless is not a new one.  It was introduced in the first instance prior to the establishment of the wireless station.  I was in favour of that, but it was not agreed on.  My Department took my view, but the Committee took another.  Nor was this country alone in collecting a tax on imported wireless.  A tax of the kind is collected in a great many other countries, and therefore there is nothing new in collecting a wireless tax here.  Further, I do not see any great difficulty in doing so, and there is certainly no more difficuly than in collecting any other tax the Minister imposes.  The suggestion that we wish to provide amusements for urban dwellers at the expense of rural ones is certainly a most extraordinary one.  I am not prepared to suggest to the Minister that he should spend the comparatively large sum of <Col N="1108" /> money necessary for the erection of three more wireless stations, and commit himself to a large annual outlay in connection with these stations until I am satisfied that there are good prospects of a reasonable revenue.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I should have mentioned that I discussed the question of 10/- or £1 licences with certain Deputies who are interested in wireless activity, and they agreed, or rather argued, that in the case of crystal sets users the fee should be 10/-.  I was rather reluctant to reduce the fee to 10/-, in the absence of the prospect of a self-supporting station, but I took that plunge and I was prepared to chance it believing that the revenue which is now suggested would materialise. Otherwise I would not have favoured that reduction.  I wish to point out, further, than it is a distinct advantage to the crystal user to get the benefit of 10/- a year off his licence fee, and in addition by paying the 5/- import duty for a single import&mdash;a nonrecurring item&mdash;he is certainly getting an advantage.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to answer Deputy Heffernan's question in full.  We make the point that as things are at present all the taxpayers are contributing money towards the cost of the wireless station, and only a few are able to benefit from that expenditure. The State is still responsible for a possible loss in the running of that station, and the Minister has told us that he is taking steps to see that this station will be no longer run at a loss, and that the users of the station will pay for the running of it.  When the Minister makes that statement does he suggest that the users, or possible users, in the rural districts if they are to benefit from the station will have to pay 33? per cent. on their valve sets? Is he taking that into account when he says that the users of the stations in the future are going to pay for the station? By what means is the Minister going to make the station pay for itself?  Is he going to increase the licence fee of the people who have sets, or may have sets in the future, or does he intend that the station shall pay for itself not alone by licence fees but by the revenue that will accrue from the imposition of the 33? per cent.?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Down the country very few sets, comparatively, are installed, and very little is known of wireless broadcasting.  The cost of these sets to a good many people who desire to have them will be prohibitive, and the taste for wireless will be restricted <Col N="1112" /> because of the want of knowledge. I was making the point&mdash;the Minister for Finance may be a little amused, but the point still stands&mdash; that if we are going to have transmission stations erected here and there they will enable crystal set owners to have wireless in about twelve months all over the country.  We are to wait certainly for the erection of these stations before they will purchase wireless sets.  The sets the people are going to purchase at first are going to be crystal sets.  The Minister tells us that the installation of crystal sets means, in many cases, the installation later on of valve sets.  If the Minister is waiting for his revenue until the valve sets are installed, he will first have to wait until the crystal sets are installed, and the crystal sets will not be installed until the transmission stations are erected.  I cannot see where the £20,000 of revenue is going to come from this year or how it is going to come.  On that alone, I think there is a case made for not insisting on the imposition of this duty this year.  No matter how you look at it, the point is that the State has borne the expense up to the moment of the erection of the station that exists.  It is paying the loss, if there is a loss.  The whole State is paying it.  If people are benefiting, and great numbers are excluded, the people who are benefited have already their sets.  There is no duty imposed on these sets.  The Minister informed us that there was some duty put on as furniture.  I do not know how much, but I assume that it was considerably less than 33? per cent. of the cost of the set.  The position now is, and no one can dispute it, that the rural dweller is put in an unfair position as compared with the people of the cities.  This position will prevent the installation of these valve sets in many places in town and country where the people were considering the installation of them. These people will now wait before installing their sets until the transmission stations are erected.  There will be many hundreds and many thousands of people who would procure sets and come in quicker if the duty were not imposed.  Now they will not get the <Col N="1113" /> valve sets because of their want of knowledge of wireless, and that will be due to the fact that even valve sets will not be procured by many people who would procure them if this impost were not put on.  In halls and such places in the rural districts there has been going on for some time the consideration of the installation of sets. I hold that the imposition of this 33? per cent. duty will absolutely prevent such installations taking place, and if these people have to wait for another twelve months before putting in the sets the revenue that will accrue from this imposition is going to be a good deal less than the Minister suggests.  All the good that would come, educationally and otherwise, to the users of wireless will be kept back for twelve months longer and the development will be withheld.  That is unfair if you want wireless sets used in the homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy has followed me very closely.  I said on a previous occasion that I intended proceeding at once with the erection of the Cork station, soon after with the erection of the Western station, and then, perhaps, with a Northern station.  There is no suggestion that the three stations will be erected slap bang at one time.  The intention is to get ahead now if we have the necessary means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cork station, if it is erected, will serve only a small area; it will serve crystal set users only in that district.  Taking the development of wireless broadcasting in the Saorstát as a whole, it will be held up for at least twelve months.  If you want to cultivate a taste for wireless, if you want to give people an opportunity of experiencing it, you must offer some encouragement.  A taste for wireless can only come when it is possible for the people to possess wireless sets.  There may be people in the country prepared to spend £30 on a set, but that will not apply to many. I have no doubt a taste for wireless could be cultivated if one or two people in an area had sets and others in that area had an opportunity of listening-in.  You are going to restrict <Col N="1114" /> even the possibility of that if you impose this duty.  The result will be that later on when you erect stations the numbers you will have applying for licences will be hundreds and thousands less than would otherwise be the case.  I suggest that you should withhold this impost for at least another Budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment moved by Deputy Cooper.  I am in agreement with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in so far as he objects to having this charge for wireless placed on the public funds.  In view of the other social services which are needed, it is undesirable at the present time to have the taxpayer, through the State, bearing the greater portion of the charge. I am with the Minister in the suggestion that the charge ought normally and naturally fall on the person who enjoys wireless reception.  The question arises whether the money which we are asked now to raise by taxation will be used to the best advantage. The point as to whether we ought to consent to his proposals is another and a different matter.</P>
      <P>If I understand the Minister correctly, he proposes to erect three further stations in the country.  Why should he erect three more stations? Does not that seem to be an uneconomic proposal?  Would not one high-power station, centrally situated, serve a much better purpose?  Already we have an indication in the Estimates of the intention to erect a station in Cork.  That will mean two wireless broadcasting stations erected on the sea-coast.  It is true that they will be situated in populous areas, but nevertheless I am of opinion that a great part of the wireless waves will be lost; the full benefit of reception will not be enjoyed by residents in the Saorstát. All the waves that go seawards are lost, and you have only a semicircular area around each station in which Saorstát residents can receive what is broadcasted.  The radius of reception would be about ten or twelve miles.  I am not an expert on this matter, but I understand that the radius would be something like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the station were more centrally <Col N="1115" /> situated, people could receive over a much larger area.  With a centrally situated station, an area twice as large can be covered, giving good reception. If you have a high-power station naturally the radius will be extended to a greater extent and a wide territory can be brought in.</P>
    <P>There is a further matter I would like to touch upon.  Will the stations it is intended to erect be merely relaying stations, or will they broadcast individually?  Will they have a wavelength of their own?  In that event where is it proposed to secure the talent?  If it is the Minister's intention merely to use them as relaying stations, it evidently appears to be an uneconomic thing not to have a high-power station.</P>

      <P>The Deputies on the Farmers' benches want to make a particular point about rural users, but the only way in which the question of what is going to be done with the money is relevant is this: that the revenue which will be gained from the proposed imposition of these taxes will be used for the benefit of listenersin. How it is to be used is another question.  If Deputies will consider the matter for a moment they will see that otherwise we might get into a debate that might last a long time.  This is a matter which will arise on the Broadcasting <Col N="1116" /> Bill and which will, to a certain extent, arise also on the Estimate for broadcasting stations, for which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs must answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am remembering also the matter of the incidence of taxation.  Already we have put up a station in Dublin, and a number of people, by no means poor people, have installed crystal sets.  The station was put up at the public expense.  It is the intention to lower the annual licence on crystal sets to 10/-; in other words, this will benefit the favoured few in Dublin who are by no means the poorer of the population but are people who can very well afford to pay a reasonable charge for reception.  The intention is to lower the licence fee and give them wireless programmes at a cheaper figure and at the public cost.</P>
      <P>In order to set up further stations we have to penalise, to the extent of this 33? per cent. tax, the rest of the community.  Anybody who in future requires a wireless set must pay this duty.  Down the country it is absolutely impossible to receive outside of ten or fifteen miles from Dublin.  I think the proposal is most unfair.  If we want to spread wireless, to popularise it, as Deputy Thrift said, we ought not to impose prohibitive charges or put on duties which will prevent people who otherwise would be users from becoming users.  I hope Deputy Cooper will seek a division on his amendment.  I mean to vote for the amendment if he does.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have some more figures in regard to this question.  The justification for the proposal seems to lie in the statement of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that he dare not&mdash;and would not have the hardihood in face of the campaign for economy&mdash;to go to the Minister for <Col N="1117" /> Finance and ask him for capital to enable him to put up other stations besides the Cork station unless he had in hand an assurance from the Dáil that there was going to be an income derived from imports.  That is the position as stated by the Minister.  If he can be assured that there is going to be a duty on these imports which will bring in, according to the Minister for Finance, a revenue of £20,000 a year, then he is prepared to ask for capital amounting to £22,000, based upon the Estimate, to erect these four stations.</P>

    <P>As I say, I should like to have a Budget statement on this matter.  The suggestion of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is that, by the erection of those four stations, he would have an immense increase in the number of crystal set users.  Pretty well everyone in the country would be in a position to hear wireless programmes by the use of a crystal set and, in consequence, the crystal set would be in demand all over the country.  The Minister for Finance goes a little further and says that, having accustomed the people to using the crystal sets, they would go on to the valve sets and, of course, that would help to increase the revenue. The change over from crystal to valve sets does not increase the number of licence-holders.  It means you abandon your crystal set.  On these two statements, the £20,000 a year income on this Customs duty means an import of £60,000 worth of apparatus at the ports, and assuming that the difference between the port price and the selling price is 100 per cent., we have £120,000 worth of apparatus sold to the public per annum.  If you have got 2,000 people each buying a valve set per annum at the price of £20, that is a port price of £10, we have £20,000 of valve sets, but then we have to assume that we are to have £40,000 of crystal sets at £1 port price.  That brings us £60,000 worth of apparatus at the ports per annum.  Forty thousand users means 40,000 licence-holders, and that means at a pound each £40,000. At the proposed rate it will mean a drop of £20,000 in the revenue from licences.  I cannot see from those figures where the justification is for this hesitation on the part of the Minister. <Col N="1118" /> The price of the Cork station is £5,500.  Four times that would be £22,000.  The case as presented does not seem to me to justify the imposition of this 33? per cent. duty as a revenueproducing operation.</P>
    <P>As I say, I think it would be very necessary for us to have presented a Budget statement of how £20,000 is likely to be arrived at and what is going to be the effect of the duty, and how the reduction to the ten shillings for crystal set users is going to affect the revenue, because, presumably, it is not intended to make the business more than cover expenses.  If these figures of estimated revenue are well founded, there is the immediate justification there would be, certainly, for any business enterprise to expand.  Twenty-two thousand pounds is required for the erection of those stations, and there will be a considerable drop in the price of the licences for crystal sets You should hesitate to spend £20,000 or £25,000 as capital expenditure on working these stations, assuming, for additional cost per annum, say, a thousand a year.  Why, in face of that as a prospective charge, you hesitate when you are assuming that 40,000 people annually will buy crystal sets, I should like some further explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>The text taken by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in connection with this discussion has been that he who calls the tune should pay the piper.  The proposal is to levy a duty of 33? per cent. on imported wireless apparatus.  In the case of a 2-valve or 3-valve set, that is going to hit the user.  When the Minister says that he who pays the piper should call the tune, he should remember that in the case of the valve user there are more stations than the Irish stations. Britain and foreign stations are piping and the valve user gets his set largely for the purpose of hearing British and foreign stations, and the cost of supplying him with broadcasting will not be any greater than the cost of supplying a crystal set user.  I think it would be most unfair to ask the valve user to pay a higher amount in taxation on his set than would be paid by the crystal user.  The Minister for Finance said <Col N="1119" /> that valve sets usually succeed crystal sets, and, of course, that is so.  People having experience of the well-known sameness of the Dublin programmes are anxious to hear other programmes, from other countries.  They buy a valve set for the purpose of doing so, and now it is proposed that the more they desire to hear other stations the more are they going to be taxed.  I think, seeing that it only costs the same to provide broadcasting to the valve user, as for the crystal set user, that if there is to be any tax on wireless apparatus it should not be any higher in the case of a valve set user.  I think, with Deputy Johnson, that we have been groping in the dark on this matter.  I do not think we have had any reliable evidence that there is going to be a deficit or that at the end of 12 months we will be in the position the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs outlines to-day. I think the wise thing, in the absence of better information, is not to enforce a tax until we are convinced that a tax is necessary.</P>

      <P>The problem which we are discussing appears to be one of two questions.  The Ministry require £20,000 additional to run the broadcasting service.  The proposal put up by the Ministry is that they will continue to charge twenty shillings for valve sets and that they will reduce the charge for crystal sets to ten shillings and also that they will put an import duty on all wireless products of 33? per cent.  The proposal on the other side, I take it, is that a flat rate of 20/- be charged upon all wireless sets, whether valve or crystal. These are the two questions before the House.  With regard to the flat rate, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs have expressed an opinion against it.  They seem to think that the user of a crystal set should only be called on to make a smaller payment than that charged, to the user of the valve set.  Might I remind the Ministers, however, that even with a chain of four wireless stations the larger number will be served by these stations only through the medium of valve sets and not through that of crystal sets?</P>

      <P>On this, as on other subjects, the Minister does not see eye to eye with me.  His proposal is to give a preference to crystal set users and to charge this import duty.  Might I remind the Minister that in opposing the flat rate charge he is not upholding the basic principle on which his own Department is run.  If he were to apply the same principle which he is applying in the case of crystal sets to the postal service, what would be the effect?  We who live in the city have to pay for the delivery of a letter in remote parts of the country, posted in College Green or elsewhere, a flat rate of 2d.  If he gives the users of crystal sets in a particular area an advantage, let him apply the same principle to the postal service.  Then it would have very much more force with Deputies than it appears to have at present.  I am strongly in agreement with Deputy Thrift, that considering the fact that wireless to-day is in its infancy and with a great future before it, it should not be taxed and burdened at this particular stage with an import duty.  I believe that that principle is unsound. It is unsound from many points of view because, as a Deputy has pointed out, nobody can tell when wireless apparaatus is imported whether it is for the installation of wireless or for ordinary electrical purposes.  That, in my opinion, carries us into difficulties.  By way of illustration of some of the difficulties experienced in connection with some of our other duties, I may mention that I heard of the case of a man who imported a wireless set and the Customs authorities wanted to charge a furniture tax on the box which surrounded the wireless installation.  In this particular case the authorities were troubled by the fact that the box had what is known as knobs on outside for <Col N="1121" /> the working of the installation inside. Having considered the situation for three days, the authorities came to the conclusion that it was an electrical equipment and not furniture, because the knobs were on the outside.  That is one of the difficulties in connection with this duty, but, apart from such difficulties, it is, in my opinion, unwise to tax this important industry which is really only in its infancy.  If there is any country where wireless can serve a great purpose in the way of educating people and bringing those in scattered districts into touch with city life I think it is this country.  I also think that everything that can be done to encourage the development of the wireless industry in this country should be done, but I am convinced that the method proposed by the Minister is not a step in that direction and, therefore, I will oppose the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proposing this tax because I agree with Deputy Thrift that the important thing is to popularise wireless.  I think that the one way to do that is to extend the facilities for crystal set users.  Wireless will not be popular in this country until everybody can hear our wireless programmes on a crystal set.  It will take more than four stations to achieve that.  You may, with a small number of stations, get the bulk of the country within the range of most crystal sets, but I believe that once the State has taken up the wireless business it will be its duty to provide for everybody with crystal sets, just as everybody has to be provided with postal facilities.  A considerable number of people can, and will, buy valve sets, but the small farmers, the labourers, and the unskilled workers in the towns will not buy these valve sets unless prices come down very much.  I think that the thing we must have particularly in mind is to bring wireless within the reach, so far as we can, of the poor people of the country.  It is for that reason that I favour the reduction of the crystal set licence fee to ten shillings.  If at any time it was proved that there was money to spare, I would then say that the other licence fee should come down to the same extent.  In the meantime, the thing to be done is to try as far as <Col N="1122" /> possible to provide wireless facilities for those in every part of the country who can only afford crystal sets.  That means new stations and fresh expenditure&mdash;recurrent expenditure which will not, so far as we can see, be met out of licence fees for a considerable time. On the other hand, while it is very desirable to extend the service and bring it within the reach of everybody, I do not think it is desirable that the general taxpayer&mdash;the person who may not use wireless&mdash;should be burdened with the charge.  So far as possible, the cost of providing wireless should be met by those who use wireless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think you will ever reach the time when everybody will use it&mdash;certainly that will not occur for a very considerable time. The suggestion that this will bear heavily on the rural population is, I think, not true.  Wherever you have stations you will have valve sets purchased. There will be more valve sets in any area which is a crystal set area than in any corresponding area which has not a station, and in which there are not crystal sets.  The people of Dublin, and the people of Cork who will be the next to be brought within the crystal set range, will contribute more to this £20,000 which we are seeking to get out of the Customs duty than the rural people will provide. Developments are taking place in wireless and there will be a continual purchase of valve sets.  In the present state of our finances, it seems to me that the alternative to finding the money out of the use of wireless for the extension of wireless is simply to go slow&mdash;not to extend the number of stations until the revenue from licence fees has gone up to such an extent as to meet the annual cost.  If we pursue that policy, it will be a very long time before the great majority of the people can avail of wireless through crystal sets.</P>
      <P>I do not think that any very great difficulty will be found in distinguishing between material imported for the use of wireless and for other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> There may be certain articles as to which difficulty will arise, and certain articles which will escape duty, but ordinarily the ambiguous type of article will come in free, unless it is being imported by a wireless dealer, and even if it is being imported by a wireless dealer, if he satisfies the Commissioners that it is imported for another purpose, then it will be exempted.  This is the type of problem with which the Customs authorities have to deal in respect to every class of goods, and I do not think that any very great difficulty will be experienced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to give notice as to any individual article.  If he does give me notice I will answer him all right.  Unless the article is going to be used for wireless, duty will not be chargeable; any of the administrative difficulties that arise can easily be overcome.  The whole question of the financing of wireless is one on which firm figures cannot be given at the moment.  For instance, we do not know what the cost of running the Dublin station will be.  The station is still undeveloped.  Programmes will have to be extended and new features will have to be introduced. There are many features one finds elsewhere not yet available in the Dublin station.  There will have to be considerable extension of programmes, and it is probable, if we have a number of stations, they cannot be entirely relay stations.  We might have three or four relay stations.  If we were going beyond that we should have to provide another station or two from which a separate programme would be sent out, if not every night, at any rate from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we do not develop programmes and provide variety there is no doubt but you will have discontent.  You will be obliged, in some way, to find money for these programmes.  The desirable thing at the moment, to my mind, is <Col N="1124" /> to take what will be a fairly permanent source of revenue from those who are interested in wireless and apply it to extending facilities.  The extension of facilities, we know, will bring increased revenue; but the very extension of facilities will call for additional charges.  As I said, if there was money at any time available, I believe that all licence fees should be reduced to ten shillings.  The collection of licence fees will not be at all easy.  With the perfection of instruments it may become very difficult in the future, and very costly.  If people had instruments that do not involve the setting up of outside aerials, in my opinion, ultimately the collection of licence fees will be impossible, and the cost of broadcasting will have to be found otherwise. You certainly cannot be continually going into people's houses to see if they have wireless sets.  While people, generally, have aerials you can detect the matter easily enough, and impose a fine, and collect a substantial revenue, but the time will rapidly come when, unless the fee is small, something like a half-a-crown, it will be impossible to collect licence fees.  The cost of collection would be far too great. Deputies really, when considering the question of paying for the cost of wireless service, should bear that in mind.  I have been in a house where there was a set.  The police might visit that house and fail to discover it there. There was no aerial, nothing except a quite nicely-designed piece of furniture to indicate the presence of a wireless apparatus in the house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was informed that it had not been paid, but that they would pay it later.  Nobody need fear that Customs' revenue will dry up.  As a matter of fact it will not.  The increased facilities will mean naturally that people will buy valve sets. Changes in design, and improvement in valve sets, will lead to old sets being replaced by new.  I think we may take it that for a very considerable time there will be substantial revenue from this particular source.  Some small fee <Col N="1125" /> can always, I suppose, be collected.  If the fee is small people will not take the risk of a fine.  Some small revenue can always be hoped for from licences, but I do not think that substantial revenue can be hoped for for any considerable length of time from licences, and unless we tax some sources such as those, there will be no alternative to placing broadcasting as a charge upon the <Col N="1126" /> general public, just in the same way as the charge for the police is placed. There may be a good deal to be said in defence of that, but I do not think at present we have reached such a stage as that that could be contemplated.</P>

    <P>I think that this amendment will help the Ministerial Party to retrieve themselves.  The effect of the amendment, of course, would be partially protective and as a consequence it would enable the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and his supporters to put into effect at least some of their purposes and ideas.  It would also meet the objections that Deputy Thrift and others have raised as to the difficulty that would be created by the imposition of a tariff of this kind upon parts which may or may not be used for wireless purposes.  I think it is clear that there will be a very great deal of inconvenience to traders and to purchasers <Col N="1127" /> of this class of goods if some of the articles can be used for different purposes.  The object of the amendment is to confine this tariff to the completed apparatus.  It would as a consequence leave out the parts, and by that means would enable the Minister for Posts to encourage the assembling of parts and the completing of the apparatus in this country, thereby satisfying some of his aspirations, and at the same time would also assist in making easier the purchase of apparatus which may be used for other contraptions, shall I say, as well as for wireless.  It would undoubtedly have the effect of reducing the income from this tax, but to that extent the arguments that were used on the previous motion will suffice and I need not repeat them.  In a general way it may be said that this amendment would effect a good portion of the object sought to be achieved by Deputy Cooper and in addition would satisfy and meet the case that the Minister for Posts has made, supported by so large a number of his own Party, to protect and help to develop an Irish industry, the assembling of parts and the making of wireless apparatus.</P>

      <P>This is not in the form of a direct negative, but in effect the result would be the same as if the resolution were defeated, because it would leave us with less revenue from wireless than was got prior to this Budget.  Heretofore on those instruments which were so constructed as to be liable to furniture duty we got revenue at the rate of about £1,000 per annum.  If the amendment were passed I doubt if we would get as much as that.  It would certainly mean the separating of parts of wireless apparatus so as not to make the apparatus liable to the duty, which would be charged only on the case, where the case was liable to the duty.  That would not be as at present, because where the case is such as to make it liable to the furniture tax, duty is now charged on the whole thing.  As far as the effect of the amendment is concerned I think it is a direct negative, though it is not so in form.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph (3), line 19, to insert after the word &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or is imported by or on behalf of a school, college or other educational institution for educational purposes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I was rather encouraged in putting down this amendment by a remark of the Minister when these motions were up before.  This is not in any way an important amendment as regards revenue. I am sure the amount of revenue that would be lost if this amendment were adopted would be very small. But it is quite an important amendment for those who are interested in scientific education and educational establishments.  I can assure the Minister that they would be very much affected if some such amendment as this were not adopted.  I do not press for the particular wording, but I do press the point that educational institutions should not have to pay this duty on scientific apparatus they require for electrical work.  It would be practically impossible to get electrical apparatus which could not be used in some way for wireless.  The Minister need only consult anybody who has anything to do with the teaching scientifically of electricity to have that statement corroborated.  I do not propose to spend much time in arguing the question because I feel sure that the Minister will tell me either that the amendment is unnecessary, because it is covered by sub-sections (3) and (4) &mdash;though I do not admit it is&mdash;or that he is ready to accept it.  The Minister said the resolution might be amended later to deal with the needs of educational institutions.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the amendment as it stands, but I accept the principle.  I have heard from various sources&mdash;those who made representations included the Minister for Industry and Commerce who, I suppose, was representing the view of the National University&mdash;that it would be a hardship if educational institutions were to be taxed on electrical apparatus. The reason I do not propose to accept the amendment as it stands is that it is on this resolution the charging section of the Act must be based.  The charging section cannot go outside the scope of the resolution and, in amending the resolution, the wording of the amendment would require to be carefully considered.  However, I can undertake to introduce a section or sub-section in the Act to give effect to what the Deputy desires.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has accepted the principle of the amendment.  I suggest that he should stretch his definition so far as to include schools of wireless telegraphy. There is now a definite profession of wireless operator.  I am not sure if there are any schools of wireless telegraphy in the Free State but, as we have set up a school of navigation, it would be very desirable that we should have a school to train wireless operators. It is now a definite career for boys who are anxious to see the world and to follow a scientific career.  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider these schools in the framing of his section&mdash;schools which are making definite provision for the training of operators, and who are not taking up the work by way of amusement or luxury.  I would ask the Minister to make his definition sufficiently wide to cover that class of school.</P>

      <P>In connection with sub-section (4), I would like to <Col N="1132" /> draw the attention of the Minister to the definition.  I think it is a very unsatisfactory definition.  I have not put down any amendment, but I think the definition would cover a great deal more than the Minister wishes to cover. The definition says that the signal must be produced electrically and transmitted, without the aid of a wire, from the place where the signal is made to the place where it is received.  May I draw attention to the fact that the wording does not seem to be quite right.  The word &ldquo;and&rdquo; is used in one place and the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; in another. I think it ought to be &ldquo;and&rdquo; in both places.  It would then refer to signals made in one place and received in another.  The point, however, is that the signal is to be one which is electrically made and transmitted from the sending place to the receiving place without a wire.  That covers a great many signals that are not in any way connected with wireless telegraphy or broadcasting.  Take, for example, the electrical horn of your motor car.  It has no connection with broadcasting. The signal is made electrically and it is transmitted from the motor horn to the ear without any wire.  Take then the flash-lamp.  It may be used as a signalling instrument; it may be made electrically and the signal would be transmitted without the aid of a wire from the sender to the receiver.  Take another example, which is becoming more common&mdash;megaphoning.  You can signal by means of megaphonic apparatus, which is made electrically, and the signal is transmitted from the megaphone through the air to the ear of the receiver.  I do not know if the Minister means to include it.  In that case, it might be argued that the signal was really transmitted with the aid of a wire from the place the sound was made to the megaphone.  But the matter is not by any means clear in the Resolution and I think it ought to be made clear.  There are two objections to the definition as it stands, and, though I have not put down an amendment, I think the Minister ought to consider them.  One of the objections is that it is too wide.  The other is that, if it is intended to include certain things, it is not absolutely certain that it does include them; and if it is intended <Col N="1133" /> to omit those things, it is not absolutely certain that they are left out.  The megaphone is what I am referring to in this connection.</P>

    <P>I put down this amendment in order to meet what seemed to me to be a slight anomaly in the Minister's classification. This paragraph refers to commercial vehicles and lorries.  The Minister has made a flat rate for all lorries of more than one ton and less than two tons.  I think it is common knowledge that there are on the roads at the present time a large number of 30 cwt. lorries, and I seek, by this amendment, to allow these 30 cwt. lorries a slightly lower rate of taxation than the two ton lorry.  I do not think it would entail any serious loss of revenue if the position, as I am going to put it to the Minister, is correct.  Take a man in a fairly large way of business who uses four 30 cwt. <Col N="1135" /> lorries.  Under these financial resolutions there is a direct incentive to that man to get rid of his four 30 cwt. lorries and to put on the road one 6-ton lorry.  Assuming&mdash;which is a large assumption&mdash;that the running cost of the four 30 cwt. lorries and the 6-ton lorry are equal in other respects, he has to pay four licences for his 30 cwt. lorries as against one for a 6-ton lorry; he has to pay four drivers' salaries for the 30 cwt. lorries as against one driver's salary for the 6-ton lorry.  In addition, under the Minister's proposal, he will have to pay £120 tax for the four 30 cwt. lorries as against a £90 tax for one 6-ton lorry.  I do not think a 30 cwt. lorry does as much harm to the road or is as great an obstruction to traffic as a 6-ton lorry.  It is the very heavy lorry that cuts up the roads.  It is the very heavy lorry that swings along like the car of Juggernaut caring nothing what is in its way or what is behind it.  I put it to the Minister that it would be wise to encourage the 30 cwt. lorry.  The adoption of this proposed scale of mine will do that without any serious sacrifice of revenue.  In the hypothetical case that I have put before the Minister he will get £100 in tax from four 30 cwt. lorries as against £90 out of one 6-ton lorry. Therefore, under my proposal he will be getting £10 more, and, at the same time, he will be relieving the roads of a certain burden.  I think where an article is of such common use as the 1½-ton lorry that the Minister, in framing his schedule of taxation, should try and meet it.  I do not know of many one-ton or two-ton lorries, but the 1½-ton lorry is a very common sight on the roads.  These 1½-ton lorries are in use in the Army to a large extent. Therefore, I think that the scale of taxation should have been framed with regard to that fact, and in regard to the fact that there is a very large number of this type of lorry at present in use which, if taxed to an undue extent, will probably go off the roads and be supplanted by heavier vehicles paying a less tax and costing less to run.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seeks to <Col N="1136" /> introduce a new break in the classification. Heretofore there has been a rate for lorries of from 12 cwts. to one ton; another rate for one-ton to two-ton lorries, and one for two to three-ton lorries, and so on.  One could make out a case for breaking up the scale of charges on a rate for each cwt. weight of increase, but that would not simplify the matter, and there would be certain disadvantages in having such a rate. So far, the person with a 30-cwt. lorry is taxed in the same way as if he had a two-ton lorry.  We do not see any particular reason, unless we were to break up the whole scale into much smaller steps, for altering the scale We are simply increasing the scale and the rate for commercial vehicles generally except those which are under a ton. If the Deputy's argument has any force at all, it is that he is in favour of still further steepening the scale.  I do not think the Deputy was using his argument that way, but if we desired to prevent people who might be induced by the scale as it stands to put on six-ton lorries, the point is whether we should not steepen the scale somewhat further.  If you take into consideration the question of the drivers as an argument in favour of employing the heavier lorry, I do not think the scale is going to have the effect of causing people who have, say, three or four 30-cwt. lorries getting six-ton lorries. The argument in favour of the amendment is simply one for breaking up the scale.  We do not think that is called for.  It would lead to a loss of revenue and it does not seem to us that a tax of £30 for a lorry one ton and upwards to two tons is an excessive tax.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment will be to leave things as they are in so far as taxation is concerned on cars other than the Ford cars.  The proposal, in the Minister's resolution, is to revert to the horse-power basis for cars other than the Ford car.  In the year 1922 or 1923 the new basis of taxation was arranged by the Ministry, the object possibly being to give a certain benefit to the Ford car at the time.  When the basis of the taxation for cars is changed it causes a certain amount of inconvenience. It takes people some time to get used to any new arrangement that is made and to know exactly what particular tax attaches to a particular type of car.  Now when things have settled down fairly well in connection with this matter, the proposal is made to go back again to the horse-power basis.  I do not think that is a wise proposal or that it is necessary.  It will have rather peculiar effects inasmuch as it will mean that the popular or cheap type of car, the small car, will have the tax on it increased appreciably, while in the case of the larger and more expensive types of car the tax will be decreased.  I have taken a list of cars from a motoring paper and I find that there are thirteen cars on which the tax will be decreased and thirteen cars on which the tax will be increased.  The peculiar thing about this new proposal is that there will be a decrease in the tax on the big cars which cost £600 or over.  The Chevrolet car is one of the most popular cars after the Ford, and on it the tax will be increased by £4.  There will be a similar increase of tax on the Overland, another very popular car.  The tax on that car is pretty heavy already, so that under the new proposal the tax on this and the other cars I have mentioned will be £22 a year.  The tax on a Singer car will be increased by £3. Other cars on which there will be an increased tax are the Trojan, the <Col N="1138" /> Austin Seven, the Citroen, while on the Morris-Oxford the increase will be £2.  Cars on which the tax will be reduced include the Crossley, the Napier, the Rolls-Royce, the Fiat, the Delage, Hupmobile, and the Humber.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Minister will get very much revenue out of his new proposal.  It seems to me that there will be as much one way as the other.  The Minister will certainly not get as much by way of increase in revenue as would make it worth while to create the disturbance that will be caused by the reintroduction of the horse-power basis.  I do not think there is anything specially in favour of the reintroduction of that basis.  I am told by people in the business that the putting into operation of this new proposal will cause them a great deal of inconvenience inasmuch as they have their catalogues printed and issued with price quotations for each particular type of car sold in the Free State, the prices being based to some extent on the scale now in operation.  I have been told, too, though of course I do not profess to know very much on this point, that it will mean a very considerable interference with people in the trade who would prefer that the present basis was continued.  I have already pointed out that from the revenue point of view there will not be very much in it one way or the other. As far as I know the Ford car will be out of it altogether&mdash;that is to say, the Ford car manufactured in the Saorstát. I would like to remind the Minister that there are some old Ford cars still left in the country, and I do not know what he proposes to do with Ford cars that were not manufactured in the Saorstát.  If this new proposal applies to them it will mean that they will have to pay a tax of £21 or £22.  If that is so I do not know what is going to happen, because you could get some of those old Ford cars at the present time for £15 or so.  I do not know what is going to happen if these cars are to be made liable for a tax of £22. I would remind the Minister that quite a considerable number of them are still left in the Free State.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accept my <Col N="1139" /> amendment and to leave things as they are at present.</P>

      <P>I think it would save discussion if I said a word or two on one aspect of this.  I think Deputy O'Connell has been misled by the use of the phrase &ldquo;reintroducing the horse-power basis.&rdquo;  That basis has never been departed from, and so far as the resolution is concerned we are simply continuing the provisions of the existing Act of 1920.  That Act enables the Minister for Local Government to determine the basis on which the horse-power shall be computed.  We are not altering the law in regard to the matter. We are simply announcing in connection with the other proposals that it is intended the Minister for Local Government shall reverse the Order made about the beginning of 1923, and so revert to the previous basis of computing horse-power which was in existence.</P>

      <P>To pass Deputy O'Connell's motion would mean that all cars except the Fords would be free of tax altogether.  If Deputy O'Connell wants to put his proposal to the House I think the way he should do it is to propose a sub-section to the Finance Bill confining the power to the Minister for Local Government to fix the basis.  At present the Minister for Local Government can take any formula he likes as the formula on which horse-power is to be computed, and prescribe that.  If the Deputy wants the present basis made permanent and statutory, so that it cannot be altered in future, he would have to propose a sub-section containing a provision that for the future horse-power was to be calculated on the cubic capacity of the cylinder.  We changed from the bore of the cylinder to the cubic capacity of the cylinder. It would be possible as the law stands under the general provisions of the Finance Act of 1920 for the Minister for Local Government to take something quite apart from cubic capacity or the bore, and make, say, some computation based on speed, on the number of revolutions of the engine per <Col N="1140" /> second, or something like that.  The way to make sure the present basis is retained would be to put into the Act that it should be computed on the cubic capacity of the cylinder.</P>

      <P>We tried to explore the weight basis, but we could not get <Col N="1141" /> sufficient data to enable us to come to any conclusion in regard to it.  There is a good deal to be said for the weight basis.  Personally I am inclined to it, but I could not get sufficient data to satisfy me that it is one which could be brought before the Dáil at this stage.  I believe during the coming year steps will be taken by the Minister for Local Government to ascertain and have tabulated the weight of cars. There are so many weights in each make of car that it is impossible to say at what figure you ought to place the weight tax in order to get a specific revenue at present.  Take the Fiat car: there might be ten different weights, and it would be almost impossible, without knowing more than we do at present, to say at what rate per cwt. you would need to levy the tax to get a specific revenue.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister has he considered the effect of throwing on the Minister for Local Government the responsibility of finding out where a particular vehicle was built, or what particular portion of it was built in a particular country.  I cannot understand the reasons for doing that.  Hitherto, of course, he has had a certain responsibility in regard to the fixing of horse-power, and so on, but this particular proposal involves that he should be brought into direct contact with the makers of the vehicles and I suppose to be satisfied by Messrs, Ford that certain cars were built in their particular place, or cars that Fords made before a certain date would have been built in their establishment. That seems to me to be entirely apart from any function of the Minister for Local Government.  It is bringing him in rather to Excise and Customs, and operations of the Minister for Finance. In view of the position of the Minister for Local Government, who is an external Minister and not a member of the Executive Council, there is always <Col N="1142" /> the danger of a conflict between the Minister for Local Government and other Departments&mdash;by his having to interfere with the Ministry of Finance, or the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and so bringing about unsatisfactory relations.  I do not like this idea of the Minister for Local Government having to satisfy himself that a definite proportion of the cost of producing a particular article has been incurred in the Saorstát.  That seems to be entirely outside his province.  If there is to be an alteration of the law in that respect I think the responsibility should be on somebody else rather than the Minister for Local Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of these duties is mainly to replenish the Road Fund.  The Road Fund is under the control of the Minister for Local Government and as he has certain other powers&mdash;the power of fixing, for instance, the method of calculating the horse-power and other powers under this Act in connection with the Road Fund, and the motor vehicles taxation &mdash;it did not seem to be necessary or appropriate that another Minister should be requested to do some particular part of the work.  The task will not be a difficult one, because the Minister will, from time to time, have to be satisfied that the specified amount of work is being done on the cars that are being turned out at the Ford works in Cork.  That can be done by the inspection of the books and documents that will be submitted to him or his representative. The cars which will get this preferential rate of tax have their numbers and the representative of the Minister will be able to ascertain from Messrs.  Ford the engine numbers of all the cars turned out at their works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He will be able to satisfy himself, from the figures that will be submitted to him, that the provisions of the Act are being complied with.  There is no intention of having anything like an Excise supervision, which is an entirely different thing.  I do not propose to follow the processes.  We do not propose to say that it is quite impossible for the Ford Company, if they choose, to do it for any particular reason, to bring in one car from outside and to <Col N="1143" /> pass it off as being a car made in Cork. They would not do that, of course, and in any case it could not be done on any scale.  The Excise supervision is an entirely different sort of supervision from this.  The Excise supervision is extremely strict.  Processes are regulated, machines are fitted with devices to show the number of times they have been operated, and all sorts of restrictions are placed on the manufacturers. That is not intended in this case.  It is intended that general evidence be given to satisfy the Minister that the cars that are being turned out in Cork are the result of labour done there to a specified extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister satisfy a good deal of curiosity with respect to the extra cost of the Ford cars in the Saorstát as compared with Northern Ireland; and in that respect, can he tell us whether this concession which, in effect, is to the Ford cars, applies to cars, parts of which are made in Cork and which are assembled in Manchester, some of which go to Northern Ireland and some to Dublin? I am sure it is quite easy of clarification, because I have no doubt the Minister has gone into these figures closely.  There has been a great deal of mystification on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been very much mystified myself, and I was wondering whether there was a great deal of substance in the contention that when you put on a tariff it immediately caused a rise in the price of the article by the amount of the tariff.  If you examine the matter, the Cork works produce 75 per cent. of the car, and there is 25 per cent. of the car imported. I cannot understand by what process of calculation 25 per cent. of a Ford car, on which a tariff of 22 2-9 per cent. is imposed, causes the whole car to rise in price to the amount of the difference between the price at which the car is sold in England or Northern Ireland and here&mdash;£25.  When the car leaves the works at Manchester the price, plus tyres and including commission, is £125.  That would leave the cost of the car made at the factory, without tyres, £100.  On this £100 the part on which the tariff <Col N="1144" /> of 22 2-9 per cent. would be charged would be only £25.  How that sum works out so that it amounts to £25, the difference between the price of the car in the Saorstát and in England, is a thing that I cannot understand.  I wonder why we should give facilities to that particular company that is mulcting the citizens of this country in such a large sum.  The whole thing is absurd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will have noticed that there is an amendment down in the name of Deputy Duggan making the 25 per cent. apply alternatively to the &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo;&ldquo;or the engine of the vehicle.&rdquo;  As a matter of fact, there is not so much as 75 per cent. of the vehicle made in Cork.  In so far as the vehicle is imported there is a greater import here than there is in Great Britain.  That is the car turned out here has paid more duty than the car turned out in Great Britain.  A good number of the wheels and the various parts of the car that have been ground, tooled and finished in various ways in Cork, are really cast in England.  For instance, the cog wheel is even imported into Cork as a casting.  It is ground, and the cogs are cut in Cork, and, perhaps, the hole for the axle is bored in Cork, but there has been a tax paid on the casting coming into Cork.  Take the case of that particular wheel.  In England that wheel has borne no tax because it was cast in England.  The other reason alleged by the firm, in addition to the operation of the extra duty here as compared with England, is that the costs, because they are assembling in a comparatively small way in Cork, are higher.  For that reason they cannot assemble the cars in Cork at the price at which they do them in England.  It is said that if there were a greater output of cars and a greater purchase of cars here the car would be cheaper. I do not profess to be able to account for the £25 in the difference, but there certainly is a reason for a difference. I quite accept the statement of the company.  I would not be able to assess a certain number of pounds as being the amount of which I would be satisfied.  But, undoubtedly, the cost of assembling must be greater in Cork <Col N="1145" /> than in places where work of that character is being done on an immensely greater scale.  Then there is a certain figure in the matter of the duty.  I do not know whether there are cars assembled in Manchester and imported into Dublin.  I was unaware that that was being done.  I understood that the Free State market was being met from cars assembled in Cork since 1923&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Whatever views are held by Deputies on the question of tariffs, I think most people would agree that raw material should come in free of duty. It cannot be produced here.  I do not think we produce iron and steel castings.</P>

      <P>In any case any that are re-exported are allowed a drawback, and in so far as we tax something that might be doubtful as to whether it should be taxed or not, coming into this country, the company is placed at no disadvantage.  The company has the advantage of a protective tariff to the extent of 22 2-9 per cent. in general, and I do not think it is a serious matter if certain cars which are in a partially completed state are taxed.  I can understand an argument in favour of something that is substantially manufactured being free.  It is sometimes hard to draw a line in these cases.  If you impose a tax on fully-manufactured articles, then parts will <Col N="1146" /> be brought in which require merely the least touch to complete them.  The difficulty is largely one of administration I do not think Fords suffer; they have no grounds for complaint because certain goods that might be exempted are ordinarily charged.</P>

      <P>There is one thing perfectly certain, and that is that the object the Minister has in view in connection with these particular tariffs will not have the effect that some of our great tariff reformers believe.  I think Deputy Cooper said that raw materials in the shape of iron and steel ought not to be taxed in connection with the production of the Ford car on the grounds that it is a recognised impossibility for those things to be manufactured here.  I do not admit that, on the Free Trade basis.  I do not agree as to the impossibility of producing many of the things the production of which is considered impossible in the Free State We had a long debate in the Dáil yesterday on the question of tariff reform.  I do not accept the position that seems to be laid down that difficulties exist in the Free State in regard to the production of certain articles.  We are told that certain things are suffering a material handicap by reason of existing conditions, and we are told that difficulties <Col N="1147" /> in this respect are insurmountable.  I would like to express the opinion, rightly or wrongly, that without the aid of tariffs&mdash;more particularly if tariffs were not there&mdash;and possibly with a little help in the first instance, that even iron and steel could be manufactured in the Free State.  There is nothing geographically or physically impossible in regard to the manufacture of these things.</P>

If one looks at the position of some industries on the other side of the water&mdash; take pig-iron as an instance&mdash;one finds the big bulk of raw material made into pig-iron is imported into Great Britain. That could equally be imported into the Free State for the purposes of manufacture.</P>

It is going to strike a very severe blow at the coachbuilding industry and is going to remove from that industry a certain protection which it had under the resolution as originally drafted.  It seems to me to be a direct encouragement to make the bodywork of a car, either of wood or steel or any other composition, in France, the United States, or Great Britain, and send it here.  It is a direct encouragement at a time when, I believe&mdash;my authority is Deputy Byrne&mdash;coachbuilders in Dublin are in very great need of employment, and probably the coach-builders in Cork are equally in need of employment.  I have no objection to the limiting of the principle of protection, but we ought to know what we are doing, and the matter ought to be made quite clear to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>There were certain statements made here when the Budget was introduced, and I did not like to intervene, not having had authority to do so.  Since then I made some inquiries with reference to the work carried out in Ford's in relation to the making of their cars.  A statement was made here to the effect that the car could be bought £25 cheaper in Belfast or Britain than it could in the Saorstát. The cause of that is the McKenna duties.  If the McKenna duties had been taken off&mdash;unfortunately they could not have been&mdash;the fact remains that <Col N="1149" /> the car could have been sold in any part of Great Britain or Northern Ireland and be sold as cheaply in Cork or any other part of the Saorstát.  It is in consequence of those duties which are made up on small parts, particularly in steel, that the price is higher.  There are steel pieces coming into Ford's which they could not set up a plant to cast.  Fully ninety per cent. of the work on those pieces that come in is given to the factory.  I am glad to be able to say that Messrs.  Ford are laying down a plant, which will probably be finished in a month, to manufacture closed-in bodies altogether.  As far as the ordinary truck is concerned, it is manufactured completely in the Ford factory, and if they get the facilities they are looking for, I certainly say it will give a tremendous fillip to the Ford Car, not alone in this country but Great Britain.  Unfortunately, they could not obtain them for certain reasons laid down by the Minister for Finance in introducing his Budget.  We hope in the near future they will obtain them, and if they do there is no doubt that it will give further employment in the factories.  A statement was made when the Budget was introduced that the Ford factory employed only Cork men. I do not like those narrow views to be taken, particularly in an assembly of this description.  Having made inquiries, I have found that there are men from as far as Belfast and all over the country employed in Ford's.  The minority are Cork men.</P>

Furthermore, the axles are manufactured in Cork and sent to England.  Manchester and Cork have to import steel metal to the extent of 33? per cent. from the United States.  These things have to pay duty in England as well as here, but as far as the manufacture of the truck and engine is concerned they are manufactured completely in the Cork <Col N="1150" /> factory.  I sincerely hope, when the next Budget will be introduced, that the Minister will give more facilities to the Ford factory to employ a greater number of men.</P>

The Minister said the castings were ground in Cork and he said the other parts were ground in Cork.  I should like him to give us some indication of the relative value of the raw castings and the finished article, and give us some idea of how the cost works out.  Deputy Egan says there is a difference in the retail price.  That is to say, the retailers of this country have taken advantage of conditions in other countries to keep up this price here. Deputy Egan is evidently speaking with authority; then it is the fault of the retailers here.  We want to know what is the value of the unground and uncut raw castings, coming into the Saorstát, for each car.</P>

      <P>In that case there is no necessity to insert this amendment inasmuch as if the whole of the car may be made in Ford's in Cork, that will easily make up the 75 per cent. of the whole of the car.  I think it would be well if we had a complete analysis of the whole process of manufacture and retail prices.  We would be doubly enlightened if we got that, and, perhaps, before the end of the discussion we shall have it.  The Minister dissents that 75 per cent. of the whole can be made up.  When the closed-in body is manufactured in Cork, as well as the part of the engine that is at present manufactured in Cork, it will not cover 75 per cent. of the cost of the car.  That is a surprising admission, and I think the effect of this amendment may well be that Messrs. Ford, in view of their frequent and very sudden changes of policy, may one of those days say, &ldquo;there is no advantage to us in having these bodies made in Cork.  We will get the engine alone, up to 75 per cent., made in Cork and let the bodies be imported.&rdquo;  I think this amendment is going to be detrimental rather than beneficial to the amount of employment given by the manufacture of Ford cars in this country.</P>

      <P>There is a good deal of exaggerated talk about the proportion of the car made in Cork.  Apart from the engine, there is nothing like 75 per cent. of the value of the car made there.  The plates, for instance, are probably stamped out, fitted together, and varnished there, but the materials in all cases, including probably the paint and varnish, are imported, and a great proportion of the body is also probably imported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Great numbers of the parts are imported from America, where they are made in large quantities in Detroit.  If we left the Resolution <Col N="1152" /> as it was and did not separate the engine from the vehicle, and unless the Minister for Local Government was not to pay much attention to the actual duty imposed on him, it would be impossible to give this advantage to any Ford car.  If you take the vehicle as a whole, the amount of the car made in Cork would not be anything like 75 per cent.  It is certainly attributable to the manufacture of the parts performed in Cork.  You must take the case of the raw material, which is produced elsewhere.  A considerable amount of work would require to be done on an article to ensure that 75 per cent. of its value is attributable to operations in Cork.  A great proportion of the raw material comes in to Cork. One hundred per cent. of the engine is, in some cases, made in Cork.  In regard to the other portions of the car they are simply cut and so forth in Cork.  I would have to consider a much less figure than 75 per cent. if this were not to be attributable to engines. The figure would have to be substantially under 75 per cent.  On the other hand, we are satisfied, if it is necessary for them to make the engine or to have the engine so that 75 per cent. of its value is attributable to manufacturing operations in the Saorstát, the work at present being carried out will continue to be carried out, but as regards the body or body-making there is still the advantage of the 22 2-9 per cent. Customs duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as we are concerned with the new arrangement of duties, we are doing what we believe to be the maximum that is necessary to induce the Ford concern to continue its manufacturing operations in Cork, as it would be a great loss to the country if that concern were to go.  We know that where you have engineering operations carried on and where you have a particular sort of skill required and a population trained in that work, there is a chance that other firms may establish work in the district.  It would be most desirable that we should have work of an engineering character here. I do not know if we could build up, for instance, anything that would correspond with the shipbuilding works in Belfast.  On the other hand, if Messrs. Ford left Cork and some other firm did <Col N="1153" /> not step in, I think the prospects of engineering here would be very remote. When they established their plant in Cork they intended to make not only for the Saorstát market but for the British market.  They are practically cut off from the British market and they have to pay 22 2-9 per cent. when the parts are sent to England. Now the British propose to include in the scope of those duties commercial vehicles as well as touring cars, and that is another obstacle placed in the way of the Ford firm.  Unless we give some concession like this and increase the demand for cars in Ireland so as to enable them to employ their big plant fully, I think it is almost certain that they will have to close down soon. When we fixed the figure at 75 per cent. we did not inform the Ford people what we were going to do in the matter, and we were not able to examine, as closely as we would like, the actual figure at which the percentage should stand.  Consequently the percentage was fixed higher than an examination showed it ought to be fixed.  We could not, without disclosing to the firm our intentions prior to the Budget, pursue the matter as thoroughly as we desired. The alternative to Deputy Duggan's amendment would result in lowering the percentage considerably.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph (1), line 25, to delete the words &ldquo;one pound&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;six shillings.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendment 12, which is out of order, was intended to raise a question which can be raised on amendment No. 14. It is a question as to the distinction between the fee of five shillings under the Motor Car Act of 1903 and the Excise duty.  I take the position that the fee of five shillings is, in fact, a registration fee, and as the licence is given to any person who applies, without test, it obviously is merely intended to be a record of who has authority to drive a car.  When we come to deal with the Excise duty of one pound, we talk about a licence, and a licence suggests to me&mdash;and I think when a question of one pound duty is involved it should entail some check upon the capacity of the person to drive a car&mdash;that there should be some condition imposed before a licence is granted.  But I will wait and hear what the Minister has to say about the distinction between the fee of five shillings and the Excise duty.  I cannot understand what the distinction implies.  But the amendment I have down is to make the Excise duty six shillings.  I would prefer to move that it should be five shillings but for some matter of order. My amendment, in effect, will merely add one shilling to the present cost of the licence or registration fee, whatever it may be called.  Under this new proposal it will be called an Excise duty. In the past, it has been called a registration fee.  There is no case for increasing this fee to £1 or, in fact, increasing it at all, but I will assume that if my motion is carried it will be satisfactory to the Dáil that it should be increased by one shilling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The driver of a hackney car is under a considerable amount of expense to-day, and I can see no justification whatever for adding to the fee that is at present paid, unless, as I said, we are going to impose some conditions as to the capacity of a man or woman to drive.  There is also the question of the duplication of the fee in respect to a family which will arise on a later <Col N="1156" /> amendment.  It is unreasonable that a number of persons driving the same car should have to take out separate licences at a high cost.  The Minister made the plea that it was necessary to call upon all drivers of cars to pay an increased sum to the revenue, whether as drivers or as owners, except the owners of Ford cars.  I am not going to deal with the case of the vehicle duties.  In the matter of the licence fee, I think there should be no advance, but I content myself by asking the Dáil to agree that there should only be an advance of one shilling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Johnson in his claim that this proposed tax or excise duty of £1 should be reduced. In doing so, I desire to draw the attention of the Dáil to the fact that within the past 18 months there have been upwards of 100 taxis put upon the streets of Dublin.  These taxi men find it very hard to live at the present moment, and this increased taxation will be a hardship both to themselves and their families.  I am aware that these men purchased their taxis out of the pensions or gratuities they got on retirement either from the British Army or from the Free State Army.  I think it is very unfair, now that these men having undertaken this expense in making an effort to provide employment for themselves, should have this additional tax placed upon them.  I am also aware that there are a large number of idle men who hold drivers' licences at the present moment anxiously awaiting to get a day's work. There are a number of these men who only get a day's work, or probably two days' work, and are very glad to get it. They carry their own licences and pay for them, not as if they were working for big companies and permanently employed where the company would pay the licence fee.  On behalf of these men, I ask the Minister to consider seriously the suggestion made by Deputy Johnson that this proposed Excise Duty of £1 should be reduced to a reasonable figure that these men could afford to pay.  Regarding the other point that Deputy Johnson has made, as to two or three members of one family taking their turn in driving a car, you have that also in the taxi business.  I think <Col N="1157" /> it would be a great hardship that there should be more than £1 licence for a car.  If there is a second or third licence required the figure should be considerably reduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two or three points quite distinct, I think, in connection with this amendment. There is a wide feeling that this sudden rise in the cost of a driver's licence from 5/- to £1 is excessive.  The object of the Minister is to increase the amount of money available for the Road Fund; so he said: Now that is very desirable.  At the same time I think it is incumbent on him and the Dáil to see that in raising that money they do it in a way that ensures that it falls upon those responsible for such great increases in the cost of the roads. Motors, particularly small motors, do far less damage to the roads than ordinary horse vehicles, yet all motors are subject to no less than three separate and distinct duties.  First there is the duty payable on cars coming into the country; then there is the tax which is definitely for the Road Fund, and, in addition, now it is proposed to add this amount of 15/- for each licence which hitherto, as Deputy Johnson has pointed out, has been obviously a registration fee.  It is obvious that that will be quite unfair in the case in which there are several drivers for the one car, on different occasions.  It seems to be quite unfair in the case like that, where the damage done to the roads is that done by one car, that there should be this increase in the amount payable on that car for the upkeep of the roads.  In addition to the case of a number of drivers in a private family mentioned by Deputy Byrne, there are, I understand, a good many commercial owners of cars who take out licences for several men whom they want to drive a particular car.  No doubt if a man has to pay a pound in the future he will take care to make such arrangements that he will not have that latitude open to him and he will arrange to require a smaller number of licences. I do not think it at all follows that this will increase in the ratio of four to one the revenue that the Minister calculates on receiving.  I think that there <Col N="1158" /> is a real case for a relaxation on some of the lines indicated in these different amendments.  I would prefer that the tax should remain at five shillings, but, if it is to be raised, I think it should be raised in a much more moderate manner than by this sudden increase of four hundred per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I also would like to add my voice to the protest which this increase has called for.  In my judgment, this is perfectly unjustified, and I think that in principle our legislation is moving in the direction of stifling advancement for the good of the community as a whole.  There is a very big difference between five shillings and a pound to most people who are using cars.  With the present rate it is undoubtedly the practice that people who only occasionally drive a car take out a licence so that they can do so if they get the opportunity, and this advance would, I think, in their case be unjustifiable.  More particularly I think it unjustifiable in the case of a great body of men who are getting more and more opportunities for earning a living by driving cars, regularly or spasmodically.  If the Minister wants money for the roads&mdash;and his maw seems to be an insatiable one in that connection&mdash;why on earth does he try to saddle a thing that is only a registration fee and make it into a real tax?  I do not see what argument can be adduced in favour of it except that it seems to be the set desire of the Minister to crush out an enterprise that is increasing in importance, in this and in every other country, and make it, and himself, as unpopular as he possibly can to the maximum number of people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Thrift has touched upon the fact that motors are to-day called upon first of all to pay an import duty. That is put on, I suppose, with some idea that motors are a luxury.  I disclaim that altogether.  The number of motors in the Free State, or anywhere else, that are used as luxuries is comparatively small, in fact infinitesimal. when compared with the number used commercially.</P>

      <P>I suppose a good many of them went to an open-air enclosure on the side of the road, except that for security, as a matter of insurance, some owners thought it wise to put them in an enclosure where people could not get at them.  The charge that is proposed is not in the interests of the general community, and in so far as it is a tax in aid of the roads, I say it is the very worst form that such a tax could take.  I think it is not desirable that anybody should be prevented from taking out a licence because of the excessive charge.  I would willingly make the Minister a present of the suggestion that the tax might go on to the heavy motor lorries if it is taken off the licences, but I certainly do think that, even if he is compelled to raise so much more money to alleviate the distress of the farmers in the maintenance of the roads, that would be much better than this objectionable form.</P>

It <Col N="1160" /> will be used only to provide very good roads for the motoring public, and people who tell us that it is an undue charge and an unfair burden have not made any suggestions as to how the money is to be acquired from other sources.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am at is that £45,000 is required for the Road Fund.  That is the reason for this increase and for the decision to make this an Excise duty instead of being, as it formerly was, a registration fee. This money is required, and in some way or another it must come in.  There has been a considerable increase in the taxation of ordinary cars.  It is anticipated that the amount will run into something between 25 and 30 per cent. on the ordinary cars.  On goods vehicles there is an increase of 50 per cent.  I do not know the exact curve of increase in the case of buses, but this fund is the final means of bringing in a certain sum of money to maintain and keep the roads in order.  No suggestion is made, and no information is given as to how this £45,000 could be raised from any other source.</P>

      <P>That, of course, upsets the calculations that have been made in connection with what is called the road policy and the figures and the estimates that have been given.  The estimates of the receipts in question are all, in my view, rather optimistic.  In other words, I believe the increases that are proposed generally will not materialise to the extent of the estimate. If this particular tax be reduced, as Deputy Thrift suggests, obviously we are not going to get half.  Then there is the problem remaining to be solved next year of getting this money from some other source.  That is the whole case for it.  It is not through any pleasure that the tax is imposed, but if there are better methods of raising the money from the principal users of the roads&mdash;and the users who will benefit most out of it&mdash;we ought to hear of them.</P>

      <P>We have heard some talk from time to time about going slowly.  We have also heard talk about people being unable to afford what they want.  I would like, for instance, to be better dressed, to have better boots, and many other things, but I am not able to afford all the things I want.  I have to put up with it, and I do not think it is a good argument <Col N="1163" /> for the President to say: &ldquo;Here is a sum of money that must be got, and the only way we can get it is to put a tax chiefly on the working man.&rdquo;  This tax will fall most heavily on the men, I maintain, who are earning their living driving cars.  I have seen a few of them and the case they put up to me is that a great number of them are unemployed. If they get employment, they ask, where will they get the money to pay for a licence?  That is what appealed to me most.  I do think if it is not possible to get the £45,000 this year, the Minister for Finance should take another view and try to do without it until the country is able to afford it.  I am as keen on having good roads as anyone.  As I said here, when speaking the other day, I object very much to heavy lorries being allowed to travel on the roads because they are injuring the roads to an extent unprecedented by anything that light motor cars can do.  As Deputy Thrift has said, I do not think that light motor cars in particular do the roads anything like as much harm as the old horse drawn vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question that a motor car is no luxury now.  I pointed out on several occasions here that, at all events as far as my profession is concerned, it is an absolute necessity to have a motor car, and therefore it cannot be regarded as a luxury.  It has already been pointed out by other speakers that if a man buys a motor car it costs him about £200.  Then he has to pay a considerable amount in duty when the car comes into the country, something like £45, I suppose, and afterwards he has to pay, say, £12 motor tax. He has also to pay insurance.  I do not think anybody has referred to a matter that has been engaging the attention of people on the other side recently, that is to insist on the necessity for every motor owner having a third-party insurance. That means that where injuries are sustained the motor owner would be insured so that he could pay the injured person.  I maintain that it is far too much to increase a tax of 5/- at one bound to £1.  It will hit the poor man very heavily.  I am also quite sure that in many cases the funds will be reduced <Col N="1164" /> by people who have been taking out a number of licences for the members of their family taking out only one now.  They had separate licences for all the members of the family where there was only one car, so that in an emergency any of them might be able to drive the car.  I know a good many who have four or five licences in their family.  The car is never out without the best driver.  They certainly will not continue to pay £1 for a licence for every single member of the family.  I do appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter, because it will be a very severe tax on the man who has to earn his livelihood by driving cars.  If the Minister cannot get the £45,000 this year he should hold his hand a little bit and do like the ordinary individual would do as far as his home life is concerned. He would hold his hand if he could not afford to have all that he wanted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that whatever may be said in reference to the other amendments, this one is altogether too drastic.  In 1903 a fee of 5/- was, I think, fixed, and having regard to the value of money a fee of 10/- would be no more than equivalent to that at the present time.  Having regard to the need there is for expenditure on the roads on account of motors, and the necessity there is for <Col N="1165" /> relieving the rates as far as possible, I do not think any good case could be made for declining to raise the fee by more than the figure at which it was fixed in 1903.  The matter is practically one of putting the increased cost of the roads, as far as we can, on the motor-using population and relieving the agricultural community, as far as we can do so, of that cost.  The entire cost pre-war practically fell on the rates.  There was no Road Fund contribution worth talking about then. The roads have now to be maintained on a different scale, largely because of the increase in motor traffic.  It seems to us desirable that, as far as possible, the increased cost shall fall on those who use motors.</P>
      <P>The President explained that we could not very well increase the charges on goods vehicles to an extent that would bring in any substantially increased sum of money.  We have considerably increased the rates on goods vehicles, but it is probable that a further increase would still leave enough vehicles on the road to require strong roads, and would not give any very greatly increased revenue.  I recognise that in certain cases a fee of £1 would seem to be very heavy, such as in the case quoted of a family perhaps in the country having a car that it might not be convenient to have driven only by one person On the other hand, proposals such as that made by Deputy Cooper would be very difficult to carry into effect.  We gave a good deal of consideration to them. Certain anomalies would be produced. For instance, if you had two brothers owning two cars, living in one house, one would get off at the 5/- rate.  On the other hand, if they lived in different houses both would pay the £1 rate, presumably.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The main duties on the cars are Excise duties.  It was thought desirable that the drivers' licence duty should be an Excise duty and that some regulation as regards coverability and so forth should apply as apply to the main duties.  Even at 5/- in 1903 it was definitely a tax, as the cost of recording would then amount to nothing like 5/-.  If we have a higher fee at the present time, it is very definitely a tax and should be put in the same category as revenue taxes are ordinarily put.  I do not want to anticipate Deputy Cooper, but, in my view, it is extremely difficult to devise any system to work satisfactorily for supplementary licences at reduced fees. I think if we were departing from the provisions of the resolution as it stands, that a reduction of the fee would be better than an attempt to have a system of supplementary licences, which would be somewhat difficult to operate, would lead to evasions, and provide anomalies of various sorts.  If we were to reduce the fee to 10/- it would mean a loss of probably anything between £26,000 and £30,000.  To that extent it would prevent us carrying out the policy it is intended to carry out in relation to the roads.  There would be so much less borrowing power, so much less of the capital type of improvement done on the roads, and the annual charges would not be diminished in the way that we would expect they would be diminished if we could push ahead with the work of providing good foundations, and generally strengthening the roads for the carrying of heavy traffic.  I believe that any reduction in the Road Fund, from sources other than taxation, can only <Col N="1167" /> result in increased charges on the rates When you have motor traffic the cost of maintaining the roads at the necessary standard is extremely high.</P>

      <P>While I sympathise with the desire of the President and the Minister for Finance in their efforts to secure sufficient money to enable them to borrow a certain amount for the construction of roads, I am in entire agreement with this amendment, because I consider that the poor man is again called upon to supply the money for reconstructing the roads.  I dare say if the Minister for Finance were to examine in detail the list of people who have taken out licences this year he would find that the greater number are either in the employment of business firms or are driving hackney cars in the towns and cities.  Those people are already heavily taxed in other directions and they should not be called upon to pay this large increase in the licence fees.  I would appeal to the Minister to come to the relief of those people and not to insist on this tax going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President has stated that no suggestions have been made as to how this amount of money is to be made up, if the tax went back to its original figure.  I have no hesitation in suggesting that it should be made up in respect of the heavy lorries.  The President, or the Minister for Finance, may say that that would be placing too heavy a burden on those people and that 50 per cent. has already been imposed upon them.  I consider that if another 50 per cent. were put on&mdash;I am not quite sure of the figures&mdash;he would get approximately the same result.  Even if these people refused to pay and took the lorries off the roads, I suggest that it would be a good day's work for the Government. and that the amount of money that would be saved by these lorries being taken off the roads would justify the Government in their action. These goods would then go back to the railways and the roads would be saved. <Col N="1169" /> The amount of money that the President and the Minister for Finance speak of would not be required for the upkeep of the roads.  I believe that that is the solution of the problem</P>
    <P>I think it is very unfair of the Minister to tax poor people in the cities and towns who are driving Ford hackney cars and, thereby, endeavouring to eke out an existence.  We may be told that the Ford car licence duty has been reduced from £18 to £10, but how many of those people, whose living is very precarious, are in a position to buy a new Ford car to-day?  They all have to pay the old tax of £18, and on top of that they have to pay 15/- extra. As a matter of fact, they have to pay the extra duty on the old Ford car.  so that those engaged in the hackney car business have not got any relief in the Budget.  I would appeal to the President and the Minister for Finance to reconsider, seriously, this tax and to put it on the heavy lorries and drive them off the roads.</P>

      <P>Reading between the lines it occurred to me that the Minister intended to put a heavier tax on motor cars, but did not like to do it, and that he then found a way of doing it by putting it on the drivers.  But he has not made the changes in the same ratio.  Having increased the licence of the motor car drivers from five shillings to a pound the licence for the driver of the heavy lorry should be increased from five shillings to £5 or £10.  There is very little alteration in the tax on most of the cars, but the driver's licence is increased from five shillings to twenty shillings.  There is three times the tax in the case of heavy lorries&mdash;from £30 to £90, but the licence increase is not in the same ratio</P>

They seem to think now that these lorries should be taxed off the roads.  These lorries had to be procured at heavy expense for the purpose of maintaining transport when the people were not able to maintain the railways and when the roads of the country, to a great extent, were broken up.  A great many merchants went to heavy expense in procuring those lorries.  It is very unfair that these lorries should be taxed off the roads. Again, we have a great many co-operative societies, and the farmers are, to a large extent, dependent on the co-operative societies.  The welfare of the agricultural industry is mixed up with the welfare of those co-operative societies, and it would be very unjust if these lorries were obliged to be taken off.  The Minister is taking a fair, if not more than fair, view in the tax which he has put on the motor cars and motor drivers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that with the extra £1 for a driver's licence, that is putting a burden on the driver of the hackney car that he cannot bear. Surely to goodness the Government cannot expect that all those Ford cars built before 1923 should be thrown off the road and that the people who own them should be obliged to buy new cars.  I think that a proposal of that kind is most unfair.  When the Budget was introduced people generally in the country believed that all Ford cars were to be at a level of £10.  Now it <Col N="1172" /> seems the position will be quite different. The poorer classes of people will be more affected by this than those who are in a better position to pay the extra tax of £8 15s. which is to apply to the hackney car driver in future.  If that is a relief I cannot understand it, and I do not know where the relief of the £10 tax comes in.  It may be a relief to well-off men who can afford to buy a new Ford car, but it will be no relief to the owners of the old cars.  I disagree entirely with Deputy Noonan when he says that the heavy lorry should not be taxed off the roads.  I hold that everyone of them over 4 tons should be taxed off the roads.  The upkeep of the roads for these heavy lorries is costing the local ratepayers an extra charge of 2/- in the £.  I believe that the ratepayers generally can less afford this rate of 2/- in the £ than the wealthy merchants who own these 6-ton and 8-ton lorries.  I agree with Deputy Corish that the tax on these heavy lorries should be doubled in order that we might get them off the roads for all time.  Most of the roads in the Saorstát are not capable of carrying these heavy lorries.  The damage they are doing to the roads is placing a burden on the local ratepayers that they are not able to bear, and I believe that in a short time the running of these lorries on the roads will have to stop of necessity.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph (1), line 29, to delete the words &ldquo;one pound&rdquo; and to substitute the words &ldquo;ten shillings.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In accordance with our agreement.  I do not propose to re-argue that question, but I would propose to make one or two remarks.  I think the Minister is half disposed to yield something in this matter.  I think the feels a case has been really made.  I want to put the point that he will make nothing like twice the amount of revenue from the double tax.  I think if he were to estimate the difference in the receipts at £15,000 he would be on the high side, and if he takes it at £20,000, which I am sure is on the high side, the President will not get the £750,000 he expects.  I hope the Minister and the President will see their way to compromise in the way proposed in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment.  Without repeating previous statements, I would ask the Minister to accept this so far as the licensed drivers of hackney cars are concerned.  They should get at least some benefit.  It should be taken into consideration that in Dublin alone there are over 100 taxis that have been purchased by young men who could not find employment.  Through their friends they raised money to purchase these hackney cars, and I think they should get some consideration and not be asked to bear this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the information we got from the President helps us somewhat to see this problem in a proper perspective.  As has been pointed out by Deputy Doyle, the additional burden on the drivers of cars who are driving for a living is going to be very heavy.  It appears from the figures and the estimates one can make from observation that probably 20,000 of the 37,000 cars in the country are old Fords.  I do not know what proportion of these are hackney cars&mdash; cars which men drive in order to make a living.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the Saorstát; so that in the case of the proposal in the resolution, fifteen shillings is to be added to the extra vehicle duty on the hackney cars.  I want to emphasise the point that that is going to apply possibly to 10,000 workmen in the country.  The President made the case that it was necessary to raise this revenue, but if you are raising a revenue from the owners of cars, what difference does it make to the revenue whether it is paid as a tax upon the cars or as a tax upon the man himself? It is only when you are imposing an extra duty on the workman as a workman, and as distinct from the owner of the car, that you are creating an evil and emphasising the grievance.  If you have to raise the money, raise it on a car owner, as car owner, in respect to the car.  In this case what you are doing is imposing a tax upon the workman's activities in earning a living. That may be justified.  Deputies voted on the last occasion as though they were trying to justify it.  They have <Col N="1175" /> another opportunity now at least to modify their views, and in the case of the licence duties at least only to impose an additional tax of 5/- instead of £1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DOHERTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Deputy Johnson in this matter.  I think as a matter of fact this tax is rather a hardship and it requires very little argument to show that the amount that is demanded imposes a very considerable burden on the employee or the assistant.  I think that from that point of view alone the amendment should be agreed to, and I thoroughly agree with Deputy Johnson's observations and I support them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support this amendment and I think the Government ought to accept it as a compromise.  I would suggest to them that this particular tax is one of the most unpopular taxes they could impose. In proportion to the amount of tax collected it will cause a greater amount of annoyance than can be imagined.  One of the first considerations in putting on a tax should be to put on a tax that will not inconvenience or annoy people to any great extent.  I also think that the tax for the upkeep of roads ought be applicable to the vehicles and not to the person driving the vehicle.  I think that this method of making the driver responsible for the upkeep of the roads is a new departure and is not really justified. The tax should be applied to the car which is responsible for the damage to the roads.  I would press on the Minister the advisability of accepting this amendment, which, though not very satisfactory, is a compromise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined to accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Thrift as a compromise in this matter.  It will, of course, prejudice to some extent the future of the roads. Undoubtedly that must be the effect of it.  But as the rise is perhaps rather steep&mdash;it is fairly steep&mdash;I am prepared to accept the amendment.  In the case of the Ford hackney I will make provision in the Bill that the old cars will not be hit to the extent that they would be hit under the Resolution as it <Col N="1176" /> stands.  The reason why the Resolution is so severe is that the more definite information which we have been able to get from the Ford firm since the Budget was introduced has shown us that the cars to which the preferential rate would apply are newer cars.  The date of their construction is more recent than the date we had contemplated at one time.  There are more of the old cars to be prejudicially affected than we at one time thought.  Any concession there will not be in the nature of a continuing loss to the road fund.  It will be a loss that will affect it only for a year or two or three.</P>

I am not pledging myself to put down a further amendment and I am not pledging myself not to put down a further amendment either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to press Amendment 16, but I would just like to put it up to the Minister because he adumbrated certain difficulties with regard to the family licences, and I should like his view as to whether this is insuperable. Amendment 15 did not go as far as it should go.  I should have liked it to <Col N="1178" /> exempt the paid servant of a family residing in the house, the licence being in the name of the family.  In view of the possibility that the paid servant would remove himself from the house or give notice to leave or set the house on fire and burn the family, or conduct himself in any other unforeseen manner, I do not think it advisable to include him.  I suggest to the Minister that by the adoption of this amendment he will not lose any revenue.  The main argument used against me on a former occasion was that the Road Fund would not admit of the loss of revenue.  The revenue has now submitted to having its privileges and licences cut in two as by a sword and apparently it has not suffered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, I am going to put it to the President and the Minister that the adoption of the principle of the amendment will not cause any serious loss of revenue.  In a family where there are three or four persons capable of driving a car and likely to drive a car, two things will happen upon the introduction of the increased licence.  If they are a very law-abiding family and the father will say&mdash;assuming that he is not only nominally, but actually, in control of the family&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'CONNELL Mr. T. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>You are assuming a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that.  Now, I will assume this, that the father or mother will say to the family: &ldquo;None of you is to use the car except the one who has taken out the licence.&rdquo;  If I can draw on Deputy Hewat's imagination yet further, the assumption is that the family will obey. That is my optimistic outlook.  Now. in that case there is not much revenue to be got out of that.  The alternative supposition is that where there are four or five persons in a family who might drive a car they will not take out a licence for everyone in the family.  One or possibly two will take out licences, but the remainder will chance their <Col N="1179" /> luck and drive the car in the hope that the Civic Guard will not hold them up in order to look at the licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, we can see how the Road Fund is going to be operated.  There will be armies of clerks employed filling up these licences and securing particulars.  Formerly applicants for those licences used to send in their applications by post, and there was no occasion to present themselves.  Now, it is more than likely that they will have to have any particulars they supply checked.  Possibly, a note will be made of distinguishing marks, and if there are two pimples on the right ear the clerk will have a look at them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily? The Minister for Finance says that personal identification will be absolutely necessary, and I have no doubt particulars with regard to age and appearance will have to be entered on the licences.  Now, the Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us that it is not necessary.  The trouble with this Government is that they are always speaking with divided voices.  Take the case of the President's car.  If it is not the President's car it is the Government's car.  How on earth are the officials to fill in on the licence the personal description of the person entitled to drive the car?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking figuratively of who holds the wheel at any given moment.  If we introduced this form in regard to, not the actual motor car, but the car of the State, and compel a detailed description as to height, age, and so on, we should gain an enormous amount of information.  I am afraid I am allowing myself to get out of order.  I have been compelled by those very disorderly interruptions on the part of the Ministers, which I deprecate, to stray from my point.  My point is that you will not get any more revenue by saying that every member of a family has to take out a licence to drive the same car.</P>
      <P>There may be cases where two brothers have two hackney cars, but these cases are not very numerous, and the net loss will not be very great, and therefore I would suggest to the Minister that some consideration in the way of cheaper licences should be given.  I am not pressing this amendment tonight. The whole situation has been altered by the acceptance of Deputy Thrift's amendment.  I do think the principle of cheaper licences for other members of the family should be considered. I would like to hear the Minister's view on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it desirable that they should be asked to take licences out?  They will not take out as many <Col N="1181" /> licences as they otherwise would if facilities were given them.  Then again, you will not have as many people learning motor driving.  I do not think the revenue will be increased under this proposal.  The owner of a car, or whoever is to drive the car, will take out one licence and no more.  If the cost of licences was reduced to something within reason, perhaps two or three members of a family would be inclined to take out licences.  If the cost were reduced licences would be taken out in the case of learners.  With a 10/- licence I do not see very much inducement offered to people.  This proposal will not lead to efficiency in driving motor cars.  You will not have as many people driving cars. What you need to cultivate in the country is efficiency in driving.  The necessity for efficient driving is rapidly growing.</P>

While a 10/- licence fee has to be paid you will have very few learners, and very few members of a family will be inclined to pay 10/-.  They will pay only what is absolutely necessary.  Few people are ready to pay 10/- for nothing.  Ten shillings mean a lot in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The case made in regard to this particular matter is very much weakened by the fact that the main licence is now reduced to 10/-.  I think a 10/- fee is not too high a charge if we have regard to the fact that 5/- was fixed when the value of money was very much greater than it is now. As compared with the pre-war period we are not increasing the fee at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Not as regards pre-war. I think it is not a fee that is at all too high.  I do not think it is desirable that anybody should get a licence for a very small sum, a sum they would not think very much about. There is another side to the case that Deputy Gorey put up.  It is very desirable that people who are in charge of cars should be expert drivers.  I do not think it is a good thing that people should, at a very small fee, be able to get a licence to enable them to drive. There is some advantage, for instance, in discouraging school children from taking out licences.  I think a 10/- licence is advisable in so far as it will discourage people from taking out licences who would otherwise be undesirable as drivers.  Deputy Cooper's amendment, I think, if it were being adopted, and if we had been retaining the £1 fee, would have to be extended so as to cover employees as well as members of a family; then there would be anomalies and difficulties which could not have been completely surmounted. It was partly because I did not see any way in which we could operate such a system of licence entirely satisfactory that I was prepared to agree to what I regarded as a compromise.  If we had kept to the pound I believe we would have had to try to make some sort of exception, because there would have been hardship if there was no exception.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to suggest that the Dáil should not accept this Resolution because it is part of a bargain that super-tax has been reduced and estate duties increased. Although I look upon it with some anxiety and apprehension&mdash;it is, as Deputy Thrift said, &ldquo;a rub of the green&rdquo;&mdash;I do not want to suggest anything unfair.  I would ask the Minister to do what he can to ease the methods of payment of estate duties because this is a considerable burden on estates. Take an estate, for instance, of £100,000.  That means an income of £5,000 a year, or less, because houses. gardens, demesne lands, and other amenities, which do not return an income in proportion to their capital value, are included in the value of the estate.  That estate will have to pay £20,000 estate duties&mdash;that is to say, more than four years' income of the estate.  Before the war it was possible to save money in anticipation of these payments, but it is not possible now. The imaginary individual who is getting <Col N="1186" /> £5,000 a year is paying £2,000 at least in direct taxes, income tax, and super-tax, and he is also paying high indirect taxes and wages.  I am assuming the case of a demesne here.  The wages which have to be paid for upkeep and maintenance have increased very largely.  Nearly half the income goes in taxes.  The wages of servants, gardeners, stablemen and others have increased very much, and a man is not in a position to save, so that when he dies and when his executors come to deal with the estate duties they are faced with claims to the amount of four years' income from the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying the claim should not be paid, but I say it ought to be paid on as easy terms as the Minister for Finance can permit.  There are two ways out of that.  One is that wherever there is superfluous land, the Land Commission should take it over and its value should be graduated Again, most of the estates to which I am referring are estates which are the subject of trust.  The owner is not the absolute owner, but a tenant for life, and I would suggest to the Minister the desirability of introducing some legislation to enable the tenant for life, or the trustees of a tenant for life, to dispose of portions of the estate in order to pay estate duties, because, if the tenant for life is faced with the position that he has got to pay out of a dwindling income, which has far more demands on it now than ever, and the charges upon it are far higher now than in the past, he is practically reduced to going to the moneylender. The third suggestion that I will make will probably be the least acceptable. As there are already arrangements by which estate duties can be paid by instalments, I suggest that the Minister should see if it is not possible to extend the period of these instalments. I do see that there are obvious objections. If I were the Minister for Finance, I should probably say that it was never done before, and could not be done now; but if the Minister would look into the question of the capacity to pay and the amount demanded of the person who has to pay, I think he will see that there is some case for an <Col N="1187" /> extension of the period of repayment. I am not asking for the terms of the annuities under the Land Act, or anything like that.  I think it is spread over five years at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest fifteen.  I admit that from the point of view of the existing Minister the prospect is not attractive.  The fifteen-year period may result in money coming into his successor or even his second successor, but I do not think the Minister is going to deal with this question in that spirit.  I do not expect him to do anything in this year's Finance Act, but I do put it to him that it is a point that might well occupy the attention of his Department before the next financial year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties that Deputy Cooper refers to are, of course, realised to some extent, and the fact that there are provisions, whereby in the case of realty, payment may be spread over eight years and paid in eight annual or sixteen half-yearly instalments, does indicate that the position is appreciated.  Whether more can reasonably be expected is a matter which I have not personally examined. I am prepared to look into it, and, perhaps, later on I shall be in a position to give a considered view to the Deputy. I am sure that he does appreciate that in so far as the duties are being increased by the present Budget the people get help to pay by the fact that the super-tax rates are somewhat reduced.  There is, therefore, perhaps, the possibility of making some provision in advance in order to help them to meet the instalments.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 14.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal effect of this resolution is to make it clear that the value of property shall be taken as the value at <Col N="1188" /> the time that the successor comes into it&mdash;when it is actually acquired&mdash;and not the value at the time when the original Will was made in virtue of which the succession took place.  That, according to certain practices, cuts both ways.  The existing arrangement and practice, on which a certain doubt has been thrown by a decision of a British Court, is the fairest one.  It sometimes may benefit the Exchequer and sometimes the taxpayer.  For instance in recent cases it will benefit the taxpayer.  If a person died, say, in 1919 and left a farm of land to his mother for life and afterwards to his brother under the arrangement that existed heretofore, and under the arrangement which we want to put beyond doubt, by this resolution, if succession duty was being paid now it would be paid on the value of the land, at the present time, and not on the value of the land in 1919, which was the peak year.  In that case it would operate to the advantage of the taxpayer. If, however, the original Will were made earlier, say in 1914, and a succession occurred under it, at the present time, the land would be valued at the present value which is greater than 1914.</P>
