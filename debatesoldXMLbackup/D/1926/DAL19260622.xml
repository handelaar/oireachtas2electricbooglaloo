      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that owing to the regulations of the Revenue Commissioners restricting the release of five-year-old spirits from bond many merchants are being seriously inconvenienced, that new trade cannot be developed, and that the Distillery Companies have obtained concessions in this respect, and if, in view of the fact that the Council of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce have requested it, he will issue instructions that any spirits that have been bonded for five years or upwards, may be immediately released on the payment of duty by any owner.</P>

      <P>There has been no change in the classification of the imports of goods required to be described as &ldquo;Other Apparel.&rdquo; The figures referred to are not comparable. It is regretted that an explanation was not published with these figures in the neo-styled statement for April last, although the neo-styled statements purport to contain only preliminary figures, exclusive of non-dutiable goods imported or exported through the parcels post.  As explained on page V. of the Trade Report for 1924 and Page IV. of the corresponding Report for 1925, it was impracticable for these two years to compile the quantities and values of each non-dutiable article imported through the parcels post under its specific heading, as such a course would have doubled the total cost of compilation and, accordingly, the British method had to be followed of bulking all such non-dutiable parcels together and compiling them merely as so many parcels with an aggregate value.  The figures for &ldquo;Other Apparel&rdquo; prior to the imposition of duty are, accordingly, as explained in the Trade Reports, understated by the amounts imported through the parcels post.  The figures of imports of &ldquo;Other Apparel&rdquo; subsequent to the imposition of duty have had to be compiled specifically as such, as is done in the case of all dutiable articles imported through the parcels post.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY (for Tadhg O Donnabháin)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he is aware of the serious loss and inconvenience caused to annuitants owing to the discontinuance by the Land Commission of the issue of the six-day notices, and, if so, whether he will take the necessary steps to re-establish the system of issuing such notices in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to revert to the practice of issuing these notices.  The reasons for the discontinuance of the practice of issuing 6-day notices in connection with the collection of land purchase instalments were dealt with by me in my statement in debate in the Dáil on 11th January, 1924, and again on 2nd December, 1925, in reply to a question in regard to proceedings against defaulters in County Kerry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it is not proposed to revert to the practice of issuing those notices, and I referred to the reasons already given in a debate in the Dáil for that decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us any indication how much the extra cost of this is&mdash;how much the legal Department of the Land Commission recovered from the excess costs because of this?  How much have they recovered in excess costs from the annuitants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, and it is a very serious matter.  Could the Minister give us any indication of the amount the Land Commission has recovered by reason of having discontinued this six-days' notice?  Is it for the purpose of financing the legal Department of the Land Commission that this notice has been discontinued?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NocholasWall" hpid="Mr. WALL Mr. WALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALL</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago the Minister gave us an undertaking in connection with this matter that he would retain the receivable orders until the annuities mature and then send them out in order to save expense. That has not been done.  That would not involve additional expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is on a different point.  The suggestion that the receivable orders should be retained and sent out immediately the instalment becomes due, would not clear up the situation.  That would be no good to people in arrears and these are the people who are making trouble. We never get any complaints from people who have paid their annuities as they fall due.  These people never complain that they have not got their receivable orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware how inaccurate that statement is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will allow me to finish and then make his speech afterwards.  I was pointing out that we never get any complaints from people who pay their annuities. The people who always complain that they have not got their receivable orders are the people who are in arrears.  You could not retain the receivable orders until the instalment would mature; in the case of people who are in arrears I am afraid that would not meet the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NocholasWall" hpid="Mr. WALL Mr. WALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALL</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, to my own knowledge, numbers of cases where regular payers of their annuities have not received their receivable orders. That occurred in my own case.  I admit I overlooked the matter, but I know there are many other cases of the same kind.  I think it would be a great asset to everybody if the receivable orders were retained by the Land Commission until the annuities had matured and were then sent out.  That would not cost any extra expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There you are.  Would it be right to change the procedure for people who would undoubtedly overlook it?  In fifty per cent. of the cases everybody would wait until he got the six-days' notice and the receivable <Col N="1455" /> orders would be so much waste of time and expense.  That is what would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NocholasWall" hpid="Mr. WALL Mr. WALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to revert to the six-days' notice at all on account of the additional expenditure it would involve, but what I do want is the retention by the Land Commission of the receivable orders until the next moiety is due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

      <P>Proceedings were originally instituted by the owner for the sale of this estate direct to his tenants under the Irish Land Act, 1903, and purchase agreements signed by the parties were lodged with the Land Commission on the 26th October, 1906. The Land Commission, however, owing to the character of the holdings, refused to declare the lands fit to be regarded as an &ldquo;estate&rdquo; for the purposes of the Act.  Subsequently the Congested Districts Board purchased the estate.  Pending the negotiations between the owner and the Board for the purchase of the estate the Land Commission continued to collect interest in lieu of rent from the tenants. It is not considered advisable to resell to the tenants their holdings in their existing condition, and the Land Commission are endeavouring to acquire other lands to be used for the enlargement of the holdings on the estate with a view to fitting them for resale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only right before this proposal of the Minister is accepted by the Dáil that the point of view of the Farmers' Party should be restated and our attitude towards this measure made perfectly clear.  It is proposed by it to establish a new order in the administration of local affairs. It would be unwise that the Bill should pass through the Dáil without the Farmers' Party declaring again their disbelief in the effectiveness of the Bill for raising the standard of local administration to the height which we would like to see it reach.  By passing this Bill the Minister in effect says to the local authorities:&mdash;&ldquo;I have no faith in your ability, capacity or integrity <Col N="1462" /> to select the people who are to serve under you in the administration of local affairs.  I feel that you have performed this work in the past in such an unworthy manner that the old order must change and I accordingly have determined that a body known as the Local Appointments Commissioners shall be set up who will select the individuals to be appointed to every position under local authorities.&rdquo;  That is the declaration which the Minister is making by the passing of this measure.  We cannot agree with that. Undoubtedly nobody can declare that everything has been as perfect as we would wish in connection with local administration.  While we cannot say that, we can predict with certainty that everything is not going to be satisfactory under the new order.  I am prepared to prophesy that the operations of this measure will not be more successful in the making of local appointments than has been the case up to the present.  I will go further and say that before twelve months every local authority will have thrust on it some particular individual to fill a certain position and that the local authority will have no alternative but to accept that individual.  In many cases it will be seen that the selected individual will not be the best and most suitable of the applicants and a clamour will arise from all the elected bodies for an alteration of the conditions that the Minister is enforcing and for an amendment of the Bill.  Whatever party will come into power after the next election will be compelled by the pressure of public opinion to amend this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all recognise that some change was necessary, and were prepared to concede that an examination test should be instituted.  We believe further that the best of the candidates at the examination should be appointed to any vacant post.  Examining the measure as it stands, I say that the Minister made very little concessions.  We believe that he should have acceded to our request with reference to the number of successful candidates whose names should be submitted to the local authorities.  We might as well, in fact, have left the appointments to the Minister himself and not have asked him to change the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to <Col N="1463" />&ldquo;Local Authority,&rdquo; because the local authority will be but a registering body to do just as the selection board will demand that they shall do.  The majority of the Dáil seem to think that is right.  We are not satisfied that it is right, or that it will bring the results anticipated.  The Bill will not put an end to canvassing.  I repeat again what I said at an earlier stage that the canvassing will be changed from the members of local authorities to the members of the Dáil.  Whatever the position may be, the impression will prevail, and you will have great difficulty in disabusing people's minds of it, that people will now have to try and get the local T.D. to do what the local council did before&mdash;to try and get the local T.D. to see what can be done by discovering who are the members of the selection board and if the Local Appointments Commissioners can be approached, so that the selection may be determined in a particular way.  It is not satisfactory that such an impression should prevail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The impression is there.  You will have to take conditions as they are.  I am not giving it&mdash;I am not saying that it is the position.  I am dealing with what is accepted as being the position, and you have to take cognisance of it.  There is no use in the Minister suggesting that what I am saying is not true&mdash;is not believed.  It is and it will be.  When you are proceeding along lines which mean that the appointments to every position under local or national authorities are to be determined by a body set up in the capital, what does it mean?  It means that every wire-puller, every individual who wants to get a position, not through merit, but through his ability to pull the wires, will believe that nothing can be done unless he is first able to use such influence on members of the Dáil as will secure for him what he thinks is being taken from him under the new conditions.  Ministers know quite well what the feelings of the people are with regard to the making of appointments.  You are not <Col N="1464" /> going to change all that in a night or by an Act of Parliament.  Undoubtedly whether it is satisfactory or not, the concensus of opinion down the country in the future will be that everything in the country must be managed from Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I express my surprise at the attitude of the Labour Party towards this measure who have been declaring against this policy of centralisation. They feel that local authorities are so incapable and so unworthy of the trust reposed in them by the local people who elected them, the same people who elected us, that they are prepared to put men in on a local body who are not fair, who cannot be just, who have no capacity or ability to judge the merits of those who are to serve under them in local bodies.  If the electors in the management of local affairs are so blind that they are not capable of passing judgment on the integrity of the men who are to represent them, what can be said about their ability to select men or to elect men to come to this House?  If those men are to be trained to understand better their responsibility as citizens, how better can you make them understand that than to put them in a position of responsibility?  Yet, day after day, you are removing responsibilities from them and declaring them incapable of discharging them.  That policy is not going to give you the type of citizen you require for the administration of local affairs.  If a man is not put in the position first of having to give earnest of his ability and his honesty you will not have a man going for the position worthy of the trust of the people.  If the position is small, insignificant and mean you will just have the individual worthy of the post and of the work he has to discharge. You will have the people who are electing that representative treating the position in a similar manner. All along the line, as we are moving towards centralisation, day after day, we are inclined to the policy of distrusting the capacity of people to do anything right.  We seem to indicate we have no faith that either now or in the future under new conditions there are any possibilities they are going to improve.  We take away all <Col N="1465" /> the responsibility they have been exercising up to the present, and put the trust in other people, believing, as the Minister says, that the corruption, nepotism and all the rest, is going to pass, fade and be a thing only of memory, that everything in the management of our local affairs is to be clean in the future, that we are going to get by the new methods the best possible type of public servant, a far better type of public servant than the old system gave us, and, further, that the success of the measure is so assured already that the people will applaud it.  The Minister's case is not sound.  I believe, to go part of the way with the Minister, that he should have given the present administrators a chance and see what two or three years under present conditions would have meant and if, after experience under the new and changed conditions, the more serious responsibilities that have been brought to every citizen in the Free State for the last four or five years he saw that things were not better, then the Minister could come, or some other Minister, and make a change.  If the case could be supported by facts, if by the experience of three or four years the new men were not going to be any improvement beyond what the old people were, the Minister would have a better case than he has, but in asking the House to pass the measure before us now, the Minister is asking us to declare what we here are not prepared to state, and that is that the people elected to the local authorities, have not the capacity, ability or honesty to select the best men for the posts that become vacant under them and because of that fact and because the Minister has no faith that there can be any change in the outlook of those people in the future, the Minister is taking away that authority from them and vesting it in other people.  I reiterate that the Minister will not have the success in the venture which he anticipates.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey, like Deputy Baxter, said that this measure took away from the electorate the power which they had and that it showed distrust and want of faith in them.  The electorate can elect the county council, and the Dáil.  They have the same power with regard to the county council that they have with regard to the Dáil.  No power has been taken away from them.  The county council can do the same work as they did hitherto.  The Executive Council selects its officials through the means of a competitive examination.  It is the highest body in the land and has the most power in the land.  By this measure the county councils are placed on the same level exactly as the Executive Council.  How that can be regarded as a degradation, a lowering of their status or power, I fail to see. Those were the two points raised by Deputy Baxter and, on reconsideration, I think he will see they are not very strong points.</P>

      <P>Deputy Baxter, seconded by Deputy Sears, suggests to the House that the Labour Party, in supporting the new edition of this Bill, is inconsistent, having regard to its opposition to the first edition of the Bill.  I am afraid Deputy Baxter, in the statement of his opposition to the first edition of the Bill, cannot have been entirely frank.  I opposed and those sitting behind me, opposed the first Bill because it tended to centralise the power of appointment in the hands of the Minister and because it did nothing, in our opinion, towards the setting up of a Municipal Civil Service. But if any careful student would read the new Bill and compare it with the old Bill, he would see that the reverse is now the case&mdash;that the power of appointment does not rest with the Minister, that the Public Appointments Committee, which is set up under the <Col N="1467" /> Bill, is not now set up to advise the Minister but to respond to the call of the local authority, that there is an entirely different conception of the relations between the local authority and the Minister.  Further, there is within the Bill, though it is not mandatory, power&mdash;I have faith enough to believe that it will be exercised at an early date&mdash;to begin the actual preparation of a scheme for the establishment of a civil service for local administration. When the civil service is established, the automatic workings of the system will ensure that the persons to be appointed by local authorities for such grades and positions as may be specified, will be appointed on merit and not by personal influence or canvassing of any kind.  If the Deputy is not able to see the difference between the Bill as it is now and the Bill as it was introduced, I fear the meaning I attached to his opposition was not the real meaning.</P>
      <P>I think the Deputy has, by his speech, done a good deal of damage to the public reputation of the Dáil.  It is most unfortunate that from a Deputy there should go out even a suggestion that one of the functions of Deputies is to assist in influencing either Ministers or the Public Appointments Committee, or anything analogous to the Public Appointments Committee, in connection with the selection of persons for appointments. The very fact that it can be stated in the Dáil is a suggestion that it exists.  Does it exist?  If there is any evidence at all that it exists I would be the first to applaud any Deputy who would table the facts here and let us brand the canvasser with dereliction of duty and with faithlessness to his public trust.</P>

What I want to make clear is that under the new order, with the setting up of a Commission and a Selection Board, one name will be sent down to the local authority after the decision of the Selection Board has been made. The impression amongst local people <Col N="1468" /> will be&mdash;it will be idle for them, I admit&mdash;that they must change the scene from the home district to the centre where your Commission or your Selection Board is to operate.  The impression with them, unfortunately, will be that they must try to get after their local Deputy to see what he will do. The result will be that the local Deputy will be plagued and worried to death over this sort of thing.  That is the position that he, unfortunately, will be placed in.  That will be the impression they will have.</P>

No honest Deputy who desires to do the fair thing by his constituents wants to be put in the position that the impression that he could do anything to influence such a body as this would place him in.

I feel that in this, as in too many other instances, the public have sometimes regarded membership of the Dáil as an administrative office &mdash;as part of the administrative system. I am afraid it has not been sufficiently made clear that that is by no means the position of Deputies in this House.</P>
      <P>Therefore the position that Deputy Baxter has now arrived at is that there is no foundation for the suggestion or for the opinion that might prevail in the country that Deputies can, by any means, influence the Civil Service Commission or its parallel, the Public Appointments Committee proposed under this Act.  That being the case, and that erroneous opinion being easily dispelled, what is there left?  This Public Appointments Committee, acting on behalf of the local authorities, will make selections of the fittest persons to fill the office, and will send to the local authorities who apply, the name of the fittest person.  I think that is a desirable development.  When it is extended to the wider administrative offices, fitness being the only test, surely that will be a development that most of us at any rate have been anticipating and hoping for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no need to apologise for my opposition to the first draft of the Bill <Col N="1470" /> and for my support of the present Bill. The Deputy says there is no difference. Presumably he bases that remark on the fact that the Commission will only send down one name, and will do that at the instigation of the local authority rather than at the instigation of the Minister.  If the Deputy thinks that that is not a change, and that the dropping of Section 10 and Section 12 and all the implications that these sections involved, has made no change in the Bill then I have nothing more to say.  I think it has made a very great change in the Bill, at least so great a change as to warrant my clear approval of it as it now stands, notwithstanding my fierce opposition to the Bill as it was when first presented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wish to say in connection with this Bill that I think the Minister had already sufficient power to deal with the causes that led him to introduce this Bill.  It has been known that in counties of the Saorstát practices that were anything but creditable had been in operation for years. I think that will not be denied by anybody who has any local knowledge. The Minister has suspended several local authorities for incorrect procedure and for palpable faults.  Has he not the same powers of treating local authorities for malpractices, contemplated by this Bill to-day, and if so, why cannot he exercise them?  I say suspension is good enough for any local authority guilty of practices of this description.  It deserves it.  If anybody is guilty of such conduct the Department that the Minister rules over can come down upon them and so purify the administration while preserving the idea of local control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What object have we now in calling this Department the Local Government Department, or calling the Minister Minister for Local Government?  It is the Department of Central Government and he is Minister for Central Government.  Local authority and local jurisdiction is gone.  Under the Bill every vestige of what was local authority resides now with the Minister. Not a single appointment can be made, not even a roadmaker or a stonebreaker can be appointed by the local authorities.  I am not one of those <Col N="1471" /> who would stand up for corruption of any sort in the local, private or the higher services in the country, and I say where it exists it should be stamped out, but this is not the way to do it.  This is not the way to restore public morality, or public confidence to the nation.  To remedy some of the evils that are now existing under local authorities powers must be transferred from those local authorities to a central Department.  If that is the only means that can be found for curing these evils, it is pretty desperate and it is a great national confession of degradation.  That is what I call it. The only function of the local authorities for the future will be to find the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not going to make for good administration.  Everything is to be done from Dublin and the power of supervision and authority in the local authorities is gone even over their own officers.  And we are told this is good government.  I say, in my humble opinion, it is not good government. I think in common decency, the first thing we ought to do in connection with this Bill is to remove the term &ldquo;Local Government Department and Minister for Local Government&rdquo; and not have this palpable fallacy.  We <Col N="1472" /> are asked to believe that some Committee of Public Appointments are going to be super-human beings&mdash; people who must live shut up behind glass walls.  They will be without family influence.  Nothing can influence them.  I can see the members of these local Appointments Committee invited to all the teas and luncheons in Dublin.  Not a word will be said; not an attempt will be made to influence them.  But they are human beings all the same and cannot divest themselves of their humanity.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to raising the standard as high as you like to raise it. Raise it any way in order to secure efficiency, in order to ensure good local public service, in medicine and otherwise. But when you have reached that standard why not leave it to the local authority which pays the money, and which is supposed to control its servants, to appoint them?  Where they have been guilty, and where they are likely to be guilty of malpractices, suspend them, and in that way encourage a healthy local administration. I want you to realise that the county councils are very little our inferiors; the members of them are just as good as many of us, and perhaps better than most of us, and I do not think it will make for the right atmosphere, and it certainly will not make for good local administration and good local control of officers, to pass this Bill.</P>

We are told that it is a slur on their character and on their honesty to limit in any way their right to make appointments.  The whole point of this discussion is that the county council should be in a far different position from, a far superior position to, the Executive Council. Remember that the Farmers' Party opposed the previous Bill, and they opposed it because, as they pointed out, the local bodies should have some say, should come into the machinery at some place.  Now there is to be a special selection board appointed by them.  They have the actual appointment, in the same way as I have the appointment of anybody in the Department of Agriculture, no more and no less.</P>

He put it in the third person: &ldquo;What would the people in the country say? They would say that jobbery was being transferred from the country to Dublin, and that nothing that the Ministry or the Dáil could say would alter that.&rdquo;  Deputy Johnson, of course, met the point, and there is no answer to what he said.  That remains for Deputies themselves.  Has the Deputy, or any Deputy, ever succeeded in influencing, say, the Civil Service Commission? I challenge any Deputy to get up and say that he has.</P>

There are people who believe, and you cannot get it out of their heads, that every man has his price.  That is what it all comes to, and it is an absolutely rotten point of view.  There are people who have not their price, that is the long and short of it, and all Parties will have to learn that.  There are people who are above that; there are people who would not do it for any consideration, and it is cheapening the Dáil and cheapening public life to make such statements.  There are enough people around the country to make these unworthy statements. Leave it to them.  But it is for us to protect the decencies of our institutions and to keep our standards high, and we should leave that sort of talk to somebody else.  The talk about what powers are left to the county councils is also nonsense.  Poor Law, roads, asylums, all the other powers they ever had are left to them.  What powers are left to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture?  I mention my own case because I know my Department better than the next man perhaps.  Powers are left to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, even though he makes no appointments.  Has he no his hands sufficiently full with his own responsibilities, and can he not carry them out? No Minister would come here and say: &ldquo;Such and such a thing happened; such and such a thing is wrong, but I have not the making of my own appointments and I accept no responsibility for it.&rdquo;  If he did, what would Deputy Gorey or Deputy Baxter say? They would not listen to him for two minutes, and forsooth, the appointment of a rate collector by the Local Government Selection Board can be a slur because the power is taken away from the county council.</P>

      <P>A rate collector. This is very important.  It is the kernel of the whole matter.  The Minister refused an amendment that would have left this appointment with the local authority.  I want the Minister to put himself in the position of a member of the board to select a rate collector for the County Galway, and I want him to say how, under this measure, it is to be done.  Are the selection board to be from the county concerned?  If they are not, how are they to do the work?</P>

I am quite content to put my initials opposite the first name on the list sent in by the Civil Service Commission.  Let the county council do the same thing.  I am asked to solve this insoluble problem of the rate collector.  He must add, I think, subtract, multiply and divide. He must be up to a certain standard of education, extremely high, I know, much higher than that of the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, the Establishment Officer of the Department of Finance, or the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce. But still, as I see it, his qualifications are to be a fairly good education. If he has previous experience of similar work it would count in his favour.  I am giving what I, if I were on the selection board, would take into account.  If he had a good education, and was able to do clerical work and calculations, it would also count in his favour.  I would take into account his personality.  I would ask him some questions to find out what sort of a man he was.  If I found there was something wrong with him in his past in some similar job I would rule him out.</P>

Certainly it would be a very extraordinary thing for me, or my Department, to include in the list of those who should be appointed by the Local Appointments Committee, people who, for one reason or another, could not possibly be appointed, or could only be appointed with great difficulty. There is a special difficulty with regard to rate collectors, and for that reason Deputy Baxter has picked out that class owing to the fact that collectors may require to be men of well-known integrity locally and, perhaps, men of considerable substance.  That is not a matter with which we are concerned at the moment.  It is for the local authority and the Commissioners to decide whether a particular selection board should have people with local knowledge on it or not.

      <P>Members of the selection board.  He said they were only human.  I remember a case recently where a friend of mine, a member of a county council, was being canvassed, and he explained, rather humourously, circumstances that arose in connection with it.  This man was a non-drinker, but at the time he was in a public-house with seven or eight friends, each of whom was being plied with drink, not by the candidate for the job, but by some friends of his.  They were trying to impress on the friends of the candidate that they had this man's vote in their pockets, and he said he was the only one who did not know what he was going to do with his own vote.  When this Bill was introduced there was one thing I regretted about it and that was that if it passed it might have the effect of abolishing what was in this country a thriving industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I believe in the development of industry I was, at that time, rather inclined to oppose the Bill, but after serious consideration I came to the conclusion that this particular industry was confined to a comparatively small number of people; in other words, to a certain small section who had a monopoly of it.  Not being in favour of monopolies I thought that we might let that industry go.  I refer to the industry of the breeding of prize cats.  I do not know if some Deputies ever heard of such an industry, but I believe it was a common thing for canvassers, on behalf of persons who wanted public appointments, to visit people who had the making of such appointments, and if there was a decent looking cat about <Col N="1479" /> the premises the visitor immediately claimed that it must be a prize one and very often offered £100 for it.</P>
    <P>On a recent occasion five Deputies were travelling from Cork to Dublin, one of whom had been for over a quarter of a century a member of different public boards.  In order to while away the time stories were told. One of the party told a very interesting story.  There was a vacancy for a doctor, and as this man was a member of the rural district council and the board of guardians a friend of one of the candidates came to his house.  This man, seeing a sideboard in one of the rooms, ran his fingers along it, and it dawned upon him suddenly that this was a piece of old Chippendale.  That was another industry, perhaps a sideline of culture that will be abolished by the passing of this Bill&mdash;looking after ancient furniture.  This was a surprising revelation to me.  I never heard of any of these things before.  This man actually offered £300 for the piece of old Chippendale, and what surprised me still more was that my friend refused the offer.  We heard a number of yarns of this description, all of which went to prove that there was a good deal of bribery carried on in the past in connection with public appointments. On one occasion, three or four years ago, a friend asked me to use what little influence I had with members of a certain board of guardians in order to get him a job as a dispensary doctor.  I approached one member that I knew very well and I asked him if he had not promised his vote to consider the question of voting for the individual who asked me to speak for him. This man bluntly answered &ldquo;No.  I am already bought.  It is a matter of indifference to me who gets the job, but I promised the first man who made a decent offer.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Nagle gave a very poor record of the integrity of local boards.  I had not a particularly high opinion of the integrity of a great many of the local boards in the past, but I would point out that the Minister is establishing practically a new régime and is putting it up to local boards to show that they are of a different type to the boards that existed in the past.  The first Bill which the Minister introduces, after having done that, is one that takes away from local boards the power of appointment which they had.  I maintain that if you put responsibilities on these local boards you must, at the same time, show that you have confidence in them. The analogy that has been drawn between appointments made here by the Civil Service Commission and the appointments that will be made in future by the Local Authorities Commission is not a true one.  It is my argument that the whole weakness of this Bill depends on the faultiness of that analogy.  The appointments made by the Civil Service Commission cover, to a great extent, junior men, men who begin at the bottom of the ladder and who from the point of view of experience are much on the same level. These men get a reasonably fair chance of proving their merit by means of a Civil Service examination.  With regard to the appointments that in future will be made locally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to correct the Deputy.  He is not giving a true picture of the case.  While the Civil Service Commission, by means of competitive examinations, makes appointments, it also appoints people to very responsible positions where the system of examination does not apply: positions such as those of director of the broadcasting station, assistant State chemist and a great many other <Col N="1481" /> positions that are bigger than the great majority of the local positions to which this Bill would apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite well aware that the Civil Service Commission appoints people to positions other than those of a junior character made as a result of a competitive examination. I maintain, however, that the number of appointments made in that way by the Civil Service Commission, whether by means of a selection board or otherwise, is very small compared with the total number of appointments made through means of an examination. The Minister by his statement shows the difficulties which the Civil Service Commission is up against in the case of selecting people who must have particular qualifications, qualifications which cannot be judged by an examination. The Minister mentioned the appointment to the broadcasting station.  A difficulty arose in regard to that very appointment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a very junior position, I think&mdash;that is the position in which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was interested and on which there was a very ardent debate in the Dáil.  It was argued at the time that it was very difficult to fill those appointments&mdash;the appointment of people having special abilities which could not be tested by an examination or even by a selection board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think no difficulty arose.  The selection board had no difficulty in coming to a conclusion and the Civil Service Commission experienced no difficulty, but they did have a certain disagreement with the Minister.  That is a different matter altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>When it comes to the question of the appointments that are to be made locally we are up against a different proposition altogether. <Col N="1482" /> It was put fairly and squarely to the Minister by Deputy Baxter when he asked him &ldquo;How can the local selection committee select the best man to act as a rate collector?&rdquo; I ask&mdash; How is the selection Committee going to select the best men to act in, say, the position of home help officer?  I say that you must appoint men, senior in experience and in years, to fill a position of that kind.  I say, too, that local knowledge of the candidates' abilities and qualifications is absolutely essential before such an appointment can be made.  If the local authority, or even the General Council of County Councils, had the appointment of the selection boards, I would say that there would be some justification for this Bill, but that is not going to be the case.  The appointment of a selection board will rest with the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that statement of the Deputy should be corrected. The statement is not quite right, and perhaps the Minister for Finance, who is conversant with the working of this, will correct it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must surely be aware that the selection board will be appointed by the Commission.  The Executive Council will have nothing to do with that and will not know who the members of it are.  I might say, in case the Deputy should wish to raise the point, in respect of the Civil Service Commission, that the Executive Council has never asked a question, or expressed a wish or attempted to communicate with the Civil Service Commission in any way in respect of the constitution of selection boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Executive Council will not appoint the selection board, but it will appoint the Local Authorities Commission, and this latter will appoint the selection board. The feeling down through the country is, and I believe it is justified, that all these appointments will be coloured by the outlook of the City of Dublin, and that in future there will be no appointments for boys from the country or from the small towns.  I believe that, to a certain extent, the <Col N="1483" /> feeling which exists down through the country is justified, not because the selection board will be corrupt, or even that they would be consciously unfair or that the local committee will be consciously unfair, but rather because their whole outlook will be coloured by the outlook of the young men educated in the cities.  It is stated through the country that in future local appointments will, to a large extent, be the preserve of graduates of the University and that the programme of examination will be so drawn up that the subjects on it will only fit in with the qualifications of men trained in the Universities.  While I have the greatest appreciation of the advantages of University training, I want to see the boys from the country getting the same chance as boys living here in the city who have the opportunity of attending the Universities.  The country boy may not even have the opportunity of getting a secondary education because of the cost involved, a cost that does not arise in the case of the city boy who has the opportunity of attending secondary schools.  Most of those positions under local boards could be filled by any young boy who has availed to the full of the course of training given in a good national school.  Any boy who has taken a full course at a national school should be capable of filling a great many of these appointments under the local boards. That would apply to nearly all appointments except those requiring technical qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The feeling in the country is that the opportunity for a country boy to get one of these appointments will be wiped away, and that he will have no chance of getting them.  The result will be that you will have officers coming down from Dublin to fill up those appointments under local bodies.  That, I think, is almost certain to lead to friction and strife between the appointees and the local boards.  Deputy Johnson has, as he says, justified himself for the action he has taken on this Bill as amended.  I do not share his justification because, in my opinion, the changes made in the Bill as amended, in so far as they convey any authority or power to the local authorities, <Col N="1484" /> are purely nominal.  As far as I can gather, the change made in the Bill merely means that a local authority has the power to ask the Local Appointments Committee to make the appointment.  As the Bill stood originally the Minister had that power.  As far as I can see, that is only a change in name and not in reality.  I would be sympathetic towards the Bill if the Minister really had, as Deputy Johnson says he has, taken a step towards the foundation of a Local Authorities Civil Service.  If such a foundation has been laid I say it is one of a very flimsy character.  I would rather have seen the Minister wait and deal with this whole question of a local Civil Service by means of a comprehensive Bill. If the Minister did that, I do not say that his Bill would have my sympathy or support, but it might.  He is certainly not doing that under this Bill. You cannot have a local Civil Service where the promotion is confined to a particular local council.  The field of promotion is altogether inadequate and does not open up a vista with real prospects for men entering such a Civil Service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving my view of the Bill.  It allows, I acknowledge, for appointments from existing officers, but it does not allow for any particular form of promotion within the existing class of officers.  It does not allow for transfer between one local board and another.  If a local civil service is to be created it must allow for something in the nature of transfer from one board to another, something comparable, perhaps, to the system prevailing in banks or the Civil Service. There is nothing in the Bill to show the Minister has that intention. Deputy Baxter said, and I agree with him, that the Minister should have given a chance to the new boards to prove themselves and to show their incorruptibility or corruptibility.  A lot has been said about nepotism and corruption on the part of local boards, but nothing has been said about the possibilities of corruption in higher quarters.  I do not say, and I have <Col N="1485" /> never said, it has existed.  I make no charge.</P>

      <P>I have no intention whatever, if words mean anything, of conveying what the Minister suggests or thinks.  I say that in other countries central governments have become corrupt, and that there is no reason why we here should take it for granted that central governments and the powers under them are guarded against being corrupt, whereas we take it for granted that local boards down the country will immediately, become corrupt.  That is the confidence we have in these local boards.  I am convinced that the idea in the back of the head of the Minister for Local Government with regard to local authorities is that he has no confidence in them, and that he intends at the earliest possible date to centralise local government control in his Department, but we are living in a democratic State, and are supposed to place confidence in the electors and in the people appointed by them, whether in the Dáil or on the local boards.  Instead we are taking every step we can to show that we have no confidence in the people selected by the electors, particularly in the people who have been selected down the country. I know of my own personal knowledge that the men selected for the county councils down the country on the last occasion started into their work determined to do it in a straight and upright way, and I think people in the Dáil instead of doubting their integrity and showing doubt on the first possible opportunity should give them a chance of proving themselves instead of passing this Bill, which I consider a vote of want of confidence in the local authorities.</P>

      <P>This whole discussion has taken the drift that the House should have more trust in the local authorities. Some time ago when the Executive Council and the Government were impeached here, and direct charges of corruption made against them, they made all appointments on a civil service basis and established a Civil Service Commission.  No man can say but that has worked well, and no man is now in a position to say, or suggest even, that the Government is corrupt. It will be the same when a Civil Service Commission is established <Col N="1487" /> for appointments to all local authorities. Frequently we are asked to get appointments here in the central Government for people we know throughout the country.  My amiable and honey-tongued friend, Deputy Gorey, is after moaning or laughing.

      <P>If I may be permitted to resume discussion, I would say that everything proposed in this Bill means clean administration under <Col N="1488" /> the local authorities.  I never charged the local authorities with corruption, whether they were situated near the Shannon or far away from it.  That is not the question.  I believe that temptations to corruption should be removed. Deputy Heffernan mentioned that all these appointments which would be made after the establishment of the Civil Service Commission would be collared by the people of Dublin.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Heffernan goes through the civil service departments here, and if he hunts up the personnel of those different departments, he will find that these men have been recruited from Kerry, Cork, and every other county, and the only qualification was their fitness as candidates to beat others.  I think when he goes down to County Tipperary&mdash;and I have no doubt that Tipperarymen will hold their own in these appointments&mdash;he need have no doubt about Dublin manning the whole country.  It has never done it.  To talk of the commission making the test for these appointments on a university basis is very extravagant.  What commission would insist on a knowledge of biology and physiology for a rate collector? Suitable rate collectors seem to be very difficult men to find.</P>

      <P>It is, and sometimes, when they find them, they do not find their way to the right place.  I do not see why these rates could not be collected by post, and why any outstanding rates could not be collected by the Civic Guard.  We have heard a great deal about economy, but I have never yet heard economists say that most of the local duties could be done by the Civic Guard.  The work in connection with nine out of ten of these posts could, I believe, be discharged by Civic Guards, and it would be an immense saving to the ratepayers.  Again, we must remember that the General Council of County Councils favours these appointments being made by examinations.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Baxter says that he wants these appointments made by examination, and that the men who get first place should get the appointments, what is the meaning of this panel of candidates?  I doubt that he will find it easy to answer that.  He wants a panel with the names of the candidates numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, in the order of merit, and, if that panel is to have any meaning, according to Deputy Baxter, it is that the man who gets the sixth place will be just as liable to be appointed as the man who gets the first place.  If he says that the man who gets the first place must get the position. I would not differ from him.  It has been suggested that this Bill is a scheme to do away with local authorities. We might remember that the great democracy of the United States of America transacts much of its local business by means of Commissions and does it well.  I am not at all squeamish on this subject.  It is not, at all, a reflection on the members of local authorities to say that they have neither the training nor the time for the work they are called upon to discharge.  A good deal of the work of local authorities is done really by officials, and the officials' word is taken all through.  I must congratulate the Minister and the Government on this Bill.

      <P>You may have your opinion, but I say again the Bill is popular with those people who want appointments in Ireland to be made on merit alone.  It would be foolish for me to think that any man on a public board, if his son or nephew is up for a position, is going to vote for any other candidate because he believes him better qualified.  He will vote for his son, his cousin and his friend.  Let us be honest with ourselves.  If I were on a board I would do the same thing, and for that reason I am glad that the Minister has brought in this Bill.  It will do away with nepotism, and though I have never dwelt upon the corrupt side of local authorities, if it existed, the Bill will also effectively do away with it.</P>

      <P>I had no idea that Deputy Baxter was going to treat us at this stage to a funeral oration over the dead body of local jobbery.  We had threshed out every phase of this Bill already on three stages, and I thought there was very little to be said.  So far as Deputy Baxter has brought any new light to bear on the subject, I think Deputy Johnson has disposed of it. Deputy Baxter's case all through the debate on this Bill has been based on misrepresentation.  He has never faced up to the issue squarely.  This Bill is endeavouring to put into operation, with regard to local authorities, the principle that we had already adopted as regards the central Government&mdash; namely, the principle that efficient servants, whether for local services or for central services, can best be recruited through the medium of machinery which is independent of people who have to depend upon the popular franchise for election.  It is not a question of a lack of confidence in local authorities. I have had considerable experience during the last few years of local authorities, and I would like to pay a tribute to the members of those bodies.  I think in the very difficult circumstances of the last few years <Col N="1492" /> they have carried out their duties remarkably well.  I consider they have acquitted themselves better perhaps than we had reason to expect in such difficult circumstances, but this is a question of the whole policy of having public representatives in a position where they can be canvassed&mdash;of that being an improper and wrong state of affairs.</P>
      <P>I believe if you had councils of Archangels placed in the position of the present local authorities they could not be completely sure of themselves in the various circumstances that arise in connection with these appointments.  We are all human, as Deputy Gorey and other Deputies have remarked, and we cannot divest ourselves of our human nature.  If we are under obligations to people for services in the past or for possible services in the future, it is very difficult to bring an unbiassed judgment to bear on the merits of candidates who come up before us for selection.  In the recent local elections I think most parties made it a plank in their platform that all appointments should be made through open competitive examination.  All parties were agreed upon that, and I cannot understand now the attitude of certain Deputies in running away from it.  When I was introducing this Bill I really expected that there would be very little opposition.  Some Deputy&mdash;I think it was Deputy Heffernan&mdash;mentioned the fact that the only result of this Bill will be to restrict appointments to men who are born in the city of Dublin. Well, as Deputy Hennessy has pointed out, one need only run through the names in the present Civil Service to see immediately that that is a fallacy.</P>

      <P>Quite recently there was an appointment made to a post <Col N="1493" /> down the country, and some of the local people were very much astonished when a man who had got very high literary qualifications and passed exceptionally difficult examinations was passed over in favour of a man who had practically no literary qualifications but who had great practical experience. In the future as in the past any selection board set up by the Civil Service Commissioners or by these Local Appointments Commissioners may be relied upon to exercise sound common sense in selecting candidates, and there is no point in trying to find extraordinary cases to illustrate our points of view.  In this and in every other matter there will be border-line cases and there will be times when it will be a difficult matter to decide whether a certain class of officer should be brought within the scope of the Bill or not.  I think it was very unfair to this House and to Deputies themselves, to take up the attitude that because we are insisting on the same procedure for the appointment of officials for local authorities, as we had insisted upon <Col N="1494" /> with regard to our own officials, we are displaying a lack of confidence and a lack of trust in these bodies.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,200,326 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1927, for Superannuation, Compensation, Compassionate and Additional Allowances and Gratuities under sundry Statutes; Compensation under Article 10 of the Treaty of the 6th December, 1921; Compassionate Allowances, Gratuities and Supplementary Pensions awarded by the Minister for Finance, the salary of the Medical Referee; and sundry repayments in respect of pensions at present paid by the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will notice that there is an increase of £43,499 shown in this Estimate. This increase arises from two causes.  There is a certain increase in the ordinary superannuation allowances; that is, superannuation allowances paid to people who retired in the ordinary course through the setting up <Col N="1496" /> of the Saorstát.  There is an estimated increase in compensation allowances under Article X. of the Treaty.  If the Wigg and Cochrane case is disposed of at an early date there will be a considerable number of civil servants who will go out under the Treaty.  Their cases have been held up since proceedings were started in the Wigg and Cochrane case.</P>
    <P>There is another increase in sub-head M&mdash;Re-payments to the British Government in respect of civil pensions.  That increase arises in this way:&mdash;Up to the present we have not been paying the full British demand in respect of inland revenue pensions, and Customs and Excise pensions.  The British Government made a demand which was based on a calculation arrived at in this way:&mdash;They took the salaries, wages and overtime of the staff engaged on Saorstát Revenue and Customs and Excise work in the period, 1st April to 5th December, 1922, and they took the salaries, wages and overtime of the entire Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise staff, and applied that fraction to the total pension charge in respect of Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise as at 6th December, 1922.  We did not accept that calculation as being correct, and so far, we have paid only 80 per cent. of the British claim.  We have not yet accepted the calculation they made as being entirely accurate, but we are clear that there is no justification for keeping anything like 20 per cent. of the demand back.  We are making provision this year for a sum of £37,600 in respect of arrears arising through the keeping back of 20 per cent. of the British claim.  It is hoped that during the present year&mdash; very shortly&mdash;some definite agreement will be reached with the British Government as to the figure which is properly chargeable against us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there was an amendment on the Order Paper proposing the reduction of this sum.  It was standing in the name of Deputy Cooper, but apparently it has been withdrawn.  I would like to point out it is a logical conclusion of the advocates of cutting down the Civil Service that this Vote should be substantially increased; any substantial reduction in <Col N="1497" /> the Civil Service means a corresponding increase in the Vote.  Perhaps the Minister will give us some definite figure as to the exact financial saving to the State by the retirements under the Treaty.  I have in mind the percentage saved through the retirements of civil servants under Article X. If a certain number of civil servants were retired, and were entitled to these pensions, what would be the percentage of gain to the State irrespective of the loss of work which those civil servants might have been engaged in?</P>
      <P>Any large reduction of the present civil administration would involve a correspondingly large increase in this Vote.  On several occasions I have urged on the Minister the advisability of exploring all the possibilities of funding this substantial annual sum, particularly with regard to the R.I.C. pensions. I notice that the R.I.C. pensions are being increased; at least the actual sum we are asked to vote is larger than last year.  That seems to be a matter that requires some explanation. There is a footnote in the Estimates in which it is mentioned that the provision includes a contribution towards British administration expenses estimated at £13,000 in connection with the pensions of the ex-R.I.C. men.  If we have to pay this large sum I think we should have more effective control over the disbursement of this money.</P>
      <P>I think that the Auditor-General should have more complete and more effective powers in auditing the accounts of the R.I.C.  This is a very large sum which the taxpayers of this country will have to pay for many years to come&mdash;until the last surviving member of the R.I.C. dies.  It will be a decreasing sum, I presume.  I think that steps should be taken to see whether during these years the Minister cannot arrive at some satisfactory system of funding this commitment&mdash; at any rate that more effective measures should be taken to see that we have complete control and a complete check over the individual payments in connection with pensions to the R.I.C.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it would be worth while if Deputies in looking at this Estimate would take into <Col N="1498" /> account this item in considering the national indebtedness.  I think it would be quite fair and reasonable if this particular Vote at any rate and perhaps one or two others were considered as equivalent to interest on war debt. If we were to take that view it would perhaps put us into a better understanding of the relative position of this country with other countries.  I want to raise a question under sub-head L. Perhaps it is not strictly in order just now, but I think it might be dealt with now as it is certainly not a contentious matter and it is one as to which I gave notice to the Minister.  It is with regard to the pensioners from the D.M.P. I think that matter is very important. It certainly is very important to the pensioners themselves that they should understand exactly what the position is with regard to their pensions.  The case is somewhat complicated, and I will try to make it clear.  The reference is to pensioners of the D.M.P. who retired prior to 1st April, 1919.  It may be asked how that date has been fixed. I do not know how the date has been fixed upon, but it is a very important date indeed to the pensioners who happened to have retired from the D.M.P. before April, 1919.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that by some arrangement the Saorstát or the Provisional Government made with the British Government under the Transfer of Functions Order that there was a transfer to the Provisional Government of the D.M.P.. and the administration and control of that force.  Now that is understood. The arrangements subsequent to the Treaty led to the decision to disband the R.I.C., but the D.M.P. were taken over and continued under the auspices of the Provisional Government and ultimately of the Saorstát Government. It appears that under this Transfer of Functions Order the date was fixed as 1st April, 1919, I think.  Whether the Order actually contains that date I am not sure, but it was arising out of the Transfer of Functions Order of April, 1922, that the position of the D.M.P. pensioners who retired prior to 1st April, 1919, came to be so very much worsened as compared with those pensioners of the British Government who <Col N="1499" /> retired afterwards or the pensioners of other services who retired prior to 1919.  I speak of a difference in pecuniary condition and I will illustrate that.  It appears that if, let us say, an inspector of the D.M.P. retired at any date up to 31st March, 1919, he would have a pension of £106 13s. 4d. If he were in a position to take advantage of, or to get any benefit from, the Increase of Pensions Act, 1920, he would have a certain addition to that, perhaps up to £50.  But if he retired since 1st April, 1919, instead of £106, plus about £50, his pension would be about £240.  In the case of a constable who retired prior to 1919, the pension was £52, with some addition under the 1920 Increase of Pensions Act&mdash;perhaps £20 or £30; but if he retired since 1st April, 1919, it would be £164 13s. 4d.  If he had the good fortune to be a member of the R.I.C., which was disbanded, instead of a member of the D.M.P., which was transferred, his pension would be very much greater than it is if he retired prior to 1st April, 1919.  A sergeant of the R.I.C. of 18 years' service who retired under the Treaty would have 12 years added and would receive £195 per annum.  A sergeant of the D.M.P. who retired prior to April, 1919, would receive £65 per annum, plus about 50 per cent. under the Increase of Pensions Act, 1920.</P>
    <P>The grievance that these men suffer under is that they have been, by the fact of their transfer, debarred from receiving the benefit of the Increase of Pensions Act, 1924, passed by the British Parliament and affecting pensioners of all kinds.  R.I.C., prison warders, postal employees and other pre-war British pensioners were all given the benefit of this Increase of Pensions Act, 1924, although those services were transferred to the Saorstát Government, except the R.I.C., just in the same way as the D.M.P. were transferred. The R.I.C. was disbanded.  In the case of prison warders, postal employees and others, the service was in fact transferred, but the responsibility for the pensions appears to have been retained by the British Government.  I am not able to understand, and it does not seem to have been explained to <Col N="1500" /> anybody, why the responsibility for the D.M.P. pensions should have been transferred to the Saorstát Government, and the scale of pension determined by the decisions of the Saorstát Government, even though the pensions were in regard to services rendered to the British Government.</P>
    <P>The British Government appears to have denied any responsibility for these men.  My desire is to find out what is the position of the Saorstát Government towards them.  Are we to take it that nobody is responsible for them, or at least that both parties are shirking the responsibility and trying to shift it over to the other?  So far as the people of the Saorstát are concerned, I think they had no thought of differentiating so strongly and decisively against the D.M.P. as against the R.I.C.  I do not think the public opinion of the Saorstát was so decidedly averse from the D.M.P., or so decisively favourable to the R.I.C., as to justify this difference of treatment of pensioners who retired during the British régime prior to April, 1919.  It certainly is a very remarkable fact that men who retired in May, or even April, 1919, should be receiving round and about three times the pension of their fellow police who happened to retire one month earlier. It is a discrimination which requires justification, and I am afraid it will be very hard to justify it in any court of equity.</P>
    <P>What I would like to know is&mdash;who is responsible for the payment of those pensions?  If the Saorstát Government are responsible, why should they be responsible for the payment of D.M.P. pensions and not for the payment of R.I.C. pensions?  What is the reason for the discrimination against the D.M.P. pensioner?  Perhaps the Minister can throw some light upon this question and justify, if possible, his attitude, or, if not to justify it, explain why the case cannot be met as between the British and the Saorstát Government, having regard to fair treatment and equity for these men of the old D.M.P.</P>

      <P>I want to take this opportunity of asking the Minister whether he has any views on the question of acceding to the request of persons <Col N="1501" /> who retired under Article X. of the Treaty for reinstatement.

I am just putting the question with a view to eliciting some information on the point.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde asks if a number of persons were to retire under the Treaty what would be the saving to the State, if we assume that the work which they had been doing would not be done unless other staffs were got.  I could not give the figures, as a calculation will have to be made, but I think it might be roughly accurate to say that the cost of the pensions would be something like half the cost of the salaries.  I do not think it would be possible, or financially desirable, to attempt to fund the pension charges.  They will go on for a very long period, especially in respect of the disbanded R.I.C., who are comparatively young men, and I do not think that any saving in actual expenditure could be effected by borrowing for this purpose.  So far as control is concerned, we have so far accepted the certificate of the British Comptroller and Auditor-General provisionally.  We have undoubtedly the right, and we have made it clear to the British Government, that we would insist on an examination of the records in connection with R.I.C. pensions, of which we pay our share.  If, when a check examination does take place at any time, any discrepancy were to be disclosed, we would, of course, have a complete examination made and would withhold any amounts which we might have overpaid.  So far the matter has not been examined on our behalf, but it will be, and the Saorstát Exchequer will not be prejudiced by the payments which we are making on the certificate of the British.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson referred to what I think he described as the discrimination against the D.M.P.  The difference in treatment between the D.M.P. the R.I.C. and the Post Office pensioners arises in this way.  The D.M.P. was purely a service which operated in the Free State area.  Secondly, under the Transfer of Functions Order the entire <Col N="1502" /> service, the personnel of the service and all the pensioners of the service came over to us.  We were thus responsible not only for the payment of the existing personnel, but for the payment of the entire pensions of the retired personnel.  Take the R.I.C.  Apart altogether from the question of disbandment, even suppose there were no disbandment the force would have to be schemed and the existing personnel would have to be allocated to Northern Ireland and the Saorstát.  All pensioners would not have been schemed, but would have remained payable by the British Government, which would recover portion from us and portion from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Take the Post Office employees.  The existing personnel remained here, but the pensioners who might have served part of their time in Northern Ireland or in England and part of their time here have remained British pensioners, but we recoup the British Government. In the case of the R.I.C. the position is: we pay 75 per cent. of the pensions.  Northern Ireland pays 25 per cent. of the pensions, that being the proportion in which the men were stationed in the Saorstát area and in the Northern area.  When the British passed their Increase of Pensions Act, 1924, we had no responsibility for it. They gave the benefit of that to, say, Post Office pensioners, but we did not pay the increase.  We continued to pay the amount to the British Government in respect to those pensions that we were paying before that Act was passed.  That is the position we took in regard to the Increase of Pensions Act, 1924, so far as it applies to pensioners for whom we had any responsibility, so that that was an act of generosity on the part of the British Government.  They could pay if they liked, but that was nothing to us.  We did not pay.  Therefore, while the British Government is paying more to those pensioners we are paying no more.  The D.M.P. being purely a local service, and the pensioners of that service being transferred to us completely in the same way as the serving personnel, if we were to do anything in respect of their pensions we would have to pay the cost, a cost which we were <Col N="1503" /> not paying in respect to other pensions. So the position is that while the British Government took certain steps in respect of all other pensioners they did not, and I think it would perhaps have been difficult for them, take those steps with respect to the D.M.P., but our attitude in regard to all pensioners has been the same&mdash;that is, they had already, in so far as they were pre-war pensioners, got the benefit of the Act of 1920 before the Free State came into operation, and we are paying any additional sums which would be paid to pensioners arising from the Act of 1920, but we are paying nothing in respect of any additional sums arising out of the Act of 1924.</P>

      <P>I am not clear on that point.  I think there was a revision of the police pensions.  I had better leave it over, because I am uncertain of it.  I have not considered the question raised by Deputy Norton, of people who retired under Article 10 applying for reinstatement.  I think there would be difficulties in the case of any person who so retired.  First, the particular position held might be filled, it might be difficult to find work in the office without causing an upset which would be undesirable for people of the particular grade to which they belonged. In general, as retirements under Article 10 are still possible, I would not like to encourage anyone to hope that if they went out they would get employment from this Government again in case they wanted it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement with regard to the Dublin Metropolitan Police pensioners gives a certain amount of satisfaction to myself inasmuch as it explains that the increase of pensions which was being paid to the Royal Irish Constabulary and other British pensioners does not fall upon the Free State Exchequer, but it raises another question which I venture to put to the Minister.  Such of these men as are citizens of the Saorstát have a claim for the protection and the support of the Free State Government in dealing with the Government of another <Col N="1504" /> country, and it seems to me that the services which these men rendered, and the pensions which they received on account of those services, were all in regard to services of the British Government in Ireland, and that there should be no distinction between one class of pensioner, especially in the case of a police pensioner, or another class of pensioner, when they were so definitely and clearly Government services.  If this were merely a local municipal service one could see some point in the objection, but it was not a local service. It was a service administered by the central authority for which the Chief Secretary was responsible.  Consequently I put it to the Minister that in dealing with the reasonable and just claims of citizens of the Saorstát in respect to the liability of the British Government to those men that his intervention should be made with the British Government on behalf of the pensioners who are being, as I said, unfairly discriminated against.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has taken up this matter officially.  I rather gathered from the answer he gave a little time ago that he thought it was not a matter for him to take action about and that it was for the pensioners, themselves, to make any representation direct to the British Government. I think that that is a shirking of responsibility.  It is quite usual for the Government of a country, when its nationals are not able to get a satisfactory answer on a fair and just claim, to take the matter up on behalf of its nationals with the country against whom the claim is made.  I put that case to the Minister: that it is a responsibility that should not be thrown back upon the pensioner citizen.  If it is a matter to be pressed against the Government of another country it is surely the responsibility of our Government to assist those pensioners in putting their claims forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a mere commercial debt. It is not a case that can be paralleled by an ordinary trading transaction. These were men who were servants to the State which was in command here up to 1921, and their claim is one, I think, that ought to be backed up, and supported by the official authority now in this country.  I would press upon <Col N="1505" /> the Minister that there is a fair and just case to be put forward on behalf of these men.  If they are to be treated as not worthy of the same kind of consideration as other British public servants were, in respect of pensions&mdash; men who gave service prior to 1919&mdash; then I am afraid that the case, in equity, is not receiving the attention it ought to receive.</P>
    <P>I would press upon the Minister that he ought to use such influence as he can in putting the case forward on behalf of these men which I have tried, inadequately, to put before the House today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It does seem to me that the D.M.P. pensioners have as good a claim against the British Government for an increase in pensions as those who got it.  But the Deputy will know that up to comparatively recently there have been many disputes and negotiations between the British Government and the Saorstát Government with regard to financial matters.  If there was any claim that could be pressed through any other sources than through Government sources it probably would be advantageous that it should be so pressed; because any pressure from us on the British Government to make payments could, perhaps, be reported upon.  It is a matter that I promise the Deputies I will look into further, but I would not like to say any more than that.</P>

      <P>With reference to another matter, would the Minister be able to make any statement regarding claims or requests put forward, from time to time, on behalf of individuals who are receiving pensions, for commutation in particular cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>In general we have been against commutation.  We have to borrow.  Although the position in regard to borrowing has improved, although our loan is remaining steadily up, and there is every prospect that we shall be able to borrow what we require for all Government purposes on reasonable terms, the view taken, when the matter was considered a year or two ago, was that we ought not to go on the market when there is no advantage to us to go.  There are certain other objections to commutation. <Col N="1506" /> We were particularly alive to that in the case of army service pensions. We definitely decided there should be no commutation there, because we believed that in many cases the result of commutation would be that the individual probably would lose the money he got and would then be somewhat of a problem.  That is the general objection to commutation. There is another objection to it.  I remember one particular case of a resident magistrate who pressed very hard for commutation.  We refused it. If he had got commutation I think it would have meant five or six thousand pounds.  He died in about a month, and we would have sustained a fairly substantial loss if we had agreed to communtation.  Generally the main argument seems to be against it.</P>

    <P>I will just read the various figures which have been voted since the State came into existence, and the actual expenditure out of these Votes.  In 1922-23 the amount voted was £220,000, and the amount expended £118,762.</P>
    <P>In 1923-24 the amount voted was £50,000; amount expended £39,236. In 1924-25 the amount voted was £35,000; amount expended £19,665.  In 1925-26 the amount voted was £20,000; the amount expended £8,995.  We do not expect to spend any such sum as is down in the Estimates, but as was explained in a previous year, this is a sort of Vote that if there was any threatening development which meant that a greater amount than had been anticipated was likely to be required it would be probably undesirable, impolitic and dangerous to have to come to the Dáil and ask for more.  We think that even as matters stand at present, with no danger threatening, it is necessary to ask for a sum which gives a fairly substantial margin beyond what is likely to be required.  We do know that there are people who are anxious to create trouble and who maintain a sort of organisation which all reports indicate is gradually falling to pieces and is gradually losing its morale and is, month by month, less likely to be a threatening source of danger to the State.  But on the other hand we cannot forget that it is only two or three years since we had a great anti-State movement in arms.  We cannot forget that there are many men still who think that they might succeed in overthrowing the State if a suitable opportunity arose by a renewal of tactics that were defeated before.  It is essential that the Government should have in hands a sum which might be employed if occasion arose.</P>
    <P>There will always be&mdash;apart altogether from the Irregular movement, which will, I think, very soon cease to be a matter about which we need trouble ourselves at all&mdash;a certain demand <Col N="1508" /> for some small sum for what we might call the more normal police purposes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained at some length last year how these figures were made up.  The expenses of registration are divided into four parts: (a) expenses of secretaries or clerks of county or district councils, (b) expenses of rate collectors, (c) expenses of printing, (d) other expenses, which include extra clerical assistance and unforeseen expenses. The State contributes one-fourth of the expenses under (a) because it is estimated that the work involved concerns jury and franchise matters about equally.  The State, under the existing practice, contributes nothing for the jury portion and half for the franchise portion&mdash;that is, a quarter of the whole.  In the case of rate collectors, it is estimated that the trouble of the jurors' work is about half that of the franchise work.  That is to say, the State contribution is half of the franchise element of two-thirds, which is one-third of the whole.  In regard to printing, it is estimated that <Col N="1509" /> the jury column in the list costs one-seventh of the whole, and that is a local charge.  The remaining six-sevenths of the printing costs is for franchise work, and half of this is borne by the State and half by the local authority.  The cost of printing is borne on the Stationery Office Vote. The remaining expenses are equally divided.  The Department of Local Government and Public Health estimate that the charge for recoupment in respect of registers of electors, already prepared, will amount to £14,000 as against £21,000 last year.  The register now in preparation will necessitate an additional £20,000 for recoupment, of which it is expected that not more than £15,000 will be required in the present financial year.  The claims are not paid until the county councils have paid to the Stationery Office their share of the cost of printing the register.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is this year an increase in the grant-in-aid of the Royal Irish Academy, amounting to £600.  The Royal Irish Academy has a very valuable library, and the funds of the Academy have not been equal to keeping that library in repair&mdash;keeping the books bound and binding new proceedings and new books which have been acquired.  The Academy has had practically the same grant since about 1870. although the value of money has fallen <Col N="1510" /> very considerably.  The addition made this year will not enable more than a beginning to be made in putting the library of the Academy into a proper condition.  The library of the institution is always available to members of the public who are able to use it and who are desirous of using it.  The Academy has available great numbers of scientific publications from all parts of the world&mdash;publications which could not be obtained otherwise, because the Academy is an old foundation and its exchanges enable it to have these publications available.  I think that the £600 increase which has been given this year is really a very small increase in the circumstances.  It is very little towards putting the Academy into the position in which it was pre-war from the point of view of assistance from public funds.</P>

      <P>Before dealing with the sub-heads I would like to urge again on the Minister the advisability of removing two of these sub-heads and placing them under the Votes which come under the purview of the Minister for Education.  I think that sub-heads C and D would be more properly placed under the Vote for Science and Art.  One has only to look at them to realise that it would surely be more appropriate that they should be placed under the control of the Minister for Education, particularly when we see it stated here that it is the Minister for Education who recommends this grant under sub-head D.  I am very glad that the Minister has increased the subsidy for the Royal Irish Academy. It is, unfortunately, both too much and too little.  It is not sufficient to place the Academy on a proper footing, and I hope that within the next few years the Executive Council will seriously consider the advisability of establishing a proper Irish Academy, fully equipped with funds, which the present Academy is not, and therefore cannot have the same authority in the country as a real national academy would have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down an amendment to this Vote this afternoon, but the Ceann Comhairle would not accept it, as the notice was insufficient.  I intended to move the reduction of this Vote by £500 <Col N="1511" /> in respect of sub-head B, the grant to the Abbey Theatre.  The Minister did not refer to the fact that this grant has been increased from last year; that the taxpayers are now asked to provide £1,000.  It is a grant in aid, but we are given no information as to why this sum is needed.  The public have no knowledge of the financial position of the theatre, and as to whether this money is really necessary or not.  One would have thought that when this proposal was put forward we should be given reasons for it.  We got no reasons; we are simply asked to subsidise this theatre, although for all we know it may be in a most flourishing financial condition.  The accounts of the theatre do not come before the Auditor-General, and we have no idea how this £1,000 will be spent.  I would have liked to move this reduction for the reason that if any money is to be spent by the taxpayers on the Abbey Theatre it should be spent in the first place in giving the actors and actresses a living wage, which has not been the case in the past.  I understand that for many years they have been paid starvation wages, and Ministers and Deputies, including Deputy Johnson, have supported the theatre, in spite of the sweated labour employed there.  I think it is high time, if the taxpayers are to subsidise this theatre, that at least the first people to benefit should be those who have made the theatre and made its reputation, the actors and the playwrights. I understand that the royalties paid to the playwrights are so ridiculously below the royalties paid by other theatres that they are practically of no benefit whatever.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the fact that we have no information as to the financial position of the theatre and as to where the money is going, we are asked to subsidise this very contentious school of drama; we are asked to subsidise the new stage Irishman who is being invented by a modern playwright, &ldquo;Joxer&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Paycock,&rdquo; a type of Irishman taking the place of the old stage Irishman with his shillelagh, and his pipe in his hat; it is an even more despicable type.  The taxpayers are asked to subsidise this new stage Irishman.  If this be a national <Col N="1512" /> theatre, and if the taxpayers are to support it by a subsidy, then the board for selecting plays to be acted in the theatre should be representative of the whole nation, and not any small clique or minority, which I think is the case at present, however distinguished and however cultured that clique or minority may be.  I only wish to make this protest, and I hope that if this money is voted steps will be taken to see that at any rate some of it will go to increase the starvation wages of the actors.</P>
    <P>This country has produced very great actors and actresses, and they have been driven out of the country because they could not live by acting at the Abbey Theatre.  The Abbey Theatre, as somebody remarked some time ago, is nothing but an emigrating agency for actors.  Actors come there, but are driven out of the country because they cannot live on what they are paid. Apart from these things, in view of the restricted control, in view of the particular mentality of those who control the theatre, and those who select the plays which shall be acted in it, many playwrights of national sympathies are boycotted. While their plays are boycotted we are asked to subsidise what was described by a distinguished member of another House as in reality &ldquo;the apotheosis of sordidity,&rdquo; while playwrights of substantial genius are ignored.  When we are asked to advance money I think that at any rate we should have some control of the spending of that money.</P>

I think to protect theatres is protection gone mad, and I think that that portion of the Vote ought to be withdrawn, and that the education should be given in some other way.</P>

      <P>I am glad he is coming forward more openly now than in the past.  I am not going to join with him in his case with regard to the Abbey Theatre.  I was rather surprised when Deputy Esmonde raised it.  He wanted to put down a motion to reduce the Vote by £500, with a view to showing that the actors and actresses were working on starvation wages.  I should say that from that point of view he should have moved to increase the Vote instead of to reduce it, because, as far as I can see, the reason for that is there is not enough money to pay them decent wages.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Vote, I certainly would not be inclined to agree to anything in the nature of an increase, but I think that for the encouragement of a special form of national drama the Vote is justified.  I do not agree with Deputy Esmonde, though the particular forms of drama that have been put before the public have perhaps been of a rather sordid description in some cases, that we should refuse to support the theatre.  I think the object of the theatre is &ldquo;to hold the mirror up to life,&rdquo; and now that Ireland is setting out on a new era, we should try and look at ourselves as we really are.  A theatre which we are subsidising should not be for the purpose of portraying an imaginary type of Irishman, but for showing us with all our failings and faults, and, perhaps, some of our virtues as well.  There is something in the suggestion made by Deputy Esmonde that as we are subsidising the theatre we should have some information as to the finances of it.  At least we should know whether the Minister for Finance has an opportunity of seeing the annual balance sheet.  That, I think, is not an unreasonable request. I do not know how the theatre is run, whether by a company or by some form of co-operation.  If there is a directorate I think it would not be unreasonable to expect that the Department of Finance should be represented on it, seeing that we are contributing fairly generously towards the upkeep of the theatre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned to the Dáil on this Vote last year that I had examined the accounts and found that <Col N="1514" /> for a considerable number of years&mdash; I think ten years prior to last year&mdash; there had been an average loss of £600 on the theatre.  The £850 that was put in last year was put in at the last moment, and it was felt afterwards that the figure should have been about £1,000 to enable the theatre to carry on without being in the extremely difficult position that it had been up to that time.  I think the whole of the sum that we provided last year went in increased salaries to the actors and actresses.  If sweated labour was there in the past, that is not an argument, as Deputy Heffernan pointed out, for reducing the amount of the subsidy it is proposed to give.  I think it would be impossible for the State to control the theatre and select the plays.  I know that the first proposition that came to us in regard to the Abbey Theatre was when the directors offered to give us the theatre and the buildings, property worth about £6,000, if the Government would undertake the running of it.  We declined and stated that we could not do that.  I prefer to let other people stand all the criticism that would be levelled at the theatre for boycotting the plays of playwrights with national sympathies.  I have never seen that the plays there were of one particular type or that in fact any type was boycotted.</P>
      <P>The plays have been of the most varied character, and, even if they were plays to which I strongly objected, I would not, on the strength of that, be inclined to say that the subsidy should be withdrawn.  If over a period of years the theatre was objectionable, that would be a matter to be considered. I think we must allow great latitude and allow all sorts of plays to be produced.  We cannot act as censors and there is no use in blaming the playright because he writes a particular sort of play.  The answer to criticism of those who say that Sean O'Casey or anyone else ought to have written so and so is: &ldquo;Go and do it yourself.&rdquo;  I think the directors' difficulty is to get plays.  I have heard them say that they find great difficulty in getting plays.  They are anxious that more plays should be submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will see that an arrangement is made with the theatre so that each year <Col N="1515" /> it shall submit its accounts to the Department of Finance, and if at any time it appears to be doing so well that no subsidy is necessary we might reconsider the matter.  The directors did offer to add anyone to their number whom the Minister for Finance would nominate.  I nominated Mr. George O'Brien and he is on the board.  As there was public money going in I thought it was desirable that someone who was not a playwright, who although he is a writer is not a litterateur of any sort, should be a member of the board.  I would like to say that I regard the money spent here as very well spent.  I think there is scarcely anything in the country better known than the Abbey Theatre.  I have met Americans who came to this country and one of the things that they were all anxious to see was the Abbey Theatre.  The Chairman of the Banking Commission, Professor Parker Willis, stated that he had been anxious to see the Abbey Theatre and the actors and actresses there.  I met an American officer who was on a battleship that was in the Bay and he said that there were two things he wanted to see&mdash;Killarney and the Abbey Theatre.  Any reasonable expenditure on the theatre is, I think, very well laid out money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde said that the actors come to the theatre as if it were an emigration agency and that the theatre drives them away by low wages.  As a matter of fact they are made in the theatre, and if it has not been able to keep them in the past that is regrettable.</P>

I do not agree with Deputy Nolan that because there is financial stringency that we should never pay for anything that is of a cultural character or that is going to develop the talents of the people in regard to literature and the drama.  The ordinary theatre contributes nothing and brings out no talent here.  It does nothing to stimulate activity in the country as the Abbey Theatre has in producing a <Col N="1516" /> whole school of writers, actors and actresses.  It has stimulated the minds of many people and is certainly as valuable as, shall I say, one big national school from the point of view of its general effects on the population and is as well worthy of the expenditure of public money.</P>

      <P>I think it is a very good rule, and I intend to follow it, that Deputies who receive direct benefit out of a Vote should not take part in a discussion on it, and as one who receives frequently and regularly direct benefit from the Abbey Theatre, I do not feel justified in taking part in this particular discussion.  But I would call the attention of the Minister to the position of the Royal Zoological Society, the Royal Irish Academy, the Royal Hibernian Academy of Arts, and the Irish Academy of Music, and I would ask him to see that people who contribute the work that is necessary to keep these Academies going will be properly paid for their services, and that the artistic products that are exhibited in these Academies are of a proper character and do not hurt the susceptibilities of any of the Irish public. It is just as important, I think, in respect to these other Academies as it is for the Abbey Theatre that the people engaged in catering for the cultural development of the Irish people should be properly cared for and that they should be remunerated in accordance with their merits, if it is possible to value their merits.  I think, therefore, once the Minister begins to deal with the conditions of service of the National Theatre Society, Ltd., he will be obliged to follow the same course in respect to the Royal Irish Academy and these other Academies.</P>

      <P>This Estimate shows a net decrease of £15,060 as compared with the Estimate of last year.  There has been some criticism in the Press as to the cost of this service.  I think the value of that criticism may be gauged from the fact that on one occasion a figure was quoted as representing the cost of this service for a particular year which could only have been arrived at by adding together the Estimate for the year to the expenditure in the previous year.  The House might be <Col N="1518" /> interested to know that the actual expenditure of the Stationery Office in the year 1924-25 was £34,550 less than in the preceding year, and in the year 1925-26 the expenditure was £62,683 less than in the year 1923-24, and that, notwithstanding the fact that the demands on the Stationery Office during those two years were very considerably increased.  The Estimate generally is on the same lines as last year, and I do not think ther is anything in it calling for any particular comment.</P>

      <P>The public no doubt, as well as members of this House, will be greatly relieved to have this report circulated.  It is somewhat disappointing that it is only an interim report, and, as the Minister has indicated, one question at least has been reserved for further consideration. The Dáil was startled about this time two years ago by very serious allegations against the Ordnance Survey.  It was alleged, amongst others, by a Deputy no longer a member of this House, Mr. Sean McGarry, that not only had most important documents been removed, but that plates and maps had been destroyed and that data essential to the work of map production had disappeared irrecoverably.  That may not be a perfectly accurate account of Mr. McGarry's indictment, but so far as memory serves me, he and others such as Deputy Connor Hogan and Deputy Hogan of the Labour Party, together made an indictment of which that, I think, is a fair summary. Everyone felt at the time that if it were true that documents essential to the military safety of this country had disappeared, if data upon which the production of maps has to be based were beyond our reach; if, as was further alleged, the maps issued were not accurate, the country would be in a very sad plight indeed, through the disorganisation, or whatever else it might be called, of this very important Department.  There were several items in the terms of reference to the Committee that was set up to inquire and report on this matter.  The Committee was to inquire if the Ordnance Survery had its full measure of equipment, and was properly provided, if maps, plans, documents and the rest had been removed since December.  1919, and whether or not the maps issued were constructed upon a proper basis, and as issued were an accurate account of the results of the surveys. <Col N="1521" /> Two very important things were involved: one, that the trigonometrical data provided by the survey set up in the first quarter of the nineteenth century were not to hand when they were required for national purposes at a very critical moment in 1922, and that, in common with other data, they have been transferred to Southampton.  I wonder would the Minister say if the report we are to receive deals with that?  The Minister spoke of levellings just now.  There has been a continuous dispute, I know, with regard to the following of the older levelling marks, bench marks, or the substitution of new, and the dispute as to the relative merits of the old system of levelling. But what is really of the utmost importance to know is, whether this matter&mdash;this terrible matter if it be true&mdash; has or has not been proved, or still awaits to be proved, because undoubtedly the note-books which contain the result of trigonometrical data are not forthcoming, and if no substitute for them that can be validated as accurate and authentic records are forthcoming, we are in a very serious position.  At the time I, for one, refused to believe that there could be a case made for this contention, and even now I should be glad to be reassured, and I am sure those of us who entered into the matter with interest at the time would feel intense relief to know that the reassuring words of the Minister applied to trigonometrical data.  The Minister said just now in his summary of the report that all is well, and only this question of levellings is in reserve.</P>

      <P>Before the Deputy goes further, when I was speaking of the point reserved I said it referred to levelling because I did not remember the actual word.  The sentence dealing with the matter to be inquired into is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Inquiry into the adequacy of trigonometrical data raises questions of so wide and technical a character that the Committee feels it would be undersirable to delay its report on the many matters already investigated until the sufficiency of this data has been thoroughly examined.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>That undoubtedly is eminently satisfactory, because the matter is highly technical, and as complex as it is technical, and it requires to be searched to the very bottom as to whether the accusations made here have anything of truth attaching to them.  I take it, then, that in the further prosecution of the Committee's inquiry no stone will be left unturned in seeing that the absolute truth is reached in regard to the indictment I have already quoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other matters, such as the dissatisfaction of the staff with regard to the lack of proper organisation there.  I understand that there is no trigonometrical section there.  It was freely stated in the House, at the time the question arose some two years ago, that the real trouble originated in the dissatisfaction of the staff, but that, unfortunately, has not, so far as I know, been referred to the Committee. With regard to the equipment, we learned that it is a well-equipped department in one respect through the happenings associated with the late Seanad elections.  It has an admirable printing press.  It prints its output exceedingly well, as evinced in the printing of an address for one of the candidates at the Seanad elections.  I wonder would it take a suggestion, following on the example of France, namely, to provide schools with maps.  I note that it costs over £1,000 to sell almost an equal amount of maps.  I have not the book containing the estimates with me at the moment from which to get the exact figure, but I think that something like the same amount is expended in printing maps as is received from the sales.  Anyone interested in cycling or motoring is aware that the Michelin Tyre Company has produced a series of well-constructed maps.  The idea is taken from, and the working out is based on, the French system.  I do not see why the Ordnance Survey here should not take a leaf from the book of France and provide our schools with maps of their localities, out of which there could be taught in an interesting way the beginnings of geography and from which one could learn to envisage that subject, which is becoming more and more important in this commercial <Col N="1523" /> age in a proper way.  I am very glad that we have this assurance that the important matter, the investigation of which was begun two years ago, is not to be dropped, and that the Committee, in which I am sure the public will have confidence, will not cease their investigations until they have tracked this down to the very last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Minister proposes to issue the interim report of the Committee which was set up to inquire into certain work of the Ordnance Survey Department.  I should like to ask the Minister whether it is intended that this Committee should deal with the question of staff organisation.  If that is not intended, I submit to the Minister that it is time that some definite notice was taken of the many complaints forwarded to him and to the heads of the Ordnance Survery Department in connection with staff grievances.  From my contact with the Ordnance Survey staff, I know that there is very serious discontent at the failure of the Minister and the Department to take any notice of the representations made on behalf of the staff and to do anything to redress their grievances.  I suggest to the Minister that that discontent is reflected in Vote 16 when you find that twenty-two members of the staff have retired under Article 10 of the Treaty. My information is that if the Minister does not change his policy in connection with that Department that number will be considerably increased.  I think it is quite understandable that it should be increased.  If the staff are unable to get a sympathetic hearing from the Minister, or from the heads of the Department, it is only natural that they would seek redress, by means of retirement under Article 10.  I am informed, and I believe it to be true, that the Ordnance Survey Department is taking practically no notice of preliminary agreements entered into during the British administration.  I understand that it was formerly the right of an unestablished officer when he had fifteen years' service to be established. I am informed that many officers have over fifteen years' service, but no attempt has been made to establish <Col N="1524" /> them.  There are other grievances into which I will not go now, but I would like to have an assurance from the Minister that the matters brought to his notice by the staff will have consideration. The staff believe that this Committee will deal with the question of reorganisation.  If the Minister says that that is not intended, I would like to have his assurance that something will be done at an early date to give sympathetic consideration to the matters which the staff have been submitting for the past few years.</P>

      <P>I will read another paragraph from the report of the Committee:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Excepting for the present the question of the adequacy of the trigonometrical records on which our investigations are as yet incomplete, we find the whole mass of allegations and charges in so far as they reflect on the efficiency of the Survey and its practices to be without foundation.  Many of the statements and charges investigated by the Committee were apparently made solely with a view to destroying the confidence of the Government and the public in the accuracy and reliability of the Survey and in the good faith and efficiency of certain members of the staff.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I will read another paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the course of its inquiries, representations were made to the Committee that a general staff reorganisation would be productive of increased efficiency and would tend to promote content and zeal in the service.  While this matter is, of course, outside the terms of reference, the Committee understands that reorganisation of this nature was in contemplation and was delayed pending the result of the present inquiry.  The Committee hopes that the presentation of this report will enable the matter to be proceeded with.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That hope is accurate.  The matter of staff reorganisation, which was held up because of the allegations and charges which were made, will now be taken in hand and dealt with as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out one very small fact, which is contained in the report of the Committee on Public Accounts.  There is an appendix to the report on page 397, giving a summary of instruments and plates, stones and documents relating to ordnance survey maps of the Irish Free State transferred from the Ordnance Survey Office, Southampton, to the Ordnance Survey Office, Phoenix Park, Dublin, during the year 1923-24. That list gives particulars of something over 40 tons of materials, but in it there are seven cases weighing half a ton and containing trigonometrical documents. I mention that perhaps for the satisfaction of Deputy Magennis.  He may not have seen the record.  These documents at any rate were sent away to Southampton apparently prior to the Treaty and were returned in the year 1923-24.</P>

    <P>The principal increase, I think, is under sub-head D&mdash;Payments to Prosecutors. There is a sum of £10,000 shown as against £5,925 6s. for the payment of expenses of prosecutors and witnesses.

      <P>I would like the Minister to give some explanation under sub-head A of the change in the form of presentation of this Vote. I see that the Law Officer is provided with additional legal assistance valued at £650.  Previously he was provided with an assistant who was paid £650, and that did not warrant any special call upon the assistant's services.  That is to say, he did not get prior claim of any kind on his services.  It was more or less a retaining fee, but a change has taken place and there is simply a sum which may be distributed, I presume, amongst quite a number of legal assistants.  Perhaps the Minister will give some explanation of the change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that there is no real change in practice, that it will work out that the one individual selected by the Attorney-General will actually receive this £650 for assisting the Attorney-General.  As much of the Attorney-General's work is of a very personal character, it was thought desirable that an appointment should not be created but that some person should receive a fee, a sort of compounded fee, for giving legal assistance to the Attorney-General.  If an appointment were now to be made the appointment would have, of course, to be made by means of the regular machinery, even though it were a part-time appointment. There must be a sort of close personal collaboration and confidence between the Attorney-General and the person who is to assist him in this particular manner.  While it will <Col N="1527" /> work out in practice that the money will really go to one person, it was thought desirable that the Attorney-General should have discretion to change over to a separate person if he liked, or if matters of a particular kind arose, that he should not have them dealt with by the person who would normally assist him but bring in some separate person with some special knowledge.  I think as a matter of fact they will be normally dealt with by one person.</P>

We somehow managed to pull through with one draftsman less over the years of stress, and now when we are promised a little less stress in the nature of Bills, we have to get an assistant.  I quite realise that in view of the very heavy work the draftsman had for the past two or three years, even a very long rest would be justified. I do not know whether that is the explanation, but I think some explanation is required as to why an additional draftsman is needed this year when the amount of prospective legislation is smaller than it was for the previous years.</P>

      <P>For one thing we would have no draftsman at all if we had tried to carry on much longer as we were.  In regard to the work this year we have had actually to send Bills to outside barristers to get drafted. For instance, the Land Bill which has just been introduced had to be sent out.  Previously we had to send out a number of other Bills, and that is regarded as undesirable because the knowledge of the whole subject which should exist in the draftsman's office does not exist if amendments or regulations are required later.  It is felt that, as a matter of fact for a very long period, there will be need for at least three draftsmen.  For instance, there is a monumental Bill dealing with merchant shipping which is in course of preparation, and that will occupy the whole time of the draftsman for a year or two&mdash;for quite a considerable time.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary that the efforts of the Government to dispose of this dockyard have not, so far, been successful.  I would like to hear from him whether, within the past year or so, the Government have advertised this place, or whether they have made any serious attempts to dispose of it, or if they have invited any people to work it, or whether they are disposed to hand it over to some people who might take it on reasonable terms. After all, I do not think it is necessary to remind the Government that a very serious state of affairs exists locally. We have very serious trade depression, very serious unemployment for the last few years there, and the people of Cobh have been hopeful that some <Col N="1530" /> work might be found in this dockyard. I must say that we appreciate the present expenditure of £15,000 on the place, but it is not productive money. If the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister for Industry and Commerce would visit the place and call together some local committee, it might, perhaps, be possible to work out some solution.  Something, perhaps, in the nature of a technical school might be established there where young men or boys might be trained in some trades. Something like that might be evolved and this £15,000 might be usefully spent in that way.  I think the serious economic conditions locally should warrant very early attention on the part of the Government.  I notice that there are £5,000 rates on the place.  That seems to me to be a very heavy rate. Possibly when some hundreds of thousands of pounds were spent there some years ago, the place was value for the rates on it at the time, but I do not think that if it were re-valued now the valuation would be so high.  That item for rates is sufficient in itself to warn off any people from coming in there and taking the place when they see that heavy overhead charge of £5,000 for rates.  I urge on the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Industry and Commerce that they would, if possible, visit this place during the Recess and see exactly what is there.  I do not think that very many of our Ministers have seen this place at all.  There is certainly very valuable machinery there, and it is in very good condition.  It might be possible during the coming months to evolve some scheme of work there that would afford employment to the people of Cobh.</P>

      <P>Oh, no.  With regard to Deputy Hennessy's question, I have to say that not alone did we advertise the place, but we also got in touch with various firms that we thought might possibly take over Haulbowline. Nothing so far has come of this.  It is, however, possible that some of the firms with whom we were in communication may make an offer.  It is not quite so long since we were in communication with one particular firm and, as far as we are concerned, we are doing everything to make some effective use of the place.  Certainly I would be pleased if any Deputy or combination of Deputies would evolve a scheme that would be of assistance to us in making use of Haulbowline.  We are fully aware of the value of the machinery that is there.  I have not had an opportunity of seeing the place, but I know from information at my disposal in the office that there is very valuable machinery at Haulbowline.  The real cause of the trouble that we had at Haulbowline is simply the slump in shipbuilding, a matter over which we have no control.  That, as the Deputies know, is a matter that is felt all round in the shipbuilding industry at the moment, and there is very grave doubt that until there is a revival in that particular trade there will be a possibility of doing anything with Haulbowline.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,756 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1927, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Quit Rent Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first time that this particular Estimate has been brought before the Dáil.  The cause of this was that for a considerable time the ownership or the title to the Quit Rents was in dispute with the British Government.  At first the contention was put up that the Quit Rents were the personal revenue of the King, and that the King, at the beginning of each reign, surrendered the Quit Rents to the Government of the day in consideration of the money voted to him by Parliament in the Civil List, and that they were so surrendered in consideration of the sum to be paid by the British Government, and that therefore the rent should accrue to that Government.  After a good deal of legal discussion and of examination as to what has been done in other Dominions in regard to similar matters, it was acknowledged by the British Government that the Saorstát was entitled to receive the Quit Rents.  In the year ending the 31st March, 1925, the last day for which I have the figures here, the total amount collected under this head was £11,635.  There is some question at present as to how exactly the Quit Rents ought to be disposed of, and how the expense ought to be met. An examination is going on, and it may be necessary to introduce legislation to deal with the question of Quit Rents and of their disposal.  Meantime they are being paid into a Woods and Forests Fund which is the Saorstát equivalent of the British Woods and <Col N="1533" /> Forests Fund.  Up to the present, and since the year ended the 31st March, 1923, the salaries and expenses of the Quit Rents Office have been paid out of that fund.  The position was that we collected the money, and it was passed to that fund.  As the British were not receiving the sums they ceased, after the year ending the 31st March, 1923, to pay the expenses of the office.  The whole question, which is somewhat complicated legally, is still under consideration.</P>

      <P>I have had some connection with this Bill since it was brought in and, on the Second Reading, I made an attempt to discover what were the points troubling certain people with regard to matters that were raised.  I had intended, on the Committee Stage, to point out what I had discovered.  Perhaps I may be allowed now, on this amendment, to answer the points that were raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good suggests that a new sub-section should be inserted indicating that the demise made by the Minister for Finance shall have effect subject <Col N="1534" /> to the reservation that provision shall be made for existing and future associate and non-associate students similar to that heretofore fulfilled by the College of Science.  The position with regard to the College of Science was that there were roughly three classes of students.  There were associateship students in the ordinary course, students who had entered for and intended to take the degree or diploma of associate of the College of Science in all subjects except dairy science.  They followed a four years' course, attended the lectures and sat at certain examinations which were generally held in the terms.  At the end of the course they were awarded, if their merits were up to the mark, an associateship.  They were then associate students for the degree or for the associateship in dairy science.  The only difference between that and the ordinary course I have spoken of was that it was a year shorter, but everything else held. There were certain courses to be attended, certain examinations to be passed and fees paid.</P>
    <P>There were, in addition to that, non-associate students.  They were a rather undefined class.  It came to this, that any student of good repute could present himself and take out lectures from any professor.  He could attend a course of lectures.  He simply attended the course and at the end of it he was rewarded&mdash;not having to pass any examinations&mdash;not with an associateship or diploma, but with a certificate that he had attended lectures and had shown proficiency or intelligence in any particular matter under discussion.</P>
    <P>The intention in this amendment is that provision shall be made for existing and future associate and non-associate students similar to that heretofore fulfilled by the College of Science.  If you take the existing associate students, they may be divided into two classes. There are those who already obtained the associateship of the College of Science and are or would have been entitled under the College of Science rules to proceed to the higher degree of Fellowship of the College of Science. The University is prepared to make <Col N="1535" /> provision for that type of associate by giving him leave to go on from his associateship to something higher.  What that something higher will be has yet to be determined.  It depends mainly on one thing.  The associate who desires to proceed to a Fellowship can get that either as a result of courses taken out and attendance at lectures, or by reason of written work presented.</P>
    <P>If the associate who desires to proceed further via the University wishes to take a higher degree on written work or wishes to take it as a result of courses attended, the University will make provision in both cases.  In one case it will be by degree and in the other case it will be by something to be determined; the University must be allowed to be perfectly free in regard to what that is to be called.  It is important to note that it will not in the future be called a Fellowship of the College of Science; that is ruled out.  The associate who desires to proceed higher will depend either on written work or on courses attended at the University, but there will be adequate provision made for him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not with regard to these particular people; that is what I gather.  This is all an indication of what is done or what it is hoped will be done.  The governing body of the University College will have the final decision in the matter, and nobody can bind that body until that matter comes before them formally.  I am dealing with what I understand is accepted by most of the governing body of that College and I do not think there will be the slightest difficulty about it.  Nobody could state with certainty, until they have passed some sort of resolution or set up some sort of rule approving of this, that it actually will be the case, but I have not the slightest doubt that this will be done and that an arrangement will be made, both by way of attendance at courses and presentation of written work without attendance at courses, where an associate wishes to proceed higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> With regard to the existing associates, that may be interpreted in another way.  The present student of the College of Science, who normally would have in the next year or two got the title of associate, has been taken over by the University.  Most of those people are scholarship-holders, and most of them were warned in the last couple of years, when entering for the scholarship, that they would most likely continue and finish in the University, and their scholarships were given to them on the direct understanding that they were fully acquainted with the likely change, and they made no objection.  Again, these people will be catered for by a degree, which in most cases will be the Bachelor of Science degree.  So that as far as the associate student is concerned&mdash; the man who is partly through his course&mdash;he will be taken into the ordinary university system and at the end crowned with a degree if he has continued up to the examination.  The associate who wishes to proceed higher will have his way open to something higher also.</P>
    <P>With regard to the type of man who ordinarily would have become a student for the associate examinations, that student for the future will enter into the ordinary university system, will have to matriculate in the ordinary way and proceed towards his degree.  Non-associate students are more difficult, because they represent the casual student who picked his own courses, attended lectures given by certain professors, and finished by getting a certificate of attendance at those lectures and of proficiency in the subject. But the university system certainly allows for that.  University College, Dublin, is very anxious to attract students to the college, and there is already known in that university the practice of students attending at lectures without being matriculated in the university.  If the certificate of the professor seems a desirable thing, and if the student's conduct in class warrants it, that certificate can issue in the particular case.  So that, in so far as a non-associate student attending lectures and getting a certificate is concerned he will be met by exactly the <Col N="1537" /> same type of treatment.  He need not matriculate; he can pick his course as he likes, attend professors' lectures, pay fees as was entailed in the College of Science, and get, if he so requires, and if the professor thinks he deserves it, a certificate of attendance at the course and of proficiency in the subject.</P>
    <P>As to the question of those who proceed to what is called the diploma as opposed to an associateship or a degree in the university, the university system again provides for these.  I think Cork University College has already established a course leading to a diploma in journalism.  A person has to be matriculated to enter for that, and four years, I think, is the course for it. The old Royal University used to issue a diploma in engineering.  That has lapsed recently, but the diploma may be given.  It is at the disposal of the Governing Body of the college.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thrift raised a question as to a reciprocal arrangement that existed between the College of Science and Trinity College.  He described that in more detail by saying that there are certain arrangements under which a course can be taken out in Trinity College and completed in the College of Science, and certain courses can be taken out at the College of Science and completed at Trinity College. He asked do these simply come to an end or was there any proposal to continue their operation.  These do come to an end in a technical way, as the College of Science ceases to exist. A scheme in particular that was approved by the Board of Trinity College and the Department of Agriculture in June, 1922, will definitely come to an end.  But if I had been asked by Deputy Thrift what was the likelihood of that old arrangement of June, 1922, being re-made as between University College, Dublin, and Trinity College, I should say that there is every likelihood of that being re-arranged for or continued.  In other words, if Trinity College wishes, in the case of students who have attended a course in Trinity College, to make it part of their regulations that attendance over a particular year at a course in University College, Dublin will count towards the completion <Col N="1538" /> of that course in Trinity College, then the authorities of University College, Dublin, will offer no objection to that arrangement.  The old arrangement technically comes to an end with the end of the College of Science, but there is every likelihood, in fact the greatest possibility, of a new arrangement, put to University College, Dublin, being taken up by them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say, if an arrangement can be made sufficiently soon to enable students who have entered in Trinity College for a course which entailed attendance at the College of Science for one year, to pass that one year at University College, Dublin, instead of the old College of Science&mdash;I think there is every probability of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be no difficulty in that being arranged.  It will be a matter for arrangement between the university authorities.  I think I can more or less make a promise that there is every likelihood of that arrangement being entered into.  There is just one matter which was rather of a technical nature as between the two colleges&mdash;the question of the examining board.  I understand the Trinity College authorities used to associate with their professors for the purpose of the examination a professor of the College of Science who had lectured to the students in the particular subject.  I do not know if it is proposed to continue that, but again I am authorised to say on behalf, not of the Governing Body, because they have not met and considered it, but of certain of the authorities there, that there will be no objection on the part of the authorities of University College, Dublin, to that arrangement also being continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one point with regard <Col N="1539" /> to the diploma that I have spoken about before.  It is quite possible in the university system to have established diplomas, but it would seem to me, both with regard to that diploma, and with regard to anything to take the place of the old associateship, that the authorities of University College, Dublin, must be free, so far as the title is concerned, because it has been already represented that if a course be set up and, say, an associateship be given at the end of it, that there are certain College of Science students who have already obtained an associateship who may object on the ground that something is now being given with the same title as the title which crowned the examination that they had previously taken, and there may be some doubt as to the standard of the two being the same.  In case that objection was made, the University authorities would have to reserve to themselves the right to meet such objection by, say, distinguishing the new degree by some title other than associateship.  But, in so far as the College of Science students are concerned, the associates, the diplomatists, and the non-associate students will all have at least the same educational facilities as used to be in the College of Science, and, indeed, owing to the establishment of the new Faculties both in the Cork and Dublin Colleges, they most certainly will have better facilities than they ever enjoyed under the old conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been speaking on that.  One could hardly say they would have the same title. They may or may not get the title of diplomatist or associate because there may be objections raised by previous diplomatists and associates as regards the standard of the new examinations in contrast with the old.  Certainly provision will be made for that class of student who is attending certain courses and proceeding to some degree or some diploma.  It may be called a diploma or an associateship.  I have <Col N="1540" /> said that.  In regard to even non-associate students there is room in the University system for these and it is intended to give these the same facilities as they had under the College of Science regime.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister's remarks in regard to associate students apply also in regard to Fellows of the college who would like to obtain a higher degree, such as a Doctorate of Science, for instance?  They should not be asked to go to a research course at the University, but if they were prepared to submit work of equal merit to the University Authorities would the University be prepared to give them a degree?  In other words, without pursuing research courses would they obtain these degrees by submitting work of sufficient merit to the University?</P>

      <P>I had not spoken of it on those terms of Fellows proceeding to the degree of Doctor.  I had spoken of it in general, paying more attention to the associates who desire to proceed to the higher degree of Fellow, and I was assured on the most general terms that special care would be taken to see that a College of Science student who had advanced to a certain point in the educational system of the College of Science would not be precluded from going any higher than he might have gone under the old College of Science regime.  I presume that would apply to a Fellow who wishes to take out a Doctorate as it would apply to an associate who wishes to become a Fellow.  The Fellowship would about correspond to the master's degree in the University and the step from that to the Doctorate is arranged definitely in the University course.  Again I am not sure whether it does not entail ordinarily work under the supervision of a Professor of the University, but there again the special case of the College of Science student can be taken into consideration and if necessary extra provision made for it.</P>

      <P>One is glad to have this statement we have just listened to from the Minister.  It has cleared away many of the difficulties that existed, and there is only one point I should like the Minister to clarify a little more.  He has made the position of the non-associate student quite clear. He will not suffer at all by reason of the change, but I am not quite so clear with regard to the associate student. The associate student attended a four-years' course in the College of Science. At the end of that period he got what was known as a diploma of associateship. Assuming these associates do not wish to go any further than what they had in their mind when they entered the College of Science, I presume there would be no difficulty in giving such students a diploma of associateship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I shall make it a little clearer.  As the Minister pointed out, we had the two classes of students.  We had the associate student and the non-associate student. The associate student was attending a four years' course under the old College of Science regime.  At the end of that he got what was known as a diploma of associateship.  Under the new regime if that student does not wish to go any further will he still get what he originally had in mind when he entered the College of Science, that is, a diploma of associateship?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>That particular student may get either of two things. He may elect to continue his studies for the diploma of associateship and through the Department of Education up to date&mdash;and I have no doubt that will be continued&mdash;he was able to get <Col N="1542" /> that diploma in the ordinary way.  If instead of that he prefers to have a degree and says, &ldquo;I am now in the University system and I will work for a degree,&rdquo; he will be catered for there. The student now going through the College of Science will have the choice either of an associateship or a degree.</P>

I certainly would feel in such a dilemma myself, because I feel strongly that one should not do anything to interfere with the autonomy of the University in such a manner.

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he has anticipated that there might be some dissatisfaction on the part of the existing associates or Fellows of the College of Science with regard to the change, that they might feel in any way out in the cold owing to the fact that the College of Science, in which they graduated, no longer exists, and that they have a degree from a college no longer in existence. I do not know what the feelings may be on this point, but I should like to know if there were an indication of, should I say, dissatisfaction or perhaps, it would be from their point of view, something much more serious. Has that aspect of the case been considered or would there be a possibility of conferring on them from the University a degree equivalent to what they now hold in case they are not prepared to pursue their studies any further. Some of them are advanced in years, and they may, it is true, be perfectly <Col N="1543" /> satisfied with the standing that the associateship of the College of Science gives.  On the other hand as that institution no longer exists they may feel that possessing a degree from an institution not now in existence puts them in a position that, to say the least of it, may not be enviable.  I should like if the Minister could make any statement on that he would do so, because I feel it is natural that some of those men may have a grievance over the change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">

      <P>I should like to answer a question put by Deputy O'Connell.  Deputy Baxter spoke as if he were under the impression that students of the College of Science proceeded to a degree.  Of course, they did not obtain a degree.  They became associates of the College of Science. Once the College of Science ceases to exist as such those who had already obtained that position at the completion of their studies of being associates. continued to be associates, precisely as when, for the purpose of the creation of the National University, the Royal University of Ireland was abolished, all who had graduated in that University retained their degrees and the option was given them of becoming enrolled with a similar degree on the register of the National University. Many of them made their election to that effect.  Some few still remained graduates of the Royal University of Ireland, without any connection whatsoever with the National University. Suppose, however, we take the case of those who have not yet got the associate diploma, who are and have been students in the College of Science and who will attorn to University College, Dublin, as students of that institution. In the statutes of the University, there is provision made for cases of the kind.  You, sir, understand perfectly, but the House may not understand, that University College, Dublin, as a constituent college of the National University of Ireland grants degrees that are degrees of the National University and not merely of University College, Dublin.  Similarly, it can provide courses for, and examine students, with a view to the <Col N="1544" /> getting of a diploma and it can grant this diploma as a diploma of the University.  What Deputy O'Connell has in mind, I think, is this: The University is bound, first of all, by its charter and, secondly, by its statutes, and anything which it does, or purports to do, that it is not empowered to do by its charter or statutes is, of course, <i>ultra vires.</i>  Inasmuch as the associateship is not a degree, the University could not, as things at present stand, deal with an associate of the College of Science as it would deal, say, with a graduate of Trinity College&mdash;namely, admit him <i>ad eundem</i> and give him a degree of exactly the same academic character and standing. But it could make a provision to that effect and, I daresay, if the demand were there and if it served a public need it would be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Fellowship, it would be possible, under the provisions of the University, for a Fellow to produce published work.  In that case, as Deputy O'Connell contemplates, he would not go into the College.  He would not attend courses of lectures. He would not be submitted, as a preliminary, to an examination but he would put in published work.  If that were the result of research, it would, I think, be possible to meet the case in this way: We frequently have to deal with graduates of other Universities who come to one of the constituent colleges&mdash;notably, to University College, Dublin&mdash;and pursue there a postgraduate course, with a view to obtaining an M.A. degree&mdash;a higher degree than they have.  Once those graduates of another University have qualified for that higher degree, they are, with a view to receiving it, admitted <i>ad eundem</i> to the lower degree.  That is a somewhat roundabout procedure but it meets the case.  So far as one can undertake to prophesy about the decisions of the Senate of the National University, I have not the slightest doubt that so far as the six or seven men who have the Fellowship of the College of Science are concerned there will be nothing left undone to provide them with all reasonable facilities for going further with their academic work and for qualifying to receive the Doctor degree of the University.  I am <Col N="1545" /> anxious&mdash;and this is the reason I spoke at all&mdash;to insist that the University is bound by its statutes and the ordinances made for it but it has power to make new statutes to deal with new situations. Even with its present powers, it can set up diploma courses and grant diplomas; it can admit to <i>ad eundem</i> degrees and it can confer honorary degrees.  In addition to all those plenary powers, it is able to make new statutes and, therefore, I am quite confident in saying that the transfer of the College of Science to University College, Dublin, will not make worse the position of any of its existing or former students.  It will certainly provide them, so far as the spirit and attitude of the University is concerned, with facilities that they had not before.</P>

He accepted the transfer on the conditions enumerated in the circular.  Having accepted the transfer and believing his position to be safeguarded, he awaited developments. He then got three months' notice of the termination of his services.  I do not know what case the Minister is going to make against this gentleman, but I do know that he has filled this lectureship since 1919 without any question as to his ability.  If the Education Department cannot arrange to absorb him in University College, they should, at least, compensate him on the same terms as the teachers in Marlborough Street Training College were compensated. <Col N="1546" /> If the Minister is not disposed to absorb him, I should like to know if this officer is to receive compensation after the seven years' service he has rendered?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reply to Deputy Norton, might I just stress one point which has been made by Deputy Magennis.  That is with regard to certain advertence being made to the diploma of an associate, with a view to admission to a similar distinction in the National University.  I think the Deputy is right when he says that it cannot be considered as a degree.  But apart from that, if it comes to a question of amending statutes or doing anything within the power of the University, I think there is going to be very great argument before it will be considered that these Associates of the College of Science have in equity any call upon the University to grant them degrees instead of their diplomas as associates.  That point has been raised in a letter to the Press.  It is one of the points on which I could not give any assurance as to what the likely course of action of the University will be.  I would have my own point of view about it.  I do not think the case is on all fours, for example, with the case of the graduates of the Royal University who were given the option of applying for a degree of the National University, because the old Royal graduates were graduates of a University, and they were really the pioneers in the struggle which finally resulted in the setting up of the National University.  They had other claims as well.  The College of Science Associate is losing nothing. Whatever value the diploma of associate had it still has.  It was recognised by the Education Department as equivalent to certain things and as entitling the holder to certain things.  It still has that force.  It loses nothing. If anything, it gains by the fact that there will be no more Associates of the College of Science.  The diploma will become more of a rarity as time goes on.  There is no handicap on any person who has the associate diploma of the College of Science.  He is in no way prejudicially affected.  He is entitled to the same consideration as he was entitled <Col N="1547" /> to before.  I do not think there is any case at all for considering, even if it were possible under the statutes, that a person should be given a degree of the National University instead of his diploma as associate of the College of Science.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation I mentioned the case of Royal University graduates after the creation of the National University, to illustrate the position of men with academic qualifications belonging to an extinct institution.  Associates of the College of Science, in the worst position imaginable, would be in the same position as graduates of the Royal University who did not attorn to the National University; they would have degrees from an institution that used to function.</P>

That is not so.  Whatever value attached to the Associateship of the College of Science last year attaches to it for the year, and will attach to it for the future.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies to Deputy Norton might I be allowed to say a word or two in support of the case made by the Deputy.  I think it would be regrettable if there was one single exception made as a departure from the general principle that was laid before the staff when this scheme was put before it.  A meeting of the staff was held at which all were present, including the gentleman referred to and, on the understanding that they were to receive appointments or positions under the new scheme, comparable to the ones that they then had, the scheme was accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> Now surely it must be possible that there is work for him under the future scheme as in the past.  I think, that if at all possible, it would be far better to keep to that general principle.  But, again, if it is absolutely necessary to make an exception I think attention should be paid to the point that he was one of those consulted and his consent obtained.  I think that mere fact recognises that he has a right to consideration, and, in that case, I support Deputy Norton's second suggestion that if it is found impossible to employ him his case should receive special consideration.</P>

      <P>With regard to the case of Dr. Denham the Minister for Education threw out certain hints on the last day, and indicated that he did not think it desirable to go any further into this matter, but Deputies here seem to insist that the whole facts should be made known.  Dr. Denham was merely temporarily on the staff. He was appointed at a certain salary and there were certain increments due to him.  He did not get any increments. It was not considered that his work entitled him to any, long before the question of the College of Science was under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I might express some small surprise but there is another thing to be taken into consideration. Deputy Thrift puts it this way: Surely there is some post that this man could be fitted into on the change over.  The two things have to be considered together.  Is there work for this particular officer and is this particular officer fit to do the work if it is there?  Putting these two things together there is no case for Dr. Denham being taken over.  There is, first of all, the fact of his not having secured his increaments, in the ordinary way, in which he would have been entitled to <Col N="1549" /> do had his work been regarded as satisfactory.  There is the other point that when the Minister for Lands and Agriculture was drawing up a scheme with regard to the faculty of agriculture there was no position, corresponding to the position that Dr. Denham held, that he thought should be filled under the new order of things.  Putting these two things together there was no case for Dr. Denham being taken over. On the matter of compensation Dr. Denham is not entitled to any and, consequently, the Minister for Finance cannot pay any unless there is a special vote of this House with regard to that particular officer.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of increments, I understand there is one case in which an increment was paid but then, in the state of transition two years ago, the increment ceased to be given.  I am sorry the Minister for Education is not here because I gave him full details and I understand he was inquiring into the matter.  Perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce may be able to say whether there is such a case of apparent lapse of increment merely, because of want of inquiry on the part of the Department.  This is the case of a most satisfactory member of the staff.  He is in charge of a department and, therefore, in a different position from certain other lecturers. I am inclined to think it was entirely due to an oversight that that increment was not continued in the ordinary way. Would the Minister undertake to look into the matter and see if that is so?</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 1 to add to Section 4 a new sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Part 1 of the Second Schedule to the Principal Act shall be construed and have effect as if the following Note were added thereto:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In the county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, the grants to persons erecting houses shall be similar in <Col N="1550" /> amount to those given to local authorities, viz., £60, £80, and £100 respectively for the three classes of houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be in the recollection of the House that we had a very full discussion of this Bill on the Committee Stage last week, and that, at the end of that discussion, an appeal was made to the President by many Deputies, including Deputy Johnson, that the difference in the amount given to private individuals and to local authorities, by way of subsidies for the erection of houses, should, in certain circumstances, disappear.</P>
    <P>As the matter stands at present, a private individual who erects a three-roomed house receives £45; the local authority that erects a similar house receives £60.  In the case of a four-roomed house an individual receives £60, and a local authority £80, and in the case of a five-roomed house the amounts are £75 and £100.  It was pointed out on the Committee Stage that there was no apparent justification at all for giving an increased sub sidy to a local authority as compared with a private individual for doing exactly the same thing.  At the end of the discussion an appeal was made to the President to consider that particular aspect of the question.  I trust that in the interval the President has had time to look into the matter, and that he will see his way to meet us.  The reason I urge this is that I am not satisfied that we are getting the number of houses that are necessary in order to meet the very great demand for houses.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out by the President that in the rural areas the advantages of the 1924 and 1925 Acts had been more largely availed of than in the urban areas, and I think it is agreed that the needs of the rural areas are not comparable with the needs of the cities.  To meet that point, my amendment is confined to the four cities.  We all know that housing is particularly backward in the four cities.  Those of us who live in the city of Dublin know how backward it is.  I have had representations made to me from those who are in touch with this matter in other <Col N="1551" /> cities, and though possibly the conditions are not as bad in them as in Dublin, the needs of the four cities are certainly more urgent than those of the rural areas.  Therefore, in order to give a stimulus to the erection of houses in the county boroughs.  I would urge the President to accept this amendment, so that the subsidy in the cases of houses erected in these four cities by private individuals and by the local authorities would be the same.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1925 Act, in the city of Dublin, 350 houses are being provided.  Of these, 49 represent cases of private persons; 89, public utility societies, and the remainder, 212, are the work of speculative builders.  We have often heard of speculative builders being characterised by the thoroughness of their methods, and it has been an accepted proposition that the activity of the speculative builder is the main contribution which you may expect towards the solution of the housing problem. These 212 houses are being built as a matter of business, for sale on a margin of profit, and it remains to have a case proved that we should devote extra moneys out of our limited resources towards increasing these profits. As was mentioned on the Second Reading of the Bill, some delay has been occasioned in the initiation of schemes by public utility societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the existing law these societies receive the same grants as local authorities.  If they are now to be placed on the same footing as private persons they will find themselves somewhat stultified, and the labour of initiating these societies, which is very considerable, will be largely negatived. The formation of these societies is necessarily complicated and takes time.  The fruits of their work, namely, the formation of schemes under the Act, would only begin to operate from now on.  Very considerable efforts, especially in Dublin, have already been made by a small number of public utility societies.  This, as Deputy Good well knows, is one of the most commendable forms of public service.  As I have mentioned here on many occasions, the duty of the State <Col N="1552" /> in this matter is to encourage the provision of houses at the smallest possible cost, featuring the word cost in this respect, as borne by the State, the municipality and the person requiring the house.  The construction of fifty houses and upwards under a single contract is a much cheaper proposition than the building of separate houses by individuals.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government in relation to housing needs has been to eliminate waste, to cheapen cost and to hasten construction.  To increase the grants where there has been such a remarkable response from the speculative builders and individuals would certainly discourage the founders of the public utility societies, and I need not stress to Deputy Good the fact that the aim of modern business is large-scale production.  Deputy Good has informed us that a very considerable number of houses has been built in England without any subsidy, that is, without grants of £45 for a three-roomed house, £60 for a four-roomed house and £75 for a five-roomed house. He also said that a large number of such houses were working-class houses and that such houses, to some extent, were being produced on an economic basis.  I presume that he regarded the construction of houses in England without a subsidy as a marked national advance.  I fail to see any leaning towards that national advance when he recommends still greater subsidies for individuals than experience has shown us has been necessary during the last twelve months.</P>
    <P>Where grants are given in England the cash value of the Government subsidy is approximately £78.  The local authority in England is enabled to supplement this.  In certain cases the supplementary advantage brings the total value of the grant to £100, and in certain other cases to £120.  In the Saorstát the local authorities can give, and in certain cases have given, an equivalent grant to the grant afforded by the Government.  The total amount, then, in this case, comes to £90, £120 and £150, together with a remission of practically fifty per cent. of the rates over a period of twenty years, that is, averaging the remission <Col N="1553" /> permitted by the Act, which runs in the first year to 95 per cent. down in the 19th year to five per cent.</P>
    <P>Very great care was exercised in considering the housing problem previous to the introduction of these Acts, and the amending Act which followed the introduction of the first Act of 1924, indicated the result of our experience in the working of it.  The policy has been to share the burden between the State, the local authority, and the individual.  The failure of any one of these three parties to bear a share would place a heavier burden on the other two.  The resources at the disposal of the State are in this, as in many other services which it must furnish, limited.  The other two parties to the construction of houses must bear their burden.  Experience has shown that in the majority of cases they are prepared to do so.  The amendment, if passed, would involve a bigger State contribution, to relieve either one or two of the other parties.  From the course of the discussion which arose on the Third Reading it might have been inferred that there was a difficulty in the formation of public utility societies. That may be.  But there is no difficulty in joining a public utility society which has been formed and partaking of the advantages which these societies enjoy under the provisions of the Act, namely, larger subsidies.</P>
    <P>The amendment puts a further premium on individualistic activities.  This problem cannot, and will not, I think, be solved without co-operation.  There are facilities for co-operation in the Bill, and they ought to be availed of. It may be that we will find that even those Acts are even too expensive for the solution of this problem.  If carried this amendment will make the solution more expensive.  We must remember that without giving the local authority the maximum grant and getting its co-operation, it may find its resources insufficient to meet the huge demands which it will be called upon to satisfy, in order to make a general improvement in housing.  In this as in other services we have to consider the greatest good of the greatest number, and the best work in that connection <Col N="1554" /> would not be done by giving unlimited advantages to a relatively small number of persons.</P>

      <P>I want to encourage those who would erect these houses. Despite the discussions that have taken place on this Bill I have yet to get an answer that will satisfy me or the Dáil as to why a local authority that produces a number of houses should get an advantage from the State over an individual who does the same work. What is the practice on the other side of the Channel?  There has been an extraordinary spurt in house-building in England and Wales, but here, where the need is more urgent, the question lags.  The same subsidy is given the individual in Great Britain as is given the local authority.  All I ask is that we should give the same encouragement here.  I hope the results would be as satisfactory as in England. I have contended, and also other Deputies, including Deputy Johnson, have urged that, but we find an unwillingness on the part of the President and those who advise him to agree.  The President in the course of his statement pointed out that those who erect houses in bulk can do so more cheaply. I am not satisfied about that.  Doubtless the President has information that I have not, but a great deal of what is known as speculative building, to which the President referred, is done <Col N="1555" /> by tradesmen and their sons.  In several cases the work was done by individual tradesmen and their sons.  I am not sure but co-operative effort of that kind is not cheaper than what we might call the mass production of houses.  It is a question on which I would like to be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President replied to a point that I made the other day, that in England they have been able to get over one-third of the houses erected under the 1925 Act put up without any subsidy. I take it that he draws from that the conclusion that we should be able to do the same thing.  In the different discussions that have taken place it was pointed out that housing is much more expensive here than on the other side of the Channel. The cost of housing here is very much more expensive, and you have also the inability of the people to carry the burden.  Owing to inability to pay what is known as an economic rent, as well as the higher cost of housing, I cannot see how, until you can reduce the cost of housing, you are to bridge the difficulty without State intervention. I hope the time will come, in the near future, when we will be able to say in this country that we can erect houses as cheaply as they are erected across the Channel.  We have not reached that stage yet, and until we do I am afraid the State will have to intervene. When the question is looked at from that point of view, one is satisfied that the State must intervene.  I cannot see that it makes any difference to the State whether it gives the money to a private individual or to a local authority.  As far as I have been able to examine the question from that point of view, I am satisfied that the Government is making a mistake in not proceeding in exactly the same lines as those that were adopted in England and Wales.  They have been able to achieve what we have not been able to achieve in this country.  However, one can only express his opinion on these matters, and urge that certain lines might be adopted.  If the Government does not adopt the opinions that we express and the points we urge, then of course we <Col N="1556" /> can do nothing more.  I am sorry that the Minister has not seen his way to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The motion on the last day was to give one flat rate grant for a three, four and five-roomed house and to make the same grant available for private parties forming themselves into a public utility society and the local authorities, namely, a grant of £75 for each house, whether it was a three, four, or five-roomed house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I understood the object was&mdash;to equalise, but in this case the larger houses are to carry a subsidy of £100 to private individuals as to local authorities in the cities, so that Deputy Good's purpose really is not, as he would suggest to-day, to raise the amount so as to encourage the private builder, but rather to bring about equality of payment, whatever that payment might be.</P>

      <P>What I am trying to point out is that the case that Deputy Good is making to-day is that it is requisite to pay this larger sum to the private builder to encourage him to build.  Now, as I said on the last occasion, I am not able, notwithstanding the President's statement to-day, to see a justification for the differentiation.  I cannot understand the change of attitude of Deputy Good.  To-day his attitude is that you must give this larger subsidy to encourage the private builder; the last day it was that you must equalise the payment.  Whether it be a private builder or a local authority it must be the one sum, and he would like to reduce that sum as low as possible.  As I say, the case that Deputy Good is making to-day is a very <Col N="1557" /> different one to that which he made on the last occasion.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  I do not think that, at this stage of the Bill, I need speak at very great length because most of the points that may require discussion and elaboration can perhaps be more adequately dealt with on the Committee Stage.  The purpose and main principle of the Bill is to provide for the licensing of bookmakers and of houses in which bookmaking may be carried on: to make bookmaking, whether on a cash or credit basis, legal in the premises which may be registered for the purpose.  The remaining part of the Bill deals with matters of detail except in so far as it provides that totalisators may only be set up and worked with the consent of the Minister for Finance and so far as it enables the Minister for Finance to authorise the Revenue Commissioners to work totalisators directly on behalf of the State.  In my Budget statement I think I stated the case for the legalisation of cash betting.  That is now illegal, but it is done by all grades of society and by the most reputable people, and it is impossible to <Col N="1558" /> enforce the law against it: It seems to us that if a law of that kind cannot be enforced&mdash;when the law deals with something that in itself is not wrong, something that can only be objected to if it is done to great excess or carried on in such a way as to lead to abuses growing up alongside it&mdash;the proper thing to do is to remove the legal disability, to recognise the existence of this practice and to regulate and control it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was only circulated this morning and it is rather quick work to ask for a Second Reading of it.  I am not objecting to that. I hope, however, that the Minister will give a fair amount of time before he asks us to take the Committee Stage. It is a rather complicated Bill and I would prophesy that it will lead to a good deal of amendment or attempted amendment on the Committee Stage.  I do not know whether it is the Minister's expectation to get this Bill through, but certainly there does not seem to be a great deal of time available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I received the Bill this morning the first curiosity I sought to have satisfied was to have a definition of the term bookmaking.  I looked down the definition section and I found the very ingenious and, I might say, perhaps, satisfying definition of the word totalisator, but I failed to find any definition of bookmaking.  I think a definition of bookmaking, if not necessary, would be interesting.  The chief point I want to make is with regard to that portion of the Bill which deals with the licensing of premises.  I am a little bit fearful of the effect of the proposals to license premises for bookmaking.  The section provides that only on certain grounds which are stated can a certificate of suitability be refused, and on no other grounds whatsoever.  I think that is a section which would require very careful scrutiny.  I can imagine that under cover of this section bookmakers' premises, quite suitable from the bookmakers' point of view may be established in residential centres, districts where there might be solid public objection.  I think that the limited grounds for objection stated in this section may cause a great deal of dissatisfaction <Col N="1559" /> and public comment.  One of the grounds of objection in the section is with regard to premises that are in close proximity to a place of worship, religious institutions, schools, labour exchange or other similar places or institutions.  I hope the Minister will be agreeable to insert a phrase that would cover the more considerable public works, and I think there ought to be also the opportunity to object as to suitability in regard to locality as well as for the specific reasons stated in the section.  I do not think it would be desirable that bookmakers' establishments should be allowed to open in the middle of a purely residential area, that a house could be taken and simply furnished as a betting house and that nobody whatever would have a right to object, and that it would not be within the power of the Gárda superintendent to object because of the undesirability of establishing a house for betting in that particular place or locality.</P>
    <P>I think that is a distinct flaw in the section.  However, it may be said that that is a Committee point, but in view of the shortage of time that will be available if this Bill has to become law before the House rises, I think it is not unreasonable to deal with it at this stage.  In the case of the setting up of betting premises which would be an undesirable proposition because of the locality nobody will have the right to object except the Gárda Síochána or the Revenue Commissioners.  The objection of the Commissioners will be purely from a revenue cause, so that the sole opposition would come from the superintendent of the Gárda.  I think that is a defect.  If there is any right of objection in regard to, say, a public house, the same right of objection should apply in the case of a betting house.  The Bill, on the whole, might, if one did not begin by admitting the desirability of regulating betting, be subject to a very great deal of opposition, but having conceded that it is desirable to regulate the traffic that exists I think we ought to take into account&mdash;we may have to pass many things we are doubtful about&mdash;the desirability of discouraging <Col N="1560" /> the habit of betting apart from the act of betting.</P>
    <P>I think it is desirable we should discourage the setting up of betting houses in districts where they might lead to the inculcation or the extension of the habit of betting as a habit, and where as a consequence people would be encouraged to devote most of their thoughts to racing matters.  One does not object to occasional betting, or even to frequent betting, but one does object to the habitual concentration on this feature of public life to which so many people in the country are addicted. I feel it is desirable we should frame this measure in such a fashion that we should, if we can, in some degree reduce the temptation to the following of betting as a habit.  I simply repeat my request to the Minister that he will allow ample time for the preparation of amendments to this very complicated measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, we must recognise, is the culmination of a movement to secure a revenue out of betting. I suppose the principle has now been accepted of deriving revenue from this source, and we have gone beyond the stage of arguing the merits of the case from the point of view whether it is desirable or otherwise to set up machinery for collecting the betting tax. There is one aspect of the case that occurs to me, and that is the establishment of a large number of licensed betting houses is going to operate unduly as an inducement in many who, perhaps, in the past have not indulged in this little pastime of betting.  This measure will, I believe, tend to an increase in the number of people who will be smitten with this habit.  This Bill, with its necessary machinery for collecting the tax, it appears to me, is going to have betting houses run on very much the same lines practically as the public-houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of public-houses has grown to such considerable dimensions that a movement has been in operation for some time towards reducing it.  The danger that I see in connection with this elaborate machinery, and the encouragement which is given to bookmakers to take out licences, is that <Col N="1561" /> there is a likelihood of having an excessive number of premises licensed for purposes of betting and these will be recognised, no doubt as a means of revenue, but also as a form of amusement that is likely to spread.  I think that the Bill is making it too easy for bookmakers' licences to be taken out and for premises to be licensed, so that if, at a later stage, it is found that the growth of the number of bookmakers and of premises needs consideration as to its reduction, we will be faced with the problem which is before us at present in connection with publichouses. In other words, the Bill is going to establish a State interest in these betting premises and if, later on, the country desires to reduce the number of such premises and the number of bookmakers, it will have grown to be such a menace that it may have more far-reaching effects than we contemplate at present.  I think that, at the start at all events, we ought to give as full consideration as possible to the undesirability of licensing an unlimited number of people and of granting licences in respect of places for the purpose of carrying on what has been up to the present an illegal practice.  It seems to me that that is the fundamental question involved in the Bill at this initial stage.</P>
    <P>If the House accepts the Bill as it stands, without amendments and without restrictions, I think it is going to take a rather sudden plunge in connection with a state of affairs that may, in course of time, show that it has been an undesirable policy.  The main difficulty would then be that, having started it, it would be difficult to curtail it.  I think that the need for curtailment and restriction in the matter of licences ought to be recognised at the start.  The Minister says that there would probably be between 400 and 500 licences, but there may be more.  That shows the seriousness of the problem with which we are faced in connection with this Bill.  So far as I can see, instead of there being any likelihood of curtailing betting or gambling, or any tendency in that direction, I think we are proceeding to give an incentive in the other direction that will almost immediately be felt through the whole <Col N="1562" /> Saorstát.  I do not see how, having started with an unrestricted number of licences, we are going to end there.  I think that we are going to go much further.  In my opinion, it is very desirable for us to lay down some definite restrictions in the Bill which do not seem to be there at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I feel that the Minister, in introducing this Bill, has done the right thing, because the effect of it is to legalise the establishment of betting premises, which have been known to exist in the past in an illegal form.  I have always felt that it was a gross anomaly, and, in fact, an injustice, to have the rich man going to a race meeting and betting as extensively as he wished, and being free from any possibility of prosecution or from being regarded as a man who was doing anything immoral, dishonourable or illegal, whereas the poor man, who could not go to a racecourse, had to resort to illegal means to bet, and was liable to be held up and, in addition, the man who took his bets was liable to be prosecuted. The whole feeling of public opinion, as judged by statements in the reports in the newspapers, was apparently that those who bet on the streets did a grossly immoral act, whereas those who bet on the racecourse did a thing which could be regarded as quite reasonable and almost desirable.  For that reason I think that, as an act of simple justice, this Bill is desirable.  It legalises betting in premises licensed by the State, even though bets are not recoverable by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I only received the Bill this morning, it is difficult to make a general statement upon its principles.  There is, however, one aspect of the Bill which could, perhaps, be dealt with in committee, but which, so far as I can see, is not covered at present.  I refer to the possibility that the owners of premises licensed for betting may make use of some forms of entertainment as an attraction to draw people to their betting establishments, and keep them there, so that they may continue making bets.  Any movement in that direction should be prevented by a change in the Bill, so as to meet the case.  I understand that when betting houses <Col N="1563" /> were licensed in the United States it was customary for numbers of people to go into these houses and regard them as lounging places where they could spend the greater part of the day making bets on the different races as shown on a blackboard.  If the Bill, as passed, allows anything of that kind in this country it would be very undesirable. So far as I see, the Bill at present makes no allowance for that, except in so far as a licence may be cancelled in the event of a betting-house not being conducted as it should be. Definite provision should be made for that, and loitering on premises should not be tolerated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson's point as to the desirability of preventing the setting up of licensed bookmakers' establishments in a purely residential area seems to be a sound one and so far as points like that come to be raised on Committee Stage I would be willing to meet them.  I recognise that this is a new matter, that it has not been threshed out in Departments over a period of years as have other matters which have been the subject of Bills and that there will be valuable suggestions offered in the Dáil which could not possibly have been fully considered in the circumstances in the Department.  What Deputy Johnson said with reference to giving persons the right to oppose the granting of a licence on appeal and what Deputy Hewat said with regard to allowing large numbers of houses to be licensed, seem rather to hang together.  Our point of view was that where premises were not objected to for some specific reason, ordinarily the licence should issue, because we do not want to create a property in the licence.  We do not want to be up against the problem that we are up against in regard to the licences for the sale of alcholic liquor, where the existence of the licence in a premises constituted property.  We want to have no property created and no saleable interest of any sort in these licences, so that renewal of the licence may be readily refused and the whole regulation of them may be more flexible by far than in the case of <Col N="1564" /> premises licensed for the sale of alcholic liquor.</P>
      <P>In my view if there is an undue number of houses licensed in the first year and an actual abuse is created because of that undue number, the remedy should be in a future year to increase the licence fee from £20 to some higher figure and so reduce the number of houses.  The present position is that we have a number of premises on which betting is carried on illegally and the first step should be to bring them into the open, to have people who carry on betting register themselves and the premises.  I daresay there are much more than a thousand premises in which betting is carried on and when we have them out in the open we will know how many there are.  If there are too many we ought not to restrict the issue of licences specifically so as to create a property interest in the sale of a licence attached to a particular premises, but rather by a suitable gradation of licence fees to reduce the number to some reasonable limit.  I am inclined to think that Deputy Heffernan is also right when he says that in addition to the negative steps that are indicated under Section 8, to prevent the congregation of persons on premises, there might well be some positive provision because while you might prevent crowding by knocking out everybody who allowed it to go on, it probably would be better to put in a section definitely forbidding the setting up of these attractions to draw crowds of people to the house.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  The kernel of this Bill is, of course, in sub-section (2) of Section 3.  The rest is merely an adaptation of existing machinery so as to give effect to the intention of the sub-section. The proposal is to extend the jury area for courts that sit in the City of Dublin to include the townships set out in the schedule of the Bill&mdash;Blackrock Urban District, Dalkey Urban District, Dun Laoghaire Urban District, Howth Urban District, Killiney and Ballybrack Urban Districts, Pembroke, Rathmines and Rathgar Urban District.  The effect of that will be approximately to double the numbers available for jury service.  There are in the City of Dublin 5,440 male jurors.  In the entire county there are 7,630.  Of those 2,900 are rural.  There are 630 in Howth and Dun Laoghaire and in the suburbs of Dublin&mdash;Rathmines, Pembroke and Rathgar&mdash;there are 4,100.  Roughly the effect of the Bill will be to double the number of male jurors available for service in the courts.  In addition there are women jurors who hardly ever serve, 620 in the city and 1,480 in the Co. Dublin&mdash;<Col N="1566" /> total, 2,100.  The case for the proposal I think is one that does not need to be stressed or over-elaborated very much.</P>
      <P>It is I think common knowledge that the establishment of the Central Criminal Court has thrown an additional burden on the jurors here in the city.  Now that, like many things, has of course been exaggerated.  Some people have written and spoken as if the Dublin citizen spent most of his time in the jury boxes.  That of course is not the case.  But it is true and likely to remain true that jurors in and around the City of Dublin have been called upon much more frequently than jurors in the counties throughout the State, and this extension seems a reasonable one.  When you remember for instance, that at present a citizen living in Lower Baggot Street is a city juror and liable for service, while citizens in Upper Baggot Street are in the county and not hitherto liable for service the case for the Bill will be better understood.  There is, of course, very little justification for that difference except the accident that the county line came in and generally speaking it will mean that the difference between the man in the city area and the man who is being brought in on the proposal embodied in this Bill, might be defined in terms of an addition of a penny or two-pence in the tram.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to take in the entire county for jury service in the city courts.  It is not proposed to take in the rural areas and one reason for that would be that of course the consideration of convenient transport to town would not apply to anything like the same extent as it applies in the case of people living along the tram line in the townships.  This proposal here was meant to be one of many proposals in connection with the general question of juries and jurors, but because a more comprehensive measure has been crowded out and cannot be taken up until November, I was anxious to get this special relief for the Dublin jurors through if possible before the adjournment of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <P>That, for carrying out the provisions of any Act of the present session to extend the limit of the time imposed by the Trade Loans (Guarantee) (Amendment) Act, 1925, on the giving of guarantees and the making of loans under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1924, <Col N="1568" /> and to modify the aggregate capital amounts in respect of which guarantees may be given and of the loans which may be made under the last mentioned Act, it is expedient to authorise:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the charge upon the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of such sums as may from time to time be required for fulfilling any guarantee given or for granting any loan authorised under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts, 1924 and 1925 and such Act of the present session; and</P>
    <P>(b)  the charge upon the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of the principal and interest of any securities issued for the purpose of borrowing under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts, 1924 and 1925, and such Act of the present session.</P>
    <P>This Motion is for the purpose of continuing the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act for a further period.  It is also to enable us to re-allocate the sum of £1,000,000, which was the amount which might be guaranteed between the two purposes of the Bill.  One purpose of the Bill was to give employment and the other was to reduce the cost of living.  The sum which might be guaranteed under the first head was £750,000 and the sum under the other head £250,000.  It is proposed now that the allocation be altered from £750,000 under the first head to £900,000 and from £250,000 under the first head to £100,000.</P>

      <P>We have an amendment. It reads:&mdash;&ldquo;In line 3 after the word &lsquo;time&rsquo; to insert the words &lsquo;and to modify the conditions.&rsquo;&rdquo; That amendment is intended to be a preliminary to certain amendments to the Bill itself, of which I have given notice. I think the question requires some fairly close examination in view of the declarations of the Minister and the action of the Departments of Finance and Industry and Commerce in respect to the carrying out of the Act.  I would refer the Dáil to the Trade Loans <Col N="1569" /> (Guarantee) Act, 1924, Section 1, which is the operative section in respect of the larger portion of the present Bill, that is to say, the portion of it which deals with the larger sum.  It has already been pointed out in another connection that this section, for the major part, was taken as a whole from the British Act known as the Trade Facilities Act, I think.  There is one sub-section of this Act of ours which is not contained in the British Act.  That is sub-section (4), which provides that no guarantee shall be given in respect of a loan, the proceeds, or part of the proceeds, of which are intended to be used as working capital.  That sub-section is not in the British Act, but the rest of the section is taken as a whole from the British Act.  I think it is reasonable if one wants to understand the meaning of the section to ascertain, if possible, the meaning of those who drafted the section.  We may have our meaning for our own legislation.  But when any question arises as to the meaning of a section in an Act, it is not unreasonable to consider the intentions of the people who drafted the section as a guide and as a help in interpreting it. With that in view I took the trouble yesterday to read the official reports of the discussion in the British House of Commons at the time of the introduction of their comparative Bill, the Trade Facilities Bill.  I think it is important to have the minds of the people responsible for the introduction of that Bill which contained the very language of this section.  There was a question raised as to the term &ldquo;capital undertaking.&rdquo;  It was explained by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Robert Horne, that &ldquo;the phrase is taken from the Scottish Local Government Act, 1899.&rdquo;  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Capital undertaking&rdquo; in that Act &ldquo;is intended to apply only to such large operations and works as County Councils and Parish Councils might happen to indulge in.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There was no idea in that Act that &ldquo;capital undertaking&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;would cover anything that was concerned with ordinary trading purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Right through the discussion it was evident to any reader that what was <Col N="1570" /> in mind there was creative works, undertakings which meant the production of something that did not exist already.  Further than that, I would point out that the prevalent idea in the minds of the promoters of the Bill and all those who took part in the discussion was that the loans proposed to be raised were not to be loans by banks, but were to be public subscriptions. Public bodies overseas, in foreign countries, and in British Dominions, and local authorities and corporations who might be expected to go to the public for money rather than to banks, were uppermost in the minds of the promoters of the Bill and the framers of the section.  Of course, questions of justification for the Bill were asked, and the explanation given on all hands was mainly that it was to facilitate borrowing at a lower rate with the Government guarantee than could be obtainable if there were no Government guarantee.  It was said, for instance, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is not because people have not gone to their ultimate credit to raise a loan that they do not need it, but they are not willing to raise a loan at the present time at the price at which money is now.  They are waiting until the price is cheaper.</P>
    <P>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Mr. Hilton Young, than whom there were not probably many higher authorities in regard to public finance, and who piloted the Bill through the Committee Stage and appears to have been an enthusiastic backer, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The only financial assistance in the measure which can be given under this scheme if it be carefully examined, is the difference between the lower rate at which an undertaking will get its money with a guarantee, and the higher rate, at which it would have to get it without the guarantee.  That is the limit of the help the State will give under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Further on, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Here is an opportunity for the investing public in regard to an ascertained measure of industrial expansion and recuperation to join with other forces in that common effort <Col N="1571" /> which has been described as necessary in any true remedy for the great evils under which the country is suffering.</P>
    <P>Those two quotations will show that the idea prevalent in the minds of the promoters was that with the Government guarantee money could be raised from the public at a lower rate than without the guarantee.  It was even more insistently pointed out in answer to certain doubts that had been expressed, that there was no thought in the minds of the promoters of the Bill of going to the assistance of doubtful or shaky businesses.  Mr. Hilton Young said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It cannot be said too clearly that nothing is more remote from the intention. Nothing, it is confidently anticipated, will be more remote from the manner in which this scheme will act than that it should be in any respect, or make any approach whatsoever towards being, a scheme for the bolstering up of undertakings which are approaching insolvency.  So far from that being the intention of the scheme, of course the proposition is ridiculous, and so far from it being the effect of the scheme the reasonable thing to anticipate is that with a wide field of choice those undertakings which are accepted so far from being at the bottom of the scale of credit or verging to the bottom, they will be undertakings which are situated at the very summit.</P>
    <P>A question had been raised as to the effect of a financial operation of this kind&mdash;the sum in question was £25,000,000&mdash;and the effect of an issue of credit to that extent upon prices, and Mr. Hilton Young answered that criticism in these words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It may be argued that any scheme of this sort must tend to keep up prices by increasing the supply of credit.  Against that you must set this&mdash;</P>
    <P>and I would ask the Dáil to note the terms of this statement</P>
    <P>&mdash;that any scheme such as this to increase the means of transport and the means of production will increase <Col N="1572" /> the supply of goods available, will tend to cheapen the cost of production and transport, and so will tend to counteract on the one hand what is undoubtedly the effect of increasing the supply of credit on the other.</P>
    <P>The point I emphasise there is that in the minds of the promoters of that British Bill and the framers of the section, the idea was to increase the means of transport and the means of production. On that point, too, I would quote the same gentleman, Mr. Hilton Young. A question had been raised as to the insertion of two words which finally were inserted in the Bill and which are reproduced in our Act.  The words are &ldquo;or produced&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;or in connection with the purchase of articles manufactured or produced in Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; or, in the British Bill, &ldquo;in Great Britain.&rdquo;  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We are only dealing in this Bill with capital works, and I do not think that the inclusion of the words &ldquo;or produced&rdquo; would really have very much effect, because articles needed in connection with capital work are manufactured.</P>
    <P>I have made these quotations because I want to emphasise the fact that the idea underlying the promoters of that Bill and the framers of the section, which we have copied, was that a capital undertaking would be an undertaking for the creation of something which does not at present exist&mdash;the undertaking of new works.  While that was, I suggest, undoubtedly the intention of the framers of the section, it is not the present intention of our Minister.  I think it may have been the intention of the Minister when introducing the first Bill.  If one looks up the discussions, I think it will be found that the intentions of the Bill were to encourage the carrying out of new industrial operations.  In fact, the Minister has pointed out that the expectations of that time have not been fulfilled, and some modifications have had to be entered upon.  I do not think that it is an unfair statement.  My point is that if it is the present intention, as it has been the past action of the Minister, to guarantee loans in circumstances which are not absolutely clearly intended by the section as it stands, we <Col N="1573" /> ought to modify the terms of the section and we ought to make it clearly possible under the section to guarantee loans for undertakings which are not necessarily works of this new capital nature of the kind which I have attempted to describe.</P>
    <P>The amendment which I have put down to this section would enlarge the powers of the Minister, and I have done that because I think it is the Minister's desire, and that that desire has been shown by the experience which we discussed the other day.  The proposal I have on the paper with regard to the amendment of the section would allow the loan to be guaranteed for a purpose wider than the carrying out of a capital undertaking, defining a capital undertaking in the narrower sense as the creation of a new productive asset, and it would allow the Minister to guarantee a loan which was to be used towards, or in connection with, the carrying on of any manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>I know that it will be charged against this proposal to enlarge the powers of the Minister that it is very risky finance, that it is not a wise thing to give the Minister power to guarantee loans of this kind.  But it is also said that it is unwise to give trade loans even for the purpose of new capital undertakings. As I said the other day, if the Minister can come along and say that an industry is in the position of, perhaps, having to dismiss hundreds of workmen, or to go out of existence because of some temporary failure, or that an industry or business exists which is capable of meeting a demand that is confidently expected to be created by a new tariff proposal, I am prepared to say that the Minister should have the power to guarantee such a loan within the limits defined by the Dáil.  If he comes along and says that the circumstances of the country are such, the industrial prospects are <Col N="1574" /> such, as would require that these businesses should be assisted in this direct fashion by the State, then I am prepared to support the proposition and to advocate that within the limits of sums fixed by the Dáil, he should be given the discretion to grant these loans.  I am assuming that in the selection of the loans which would be guaranteed all the checks that are necessary&mdash;the check of the Advisory Committee, the check of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the final check of the Minister for Finance &mdash;will be applied as to the prospects of ultimate success and the security of the loan.</P>
    <P>While I am advocating that, and prepared to support that, I think that it is quite wrong to guarantee a loan in respect of an existing business which is not to be used for reconstructive purposes, or for the creation of new works, or an extension of existing works under the powers of an Act with these limitations contained in it. I do not want, unless it is necessary, to go into the question as to whether or not the section itself has been strictly applied, but I am putting at this stage, at any rate, the proposal that the Minister's powers in regard to the guarantee of loans should be increased&mdash;that is to say, the conditions should be modified&mdash;and it is with the intention that it will be possible to alter the Bill itself, and incidentally alter the existing Act, that I am moving this amendment to the financial motion.  If such an amendment is not carried, then I understand it will be impossible to do as I suggest on the Bill itself.</P>
