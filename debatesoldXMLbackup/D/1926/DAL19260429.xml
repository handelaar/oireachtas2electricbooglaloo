      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the President aware that this is the only nation in Europe which has not legalised its national flag?  In view of the fact that this State has been recognised for four and a half years, does the President expect that Irish citizens will pay proper respect to a State which refuses to legalise its national flag?</P>

      <P>The discovery of the colour is not so much the question as its fastness.  It is a question of the <Col N="740" /> discolouration of dyes which has taken place during the last fifteen years.  Yellow is a colour which assumes various hues according to its age.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the reasons which led his Department to exempt the employees of the Ennis Urban Council from the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Acts: if he will state what is the official definition of &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; as applied to road-workers, scavengers, etc., under the provisions of these Acts, and if he is aware that eight of the Ennis Urban Council employees were recently dismissed and have not now any claim upon the Unemployment Insurance Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Part 2 of the 1st Schedule to the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, as amended by the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1921, places amongst the employments excepted from Unemployment Insurance, employment under any local or public authority where the Minister certifies that the employment is in his opinion, having regard to the normal practice of the employer, permanent in character, that the employed person has completed three years' service in the employment, and that the other circumstances of the employment, in <Col N="741" /> his opinion, make it unnecessary that he should be insured under the Act. The Urban District Council of Ennis applied for a certificate of exception under these conditions and on the representations they made in connection with their application, my predecessor concluded that the conditions for exception were fulfilled, and that it was a case in which a certificate should be granted.  In applying for the certificate the Urban District Council of Ennis stated that, amongst the other employees concerned the scavengers and roadmen were permanently employed and would not be dismissed unless they were guilty of misconduct, neglect in the performance of, or unfitness to perform, their duties.  In the opinion of the Minister the employment of these men was permanent in character within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  I have learned, from information conveyed to my Department by the Deputy a few days ago that eight of the employees of the Council were recently dismissed. The effect of the certificate of exception is that contributions under the Unemployment Insurance Act are not payable in respect of the classes of employees to which it relates, and as the payment of benefit depends on contributions, it follows that the employees covered by the certificate of exception would not be entitled to benefit on becoming unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that when these men's services were terminated, the urban council had no responsibility because of the statement they made that the employment was permanent?  Has the Minister any responsibility for exempting from the payment of unemployment insurance the people whom it now transpires were not permanent under a public body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the usual certificate of people who are very glad to have their contributions deducted when they have permanent employment. The representations made to my predecessor convince me, and would convince anyone, that these people should be excepted.  These people were quite well aware that no return was made, and that no complaint was made. <Col N="742" /> They are now in an unfortunate position, but it is as much their own fault as that of anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister hold that it is not the duty of his Department, because there were no complaints made, to investigate whether they were permanent or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>They knew they were permanent, and the council knew and convinced the Minister that they were permanent, but now they have been declared not permanent, and is there any responsibility on the Minister or on the Local Government Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>None whatever. These people are put in the class to whom exemptions may be granted. These were regarded as of that class, and on the representations made by the council it is quite clear that they should be excluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>TADHG O MURCHADHA</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether a regulation has been made by the Commissioners of National Education which required that the principalships of National Schools with an average of from fifty to one hundred and nineteen pupils should be confined to teachers who have given at least five years' efficient service as principal or assistant and, if so, whether he will state why the terms of this regulation were not adhered to when an appointment was being made of a principal in Rathbarry Boys' National School, Co.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EDUCATION (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In normal circumstances a teacher proposed for appointment as principal of a school with an attendance of from 50 to 95 children should have given five years' previous efficient service as principal or assistant teacher.  In the case of Rathbarry Boys' National School in which the attendance for the year 1924 was 56, the former principal retired on the 30th June, 1925.  The manager proposed the promotion in his place of Mr. Francis O'Leary, who was serving as assistant teacher in the same school and who had been performing efficient work in that capacity for a period of about three years.  The manager represented that there were a number of causes operating to bring about a decline in the number of school-going children in the district, and that the average had recently been maintained above what would have been the normal figure by the continued attendance of the senior boys awaiting Confirmation which had been postponed, and it was expected that there would be a falling-off of these pupils after Confirmation.  It was also contemplated to transfer the infant boys to the girls' school.  In all the circumstances it seemed as if an average of 50 might not be maintained and sanction was given as an exceptional <Col N="745" /> matter to the promotion of Mr. O'Leary proposed by the manager.</P>

The application was reported on by the Board of Assessors on the 18th January last.  After consideration of that report and certain inquiries arising <Col N="746" /> thereon, I decided on the 9th ultimo to grant a certificate, and, subject to the assent of the Minister for Finance, a pension.  The certificate was issued on the 16th March.  A life certificate completed by the applicant was received on the 28th instant, and a payable order for the amount of pension due up to the 31st ultimo was remitted the same day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal has been said about this Bill, so I do not desire to say very much.  In the first place, it appears to me that the Minister does not seem to know his own mind on the subject matter of the Bill.  In connection with the retrospective clause which was discussed at great length yesterday, I think we are practically assured that this clause is a reflection of the mind of the Ministry.  It is nonsense to say that the Minister is going to allow a free vote of the House on this particular clause.  It is a peculiar thing to say that he is going to have a free vote of the House when, as a matter of fact, the House is not in a position to know what is the mind of the Party which sits immediately behind the Ministry.  To my mind, anyone who gives a vote for the Second Reading of the Bill will agree with the principle of it.  Retrospective legislation is very undesirable, especially in connection with a matter of this kind, because you have got to teach the people of this country to have respect for the law.  If Bills are brought in dealing with matters retrospectively people will have very little respect for the work of the Dáil.  When Deputy Gorev was speaking yesterday he said that the railway managers had to accept a certain position which prevented them from lowering freights.  He said that anybody who goes into any office or goods store at a railway station will find too many men employed.  So far as I know, the railway managers know their business very well and they will not keep on men other than those they want.  It appears that if that is the case they are probably keeping them on because of a promise by the Minister that he will give them relief in the Bill now before us.  These men are being kept on with a certain amount of procrastination so that they will not be dealt with as liberally as the men who have gone before them.  The Minister in this Bill is trying to interfere with the Superannuation Fund.  To my mind, he has no authority to do any such thing because according to my information, this Superannuation Fund <Col N="751" /> is controlled in London and any employee, when he comes to a certain age, is entitled to draw superannuation out of it.  It is not good enough and it is certainly extraordinary legislation if the railway company is allowed to take money out of this fund&mdash;out of the pockets of the workers&mdash;and to pay it out to them again, because that is really what the proposition means.  It is an absurd piece of legislation.  The whole Bill appears to be a very hurriedly thought-out thing&mdash;a Bill brought in almost in a fit of desperation in order to come to the relief of the shareholders of the Great Southern Company.  The Minister yesterday quoted certain cases.  He said that in at least three cases men who had been in receipt of £700 per year were, on amalgamation, after the arbitrator's award, drawing £900 per year.  I have made inquiries since yesterday evening and I find that this is not the case&mdash; that nobody in touch with railway circles has any knowledge whatever of any such case or cases.  It may be that some of the higher officials&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He can read it himself. Some of the higher officials may have had agreement with the railway directors, and such state of affairs may have been brought about.  But the Minister mentioned these cases in order to blindfold the Dáil, so to speak, and lead them to believe that these were only one or two such cases, and that in the ordinary case the employees were in receipt of more money since they were declared redundant than they were prior to amalgamation.  I do not think that is the proper way to treat the House.  The Minister told us that he made a mistake, and that the Dáil and <Col N="752" /> Seanad made a mistake in regard to the 1924 Bill.  So far as I can see, he is making an earnest endeavour to get the Dáil to make another mistake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>It might, perhaps, rectify a mistake to some extent, but it would make another mistake.  As I have said, the retrospective clause is very undesirable, and I would ask Deputy Gorey and his party to reconsider their decision and to vote against this Bill, because nobody knows what will happen between this and the next Stage, when the Minister proposes to allow a free vote upon this particular clause.  To my mind, a vote for this Bill now will be a vote for the principle of retrospective legislation.  I would ask the Dáil to vote in such a manner that this Bill will be thrown out and returned to the Department of Industry and Commerce, so that it can be redrafted.</P>
      <P>The Minister challenged me to read a letter which I had received, and of which he has a copy.  I propose to oblige him.  This letter is written by the Secretary of the Irish Railway Clerks' Association to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and it is dated 29th April, 1926:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
      <P>Railways (Existing Officers and Servants) Bill, 1926.</P>
      <P>You are reported in to-day's Press as having, in the debate yesterday on the Second Reading of this Bill, quoted an instance in which a railway servant, with 30 years' service, in receipt of 60/- per week before amalgamation, and reduced by 1/- per week after amalgamation, could claim and be awarded &ldquo;a minimum payment of 30/- per week for life for the loss of 1/- per week.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel compelled in the interest of truth to characterise this as a very grave misrepresentation of fact, and one calculated to seriously mislead the Dáil.  In such a case, what would happen would be this: the employee concerned could, under sub-sections 3 and 4 of the Third Schedule, claim that his wages had been reduced, and that he was, therefore, entitled to a <Col N="753" /> lump sum allowance, based upon the value of the reduction in his pre-amalgamation wages.  If no agreement was arrived at, the case would come before the arbitrator, who would ascertain the lump sum value of the reduction and award accordingly. In fact, already two such cases at least have come before the arbitrator, in one of which the man was reduced by 3/- per week, and placed in an inferior post.  The arbitrator made an award for a lump sum of £200, and the employee concerned will now be compelled to work 3/- per week less for the remainder of his railway career, unless, as is very unlikely in the circumstances, he gets promotion to a higher post.</P>
    <P>Moreover, in all such cases the company can always avoid paying any compensation, by restoring the pre-amalgamation wages or salary of the employee concerned, and when his position becomes vacant, make the new occupant work at the lower rate.  Needless to say, reductions in wages effected as a result of Trade Union wage negotiations with the company, do not entitle the employee to compensation.</P>
    <P>In view of these facts, I think it is only fair that the amazing misrepresentations contained in your statement should be made clear, and in case you may not feel disposed to do this personally, I am sending copy of this letter to certain Deputies for their information.</P>
    <P>May I say also that your allegation that a certain redundant employee is drawing £200 per annum more now than when he was working is absolutely inaccurate, as no such case exists at the moment, except those of senior officers dealt with by the Directors (some of whom are better off than when they were working); whose cases are not covered by your Bill.  The case you may have in mind is clearly a hypothetical one, which in all probability is as mythical as the case already dealt with in the preceding paragraphs.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Center">(Signed) J. T. O'FARRELL,</P>

    <P>These cases were quoted by the Minister <Col N="754" /> in order to mislead the Dáil and it is pointed out now in that letter that these arrangements only apply to people with whom special agreements were made by the directors themselves.</P>

      <P>I do not, but I am surprised that that Act did not raise a storm at the time, as the present measure has done, because I look on that Act as far more unjust than the retrospective clause of the Bill now before us.  I think the Minister is quite ready to meet every legitimate objection that has been put forward against this Bill, but we must remember the position of the railways.  We must remember the widow and orphans who had the modest earnings of the late bread-winner invested in railway shares, and who are now without dividends.  I think these people are also entitled to consideration. The State has interfered with those people, possibly for the national good, but at the same time it has inflicted a grievous injury on them.  In this matter, instead of doing what is popular, we should be rigidly just.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to register a protest against this Bill.  The Minister, in speaking on the Bill yesterday, gave as one excuse the difference existing between railway officials and civil servants as regards pensions.  He said that the civil servant is only entitled to a maximum pension based upon one-sixtieth of his income for each year of service, while the railway official is entitled to one-sixtieth as the minimum. He did not explain to the House that the civil servant accepted his pension while the railway official had to accept dismissal.  He failed to tell the House that the civil servant was enjoying luxuries, and a good salary, at the time that the men, whom an Irish Government are attempting to rob now, were fighting for Irish liberty and refusing to carry munitions to kill our fellowmen. These men sacrificed in many <Col N="757" /> instances their liberty, while civil servants were enjoying their comfortable salaries.  These men had to face dismissal because of their activities and in return for that, as I mentioned yesterday, the Minister is attempting to legalise robbery, by preventing the men who paid into the superannuation fund from getting the benefits of the contributions to which they would be entitled.  Probably he is encouraged in that by his partial success on the Shannon scheme.  If I know the railway men aright, he will find that he will not be as successful in attempting to lower the standard of the railway workers of the Saorstát as he has been with the unfortunate unorganised men on the Shannon scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard about great losses on the railways.  One would imagine that they were attributable to the workers, but we did not hear, even from the shareholders in this House, any reference to the mismanagement of the railways or about the want of proper facilities in many areas.  I can give an instance.  On the Sunday after Christmas, when many people in business in the city wanted to get back to business for the following day, there was no train from Wexford to Dublin.  People who had to get into business by Monday morning had to take motors.  On the following Sunday, when no one was travelling, there was an excursion for the first Sunday of the month.  Probably the directors thought that they might have to pay a few men a few pounds extra if they gave a train on the Sunday after Christmas.  To my own personal knowledge they lost hundreds of pounds owing to the fact that they had no trains to convey people to their different places of business on that Sunday.  You have the shareholders, not saying one word in condemnation of the directors.  Has it not come to the knowledge of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that thousands of pounds have been spent on the repairs of carriages, and that some of these carriages were put on the scrap heap at Inchicore?  When some of the members had drawn the Minister's attention to the matter, the carriages were sent, I think, to Naas, in Deputy Wolfe's constituency.  When some of the members interested found that the <Col N="758" /> carriages would cost £2,000 for repairs, after their removal from the scrap heap down to Naas, they were transferred back again.  I hear that the directors and some of the shareholders are inquiring what has become of them.</P>

      <P>You have dog boxes there for the people.  Deputy Gorey says that you have too many employees on the railways.  He must be one of the privileged Deputies when he finds too many porters and too many clerks in the various stations he is privileged to go into.  The fact that he is leader of the Farmers' Union probably accounts for that, but it is not my experience.  We find many stationmasters doing the work of porters and doing the work of clerks, where they are in charge of goods stores, and although they are not paid for work on Sunday they are obliged very often to work on Sunday in order to get through the work that they should finish during the week.  They are unable to cope with the work in numerous country districts.  Deputy Gorey knows that even in the case of farmers who send milk to the stations, their men have to assist the porters to carry the milk to the carriages, owing to the fact that enough porters are not employed at the stations.</P>

I can assure him that as far as the railwaymen in my constituency are concerned, they are not going to submit under any guise to being deprived of any of the rights that they are entitled to.  I have changed the opinion I always held of Deputy Good after his speech last night, because he said nothing good in favour of the Bill at all.  And seeing that Deputy Good has been very good on this occasion and opposed the Bill, I ask the Minister to accept his opinion of the Bill and withdraw it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to follow my colleague, Deputy Everett, into the question of the management of the railways, but I want to point out the position which has been somewhat clouded by the speeches made here.  Remember there were three or four railways in this country, and by the arbitrary act of this Government they were forced into amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, twenty-eight if you like.  These railway companies were forced into amalgamation, and though they had not agreed to it, they were compelled by the law to accept amalgamation.  In the working out of that amalgamation several anomalies have arisen, and surely it is the duty of the Government to rectify whatever wrongs they have done the railways by this amalgamation.  Any reasonable Deputy in the Dáil will agree to that. We agree that whatever rights the railway officials have, they should have the equities, but they should not get more than their rights.  I contend that in the cases made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce there are men getting more than their rights, and we will not stand for that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>We are much interested in the railways from the point of view of our own business, but we do not allow any interest of ours to clash with our sense of justice in a matter of this kind.  We are quite satisfied that whatever rights the railway officials had, those rights should be <Col N="760" /> secured to them, and that they should keep them; but we could not force the amalgamated company into a position where the right of dismissal of an official is refused on any ground whatsoever. We could not refuse them the rights they had before amalgamation, and we are not going to force them to pay £900 a year on retirement to an official who earned only £700 per year while at work.  In the rectification of these wrongs we agree that the principle of retrospective legislation which is introduced into this Bill is wrong and we will not support it.  We have already agreed that it is wrong in principle, and ought not be embodied in the Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Everett's references to the national work of these men, I have to say that that was also dealt with last night.  This is a business transaction and it ought to be settled on business lines.  It is not right that railway stockholders should pay for national services.  National services, if they are to be paid for, should be paid for by the State and I do not think that that argument has anything to do with this Bill.  We will support the Bill subject to the promise given by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Apparently it is to be recognised now that the ordinary charges which have been so current in people's mouths lately with regard to autocracy were never meant.  I now find myself criticised not for having yielded to the representations made to me but for having refused to yield to the type of representations against which Deputy Cooper protested yesterday&mdash;the hectic flourishes of certain Senators in the newspapers, the waste of money in the duplication of telegrams to Deputies to try to sway their judgment in certain things, and the writing of letters which amount to nothing more or less than a statement that the voting power of certain folk is going to be used if this Bill is not withdrawn. I am glad that the Dáil has the courage to stand up to that sort of thing.  I do not believe that outside the Labour Benches there is any lack of appreciation of what the suggested amendment that I have spoken of really amounts to.  A certain number of details <Col N="761" /> have been spoken of.  Deputy Davin criticised this as being a second amending Bill to the Railways Act of 1924.  He apparently thought that the fact that any amending legislation to the Act of 1924 was required was in itself bad.  It must be within the memory of the Deputies that the first amending legislation with regard to the Railways Act of 1924 had Deputy Davin's approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin supported that piece of amending legislation because it was in line with his own thoughts when the Bill was going through.  I want to take this whole legislation on that basis.  If it be proved that there is any injustice being done to men by reason of this Act&mdash;and that that injustice was something that was not in the minds of the Oireachtas when that Act of 1924 was going through&mdash;then I will let it be argued against me that the purpose of the Bill has been defeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> However, I will get to that when I come to the two or three main points, and find out if certain people now stand for what we have now discovered to be in the 1924 Act.  Can they reconcile with their thoughts what was their intention when the 1924 Act was going through?  I have Deputy Davin's support for this amending legislation, if he discovers that the amending legislation in principle is favourable to Deputy Davin's views.</P>

      <P>We will leave it at that.  Deputy Davin said that the unions had been forced to fight even on unsound cases and had to incur certain expenditure.  I wonder would the Deputy like to have a comparison between the action of the unions here and in England&mdash;how far cases had been pressed in England to try and get a man both superannuation and compensation, or whether it is thought possible that such a case could be pressed in England; whether such a case as that would be considered one of the unsound cases which the railway company forced the unions to fight in order to incur expenditure.  With regard to the question of costs, which a number of Deputies referred to, and as to which Deputy Norton said that in the amending Bill I should have amended defects in other regards, suppose we have that question looked into.  It can be easily done, if some Deputy cares to move an amendment.  But care must be taken that the amendment cuts both ways and that the union funds are made liable for costs given against a man where the union is fighting that man's case, and to find out whether the union will accept that.  If they do there may <Col N="764" /> be a compromise; there may be an accommodation on that point also.  If the railway company are to be mulcted in costs when cases are given against them, so also should the union funds be made liable and the man made to give security for costs.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin alluded to a particular case in continuing his argument&mdash;at least it was in the same context; I do not know whether we are to take it as continuing his argument or not about unsound cases.  He made a point about a railway official who recently had to litigate in order to get his payment from the superannuation fund when he had previously got compensation awarded to him.  Deputy Davin raised that case in this House, and talked about the litigation having ended in favour of that gentleman. Then Senator O'Farrell writes a letter as Secretary of the Railway Clerks' Association, and says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;May I say also that your allegation that a certain redundant employee is drawing £200 per annum more now than when he was working, is absolutely inaccurate, as no such case exists at the moment, except those of senior officers dealt with by the directors (some of whom are better off than when they were working), whose cases are not covered by your Bill.  The case you may have in mind is clearly a hypothetical one, which in all probability is as mythical as the case already dealt with in the preceding paragraphs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin had previously outlined a case for Senator O'Farrell, but apparently Senator O'Farrell turned his deaf ear to it.  The gentleman did get compensation, and he litigated about his award from the superannuation fund and he got that.  The result is that he is getting more than he was getting when in full harness.</P>

The only case of a man having his rights established for him by law is that of the second man, who is actually getting more than he was receiving when at full work, but not £200.  I told the Deputy that there is the other case that I spoke of the case where a man is getting £200 more than he had when working.</P>

      <P>Might I be allowed to put a question to the Minister? Senator O'Farrell, in his letter, states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;May I say also that your allegation that a certain redundant employee is drawing £200 per annum more now than when he was working is absolutely inaccurate, as no such case exists at the moment except those of senior officers dealt with by the directors (some of whom are better off than when they were working), whose cases are not covered by your Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply asking a question.  The Minister has quoted from this letter, and there is a paragraph in the letter which purports to deal with the case of an employee receiving £200 more.  I ask the Minister for the courtesy of saying whether or not the allegation in Senator O'Farrell's letter is correct.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand it as being correct.  I have put two cases, and I have said to Deputy Davin that if he makes the statement to me that Senator O'Farrell is riding off on that&mdash;that the man is not at the moment actually in receipt of this money&mdash;he is probably right, and I give the Deputy the palm of victory for that.</P>

      <P>On this I think the Minister should be a little more detailed. As regards the case of Blackham, I know nothing about it, but I would like to know whether the Minister avers that his salary was £728 when he retired; that he received an award of £485 on account of salary and that he received, out of the superannuation fund, the sum of £446 per annum.  I would like to know if that is the position.</P>

      <P>This case of Kearney's is one of the unsound cases, presumably, on which people will be forced to incur additional expenditure in order to get their rights.  If people consider that they have these rights, then, of course, that is a correct statement. I put it that there were certain anomalies arising under the Bill, namely, with regard to Blackham's case and Kearney's case.  For the future, cases such as these, with the retrospective section knocked out, cannot be touched, but we should surely see that no such anomalies are going to arise again.</P>

      <P>I had agreed to a number of things about noon yesterday, and there was no case made to me at that time for the complete withdrawal of the retrospective clause. What was put to me was this: that there may be a rehearing of cases where this absurd double payment was being made.  That was the case made to me even by a Deputy in the House. We have gone further than that now apparently, so that you have to be either in the position here of an autocrat standing out against everything, or else if you give in to something, then you are told that is butchering. That was the politest description used yesterday.  Deputy Davin spoke of directors' fees as if I had anything to do with them.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to managers, directors and people of that sort.  I have nothing to do with them.  I do not own the railway company and I have not a share in it.  It is the business of the proprietors to see that the funds of the railway are being properly administered. If I had brought in legislation to deal with managers, assistant managers and so on, and if these people were to get large sums, then of course the <Col N="771" /> Deputy would be in order in criticising me, but I have nothing whatever to do with them.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite a good debating point to load the case on one side.  It is certainly a thing that must weigh in the minds of railwaymen who have been given small pensions in comparison to the pensions given to those at the other end of the scale.  Is it the Deputy's suggestion that we should take that in hands and rectify it?  I think that is a matter for the shareholders and I leave it at that.  The Deputy's argument was: Is the railway company in such a desperate position? If the railway company was rolling in wealth and if it had not the slightest bit of embarrassment with regard to moneys I hold that some of the things that have been effected under the Third Schedule to the Act of 1924 are wrong and that in spite of this great wealth on the part of the railway company these things should now be rectified. The position of the railway company has nothing whatever to do with this Bill.  It has been said that this Bill has been introduced on behalf of railway directors and railway managers.  All these allegations may be made, but what I ask the House to consider is the position of the railway user.  Do we want to have an efficient, economical railway system in a few years time and are we to prevent steps being taken which would lead to the railway company becoming economic for the railway user?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister inform the House whether he intends, under the Bill, to deal with one individual who received as a retiring pension over four-fifths of his salary without having paid anything whatever into a pension fund, and with another case where an official by agreement, which this Bill does not interfere with, received over three-fourths of his salary as a retiring allowance, plus £2,500? How does the Minister propose to deal with these cases?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are charged against the revenue account and come into consideration when rates are being fixed so as to bring down the standard revenue under the head of economic management, then that can be queried.  There is provision for that. The object of Section 4, the Deputy stated, was to offer a maximum of one-sixtieth, and the object of the company was to offer one-eightieth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy's presumption is based on, but I put it this way, that we are bringing in what corresponds to the Civil Service scale.  I ask the House to consider whether railway employees are entitled to more than the Civil Service retiring allowance, and I have in negotiations that have gone on, and gone even further than anything that has been referred to in the Dáil, with regard to that particular section, a matter that would be for the benefit of the people who are concerned under it.  It is hopeful at any rate to find Deputy Davin declaring himself against any absurd claim that the number of railway employees should be stereotyped.  Deputy Norton seemed to me to get close to that idea, and Deputy Johnson did get to that idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said it. What I did say was that under the old schedule as it stood that more or less the arbitrator was coerced into the position that he had to count the <Col N="773" /> number of railway employees in the employment of the railway company at the date of amalgamation, and thereafter, unless two things were proved, physical incapacity or misconduct, that number was stereotyped.  I said if that was the case, as I believed it to be the case, that that should be removed, and that is being removed by this Bill, and is one of the things in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>And a great deal more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see how much more.  Deputy Johnson, I say, more or less broached this point, that the number should be stereotyped, for that was his argument.  I admit he said he lost his cue.  I wish he had kept it, for I was interested here following out the new argument.  As far as I got it, it was this, that the amending Bill set out that where the redundancy was due to economic causes there should be no compensation.  Then the Deputy went on to give an example of what might be considered redundancy due to economic causes, and, by a process which I was not able to follow completely, he drifted into this: that there had been a reduction of rates, and that the reduction had been a cause of redundancy.  I suggest that there is a middle term missing. You have to argue that the reduction of rates caused a reduction of traffic, and that the reduction of traffic caused a redundancy.  If it is to be argued what the scale should be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>A reduction of rates causing a loss of revenue, and not of traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>A loss of revenue does not imply redundancy.  It might imply an attempt on the part of the railway company to make it redundant, but redundancy has to be proved before an arbitrator, so that we have got it that a reduction of rates means a reduction not of traffic but of receipts or revenue, and, therefore, a reduction in revenue means redundancy.  The thing is absurd.  The Deputy said he had lost his cue, and I do not know whether I have taken him up right, and I may have lost it also.  He said implicit <Col N="774" /> in the Bill was the right of compensation on anything that might accrue out of redundancy due to reduction of rates.  Let the House consider what the positive of that is, that you should allow compensation for anything that might accrue, even redundancy caused by reduced rates of the railway companies.  That is the positive side of what Deputy Johnson would like to see put forward in an amending Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister would like to be fair&mdash;a reduction of rates compulsorily against the will of the railway company brought about by the operations of this compulsory Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Leading to redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Leading to loss of revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Leading to redundancy. How the loss of revenue is to lead to redundancy I cannot see. Assuming that a dishonest railway company attempted to prove that because they have less money coming in they must get rid of a number of men, they cannot get rid of a number of men because there is less revenue.  They must prove redundancy.  But the fact that they have reduced rates would mean that they would get more traffic. If the traffic is not there, and the traffic receipts show definitely a case for dismissal, that case would be good for any of the component parts of the amalgamated company prior to amalgamation. There was no attempt to give to the employees as against the amalgamated company any rights they had not prior to the company's amalgamation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson has been well briefed, and knew his case in this Bill up to a point, but he was apparently arguing against the Civil Service rate as to the one-sixtieth maximum.  Yes, but the Civil Service is more or less permanent employment, and the people in it are not thrown out of it hurriedly. What about compensation for disturbance? That point is made as if it were a serious point.  Does the Deputy believe now that there is any account taken of compensation for disturbance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> Does he know that is in the Schedule, and is not being amended by the present legislation, and that an added number of years for abolition are given, and these are being continued? So far as he made any case against an introduction of the Civil Service rate that point is groundless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say that the Civil Service rate is fixed as a maximum, that is, that there is an option on anything within the Civil Service rate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is material. As I understand, there is a definite scale fixed in respect of the Civil Service.  It is neither a maximum nor a minimum, but a fixed standard.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is discharged or if his office is abolished he also gets one-sixtieth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he may.  I will put it this way to the Deputy. Arising out of the operations of the amalgamation scheme there may be either of two cases.  A servant may be dismissed.  His office may be abolished. Various things may happen, with the result that he is out of work and out of the service of the railways company. That is all the Civil Service regulations cover.  A second case may arise in the matter of the railway that a railway servant may be kept on in the employment of the railways company but be given duties which he considers not analagous to the duties he previously had.  He is not discharged. He is retained in the service of the company, but at a lesser rate.  He may suffer some loss in his emoluments or pecuniary loss.  That has to be met. Are you going to meet all that by the one-sixtieth rate rule, not the one-sixtieth maximum rate rule? I say the one-sixtieth rate rule is proper for people who leave the service, who are absolutely as civil servants are, but not proper for railway employees who are kept on but who suffer some pecuniary loss.  I do not know if I have made that clear and whether that is an answer to Deputy Johnson, but the Deputy stated that civil servants were in permanent employment and that there was no necessity in their case to consider the question of compensation for disturbance. There is a question of compensating <Col N="777" /> for disturbance in the Third Schedule to the Railways Act of 1924, and that is continued in the amending legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson said further on this matter of superannuation that superannuation was one of the points that was always pointed to when people were pushing railway service.  They said: &ldquo;Look at the extraordinarily good condition you are in with your superannuation.&rdquo; That is a point I think the Deputy made, and it certainly was one of the things a man had before him when entering the railway service, and consequently to interfere with whatever superannuation is coming to him would be a grave injustice.  I take it with regard to what the Deputy said that superannuation is one of the things looked to, and when a man pays into a superannuation fund he has a right to look to that certainly, but as there is no such thing of the same type with regard to the civil service, surely the rate for compensation and for disturbance ought to be less in the case of the railway employee than in the case of the civil servant.  We are taking the exact terms.  We are taking the abolition years for disturbance and doing what Deputy Johnson asked us to do in an amendment to another Bill.  We are giving exactly that right.  The Deputy went on to refer to those superannuation funds as the men's funds of which they were being robbed.  The men have paid into the funds to the extent of 50 per cent.  The railway company has paid in to the extent of 50 per cent.  Why not say the railway company's funds and that we are robbing the railway company, if there is anybody to be robbed?  That is the case I made in opening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes, because there is nothing to give.  His colleagues, who retired earlier, got more than they were entitled, on any actuarial basis, to get.  Deputy Good referred to what I called the B fund, which is more or less solvent, but with regard to the A fund and the railway clearing house fund, the pool from which benefits might be drawn is exhausted.</P>

What sort of insurance fund can you build up by a man paying in 2½ per cent. of his wages even with the railway contribution?  What fund can be built up on 5 per cent.?  Those funds are matters of agreement.  I am being pressed, at the moment, to get the railway company to act up to their commitments under the 1924 Act in another respect and bring forward for discussion on the main superannuation fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have led the Deputy into that statement&mdash;paying out on what was agreed upon but what turns out to be in excess.  As the thing developed, the original fund was declared afterwards to be insolvent, and the men were transferred to the railway clearing house fund.  That is insolvent now, and the company more or less guaranteed it, but the whole <Col N="779" /> thing depends on the solvency of the railway company.  You speak of people's old rights, but the old rights have been dissipated.  There is no money except it comes out of the railway company's ordinary resources.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat made a very slight contribution to this debate.  Deputy Hewat is apparently going to die with the railways company in the last ditch.  He died several times before when the Railways Bill was going through.  He said: &ldquo;The Minister should not have left us in the position in which we are now.&rdquo;  That was after Deputy Hewat had made a speech in which he described himself for the benefit of the Dáil as having been the watch-dog of all the proceedings during the passing of the 1924 Act.  This self-appointed watch-dog failed to discover this flaw, and Deputy Hewat, of everybody outside myself, probably bears the greatest responsibility because, being on the qui vive for everything that might harm the railways, everything that might be used as an argument against the unhappy interference by the Government in the affairs of the railways, he did not advert to the very obvious flaws that are now discovered.</P>

He made some point with regard to a motor lorry coming to a certain area and tapping the traffic, when the company would decide that because traffic had diminished there was reason for the dismissal of men, and Deputy Norton pleaded that such cases should be compensated.  Take the Great Northern Railway Company at the moment.  It is finding a considerable amount of its traffic tapped by motors and men have been and are being dismissed in the ordinary way without compensation.  Nobody stood up in this House to advocate the giving against the amalgamated company any right to the employee which the employee previously had not against the unamalgamated companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put it to the Deputy that if a man's services have become unnecessary in consequence of the amalgamation of the companies he should be compensated, but if they are caused by the other things he should not be.  If there is any point in dispute between us it can be dealt with in an amendment.  Deputy Norton was the only person who took up this point of the seven years' limitation in the Bill.  The seven years is a new point in this, and it had better be adverted to.  In the case of the Railway Clearing House system, under the 1924 Act there is a five years' limit within which the case must fall, and I <Col N="783" /> put it to the House that if amalgamation is really going to be the cause of a person becoming redundant that will have to show itself within a seven years' period from date.  I think it is a sound conclusion that if redundancy is caused by amalgamation, the amalgamation will have had the effect of causing the redundancy within seven years.  If that does not seem to be the case, it is a detail that we can discuss in Committee, but I stand on the seven years' period.  I think it is sound and wise to have some period within which the incidence of these claims must terminate.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies, including Deputy Baxter, have referred to the railwaymen who gave service in troubled times.  Nobody has denied that at all, but I do not think anybody here means to put up the case that they should be compensated by the railways company. If there should be compensation it is a case to be met by the State, and in connection with the case pleaded by Deputy Johnson there is recognition of the service done by railwaymen, as by a great many others in the community, but that will not be dealt with sectionally in Bills dealing with economic matters.  If there is anything to be done in regard to that it should be done by other people, but I do not think that plea has ever been advanced. I doubt if the men want it advanced.</P>
      <P>A number of people have made the complaint that this should have been a bargain as between the men and the management or&mdash;another way of putting it&mdash;that this has been introduced at the request of the management, and that it is on behalf of the shareholders and the dividend-earning class.  As far as dividends are concerned, they do not enter into the scope of this Bill at all.  The dividends are fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a clause allowing for the fixation of standard revenue and for rates to bring that in, and no matter what has to be paid, that clause still remains.  To bring the shareholders and the dividends into this is merely trying to cloud a clear issue.  Neither is this Bill in the interests of the railway management.  What does it matter to the railway management except <Col N="784" /> that they are the proper guardians of the property for the proprietors, and what does it matter to me, except that I am looking at this from the standpoint of the railway users?  If people here want to burden the company with indefensible payments, and if those payments would possibly prevent the bringing about of an economic situation in the railways&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of agreement, there was a schedule in the 1924 Act which could have operated smoothly, and, if attempts had not been made to drive all sorts of coaches through certain flaws that were discovered in it, it probably would have worked smoothly.  But a situation developed which had to be taken in hand.  Probably Deputy Hewat has views on that matter which are, no doubt, sound.  Whatever I say here is not for the benefit of shareholders or for the benefit of any management; it is for the benefit of railway users. I simply make that point.  Deputy Good holds that the principle with regard to the superannuation fund is just the same as in connection with an insurance fund.  I am afraid I cannot consider it so.  If these men had been in an insurance fund there would be no question at issue at all.  The fact is that they are in a fund that was built up by contributions.  There is a further fact, and that is that two of the funds are insolvent, and that makes the position peculiarly difficult.</P>

It points out that the superannuation fund is to be taken into account when fixing the nature and amount of compensation.  From statements made here and reported, or misreported, in the Press, it would seem as if some fund was being taken hold of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

      <P>May I return to the early party of my statement?  The Secretary to the Railway Clerks' Association is a gentleman who knows his business so well that he wrote this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>I feel compelled in the interests of truth to characterise this (referring to certain statements) as a very grave misrepresentation of fact, and one calculated to seriously mislead the Dáil.  In such a case what would happen would be this:</P>
      <P>We are not arguing now about what is in the mind of a certain Senator under the stress of amending legislation as to what ought to happen, but what could happen.  The writer then goes on to instance the case of the railway servant.  I would ask Deputies to look at paragraph 5 of the Third Schedule of the Railways Act, 1924:</P>
      <P>Every existing officer or servant whose office or situation is so abolished, or who so relinquishes his office or situation, or whose services are dispensed with on the ground that they are not required for any other reason, not being on account of any misconduct or incapacity, or whose remuneration or emoluments are reduced on the ground that his duties have been diminished, or who otherwise suffers any direct pecuniary loss by reason of the amalgamation or absorption ... shall be entitled to be paid compensation by the amalgamated company....</P>

      <P>I put to the Deputy Section 5 of Part II of the Second Schedule, which says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every existing officer or servant whose office or situation is so abolished, or who so relinquishes his office or situation, or whose services are dispensed with on the ground that they are not required or for any other reason not being on account of any misconduct or incapacity, or whose remuneration or emoluments are reduced on the ground that his duties have been diminished, or who otherwise suffers any direct pecuniary loss by reason of the amalgamation or absorption (including any loss of prospective superannuation or other retiring or death allowances, and allowances to his widow or orphan children whether obtaining legally or <Col N="789" /> by customary practice of the amalgamating or absorbed company), shall be entitled to be paid compensation by the amalgamated company, the amount of such compensation to be determined by the amalgamated company (subject to appeal as hereinafter provided) in accordance with the following rule, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the compensation shall be an annual allowance to be paid to the existing officer or servant during his life not exceeding in any case two-thirds of his remuneration and emoluments, and, subject to that limitation, to be calculated at the rate of one-sixtieth of his remuneration and emoluments for every completed year of his service with the amalgamated company.</P>
    <P>So that under Section 5 of the Schedule he would get one-sixtieth for every year's service.  He would get 30/- a week for life for the loss of one shilling and yet that is described by the Secretary to the Railway Clerks' Association as mythical and hypothetical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take this Bill.  The second section has reference to the short service men becoming servants of the amalgamated company and being put into particular positions that they did not occupy at the moment. Two objections are raised to that.  One is the objection raised to Section 4 that the onus of proof must be put on the railway company, and that the unfortunate man is in the position that he cannot rebut the evidence of the railway company and which the company brings forward.  So far as he is in that position you cannot help him; there is no help except to provide that every man discharged is compensated. There is no help except the Dáil provides <Col N="792" /> it.  I cannot think that they are in such an inferior position as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>When the onus is thrown on the company it means the company will bring the case before the arbitrator whether they believe it just or not.  I want an assurance from the Minister that if a man successfully defends his case before the arbitrator he will get his costs against the company if he wins.  On the other hand the Minister can have vice versa if he likes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wants that assurance from me, but the Deputy wants not to be bound at all himself; he wants an assurance from me, but it must end there.  I can give him the assurance.  I want an amendment in regard to this question of costs making the thing work each way, having the trade union funds liable if the man has no funds of his own, and if the union takes his case in hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you accept an amendment also that where the cases have been won before the arbitrator under the law in existence that the men should be entitled to recover their expenses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is that it should be retrospective against the company?  Retrospection seems to be less of a vice when it is in favour of the men.  If we make them responsible for the question of costs will he allow Section 6 to stand?  The case of the officers and servants is dealt with in the third part of the schedule.  As far as these men are concerned does the Deputy mean them to come within the cases to be brought before the arbitrator if they so desire?  The third section is an abolition one also.  The fourth section is the main one.  It puts railway servants here on the same basis as railway servants under corresponding legislation in England.  This again is to be amended by the abolition of these words &ldquo;contributed to,&rdquo; and the onus of proof is thrown on the railway company, as I have indicated.</P>

For instance, would he take responsibility for the abolition of branch lines, and the consequent loss of emoluments and salaries on the part of the men?</P>

      <P>The question of the item that stands on page 4 (c) is the second important section of the Bill&mdash;That it shall not exceed an annual sum calculated at the rate of one-sixtieth of his remuneration.  Deputy Norton raised a very definite point there.  I had previously considered it in conference.  It may be possible to provide for the two cases I have spoken of&mdash;dismissal cost and reduction of duties.  Dismissal costs ought to be on the Civil Service basis at the rate of one-sixtieth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The retention, with the diminished duty and pay, ought to be at a rate, if it is only an allowance, not exceeding one-sixtieth.  I hope that that is understood.  The sub-section lettered (c) is the one I stand on, for the abolition of which no one has made a case, with the one exception&mdash;the matter of trade apprentices.  That is the matter I stand on in Committee in order to see what the House has to say to it; (d) as lettered here, deals with a matter that I have indicated with regard to one of the funds.  There may be arguments put up, and they can be put up, in Committee, as some adjustment is possible, with regard to the solvent funds, either by giving the whole amount due, which I consider wrong, or by repayment of contributions which I would consider a fair proposition. In regard to the other two, I would ask the Dáil to consider in Committee <Col N="794" /> whether this section should stand as it now reads with regard to &ldquo;A&rdquo; Fund and the Railway Clearing House Fund.</P>

      <P>I will have an examination privately with the Deputy afterwards.  I have been asked to withdraw this Bill for a variety of reasons. People put that suggestion forward in an open sort of way.  I cannot agree with that.  I think it is understood what is at stake.  There is at stake a change of the minimum of one-sixtieth to the maximum of one-sixtieth, and a rate of one-sixtieth in other cases.  Whatever be the doubt about stereotyping the number of railway employees prior to amalgamation there is no question of that now.  Whatever right the company had prior to amalgamation with regard to dismissal that same right still lasts.  Where there is redundancy by reason of amalgamation or absorption there must be compensation.  These are really the things about which we have been voting.  I have been asked to withdraw the Bill on other grounds that I cannot consider.  One was on the ground that to prove my honesty with regard to assurances I gave here I must withdraw it.  I am sorry that Deputy Morrissey is not here, as I do not think he meant that his remarks <Col N="795" /> should be construed in that way. Deputy Morrissey put it in a way, that to show my honesty in the matter, this Bill should be withdrawn.  I have it that certain people made the suggestion that I had been so dishonest in matters of this sort before that reliance could not be put on my assurances. Deputy Morrissey did not say that.</P>

While I may have a shot occasionally at the Minister across the House I must say that I have as much respect for him as any Deputy in the House, and I would be the last to suggest that he was dishonest.  I did say that he was not fair to the working-classes of the country.  If the Minister thinks that anything I said conveyed anything approaching dishonesty to him, I withdraw it.</P>

There was another suggestion of the same sort made.  Whatever it may have been it was certainly taken up by a Deputy who is not here.  I am very glad that Deputy Byrne accuses me of dishonesty.  I should not like to have his recommendation for honesty.  I hope, as long as I remain in this House, I will have Deputy Byrne's disapprobation and that he will never dishonour me by alleging honesty or anything of the sort against me.</P>

I was very anxious to be put on a footing of cordial relations with Deputy Morrissey and I would regret any imputation that might proceed from him. But I say as regards Deputy Byrne that I hope as long as he is in the House he will continue to impute dishonesty to me.  The sort of honesty Deputy Byrne understands is not the honesty I understand.  I sat here yesterday listening to two Deputies.  I have always had a certain admiration for a novelist whose works I read long ago, Charles Dickens.

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister to clear up a point about which I am in doubt with regard to superannuation.  Take the case of two men, one of whom has been contributing for 50 years into a superannuation fund.  The other man has never contributed.  Both men have the same wages and both are being got rid of as redundant men.  Under this Bill what difference will there be in the compensation? As far as I understand from reading the Bill there will be no difference as the superannuation will be taken into account in making up the compensation.  Will there be a difference in the amount of compensation that each man will get?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the effect of the section as it stands.  I hold that that should be the effect with regard to A, a man who did not contribute to any superannuation fund, and B, a man who contributed to the &ldquo;A&rdquo; or Railway Clearing House Fund, because these are now insolvent.  With regard to a man who contributed to the &ldquo;B&rdquo; fund, I think whatever his compensation is as awarded by the arbitrator, it should exclude a refund of his contributions with interest.</P>

      <P>That is the real matter.  There will have to be a division of the two classes of funds that I have referred to.  That is a Committee point more than one for Second <Col N="799" /> Reading.  I want to put the case to the House that where a fund is insolvent and where, in fact, a railway company is going to pay what is classed as superannuation and in addition compensation, that that is unfair.  Where there is a fund actually in existence outside the railway companies' resources, from which money can be withdrawn, then it is fair that the amount paid should be an amount of the refund of the contributions in addition to the interest plus the amount of compensation.</P>

      <P>I do not suggest it from party tactics, but as a matter of good business.  As the matter is not urgent he should withdraw the Bill and reprint it.  No Bill should be submitted to the House in this shape, and you, Sir, have pointed out that the Bill we are discussing is not the same as that which is printed.  In his speech the Minister said that it was a different one.  I think Deputies will have to vote on your ruling with regard to the Bill as it stands.  With all due respect to the Minister I suggest that it is not fair to ask, even his own supporters, to walk into the Division Lobby and vote on a Bill of that kind.</P>

      <P>The Unemployment Insurance Bill, which is in the hands of Deputies, has for its object certain administrative changes.  I presume it will be permissible to go through the Bill section by section, as the sections have very little relation one with the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 deals with the question of the benefit year.  The position under present legislation must be understood to get the full effect of what is proposed under this section.  At the moment, it is provided by the Acts in force that the benefit year runs from October to October, and that at the end of each benefit year the current authorities have to be revised so as to make certain calculations with regard to contributions made and benefits drawn by applicants.  The result of that review falling for all books at the same time of the year means that there is very heavy work on the Department at a particular period and that a tremendous amount of overtime has to be worked at that period, which is avoided during the rest of the year.  That pressure of work is not merely on the Headquarters Office&mdash;the Office of Claims and Records&mdash;but on local offices also, and if this section be accepted it will mean the setting up of what is called the individual benefit year.  That is to say, each person will have a benefit year to himself, the year beginning as stated here, on the date on which the contributor makes application for benefit, next after the date of the passing of the Act, and then the years run on as stated by the last words of that section from lines 15 to 20&mdash;&ldquo;every subsequent period of twelve months commencing on the date on which that contributor first makes an application for benefit next after the termination of his last preceding benefit year.&rdquo;  In other words, you have the benefit year period running from the date on which, after the date of the passing of the Act, the contributor makes application. That runs on for a twelve-month <Col N="805" /> period, his next benefit year runs from the next application, made after the expiry of that individual benefit year, whenever it does expire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; it is so stated&mdash;&ldquo;the date on which the contributor makes application for benefit next after the date of the passing of the Act.&rdquo;  It is an administrative change.  It causes no hardship to the applicant.  There is no possibility of any hardship being caused to the applicant, and it relieves the pressure of work at a certain time and distributes the volume of work much more equally over the whole of the year.  The second section is something more than an administrative convenience.  The section is a proposal to repeal Section 25 of the 1920 Act.  That section has been regarded as hostile to the principle of insurance.  It has been accepted as hostile to that principle both in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland.  The amendment proposed in this section is now operative in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I say it is hostile to the principle of insurance because that Section 25 of the 1920 Act provides for the return of unexhausted contributions, with compound interest, to any insured contributor reaching the age of sixty and having the minimum number of contributions to his credit.  It involves this illogical proposition, that under a scheme of insurance a person who has been fortunate enough not to have to make any claim for benefit is entitled to have his premiums back.  Naturally, it cannot be repealed without making compensation to all the contributors who are affected, and provision is made in this section for such compensation, for the payment of compensation in respect of the present worth of unexhausted contributions.  How that present worth is arrived at is a very difficult calculation.  It is an actuarial calculation.  What it will be we would have to take a test case to show.  That can be done on the Committee Stage if it is desired.  It is an actuarial calculation to get the present worth of unexhausted contributions.  The <Col N="806" /> methods are indicated in sub-section 3. These methods may have to be increased by regulations to be made under this Act.  The whole thing is purely an actuarial calculation, and as far as that is concerned this will cause no difficulty except there be a disagreement with the idea which is inherent in the whole section, of repealing Section 25 of the 1920 Act, which gives a right to the insured contributor to demand back with compound interest all unexhausted contributions when that contributor reaches the age of sixty, and has a certain number of minimum contributions to his credit.</P>
      <P>The third section has to deal with two points of administration.  The part lettered (a) is giving legal sanction to a practice which has been in existence for years.  I do not mean to hint by that, that that practice has been unsound.  The practice is sound enough if care has been taken to act in accordance with the law in every detail so far as possible, but this, at any rate, will give a quick way of dealing with the sort of case that will come under it and give legal sanction to that.  B is a different point.  It gives power to settle by regulation the position of casual night workers whose employment extends over midnight and consequently covers part of two days. The questions that arise at the moment are very difficult to settle, and if there were no legal rules such as we would be able to get under regulation here, it might be very difficult for the Department to prove cases of fraud that might be brought forward.  There again I do not think it can be held to have any adverse effect upon a contributor or applicant.  It simply means that you make a choice some way or other as to which of the two days count.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dealt with in a somewhat haphazard way.  It happens to work out all right, but in a case where a prosecution for fraud would be taken it might be difficult to get the umpire or the judge to decide what was the day.  It leads to clarity of definition, and I do not think it can be alleged that anybody has been hurt by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> Section 4 deals with a point that I am sure will be quite clear to Deputies on the Labour benches.  It is intended to make clear the provisions of Section 17 of the 1920 Act as to the amount that will be paid the associations in respect of payments made to members who are unemployed and entitled to unemployment benefit.  A similar provision was inserted some time ago in the code in Great Britain.  The second portion of it has to do with the same type of association, but it is of a different nature.  Under Section 9 of the 1923 Act we have power to recover by way of deduction from future benefit due to a claimant any benefit that has been obtained by him in the past by reason of fraud or misrepresentation when he was really not entitled to it. There is no provision in the Acts at present in force giving power to recover where money had been paid to an association where an arrangement of this type had been made with the association&mdash;that is the arrangement under Section 17 of the Act of 1920.  In that case the benefit is not paid direct from the fund by us to the claimant.  It is paid by the association and a refund is made afterwards to the association.  It is now intended by this to put the association in the same position as an individual and to give the right to hold back from future benefit payable any-benefit that has been paid through that association to a person not entitled by reason of fraud or misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 gives power&mdash;it is not a power that we can see any likelihood of availing of for some time&mdash;to make a change in the position of the insurance year.  At present the insurance year ends at a very awkward period, about mid-summer, when staffs are depleted owing to holidays and when a review has to be made of authorities for certain purposes with regard to seeing whether any contribution has been paid in the previous year or whether twelve in a series of years have been accumulated. That review has to be made for all claims at the end of the present insurance year, which occurs about mid-summer. We do not see at the moment <Col N="808" /> any chance of changing the insurance year.  The reactions of that would be rather embarrassing at the moment, but it is thought right to take power to achieve this desirable end, and to have regulations made prescribing the date on which the period constituting the insurance year is to end, and such regulations will consequently have to contain amending provisions with regard to the possible reactions.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the insurance year, but has a somewhat different application.  I spoke already of the review that is to take place of the authorities at the end of the benefit year of every individual.  A review has also to be made of the same book at the end of the insurance year in every individual case.  By Section 1 we are aiming to have an individual benefit year and this is to be read pretty well with Section 1.  The result will be not to necessitate the two reviews for the same person at different times&mdash;the review with regard to contributions exhausted, contributions paid out, and money still to credit, and the review with regard to how far the statute has been adhered to with regard to contributions being paid for the person inside of the insurance year, or if not inside the preceding insurance year, then an accumulation of twelve in a certain period.</P>
    <P>Section 7 has a very special application. It is adding on to the exempted employments what is here described as &ldquo;employment as a teacher of any person in an institution certified by the Minister for Education to be a secondary school.&rdquo;  The whole position of the secondary school teachers is a peculiar one so far as unemployment insurance is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment I am dealing with how far they are affected by the Unemployment Insurance Act.  In secondary schools which are under the control of the Church the majority of the teaching staffs are members of religious Orders who are not paid individually and for whom insurance contributions are ordinarily not paid.  With lay teachers the case is different.  Lay teachers in secondary <Col N="809" /> schools are clearly insurable.  It has been considered undesirable to continue a practice which puts a burden with regard to all those teachers upon those institutions which employ mainly lay teachers in comparison with institutions which employ mainly members of religious Orders and members of the Church.  As I am informed, teachers do not consider they get much benefit through not being excepted.  It is proposed here to except them.</P>
      <P>Section 8 is a rather difficult matter. As Deputies will remember, a certain provision was made with regard to a transition stage for members of the National Army when demobilisation came on.  It was decided that to ease the passage back to civil life certain advantages should be given to people who were discharged by June 29th, 1924.  It was very definitely intended that a soldier not discharged by that date should not receive the special treatment prescribed under Section 4 of the 1924 Unemployment Insurance Act.  It has turned out, however, that there were certain people who prior to that date re-enlisted for a period and carried on their Army period&mdash; that is to say, people who had enlisted for a period that ordinarily would have terminated before June 29th, 1924, and who if demobilised at that date would have fallen under the special provisions of this section of the 1924 Act, re-enlisted or else remained on and after some period re-enlisted.  A question has been raised as to how far those people were intended to be covered by this section of the 1924 Act.</P>
      <P>It was clearly stated at the time that special provision was made for people who were likely to be thrown on the labour market.  At the time, to ease their passage back to civil life, certain provision was made for them.  If a man due to be discharged or demobilised before that date was taken on again, and given a further period of enlistment, it was considered that that further period of employment in the army took him out of the class for whom it was considered that provision should be made.  Accordingly it is intended to make that date, June 29th, 1924, rigid. The section is:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained <Col N="810" /> in Section 4 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1924 (No. 6 of 1924), no contributions shall, after the 26th day of March, 1926, be paid or payable under that section for any person who was employed on or after the 30th day of June, 1924, in the military service of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, any man who was, in fact, employed after that date does not come under the special provision.  There seems to be some doubt as to what is the legal effect of the section.  But the intention is fairly clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It has only reference to persons under Section 4 of the Unemployment Act.  If the Deputy will look at Section 4 of the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1924 and read it in connection with this matter it will be perfectly clear.  If not he can raise it on the Committee Stage by way of an amendment.  The other sections explain themselves.  One might say that all but Sections 2 and 7 are for administrative convenience.  I do not think that it can be alleged that any person is going to suffer from the changes proposed. Section 7 is going to except employment as a teacher from the operation of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  And that is desirable. Section 2 is then a different matter altogether.  Section 2 deals with this question of amending Section 25 of the Act of 1920 by removing this absurd proposition with regard to the return of unexhausted contributions with interest after the insured person had reached a certain age.  But this definitely recognises that that cannot be done without compensating people who are affected and who are going to be <Col N="811" /> changed adversely by this section and a certain scheme of compensation is proposed.</P>
      <P>Section 7 is entirely new here and is outside the unemployment code anywhere. The other sections have been included in the Unemployment Insurance codes of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that the main purpose of this Bill is to make administrative changes, and he assures us that, as far as he can see, there is no possibility of hardship to any applicant.  As that is his intention, I have no doubt that if it can be shown that there is a possibility of hardship, that can be remedied in Committee. I think it is rather a pity that there should have been mixed up with a Bill which is intended to correct administrative defects, one very considerable benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Act, and to deal with that at this particular time.  I refer, of course, to Section 2, which deals with the refund of unexhausted contributions at the age of sixty years.  It is asserted that that introduces a principle which is not insurance, that it is not an insurance principle, that it is outside the scheme of insurance.  I am not convinced of that.  I think it is fairly well known that within the schemes of insurance you have benefits within certain periods and in the case of death in the meantime a certain sum payable over at death.  Or you have benefits of a kind which are dealing with accidents and the like, terminating at the period when if there is any accumulated credits on reaching a certain age, the insured person will be paid that sum.  But I think that that principle is one involved in this provision of the Insurance Acts relating to the refund to unemployed insured persons of their unexhausted contributions. Whether it is paralleled by other insurance schemes or not is not of very great moment, if we can maintain the position that the scheme itself was a desirable one.  I believe that it is a desirable provision to have continued. I think it is unsatisfactory to be attempting to deprive insured persons of that benefit in the present circumstances. <Col N="812" /> The proposition that on reaching the age of sixty the unexhausted contributions would be refunded with interest, has had attractions for a very considerable number of men since it was introduced, and it has been put forward frequently by myself and by others as an argument why men should pay into this fund; why they should encourage their fellows to pay into the fund, and why they should not succumb to the temptation held out to them by employers and others to evade payments into the fund.  I think I may have mentioned it before, in other circumstances, that a few years ago when there was a fairly widespread agitation against recognising British legislation, there were people in the country, acting without direction, no doubt, but stimulated by the prevailing feelings, who pressed upon trade unionists all over the country to refuse to allow their employers to deduct unemployment insurance contributions.  Employers in these cases were very desirous of falling in with that advocacy at the time.  We were often appealed to as to what should be done in such a matter.  I may say the appeal very often came from men who felt that they were secure in their employment, and that there was very little likelihood of their ever having to draw unemployment insurance benefit.  It was a great temptation to that particular class of worker to endeavour to evade the payment of insurance contributions in respect of unemployment.</P>
      <P>We advised the men in all these circumstances to bear in mind the fact that there was this provision for the return of unexhausted contributions at the age of sixty, and that they were, by the provisions of the Act, by the payment of their weekly contributions, really paying into a thrift fund which would come to their benefit at a time when they would need it probably much more than they would feel the loss of a few pence a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is a valuable provision in the Act, and one that should be continued rather than abolished.  I know it may be said that the abolition of this scheme was brought about in England during the régime of the Labour Government.  Well, everything they <Col N="813" /> did was not good, and I think it is particularly useful to us in this country to have such a fund.  I want to direct attention, apart from the general principle, to the undesirability of introducing a deprivatory scheme of this kind in this administrative Bill, and to draw attention to the difference between the method adopted here and the method adopted in Great Britain. There the Bill which contained this provision for the abolition of the deferred pay fund extended widely, in many directions, the benefits in the Unemployment Insurance Act.  In many ways there were extensions of benefits.  There was an increase in the amount of insurance paid in respect of a man and his wife and their children.  There was a continuance of uncovenanted benefits and a considerable number of improvements in the scheme from the workman's point of view.  This particular provision was one which might be argued as not being desired by the workman or as not in conformity with the general scheme of insurance, but there was a difference in the presentation of this proposal, inasmuch as it might be said to be the balancing of increased benefits with the deprivation of this particular benefit that is in question.</P>
    <P>What we are asked to do here to-day is to agree to the proposition that this deferred pay, the refund of contributions, should be abolished of itself without any question of any rearrangement of the insurance scheme as far as benefit is concerned.  From that point of view I think it is a mistake psychologically, that it is a mistake in tactics, and that there is no necessity for it at this time even if it could be argued as desirable in the future when you are dealing with the revision of the whole scheme of unemployment insurance benefit.  If that has ever to be dealt with, if there has to be a readjustment of it or an alteration in any general way, then it might be desirable to consider this question, and to consider it on its merits, but I think it is most unfortunate that we should be asked in a scheme which is intended to correct merely minor administrative errors to make this change in the scheme of <Col N="814" /> benefits that has been handed down to us.  On their merits, I think, and very many think with me, they are desirable benefits.  I will not pretend at this stage to argue the merits of any further extension of the scheme, whether it is sound or unsound from an insurance point of view or any other argument of that kind, but I direct special attention to the unwisdom of introducing into a Bill which is a Bill dealing mainly with administrative defects a provision of this kind, which deprives a man of benefit, and benefit which very many men have looked forward to as worthy of their consideration. The Minister, in answer to a question yesterday regarding the number of persons who have made claims for repayment of contributions on reaching the age of 60 years in the Saorstát, stated that &ldquo;the sum of £14,432 was paid during the period from the 1st April, 1922, to the 31st March, 1926, to persons resident in the Saorstát who lodged claims for the repayment of the excess value of their contributions over benefits.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a considerable sum, and it represents something of importance to the recipients.  The Minister can argue quite fairly that there are provisions in the Bill so that, coming on to the age of 60, people may get certain repayment and so on.  But the fact that there have been 2,800 claims lodged between April, 1922, and March, 1926, shows that there is considerable interest in this matter.  These people may not know that the refund is waiting for them.  I submit it is unwise to make this provision in this Bill at this time. There are no compensating advantages in the Bill, and it is merely a case of depriving large numbers of men of something that they were induced to look forward to.</P>
    <P>Now in respect to the other portions of the Bill, I think it may be found on examination that the effect of Section 1 may bring hardship and mean loss in respect to unemployed insured persons.  As the Minister has pointed out, the effect of the proposal is to make the opening of the benefit year what might be called a movable feast rather than a fixed date, and it can be shown, I think, that in cases there <Col N="815" /> would be an actual loss of benefit due to a change in the course of, say, this current year, but as that is rather a Committee point I shall not enlarge upon it.  There is also another Committee point that I might draw attention to.  It is&mdash;Would the Minister consider whether there is any objection to the suggestion that is in Section 5: that any regulations which may in future be made under that section should be laid upon the Table and get the sanction of the House before they become operative?  Section 8 deals with the question of soldiers.  I think, as a matter of principle, we have to assume that men who reattested and are now by the operation of this section to be deprived of certain benefits, should be assumed to have been aware of this advantage when they reattested. If they had that in their minds when they consented to reattest, I think there should be no deprivation of that benefit unless they had given personal adhesion to the changed conditions.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the greater portion of the Bill is acceptable, and will make desirable corrections in the present law, but I would press upon the Minister the proposition that Section 2 should not be proceeded with, and it is not fitting that it should be embodied in this Bill as it is a deprivation of benefits under the scheme.  Consideration of it ought to be deferred until there has been, if there is to be at any time, a rearrangement of the whole scheme of unemployment insurance. That is the time when a proposal such as this ought to be brought forward, and not now, in a scheme which deals merely with administrative defects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Johnson, I agree that the greater part of this Bill deals with the administrative side of the Unemployment Insurance Act, and, like him, I also disagree with the proposal to take away from the people who attain the age of 60 benefits to which they are entitled under the other Act.  I think it is a mistake for the Minister to introduce that section into this particular Bill.  I would ask him to reconsider his decision on the Committee Stage.  Section 8, to my mind, <Col N="816" /> is very controversial, and is not a section which should come under the description of an administrative section. There are a great number of cases of hardship amongst ex-National Army men because of a decision that has been arrived at as regards the application of the Unemployment Insurance Act to their service in the Army.  I have in mind the case of a man who has just been demobilised from the National Army.  He served with the Army from 1922 up to about one month ago.  He had been employed in an insurable occupation from the year 1912, which, I think, is the year in which the Insurance Act came into operation.  Up to 1921 he had nine years' contributions paid, and simply because his cards were not stamped from, I presume, June, 1924, that man is not entitled to one halfpenny benefit. I think the Minister will agree that is a great hardship.  He had not drawn any benefit for seven or eight years he was paying into the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  Now because his cards were not stamped during his period of service in the Army he is not entitled to benefit because he has not the necessary 12 contributions to his credit. This particular man, although he was actually a soldier, was a mechanic.  I think in a case of that kind if the Minister cannot see his way to extend the provisions of the National Insurance Act to all National Army men the least he could do would be to consider doing so in connection with the mechanics in the Army.  They have paid a great number of contributions prior to enlistment, and certainly, as the Minister can see, with the application of this section they are done out of their rights under the Act.  I would ask the Minister to consider if he could bring in some kind of an amendment on the Committee Stage to meet that class of man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with the insurance, though I may be told that that is not on the administrative side of the question either, and that is the matter of a reciprocal arrangement being entered into between Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the Free State.  There are a great many cases <Col N="817" /> of hardship in that connection in the Saorstát.  You have the case of sailors whose cards have English stamps, and that have been stamped for a considerable time.  These men, at any rate so far as the English Act is concerned, should be entitled to benefit, but neither the English nor the Irish Government will pay them benefit.  They are in the unhappy position of being on the verge of starvation, although they had their cards stamped during the period of employment. I ask the Minister if he cannot do anything under this Bill that he will, at least, make a statement and let the country know the exact position.  On various occasions I put questions on the matter, and we were told that negotiations were going on between the different Governments to see if a reciprocal arrangement could be arrived at.  I ask the Minister to take into consideration the points that have been raised in connection with Section 8, and also the question of a reciprocal arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should deal with Section 2 as he has dealt with Section 6 in the other Bill. These people, in paying contributions to the fund, were looking on them as a kind of life insurance policy, so that if at the age of 60 or 65 they were to enter another world their relatives would have some money to draw to bury them.  The sum might be small, but it would be very useful to those people who would not be able to insure in any other way.  Section 8, to my mind, is unjust, for the reason that a very large number of ex-National Army soldiers before they joined the Army pre-Truce, when they were Irish Volunteers, absolutely refused to pay any contribution towards the unemployment insurance fund because it was English.  Deputy Johnson was perfectly right when he said that pressure was brought to bear on employers not to stamp the cards for their employees, because every halfpenny given in the way of these stamps was looked upon as helping to keep up the English Exchequer.  At that time every man in Ireland, one way or another, was interested in the welfare of his country.  These National Army <Col N="818" /> soldiers who were in employment would not stamp their cards, or allow the money to be stopped from them for the stamping of these cards.</P>
      <P>In other cases some of those men were in search of employment.  I should like the Minister to pay particular attention to this case.  Martin Tully, of Athlone, served in the National Army since 1922, and was demobilised in January, 1926.  He had 82 stamps to his credit.  A wife and five children are dependent on him. That man has had no food for those children notwithstanding the fact that he served in the Army over four years. If he were demobilised in 1924 he would be entitled to the full benefit of his stamps.  I believe, according to the Act, if he could find employment and get 12 stamps extra he would be entitled to the 82 stamps coming to him. Where is that man to find employment for 12 weeks?  He could not find employment. National soldiers are harder hit even than civilian workers.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Section 7 of the principal Act.  According to that section if a man signs on a particular day when he is employed he is deprived of all benefit for 12 months.  Some time ago I wrote to the Minister about the case of a man in Athlone.  I raised the question about this case and the Minister replied that instructions had been given to a solicitor to take proceedings against this man.  Proceedings were taken in Athlone.  The Department of Industry and Commerce lost their case, but the man has not yet been paid. That is four months ago.  What is the cause of the delay?  I think Section 7 should be amended and that that man should get every opportunity of proving his case.  He is called before a board of referees if the insurance officer objects to pay him.  They have no jurisdiction whatever.  They can only make a suggestion.  They cannot grant benefit, and that suggestion can be turned down by the insurance officer.  Then an inquiry is conducted in Dublin.  The matter is kept going for two or three weeks or a month. Finally the claim is turned down, and this man, his wife and family have to suffer the result and live on air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were expecting a Bill to be introduced <Col N="819" /> in the Dáil that would relieve this question of unemployment.  I put it to any Deputy that if he walks up Dame Street and witnesses women with little children in their arms, the latter crying out for bread, they will expect to get some unemployment Act introduced which will give benefit to people in distress and not an Act that will deprive people of their lawful rights.  I admit that, as far as the Minister for Industry and Commerce is concerned, any time I have written to him I have always got the utmost satisfaction.  This is a letter written on the 7th April, 1926:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am desired by Mr. McGilligan to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant regarding the Unemployment Insurance Benefit claim of James Reid, 5 Bridge Street, Athlone, into which he is making inquiries and will communicate the result to you as soon as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the way you are treated.  I ask the Minister to try and have things expedited.  Surely if the claim comes forward from a man whose people are dependent on him the least he can expect is that it will receive immediate attention.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that I am not quite sure about Section 8 of this Act. To my mind it includes all military servants.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 4 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1924 (No. 26 of 1924), no contributions shall after the 26th day of March, 1926, be paid or payable under that section for any person who was employed on or after the 30th day of June, 1924, in the military service of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means every person employed in a military barracks.  I hope, on the Committee Stage of this Bill, three amendments will be put forward and that the Minister, if those people are not included under Section 4 of the principal Act, will accept an amendment to include them and to entitle them to draw unemployment benefit. I am looking forward to the day when no man will be working and every man will be unemployed.  The big farmers <Col N="820" /> themselves are primarily responsible. If those big farmers look to the true interests of the country&mdash;the small farmers are industrious people&mdash;they will withdraw the cash they have in the bank and give employment by tilling their land.  This is an Unemployment Insurance Bill.  I am asking for employment under this Bill, and consequently I think I am in order.  I hope the Minister, when he comes to the next stage of the Bill, will be able to amend Section 2 so that those people will be entitled to have something to their credit.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to a few points with regard to Section 7, in which the Minister exempts secondary teachers.  I ask the Minister if he has given any consideration to the case of other teachers who, at present, come under the provisions of this Act. The people who are exempted are teachers to whom the National Teachers (Ireland) Act applies&mdash;in other words, teachers who are entitled to receive a pension.  There are two classes of teachers engaged in National schools.  There will be three when the Christian Brothers come in under the provisions of the Act, and I should like to know if the Minister has given any consideration to their case.  I do not see any good reason myself why they should be continued under the Act, and I should like if the Minister, between this and the next stage, got some figures in order to show to the House how many of those teachers, engaged in National schools, have drawn unemployment benefit.  I think the number must be small.</P>

      <P>It was never intended that the Unemployment Fund should apply to that class of people who had permanent employment.  I should like to know from the Minister whether he had any representation from the Department of Education with regard to those particular teachers or from the Association of Teachers before he inserted this section.  I did not hear that any <Col N="821" /> special representations were about to be made with regard to that.  I would like to call the Minister's attention to what I think is rather an unusual thing in legislation.  This is the first time I have ever seen an attempt made to summarise or paraphrase one Act of Parliament in another, and I do not know if there is any necessity for that. Section 17 of the principal Act, which provides for the making of arrangements, seems to be put in a paraphrased form in another section.  I do not know whether that is a good precedent to create.  I have never seen it before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the Bill as making administrative changes, but I am sorry that some provision is not made to deal with the special class of case which has become very prevalent lately, especially in the West of Ireland. I speak of the case of the small farmer, or, rather, the labourer who is supposed to have a small farm and who works on the roads, pays unemployment insurance contributions, but who, if he becomes disemployed, cannot receive benefit.  Because he has a few acres of land he is deemed not to be entitled to unemployment benefit, as he is supposed to have work to do on that land.  If the Minister looks into this question I think he will find that the existing state of affairs is not equitable. In the case of the ordinary labourer in the midland or the eastern counties who has got an acre of good land no question is ever raised; when he becomes unemployed the fact that he possesses a cottage and an acre of land is never raised against him.  But in the case of the Connemara or Mayo peasant, who has three or four acres of mountain or bog land, and who from that point of view is not as well off as the man with an acre of good land in Kildare or Meath, the position is different. The man in the West or Tirconaill is not as well off; he has just as little to do, and his small patch of land is of no more use to him than the acre of land to the man in the Midlands.  I cannot understand why that point is always raised to the disadvantage of the smallholders in the western counties. Several cases of that kind have cropped up in recent months where the <Col N="822" /> men, although they were asked to pay their contributions in the usual way, were not entitled to benefit.  I am sorry that the Minister has not made provision to meet that particular case in this measure or in some other way.  I would be glad if he could look into that and see if it is not yet possible to introduce a section to do so, because these are sections in the Bill that do not specially hang together, and a new section might be introduced, without changing the character of the Bill, to settle that particular grievance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephMcGoldr" hpid="Mr. McGOLDRICK Mr. McGOLDRICK">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say only a word or two to emphasise the importance of the subject raised by Deputy Corish and spoken of also by Deputy O'Connell with regard to this class.  Great numbers of people are suffering from severe hardships on account of the fact that they have had their stamps put on on the other side of the ditch.  On account of that they are not able to get into benefit here. This applies also to people who go to England and Scotland as casual labourers. Surely the Minister could find some means whereby fair play would be extended to these people and prevent this hardship.  I feel also that the insurance question in general requires to be overhauled altogether, because I think very few Deputies understand or are capable of following the legislation that applies to it.  I question whether even the Minister himself &mdash;and he is fairly clever intellectually &mdash;can comprehend the full extent of the ramifications that attach to unemployment insurance.  It should be made much more simple and should be made into one common scheme which would be intelligible to everybody and which would cover all cases.  I would urge on the Minister to try to deal with such people as the Belleek workers, from whom we have a tremendous amount of communication with regard to their hardships, and all those affected, and to see if he cannot find some means, either by some insertion in the present Bill or by bringing in a general Bill to cover all insurance, of arriving at reciprocity that would ease the hardships that these people have to endure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to two sections of the Bill.  Section 2 proposes <Col N="823" /> to abolish the provision whereby a man on attaining a certain age receives a refund of his contributions, plus 2½ per cent. compound interest, less the amount paid to him in benefit.  I think the provision is one very good feature of the Unemployment Insurance Acts inasmuch as it ensures to a person who does not become a liability on the fund the repayment of the contributions that he has paid, with compound interest.  I think the Minister must be aware that a good deal of objection is taken by people who regard themselves as being in permanent or semi-permanent employment to the payment of unemployment contributions, and I think the provision for the refund of these contributions, with interest, is an inducement to these people to waive their objections and to pay their contributions. That provision induces people to become members when they have the knowledge that what they pay is not being frittered away to pay benefit to other people.  I have in mind the case of the auxiliary postmen, who number a few thousand.  They are more or less nominally a permanent class in the Post Office, although they are liable to be dismissed at a moment's notice, but that is only a nominal liability.  A good deal of objection has been taken by them to paying these contributions, and I think there would be a great deal more if the Minister presses this section. An inducement to these people to pay contributions is the knowledge that ultimately the money will come back to them, and I think that that right should be preserved to people who are not a frequent liability on the unemployment insurance fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second section to which I wish to refer is Section 8, and here I want to support the case made by Deputy Johnson.  The men who reattested on the expiration of the time which they originally contracted to serve did so with the knowledge that they would be entitled to this benefit, and I think it quite unfair for the Minister to treat them exceptionally simply because they did undertake to serve a further period. Recently, I understand, there was considerable demobilisation from the National Army, and the policy of the Department <Col N="824" /> seems to be to continue demobilisations. These demobilisations are taking place at a time when the labour market is flooded with unemployed workers, and I suggest to the Minister that this is not the time to tighten up unemployment insurance legislation in respect to people who have been, largely for economic reasons, in an uninsurable occupation. I would suggest to the Minister, if he persists in this action, or in some equivalent action, that he should give an adequate period of notice to people that they will not, after such and such a date, be entitled to benefit, and that he should not spring it upon them in this fashion.  I firmly believe that some of those people are convinced that they should be entitled to some consideration for having served a further period in the National Army.</P>

      <P>I will detain the House only a few minutes.  I desire to add a few words to what has been stated by Deputy Norton regarding ex-soldiers. Recently I drew the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to a number of cases where young men joined the National Army a couple of years ago and, when joining, they were in insurable occupations. In many cases they had twenty, forty, and in one case, up to eighty-four stamps to their credit.  In the course of the big demobilisation which has recently taken place&mdash;men being demobilised on an average of thirty to forty a day&mdash;these young men were put out of the Army without their cards being stamped.</P>

      <P>If it is too photographic to be polite, I withdraw it with due deference to the Chair, not to the President.  I say these men, for some reason or other, were demobilised from the Army.  They left the Army or were legally discharged.  They were left on the streets of Dublin and were not in a position to draw unemployment benefit or, benefit from any source.  When they joined the Army they were in insurable occupations and they had from twenty to eighty stamps to their credit.  That is not the way to treat the men who served the country well.  When these men are being demobilised they ought to have their cards stamped and they ought to be treated as Christians and allowed the same benefits as they would get if they were in ordinary employment in a huckster's shop in the city.</P>

It is a rather difficult type of Bill to have an ordinary Second Reading debate on. My duty is to make a prima facie case for the Bill.

With regard to how far Section 7 has been called for by teachers, I cannot say definitely that it has been called for, but I have the authority of certain officials on that matter.

      <P>I understood it was put before a convention held recently; I have not heard the result.  If there is an objection I presume we will hear it before the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were certain comments with regard to omissions from the Bill. Deputy Corish raised certain cases with which I will deal when I come to Section 8.  Deputy McGoldrick and others raised questions of reciprocity and reciprocal arrangements.  This is a very old matter, one that caused considerable trouble before.  Over and over again we have indicated to those concerned in Northern Ireland our anxiety to have some sort of reciprocal arrangement set up.  I made a long statement with regard to that over a <Col N="827" /> year ago.  Since then the matter rather lapsed, but it was re-opened by a deputation that I received some little time ago.  It was then indicated that the time now seemed to be suitable to have a further approach, with better hopes of achievement.  The result was that I got into communication once more with a member of the Government of Northern Ireland, and officials of my Department were brought into conference with officials of his Department with the view of hammering out a solution.</P>
    <P>Several schemes&mdash;I cannot say schemes absolutely in the fullest detail, but certain schemes worked out to a certain extent&mdash;were put before those officials for transference to their Minister for consideration.  That has ended the matter so far as we are concerned. These things are under consideration. The whole thing was re-opened on a definite statement made to me that conversations held between the members of the deputation who called on me and the Minister of the Northern Government seemed to indicate there was every likelihood of a decent reciprocal arrangement being made.  I am awaiting the result.  Deputy Corish and Deputy McGoldrick may rest assured that these cases are recognised as involving some hardship, but they are cases in which it will be also recognised we cannot act unaided.</P>
    <P>The old question of the small landholders was raised by Deputy O'Connell. I thought Deputy Hogan would have raised it, as he has so often raised it with me outside the House.  It is quite wrong to say that people are definitely precluded from drawing benefit simply because they own land.  Cases that most frequently come before this House by way of questions raised or cases that Deputies put to me outside are cases in which benefits have been refused; but Deputies do not get brought to their notice the cases of small landholders who do get benefit. It can be taken definitely as accurate that people are not refused because they have land of a certain area, of a certain value or of a certain nature. These three things were taken into consideration, but there is also taken <Col N="828" /> into consideration the season of the year and the claimant's previous industrial history. After all these things are considered together there is the decision by the umpire as to whether the claimant is at the time entitled to the particular benefit.</P>
    <P>It is clearly recognised that the possession of land should not be counted suitable employment for a man at certain periods.  That is recognised and taken into consideration.  The basis on which the decisions are made are broader.  Equally the question of such claimant's industrial history is taken into account.  If you have a man in the possession of land, which, to a man used to land and used to working upon land, would provide suitable employment, and if that man's physical condition was so deteriorated in some kind of industrial occupation, that he would not be considered a suitable person to work upon the land, he would be entitled to benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not.  I do not decide these cases.  There is a court of referees and an umpire, and all the facts are before them, and all I want to make clear is that there is no rigid rule that because a man has land of a certain acreage that that excludes him from benefit.  I put it to Deputy Hogan, as I put it to him outside the House, to bring me a concrete case where a man having land of a certain type, and valuation, and so on, has been refused benefit at a season of the year when the land could not be worked and was not suitable employment for the man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What would be the reaction of that on the county councils?  They would employ only people exempt from contributions and for whom they would have to pay no contribution.  Is that what Deputy Lyons wants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>And when such a case comes forward possibly that would happen.  Persons not due for benefit, under the Unemployment Act, are due for benefit when they fulfil the statutory conditions.  Any person from whom contributions are taken is always due for benefit on fulfilment of the statutory conditions.  That is clear. There is no denying it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two sections complained of, one dealing with the question of the soldier.  Again I will argue this with much more detail on Committee Stage. Remember when speaking of those soldiers that nothing is taken from them under Section 8.  Provision was made by the Minister for Defence.  The soldier paid nothing.  It was a grant to him.  So that Deputy Norton's phrase about tightening up legislation hardly applies here.  What is happening is that you are not allowing looseness to prevail any longer.  You will <Col N="831" /> not allow any grant to be made by the Department of Defence to people in circumstances which were never before the mind of the Oireachtas when they voted it.</P>

      <P>It is easy to assume it, but I think the case for some amelioration of these people's lot would be easier if one could get some evidence that a man re-enlisted because he was going to get this provision.  The circumstances were that there was going to be a very big number of men thrown on the labour market at a certain time, and to deal with that special situation and that special period of time provision was made that certain moneys would be paid.  A man taken on beyond that period was not thrown on the market.  He might still be thrown on a market over-crowded with unemployed people, but the special circumstances that warranted the special provisions of the Unemployment Act of 1924 were not there.</P>
      <P>There is a big group of men who are thrown out all at once, and the provision made for them is intended only to apply to these people.  We get back to what was the intention, but we are not getting now to the position of the superannuation funds on the railways. No one has been deprived of money which was put in at that person's expense. The only thing is that the Department of Defence is not going to be called upon to provide out of the resources of the State money for people to whom that section was never intended to apply.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister deal with the case I referred to?  I referred to a case where men who had seven or eight years' contributions prior to <Col N="832" /> enlisting and, because they had not twelve contributions within the benefit year, were disqualified from drawing benefit.  Surely there is a hardship there and something ought to be done?</P>

      <P>If Deputies are going to object to the Insurance Act because there is that provision, that is one standpoint.  Remember the whole insurance code is based on intricate actuarial calculations and there are certain things to keep the funds from becoming insolvent.  If a man goes out of employment and has no stamps to his credit in a particular insurance year he must wait until there is some sort of entrance fee, having twelve stamps to his credit, before he can get benefit.  A thing that is at the back of a lot of questions asked by Deputies here with regard to unemployment insurance is that they assume that if they can prove that a man has stamps to his credit he can get benefit.</P>

      <P>Then, unless that is the case, there is no case made for the ex-Army man.  He is in as good a position as if he were in civilian life. If he went into the Army and was not in an insurable occupation for a particular period, he is not, until he gets twelve stamps to his credit, re-admitted into the insurance fund.  That is the situation.  Deputy Corish puts up a special type of case of a man who is a mechanic and who went into the Army and was employed at some sort of mechanical work and was in uniform. That is a special case and every time one makes an exception there is generally a breach made in the whole foundation on which the fund is built.</P>

That is a special type of case and Deputy Corish can raise it on the Committee Stage and it can be examined, but I have not much hope that anything can be done in the matter. We can deal with Section 25 more fully in Committee.  It is the section which Deputy Johnson pointed out was repealed by the British Government.  He suggests that some extension was made in it, but I do not know where he gets the ground for that suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there can be no suggestion that the concern was to run an insolvent fund for the benefit of insured persons and to render it insolvent by giving people, what was a very illogical type of return to give them, back their premiums because they were lucky enough not to make any claim on the fund.  The fund here at the moment, making certain additions to it, is in debt to the extent of <Col N="834" /> £1,600,000, and any moneys paid out hereafter will be paid out on foot of Section 25 for a considerable number of years on borrowed money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>He said that this time last year it could hardly be counted as an asset, but that this year it was likely to prove solvent.  It has to be remembered that the employment insurance code is very new and, so far as those people who fall under Section 25 are concerned, their period is somewhat distant yet.  The whole scheme has not come to maturity and the calculation is that in six or seven years the payments under Section 25 will amount to about £50,000 per annum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>A few months ago the Minister explained that these various exceptions could not be dealt with because there was a general balance on the actuarial valuation and there could be no interference without upsetting the whole scheme.  The Minister has upset the scheme because one is entitled to assume that there is an actuarial valuation in the exhausted contributions fund.  That is also part of the actuarial valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the actuarial calculation has had to suffer a change by reason of what was seen in the operations during the early years of the code.  There was a very detailed report in regard to this by a Committee on the other side of the water.  There is a paragraph in it which is somewhat relevant.  It says: &ldquo;The present position of the Unemployment Fund points to another serious difficulty arising out of ... refund arrangements, namely, that of maintaining in times of stress reserves correspondent with the financial obligations of the Fund ... Even at <Col N="835" /> this early stage of the scheme the liabilities in respect of refunds ... are such that a large sum should be in hand and properly invested at the present time.  So far, however, is this from the fact that ... the Fund is not only exhausted but is heavily in debt to the Exchequer, and to pay this debt and restore the reserves required for the condition of actuarial solvency it has been necessary to impose the present abnormal contributions ...&rdquo; The actuarial valuation was, in fact, found in the early years of the working of the scheme not to be sound and, in order to improve the fund for the benefit of unemployed people, this section was repealed in England and Northern Ireland, and we are moving on the same lines.  We have a fund heavily in debt and the proposition to repay on that basis is illogical in an insurance scheme. We are going to repay to people affected by Section 2 of the present Act the present value of their unexhausted contributions. This is a matter which I am sure will be dealt with in greater detail in Committee.  I feel satisfied that a <i>prima facie</i> case has been made to have the Bill go forward to the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for my Department this year shows a reduction of £5,716, as compared with last year's Estimate.  The greater part of the total saving&mdash;the sum of £3,532&mdash;will be found under the sub-head of Salaries, Wages and Allowances, and has been effected by not filling a number of posts which fell vacant during the year.  The effective staff of the Department, apart from the Film Censorship Branch, which, of course, is self-supporting and is obliged under the Act which constituted it to be self-supporting, is 69.  It might, perhaps, be worth while and of interest to Deputies to analyse that personnel of 69 and to show the composition of it.  Twenty-five officers&mdash;23 men and 2 women&mdash;of the Department are transferred civil servants.  A further four men are re-instated civil servants&mdash;ex-civil servants brought back into the service by the Government.  Amongst the 69 there is one pre-Truce Dáil employee. Then, by open or limited competition, there are a further 15 men and 6 women, a total of 21, and otherwise than by open or limited competition 2. I will explain that presently.  That gives a total of 44 male and 9 female officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I referred to &ldquo;open or limited competition,&rdquo; Deputies might <Col N="838" /> wonder what the significance of &ldquo;limited&rdquo; was in that context.  That applies, of course, to the steps taken to deal with the temporary officer problem.  Certain examinations were held confined to temporary officers, and they provided a means by which people, who had been, for many years, serving as temporary officers, were enabled to pass into the permanent service of the State and become established Civil Servants.  These figures, at any rate, might be of interest&mdash; 25 transferred officers, 4 re-instated officers, 1 pre-Truce Dáil employee, 21 by open or limited competition, and 2 otherwise.  To deal with the &ldquo;two otherwise,&rdquo; one of these is the Assistant Secretary of my Department.  He was a District Justice, and owing to the nature of the work which is performed in my Department, and to avoid unduly harassing the Attorney-General, it was found desirable to bring into the Department a man with legal qualifications.  A Selection Board under the auspices of the Civil Service Commission dealt with applications. An application was forthcoming from one of the District Justices, District Justice Finlay, and the Selection Board named him for appointment to the post of Assistant Secretary to my Department. The other officer is the personal Secretary to the Minister.  He was, I think, an Army officer at the time of his appointment.  He was on the legal staff of the Army, and was recommended to me and accepted service as my personal Secretary.  He served in that capacity for two very difficult years, and was subsequently certified as an established Civil Servant by the Civil Service Commission.</P>
    <P>Last year, in dealing with the Estimates, I gave a rather detailed explanation of the duties of the inspector appointed under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876, for which there is £50 provided in the Estimate, and of the staff charged with the administration of the Aliens Restriction Act at Cobh.  It is, perhaps, unnecessary to repeat that information in dealing with this year's Estimate.  The alien traffic at Cobh has increased during the past twelve months, the total landings being 7,389 as compared with 6,302 for the <Col N="839" /> year 1924-5.  The departures were 7,436 as compared with 5,976.  For Moville, the landing figures were 1,323, and departures 1,223, as compared with 1,554 and 1,314 for 1924-5.  During the year 54 aliens were refused leave to land, and a number of others were only allowed to land on a time basis, that is to say, they had business to transact in the country and were allowed to remain for a sufficient period to transact that business.  A sum of £100 is provided under Incidentals to pay the expenses of deporting aliens, who, for any reason, may prove to be undesirable.</P>
    <P>As regards the Accounts Branch, some explanation is necessary.  The Accounts Branch of my Department deals not only with the accounting side of this particular Vote, but deals also with the accounting of the Gárda Síochána Vote, the Supreme Court Vote and the High Court Vote, the District Court and the Circuit Court Officers' Vote.  This latter Vote, the Circuit Court Officers' Vote, has only recently been transferred to the control of my Department, and the staff in this section may show a slight increase next year as a result of the additional duties which have been taken over. On the question of accountancy it may be well to explain to Deputies that our system of accounting for the Police Vote differs from that which obtained in the past.  In the past the Inspector-General of the R.I.C. was the accounting officer for the R.I.C. Vote, and county and district officers through the country were sub-accounting officers for particular portions of the total sum.  The Inspector-General had, of course, a considerable clerical staff assisting him in that work, and there was a clerical staff in the suboffices throughout the country.  On the whole, I think it is a more satisfactory and efficient system to have the accounting as we have it at present, centrally operative.  For one thing, it leaves the specialist police officer free to do the real work of a police officer. It means that chief superintendents and superintendents through the country have not a large demand on <Col N="840" /> their time by clerical office work in connection with accounting.  It is, I think, also from the point of view of financial control, a better system to have the accounting done directly in the Department by civilian clerks as it is at present.  It is necessary to give that word of explanation in connection with the staffing of that accounts branch which, in the absence of such explanation, might seem heavy.</P>
    <P>The sum of £650 for contemplated additional staff is to cover the salaries of two junior officers who have been on loan from their own Department for some time and who are now being finally transferred.</P>
    <P>In connection with the film censorship, the apparent saving on the sub-head of £966 is due to the fact that the sum provided for the cost of showing films is now borne on the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.  The total quantity of films censored during the twelve months ending 31st March last was 5,191,412 feet, of which 363,709 feet represent interest films.  The fees taken in the same period amounted to £2,325 17s.  Complete figures for the cost of the working of this service during the same period are not yet available. But in view of the fact that there was a reduction of fees in February, 1925, there is not much likelihood of there being an appreciable surplus of receipts over expenses.</P>
    <P>The Vote for Incidental Expenses is increased by £110.  £100 of that represents the provision for the deportation of undesirable aliens to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>As to the winding up of the affairs of the late Dáil courts, that work has now practically terminated, and the sum of £100 provided is intended to cover the few remaining claims which are under inquiry at the moment.  That item will, of course, disappear from the Estimates this year.</P>

      <P>With regard to the officers at present employed in this Department, in reply to a question I got a return showing that under Vote 31 there were twenty-five transferred civil servants; four ex-civil servants reinstated; one pre-Truce Dáil employee; and new officers, 15 men and 6 women, and two otherwise appointed.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> Could the Minister indicate to us the 23 new officers in his Department?  I have been trying to get an approximate sum as to the salaries and bonus of the existing officials.  This return gives us the salaries as £8,219 and bonus £4,000, and the total for salaries and bonus here is £26,000.  I should like if the Minister would indicate the different officials who are new employees so that we may be able to get the salaries of the new employees in his Department for the purpose of comparison.  It would be interesting to see whether the new employees are being paid on the same standard as the old pre-Truce civil servants.  The return given me, while of value to some extent, is of very little value if I am not able to get further information as to the officials in the Minister's Department who are transferred civil servants and who are not.  If the Minister could go down the list and point out those who are new officials it would clear up the position with regard to the new officials and the transferred civil servants.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general question asked by the Minister, the procedure on Estimates has been this: The motion that the sum desired shall be granted is usually moved by the Minister for Finance or some other Minister of the Executive Council on his behalf.  The Minister in charge of the Department under discussion usually makes a statement, such as the Minister for Justice has just made.  If a question of major policy arises, or if for any important reason it is desired that the Vote shall be reconsidered or referred back, the Standing Orders make provision for a motion to refer back the Estimate for reconsideration. That must be made immediately.  The <Col N="842" /> debate on that motion, if made, should deal with general matters of policy and not with matters of detail which would properly arise under sub-heads.  If the motion to refer back the Estimate is negatived, then the Vote proper comes up for consideration, and if it is desired to raise any general matters, they should be raised in the beginning, and the details should be reserved for the sub-head under which they would seem appropriately to come.  Further motions can then be proposed.  In the first place, a motion for a reduction of a general Vote and subsequently motions for reductions in different sub-heads. Finally, the question on the original motion, either for the original sum proposed, or for the sum remaining after amendments have been carried, if any amendments are carried, is put from the Chair.</P>
      <P>It has been our practice to accept amendments without notice in Committee on Estimates, but it is very desirable that Deputies who desire to move amendments, whether in the nature of a motion to refer back the Vote, or for a general reduction, or for reductions in sub-heads, should give as much notice as possible, so that Deputies and the Minister will know precisely what the Minister will be asked to deal with.</P>
      <P>In Committee on Estimates we cannot discuss legislation.  That is to say, the Minister for Justice is now answering for the administration of his Department within the law, as the law stands.  A debate cannot be allowed which seeks to amend the law and that is a thing on which we have been somewhat lax, but it is really a somewhat sound rule, if Deputies will consider it, that in any discussion on the Estimates Deputies should not be allowed to advocate reforms which would necessitate legislation.  In other words, if a Minister can say when a Deputy is advocating a particular thing that that would require new legislation, and if that view appears to be a correct one, the Deputy is stopped from proceeding any further along that particular line.  If he were not so stopped the discussion would be endless and would not be on the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> Now the question that Deputy Baxter has raised is a general question, under sub-head A, salaries, wages and allowances.  If the Minister desires it, or if it were the desire of the Committee to take up sub-head A now, perhaps the Minister could answer that question if he has the information at the moment, because it might influence the general discussion.  Otherwise it is more advisable that the Minister should be allowed to hear a number of points and to answer them together or at least in groups.</P>
    <P>I will be glad to answer any question that Deputies may ask upon procedure, because if we could keep ourselves clear on that at the beginning, the discussion on the Estimates would be more fruitful.  The greatest and the most objectionable tendency is to deal with details at the very beginning. Deputies who have nothing to deal with but details should wait until the particular sub-head comes up.</P>

      <P>I desire to raise a matter of public policy in connection with the Minister's Department.  He is the Minister charged with the safety and preservation of the peace and the lives of the citizens of this country. A few nights ago a case was raised where in a particular village a man's life was in danger by a shot fired by a soldier, and from the discussion that ensued, it would appear that the State Department represented by the Minister was negligent in instituting, on behalf of the State, as the preserver of the lives of the citizens, an inquiry. I would like to understand from the Minister whether in that particular instance any action was taken by his Department, and if action has not been taken, who is responsible?  The case referred to was a case of the shooting of a civilian in the village of Killenaule, in Tipperary.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will let me say that he has exemplified very well one of the points I have made and one of the pieces of advice that I was giving to Deputies. If he intended to raise a matter of general policy, as to the action or the inaction of the Minister's Department in August, 1924, he might have given notice of that.  Because, obviously, without making the Minister's case, a question like this requires some investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.

      <P>I do not want to argue with the Deputy.  This is not a question of policy, if we consider the matter strictly.  It is a question from the point of view of the Deputy of the remissness of the Minister in a particular case.  Anyway, Deputies in the future might remember that it will be more possible to get information from the Minister, and more possible from the point of view of Deputies themselves to make their own case against the Minister, if they give him notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice indicates that there is a saving of £5,700 this year as compared with last year in his Estimates.  Without going <Col N="845" /> into the details of the staffs and all that sort of thing, I would like to refer to the fact that for the past few years the Department of the Minister has been exceptionally busy.  All the court procedure and regulations have had to come before the House, and the entire reorganisation of the legal procedure has been arrived at.  Now, broadly speaking, perhaps the Minister will not mind my saying it in this way: that if a general staff of, say, 76 was the staff that was required for the years that are gone by, and the Minister puts before us a proposal that a staff of sixty-nine is adequate now for the purpose and that a reduction of seven, temporary clerks mainly, is a sufficient economy, if I might put it that way, in connection with the enormous amount of relief that his Department must get by the settled procedure in connection with the courts as compared with the work involved in the past, it is a matter on which we would seek for information and enlightenment.</P>
      <P>The changes made so far are mainly concerned with temporary clerks, but this would seem to indicate that a staff of 69 is required in these offices in the future.  Perhaps the Minister would enlighten me on the point, but I imagine that the economy in personnel is hardly adequate to the relief that the office will get through the changes that have taken place.  I do not want to go into the matter in detail, but I am making the broad criticism that the changes in the Minister's Department must have been very considerable, and that the work in the future cannot be nearly so heavy as it was in the past.  Therefore, I cannot see how he has come to the conclusion that a staff of 69 will be permanently required for carrying out the administration of this office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Vote be reduced by a sum of £750, which is approximately two and a half per cent. of the total sum asked for. It is on general grounds of a financial character rather than of a departmental character that I am moving this reduction.  It is based on the Estimate of the Minister for Finance, who, taking all the Estimates together, thinks there will be a saving of <Col N="846" /> £650,000, or say 2½ per cent., on the average.  It may be that this particular department will save more than 2½ per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that it will save less than 2½ per cent., but we are in the peculiar difficulty of not being able to put our fingers on any particular Vote.  In any case, if there is to be an excessive expenditure on any Vote the Minister will have to come to the Dáil for a supplementary Vote.  If, in the case of the Department of Justice, it turns out that there is no saving whatever, we have to assume from the Estimate of the Minister for Finance that there will be a greater saving on some other Votes.  I do not think it would be a very great hardship for the Minister to have to come back to the Dáil towards the end of the year and say that the Estimate now presented to the Dáil for a sum of £29,822 was just sufficient to cover the expenditure, and that our reducing it by £750 obliges him to come back again.  I do not think that would be a great evil or a great hardship on the Minister, while it will give the Dáil an opportunity of reviewing the administration some time later in the year, and that will not be a fault.  Therefore, on the score of departmental inconvenience I do not think there is any loss to the Department by reducing this Vote by 2½ per cent.  I think we are justified in assuming that on each of these Votes there is an over-estimation of 2½ per cent.  It is certainly undesirable that we should be asked to grant a sum of £29,822 if the administration can be carried on for an even sum of £29,000. Consequently, I am asking the Dáil to agree with the Minister for Finance that the sum required for this Vote and all the other Votes is the sum named in the Estimates less 2½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in his defence of this over-estimation, suggested in his Budget speech that there was something not pleasant in having to come back to the Dáil with the supplementary estimates.  I do not agree with that at all.  I think it is a <Col N="847" /> greater fault to ask us for too much than to have to come again for a little more.  The Minister has indicated in this Estimate under the sub-heads what he thinks will be actually required to conduct his department.  If we take our judgment from the Budget speech of the Minister for Finance that there is a likelihood in all these several votes of a 2½ per cent. saving, that we reduce the vote by that sum, and if it turns out that the Estimate of the Minister for Justice as to his actual requirements is a correct one, he will have a very good case, indeed, and will not require to produce any great argument in asking us for the balance of his account.  That is really what it means.  I, therefore, move that the sum asked for be reduced by 2½ per cent., or, say, £750.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the general substance of Deputy Johnson's argument that over-estimating is an evil, and that it is an evil that ought to be checked, but whether it can be checked by a mechanical and automatic reduction of 2½ per cent. on every vote I very much doubt.  Before even the Minister for Finance made his Budget speech, I went through the estimates with some care looking for signs of over-estimating.  I found them in a number of departments, and I have embodied my discoveries in a series of amendments, but I do not think you can go and put an automatic rule and say cut off 2½ per cent. everywhere. The best indication by which we may judge whether a Department over-estimates or not is by observing how its estimates in the past have compared with its expenditure.  I do not entirely agree with Deputy Hewat that the Department of Justice has had abnormal claims on it in the past which have now ceased.  There is, for instance, the matter of the new rules of court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to do is to compare, as far as we can, the Estimates with the Appropriation Accounts and see what the Department of Justice costs.  Two years ago it cost £31,251, of which about £2,300 was abnormal expenditure in connection with the winding up of the Dáil courts, and the salary of a Dáil judge.  If you take away that sum of £2,300 you find that it then cost about £29,000.  That was the actual expenditure.  The Minister has now brought the total estimate of two years ago down to a total of £29,822.  It may be that he has over-estimated, but the general indication of his estimates do not show a serious over-estimate.  It is nothing compared with some other Departments I am going to deal with another time.  I rather dislike having the point of my spear blunted by Deputy Johnson taking up a not very strong case and putting it on the shield the Minister for Justice can interpose.</P>

      <P>This will not prevent you.  The case that the Deputy would like to make would be on specific items.  I cannot deal with these matters, but I submit I am right in assuming that at least 2½ per cent. is going to be unspent on many of these accounts because there will be a balance to make up.  Some will be less than 2½ per cent. and some more, if the estimate of the Minister for Finance is to be fulfilled.  I want to test the Ministry in this matter, and find out from the several Ministers where the Minister for Finance has the expectation of getting £650,000.</P>

      <P>Heaven forbid I should defend the Minister, but I do think Deputy Johnson's method is unscientific and undiscriminating.  If I may use a military parallel, Deputy Johnson wants to attack all along the line with equal force at every point.  I <Col N="849" /> want to find the weak point to ram my forces home.  I do not think it is on this Estimate, because any increase that there is in it is an increase in the accounts branch.  I think Deputy Johnson knows, and the Committee know, that it is false economy to stint the accounts branch, and that you will get more economy by having a thoroughly sound working finance branch looking into the Estimates submitted by other departments, and cutting them down within limits than by reducing them. On this point I cannot vote for Deputy Johnson's motion.  On many other occasions he will be only reinforcing the conclusion I have arrived at, but on this particular Estimate I shall abstain.</P>

If you take up the Appropriation Accounts for 1924-25 you will there find that the grant given to the Department of Justice was £36,738, and there was expended £31,252, showing an over-estimate of £5,485.

In reference to the matter of my personal secretary, it is right perhaps I should mention that he was a first honours graduate of the National University, and a barrister, and the necessary certificate was issued by the Civil Service Commission on the ground that he had the necessary educational qualifications, and that he had given very valuable service over two years in his capacity as secretary to the Ministry.</P>

That is a question of policy, but really if you take a particular incident anywhere, at any time, you can hardly say it is a question of <Col N="852" /> policy.  We ought to have every opportunity of discussing this matter, but I have serious qualms about the discussion, on the Estimates for 1926-27, of a specific incident going back to August, 1924.  There is no difficulty in the matter because the Deputy has raised it once from a particular angle.

I do not think it ought to be <Col N="853" /> raised on the Estimates.  If it is important, the more important it is the more reason why it should not be raised in any casual fashion.

      <P>Deputy Hewat said if the Minister could do with 76 people some months ago, in view of the improved condition and the relaxation in his Department he should be able to do with less than 69 now, that is to say, a sum in proportion which Deputy Hewat works out to his complete satisfaction. Of course, there are other explanations which do not suggest themselves to the Deputy.  A year or two ago Departments were very seriously overstrained and were working at a tension which could not possibly be accepted as a normal state of affairs. Officials were in Government Buildings up to late hours in the night.  There was any amount of overtime.  Men would not stand that strain and were not standing it.  Matters have eased somewhat since then.  Except in some very special circumstances there is an absence of that serious overtime work, which really is not proper, and does not make for the greatest administrative efficiency, but there is a certain amount along that line.  If the strain has eased it is right it should have eased, because it could never have lasted and men could not have stood it.  There is less overtime work in my Department.  And I think that refers generally to the other Ministers who, of course, will speak for their Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a little discouraging to hear Deputy Hewat saying that the rules of court were promised long ago.  It makes one agree with the lady character in the Abbey play, who remarks from time to time, &ldquo;Where is the use in talking?&rdquo;  I have told the Deputy again and again that the rules of court cannot be brought into the Dáil until the Court Officers Bill is signed by the Governor-General and becomes law, because rules of court deal with officers and offices that will not have a statutory existence until the <Col N="854" /> Court Officers Bill is law.

Deputy Hewat, Deputy Johnson and Deputy Cooper have already had a hot engagement, and it is very encouraging at this early stage of the Estimates to find the enemy quarrelling among themselves.  I rather incline to leave it between them and not to spoil a good fight by superfluous intervention. Deputy Johnson has moved a reduction and has applied the peculiar argument that if the Minister for Finance anticipates that on the Estimates, taken generally, there will be a surplus of in or about £600,000, that means that a particular Estimate might well be pruned by 2½ per cent.  Under the present system of financial control I disagree with that line of thought. Supposing you had such a system of control that if I were to find myself with too little I could go to some other Minister who had too much and borrow from his wealth, or surplus, there might be logic and soundness in the Deputy's point of view.  But, under a system of control when each Department is run as a water-tight unit, it is scarcely sound to say that if the Minister for Finance believes, viewing the Estimates generally, that there will be found, in some quarter or another, he not being able to put his finger on any one quarter just at present, to be a surplus of £600,000, that the Deputy must come along now with his reduction vote on my Estimate of the very meagre sum of £750.  If the Deputy <Col N="855" /> was going to have a reduction in my Estimate I would have been glad if he had put it higher.  However, it is really scarcely a point for me to grapple with.  The Deputy in moving his reduction did not imply any censure on the Department, did not put up anything which I could be reasonably called upon to defend.  Having moved this reduction of £750 to my Estimate, we must assume that he will proceed logically and move a proportionate reduction to every other Estimate. That will, no doubt, be very amusing to the Deputy and intensely interesting to the Dáil, but I do not see that I am called upon to do battle with him on that position and I refuse to do so.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister's position is a perfectly sound one. He has presented what he conceived to be the absolute minimum amount of money required to carry on the work of his Department, and all the other Departments have done the same.  But the Minister for Finance comes along and says: &ldquo;That Department will not spend as much as the Minister is asking, by a certain sum of money.&rdquo;  But somebody has to say what the amount that is required will be.  I am backing the Minister for Justice against the Minister for Finance in this.  I think he knows better than the Minister for Finance what he is going to spend.  Supposing the Minister for Justice is right in his Estimate, supposing that other Estimates are right, except, let us say, the Army&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;where is the Minister for Finance going to get his £650,000?  If the Minister for Finance is near about right, some of the Votes are going to be very much more over-estimated for than 2½ per cent., but I do not know which is, unfortunately, and I want to find out from the Ministers responsible for the various Votes which is the weak spot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister for Finance to say which of these Votes is over-estimated; where he thinks the over-estimation <Col N="856" /> is to be found.  Surely it is unreasonable to think that he can save £650,000, say, on the last six Votes on the list, because all the others, according to the Ministers responsible for them, are not over-estimated.  Who is wrong in this matter?  I think the only thing the Dáil can do is to reduce every Vote by 2½ per cent.  Of course, we will be wrong; we cannot be right in every one of them, but if we reduce them all round by 2½ per cent. the total sum we vote will coincide with the estimate of the Minister for Finance of what he wants, and as far as the Dáil is concerned, we shall be justified in not voting away the people's money in a way that the Minister for Finance says is not justified.  I think it is quite a fair statement to say that there is no reflection upon the Department to ask the Minister to come back in six or nine months' time for the balance of the account which he rendered to us in April, 1926.  If he comes in January and says: &ldquo;I asked you for £29,822 nine months ago.  You only gave me £29,100.  I now want the balance, and I have justified the claim that I put before you in April last,&rdquo; that would be a perfectly legitimate position for the Minister to come to, and we should not be asked to vote to the Minister for Justice more than the Minister for Finance says he requires, and I say that in reference to all these Votes.</P>

      <P>For the first time in my life since I have been in the Dáil I find Deputy Johnson both ignorant and innocent.  Ignorant&mdash;he has not studied the Estimates.  He wants to apply this hopelessly unsystematic, unscientific method of a 2½ per cent. cut all round, including Charitable Donations and Bequests, including Hospitals and Charities, and things of that kind.  If he had worked on the Estimates as I have worked on the Estimates, if he had even studied the amendments that I have placed on the Order Paper, he would find that the Estimates could be cut down by over £650,000.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is, fortunately, younger than Deputy Good and will, no doubt, learn it in time. I agree with what Deputy Johnson says about over-estimating, and I think Departments are too frightened of coming here and asking for Supplementary Estimates.  You cannot fix your expenditure in Estimates to the last farthing.  But the consequences of Deputy Johnson's policy of an all-round cut of 2½ per cent. would be that each Department, in framing its Estimate, would allow for that cut beforehand and inflate its Estimate by 2½ per cent.</P>

    <P>Do not attack the enemy&mdash;if I may call the Ministers the enemy for the time being&mdash;where he is expecting to be attacked.  Attack him where he does <Col N="858" /> not expect it.  Look for his weak points and attack him there.  That is the way to reduce expenditure.  When I see Deputy Johnson coming under the prophetic mantle of Deputy O'Mara and Deputy Duffy, with their absolutely crude, ill-considered suggestions of all-round cuts of 2½ per cent., which will, no doubt, in time grow to 25 per cent., I can only think, just as the Queen of Sheba said to Solomon, that the half of Deputy Johnson has not yet been told me.</P>

      <P>I just want to ask a question of the Minister on sub-head A as to the saving that he proposes in the total of salaries.  It is a special reference to the point that was raised in connection with the appropriation accounts.  The question I want to ask the Minister is whether the saving, as estimated for now, is really due to an attempt to approximate more closely what he actually found necessary for his expenditure.  If he turns to the Appropriation Account of 1924-25 he will find the estimate under the head of salaries, is £5,000 more than was necessary.  That was for a staff of 66.  The following year it was found necessary to increase that 66 to 76, owing to circumstances that he mentioned.  We do not know what was the actual expenditure that year.  The sum estimated for, I think, was about the same as that of the previous year. Now this year he is asking for £27,000 instead of £30,000 asked for in 1924-25, the numbers now being 69, getting back towards the original staff of 66.  He is asking for £2,000 more than was necessary in 1924-25, presumably because there is still an increase in staff as compared with that time.  But is this £3,000 saved on salaries due to an effort on his part more closely to approximate in his estimate to what was actually found necessary in 1924-25?</P>

I would like to have some information as to the position of the protective force, and whether there is any change as compared with a year ago.

      <P>In reply to Deputy Johnson's query this provision for messengers and a protective force is really a matter that is looked after by the <Col N="861" /> Department of Finance.  Some of it represents our contribution, our share of the cost, but this is not a service specifically in my Department.  It is the messenger staff generally attached to Government Buildings and provision for adequate protection.</P>

      <P>I am not quite sure on which vote it occurred, but there was a discussion a year ago in regard to this particular force.  I think I am right in saying that it was a survival and was being got rid of.  There should be no necessity, now, for a protective force outside the Gárda Síochána, or the police force under the Department of Justice.  If this is taken to be a special protective force still existing and running through the Estimates in different departments then it requires some explanation from one or other of the Ministers.</P>

There would be the uniformed Gárda Síochána plus the detective branch which is part of the Gárda.  I am not quite clear that the reference to the protective force is not really an error in the Estimates carried forward from last year.  Subject to possible correction, I think it should be read as applying to the messenger service in my Department. There is no separate protective force in existence now.  Any special protection that requires to be given is given by the police, either the uniformed police or the detectives associated with the police.</P>

I think the explanation lies in the fact that there is now a firmer conception of what our requirements are.  It is almost true to say that up to this year we were a growing Department, and could not have definitely stated to the Minister for Finance at a particular time that our needs were going to be X in the matter of staff.

The sum is a trifling one, but it is not inconsiderable to the small scientific departments that have occasion to import such films.  Inasmuch as the censorship office more than pays for itself by these fees, and as far as I can judge from the figures in the return, there is a surplus returned to the Minister of about £700 over cost of maintenance, I would suggest to the Minister for Justice that he should not let himself be outdone in generosity by the Minister for Finance, and that he should forego these small fees.</P>

The explanation of this will be found in the footnote which mentions sums of £10, £28, and £725.  These are respectively included in the provision under sub-heads C and D and allied services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ALTON</NameTxt>

      <P>If the Deputy looks at sub-head C he will find in connection with the Film Censor's Office a sum of £10 for incidental expenses. Included in sub-head D you have a sum of £28, and also a sum of £725.  A sum of £80 has to be paid by way of rates, £580 for accommodation, £40 for stationery and printing, and £45 for Post Office.  There is no real surplus on the working of that office, and I think that under the terms of the Act constituting the office we would not be entitled to have anything going to the Exchequer in respect of that particular service.  If there were a surplus it would, I think, have to be returned to the trade, and that actually happened last year.</P>

      <P>Yes.  But what I am at is that these figures do not show a surplus of £700 odd.  On the point which the Deputy has raised, if a surplus is found to exist and if the office is any more than self-supporting, I would be glad to consider the request that these educational films should be exempt from the fee.  That is something about which I would hope to get the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  There is not any real controversy as to the merits of what the Deputy has raised, and it is really a question whether a surplus exists.</P>

The sum accruing from this source must be very small, and it would not go very far towards the upkeep of the office.  If the Minister has power, under the Act, to do this, why is it not done?</P>

      <P>I am prepared to look into the matter, as I would not like to say off-hand what the position is.  It is a legal point which would need looking into.  As I am situated at the moment, the position is that complete figures as regards the cost of this service for last year are not yet available. Our view departmentally is that, having regard to the fact that there was a reduction of fees in February last year, there is not much likelihood of there being a considerable surplus. There may be some surplus, and if such appears to be the case on the working of the office, we could consider whether remission could be given along the lines which Deputy Alton suggests.</P>

      <P>Under &ldquo;Miscellaneous Revenue&rdquo; in the Revenue Accounts. I might say that the whole question of appropriations-in-aid is one to which some consideration was given by the Committee of Public Accounts, and it is one which has been under consideration, to some extent, in the Department of Finance.  There is not at present any great method in the way in which sums are shown sometimes as appropriations-in-aid and sometimes treated simply as Exchequer receipts.  My own opinion is that the items shown as appropriations-in-aid are rather too numerous than otherwise. In many cases the showing of something as an appropriation-in-aid serves really to disguise the real cost of the service to the public.  There are, of course, appropriations-in-aid which have not that effect&mdash;for instance, an appropriation-in-aid arising from the sale of surplus property or stores, worn-out stores, or something like that.  They do not disguise the real cost of the service, but there are other appropriations-in-aid which do.  We took over the Estimates in a certain condition, and we have, I think, improved the form of the Estimates a good deal.  We have made them more logical and we have made them simpler in various respects.  This question of appropriations-in-aid is one which has not yet been dealt with, but which is due to be considered, and will be considered further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

      <P>The point is that we should be enabled to deal with one subject under one Estimate.  We pointed out on previous occasions, when discussing these Estimates, that when we came to certain portions of them we were referred to another Department and to another Vote.  That is not desirable. The Minister has explained to us to-night that some effort has been made to improve the form of these Estimates.  I think this Estimate is capable of considerable improvement. I do not recollect whether this item of £580 appeared last year in the Estimates at all.  I am not quite sure whether it is not a new item altogether.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will realise that the point he is making now touches on the whole question of division of labour, so to speak, among Ministers&mdash;the whole question of the division of work between various Departments each with its individual political head. It sounds well to say &ldquo;Why not take everything under one estimate and show us the whole picture?&rdquo;  But then you would have this position: that whereas I am responsible for the Film Censor and his staff and the degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction which the operations of the Censor and his staff give to the general public, I am not responsible for the rent and light and equipment generally of the office in which he works.  That is a matter for the Commissioners of Public Works, who are represented in the Dáil by the Minister for Finance.  It would be only an apparent improvement to put everything down under that head, because you would have much the same position again.  One Minister, at a certain stage, would have to say, &ldquo;There I leave you; that is the responsibility of another Minister.&rdquo;  For instance, taking that last foot-note on page 106, you have sums for rates, office accommodation, stationery, and a sum in respect of the Post Office. These are all various phases of administration divided out among different Ministers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can see exactly what happens.  When we come to the Board of Works Vote we will want to know whether those offices are suitable, whether the rent is too high and whether the position of the office is suitable to this Department.  We will be told by the Minister that that is not a matter for him; that he is only responsible for the rent of the office; that whether the office is suitable or whether the accommodation is suitable, is a matter for another Minister.  We will be driven from one to the other.</P>

      <P>As a rule, if a person wants a house he goes to people <Col N="870" /> who provide houses.  He does not go to a stockbroker or a breeder of horses. The Board of Works specialises in providing this particular class of accommodation for the whole of the Government Service.  If the Minister for Justice had got to provide himself with an office, he would have to send out one of his own officials, not accustomed to that particular sphere of activity, who would go round from friend to friend or from auctioneer to auctioneer.  In the Board of Works, that is the business of a particular officer.  There is a man responsible for it and he can be held responsible.  But it ought not to be the responsibility of each Minister to make a case for his office and for the rent he pays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Deputy Good to this extent: that I think there is a growing tendency on the part of public departments to transfer to the Board of Works, where it cannot be properly discussed, expenditure which should be charged against their own Vote.  We have included in the Vote for the Board of Works, items for Agricultural Colleges at Glasnevin, Athenry, Ballyhaise, and Clonakilty.  I agree that the Board of Works are experts, but they should be experts in an advisory capacity and when they have given their advice and indicated the office, then the cost should be on the Vote of the Department concerned. Otherwise, you will never get a clear discussion.  I have never suggested in the Dáil that the British practice was the best practice because it was British, but I say in this respect the British practice, whereby not the Board of Works, but the Secretary of State for War, answers for new buildings which are required for the Army, new barracks and so on, is a sound one. We see under the Board of Works Vote this year a sum of £40,000 for new barracks at Ardnacrusha.  We must discuss that, not from the Board of Works point of view, but from the strategical point of view, and yet it is under the Vote of the Board of Works and not under the Vote for the Department of Defence.  I do think that the Board of Works should always be consulted.  They can always act as agents.  That is what they are there <Col N="871" /> for, just as if we went in private life to take an office or private premises, we would go to an agent and consult him.  They should act as agents for Government Departments but the Department concerned should be the principal and should pay the rent, and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence when he requires a barrack does not call in the Board of Works and say: &ldquo;What do you think I should build for&mdash;one thousand, two thousand, three thousand or five thousand men?&rdquo;  He says to the Board of Works: &ldquo;I require accommodation for a garrison of a certain number.&rdquo;  It is their job to see to that but so far as the responsibility for accommodation and strategical position and all that sort of thing is concerned, it falls on the Minister for Defence. The actual carrying out or the making up of the prescription is the responsibility of the Board of Works.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that these are estimates of expenditure. There is a possibility in discussing the salaries, wages and allowances sub-head, to discuss policy and to criticise the policy of the Minister in the instance which Deputy Cooper <Col N="872" /> gave, the selection of a site from the point of view of strategy.  As the President pointed out, that has nothing to do with the quality of the building, or the cost of erecting that building.  I think it is perfectly right that that should come under the head of the Department responsible for putting up buildings, and it is, therefore, in the right place under the Public Works Department.  I am not convinced at all of the case made against this form of estimating.  As I said, it is an estimate of expenditure for which the Minister for Justice is responsible. That part of his responsibility which is concerned with the film censorship is detailed, but to show that there is a further charge against this service of film censorship, which is provided by another department, the facts in the matter are stated for the information of the Dáil.  You are specifically referred to these other Departments by the foot-note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the information that is contained there is necessary for the guidance of the Dáil and for informing the Dáil of the total amount that is being spent for this particular service, but the provision of these means for carrying on the service is not the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  I think it would be quite wrong, and as a matter of fact, would defeat the objects Deputies are seeking, if we placed under the Department of Justice, the cost of the building or the rent of the building in which these offices are situated.  After all, the Minister would not be able to answer a question, and he would not be able to have access to all the officials of the Department of Public Works.  As is alleged against public officials, the Minister might be hoodwinked up to the eyes.  If there are half a dozen different Ministers, each for their respective services responsible for the provision of offices, they could give half a dozen different answers, and there would be very much more dissatisfaction in the presentation of the Estimates under these circumstances, than there could possibly be under the present system.  I think if we study the footnotes and recognise that all the information regarding expenditure <Col N="873" /> under other Votes is indicated under the Vote in question, we should be satisfied that all the facts are presented.</P>
    <P>On the question of the method of the presentation of the accounts, it has been recognised as essential, that before there is any departure from the method of presentation, the Minister for Finance shall notify or approach the Committee of Public Accounts and get their sanction for any change in the method of presentation.  I think if there is any real wish on the part of Deputies that there should be a change in that matter, it might be no harm if they would make themselves acquainted with the practice that has been outlined in some of the previous reports, and also make representation to that Committee as to what they think is worth considering in respect of the change of form of presentation.  I would seriously ask Deputies to consider the unwisdom of the suggestion that the respective Ministers should be made responsible for the Vote under Public Works and Buildings.  I think it would defeat the ends they are seeking and cause very much more difficulty for Deputies than the present system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think also that any change in the system of accounting for the receipts of the film censor's office as an appropriation-in-aid, would defeat the objects of the House, because you would have to provide the service and you would be providing that service although it would not appear in the estimate of expenditure.  It is much preferable to show the receipts amongst the non-tax revenue miscellaneous items.</P>

      <P>I am dealing <Col N="874" /> with the questions of appropriations-in-aid. I do not know if this is the stage to deal with the general aspect of the accounts, but it seems to me that something in the nature of a revision, or an inquiry into the system of accounting, would be advisable.  I would suggest that each Estimate ought to show&mdash;and I differ from Deputy Johnson in that respect&mdash;the actual portion of the expenses which should be debited to that account, such as office equipment and office furniture.  It might possibly be done by way of showing a capital account at the beginning of the account and showing a capital balance on the other side at the end of the account.</P>
      <P>That would show us the account as a business account, with the appropriations-in-aid duly credited.  I throw that out as a suggestion, although it is not a very deeply considered suggestion. The accounts as given to us are difficult to understand.  On this account for the Department of Justice we have a statement showing the different amounts for rates, office accommodation, and other things of that kind. But in connection with the film censorship there are separate items which are not shown in that account.  That is the items given in the foot-note on page 106 are not shown in the additional figures given at the end of Vote 31.</P>
      <P>In regard to the appropriations-in-aid, we have seen from the statement by the Minister for Finance that there is no standardised or regular method of showing these.  In some cases they are shown, and in other cases they are not.  I think the appropriations-in-aid ought to be regarded as the earnings of any particular Department and shown as such.</P>

We have a sum of £1,500 shown there as an appropriation-in-aid in regard to the <Col N="875" /> services rendered by the police.  I cannot see that there is any particular difference between the earnings of the film censorship and the earnings of the police.  There is a distinct necessity for clarification of the accounts and for presenting them to the Dáil in a manner in which they can be easily understood. I suggest that the time has come for some kind of an inquiry into a new system of presenting the accounts. The fact that a certain system has prevailed in the past is no justification for its continuance, and we ought to consider the possibility of a change which would make them more easily understandable.</P>

There are Deputies who think a system should be devised which would enable them to get over the necessity for reading.  In connection with appropriations-in-aid, I admit that a further examination is necessary.  As a matter of fact, the Public Accounts Committee indicated that we should wait until we had more experience in connection with appropriations-in-aid before taking decisions in the matter.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister tell me why £580 for office accommodation in connection with the film censorship appears as a foot-note at the end of the page, whereas other office accommodation in connection with the Department of Justice appears on page 104 among &ldquo;estimated amounts included in other estimates in connection with this service&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>I think the reason is that film censorship is a distinct and self-supporting service and there was the desire to show it as a separate item, so that Deputies would be in a position to see that there was no question of revenue accruing as a result of that service.  If it were simply bulked generally with the other branches of the Department in the matter of its allied services, that would not be so apparent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice to-day that I would raise, on the adjournment, the question of the method of the appointment of a teacher in the Rathbarry <Col N="877" /> National School, in the Co. Cork.  On the face of it, perhaps the matter would be a small one, and it might be considered stretching my privileges as a Deputy to be raising it on the adjournment.  But the principle involved is very important, and that is my excuse for raising it.  It is a fact that there is a rule adopted by the Department of Education in regard to the appointment of teachers as principals of schools.  That rule is that in schools with an attendance ranging from 50 to 90 the teacher appointed as principal must have five years' efficient service and experience, and that rule was adopted by the Department of Education as a result of representations made to them by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  This is a rule that has been much appreciated by the I.N.T.O., as it affords the teachers very considerable protection.  I may state that I have no personal reasons for raising this matter.  I am simply concerned with the principle underlying the rule, and I may mention I am bringing the matter forward at the request of the teachers and their organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are briefly as follows:&mdash;In June, 1925, the teacher who taught in this school, resigned.  A new teacher was afterwards appointed, subject to sanction from the Department of Education. From the documents before me here, and from the Minister's reply to-day, the attitude of the Department, as I understand it, is that exceptional circumstances prevailed, and led to the sanction of this appointment by the Department of Education.  Now the excuse is that exceptional circumstances prevailed.  My case is that there were no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, and in support of that argument I quote the fact that the average attendance in that school for the year in which the appointment was made, 1925, was higher than in any year for the previous twenty-one years, except one.  For the period ending 30th June, 1925, the average was 70.4, with 98 pupils on the roll.  The average for the other years compare favourably with that figure, except the year 1924.  Now it is only to be expected that as a result of the Compulsory School Attendance Bill which will <Col N="878" /> be law shortly, the average will be enhanced considerably.  The Minister stated, to-day, in reply to my question, that there were other reasons.  At least I gathered that from his reply.  I am suggesting that there were not other reasons, and that the Department of Education embarked on a very serious departure from the rule in this particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago this school was visited by an Inspector of the Department of Education who furnished a report of the case.  On the day of his visit there were 69 pupils in the school.  I thought that the natural result of this visit might be that this question would be re-opened, but it has not been re-opened so far. Hence my question, and my raising the matter now on the adjournment.  I am suggesting to the Minister that if cases like this can happen fairly often the result would be that the rule would be discarded and would be more honoured in the breach than in the observance. I do suggest to the Department that that is an unfortunate attitude.  Now the teachers value this rule very much. It affords them very considerable protection and it was inserted because of their representations and in view of the fact that sometimes when young men &mdash;very clever young men, some of them I have no doubt&mdash;came out of the Training College they were appointed principals of schools and placed over the heads of men who had been teaching for a number of years.  If departures from this rule in future are to be sanctioned by the Department of Education the results will be very serious, for you will have favouritism rampant in the making of appointments. There may be cases, and I dare say there have, in fact, been cases where the rule has been departed from in instances where efficient teachers could not be obtained.  That is very easy to understand and it is very reasonable.  But that reason does not apply and has not been made in the case of this particular appointment.  I do not wish to delay the House much longer with this matter but I would again appeal to the Minister to see that <Col N="879" /> this rule is maintained, and I would ask him to give the teachers the protection that is assured them when this rule is maintained, and I would ask him in the future to maintain that attitude.  A departure from this rule is a bad thing and it is particularly bad in view of the interest the Department of Education takes in the schools. If the rule is departed from in the future and if the agreement made between the Teachers' Organisation and the Department in the making of this rule is not to be treated as a scrap of paper then I say the proper course for the Minister is to have the case re-opened and the rule adhered to in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say just one or two words on this matter. Deputy Murphy has stressed perhaps overmuch, the fact that the observance of this rule and its adoption at first would make for the protection of the teachers.  That is not the aspect in which I would like to view the rule.  The rule was not made in the interests of the teachers.  It was made rather in the interest of efficient and sound work being done in the schools.  It was felt that a man who had just left the training college should not be put in charge of a large important school, but that they should get experience as assistants or in smaller schools before they would be put in charge of large schools.  I would like to stress the point that it should be a matter of general policy in the Department that once they came to the conclusion that a rule is a good one, that there should be as few departures from the rule as possible.  When the Minister will have more acquaintance with the practical working of his Department than he has at present, he will find that in all probability he will be pestered from many quarters asking him to depart from the rules and regulations that have been arrived at after considerable experience.  There is a kind of feeling amongst a great many people in the country, amongst the teachers to a large extent, and even amongst the managers to a larger extent, that it does not matter about a rule being there&mdash;that if you put up a <Col N="880" /> good enough fight with the Department of Education, you will get your way, and you can have the rule departed from.</P>
      <P>I would like that the Minister would adopt a different policy, and while a rule should be made as wide and as general as possible to meet the generality of cases, the departures from it should be as few as possible.  There will always be exceptional cases arising, but the Minister and his Department should, in such cases, take very great trouble in order to satisfy themselves that exceptional circumstances are in fact present before a departure is made from the rule.  I think the burden of Deputy Murphy's complaint in this particular case, and I happen to know something about it, too, is that sufficient care was not taken to see whether the conditions as to which representations were undoubtedly made, were in fact present.  I think it has turned out, from further investigation, that these conditions were not present. I could very well understand, if teachers with the experience required by the rule were not forthcoming, and if the conditions required were not present, that a case might be made for a departure from the rule.  But no such circumstances existed here, and I think it is advisable that we should have a pronouncement from the Minister on the matter.  Complaints undoubtedly do exist, that this rule, which is acknowledged by everybody to be a sound rule, has been departed from in several instances within the last 12 months or two years.  For that reason I say it would be well to have a pronouncement that the cases in which it would be departed from in the future would be very exceptional, and that exceptional circumstances should be proved fully and clearly to the satisfaction of the Department concerned before there is any such departure.</P>

      <P>I just wish to say a word in this case.  I understood from the reply of the Minister for Education to-day that it was because of representations made by the manager that this appointment was made. I have a knowledge of this parish, and I know that for the past 14 years the <Col N="881" /> population of the parish has been decreasing. Fourteen years ago the population was about 1,400.  It has dwindled down to something under 1,000 to-day.  I do not, therefore, wonder that the manager of the school made such a representation to the Department of Education.  I believe it is not a good thing to depart from the principle of the rules, but I would like to have it made clear that the representations made by the manager were absolutely correct.  I think it speaks well for the efficiency of the teacher that the average attendance at the school has gone up since the appointment of the new teacher there a year ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand that.  I indicated in my reply to-day that the manager did not merely state that there was every probability of a decline in the attendance of pupils at this school in the future, and that that might be expected, but he also brought forward a number of reasons in support of that.  I referred incidentally to these to-day.  One is the particular reason now referred to by Deputy O'Donovan.  But there are a number of other reasons, and some of these reasons actually did operate, though it must be confessed&mdash;and here Deputy Murphy is on sound ground&mdash; with by no means the result expected, or at least to the extent expected.  Undoubtedly the attendance was expected to fall below 50, but it did not fall below 50.  The reasons put up for that seemed quite convincing and plausible. One was that already referred to, and the other was the fact the manager of the school called attention to.  In this he was borne out afterwards.  Several months after the appointment we sent down, in connection with another appointment in the same school, one of our inspectors who held the special inspection referred to by Deputy Murphy.  There was a lower birth rate <Col N="882" /> in that parish and there was also the fact that the attendance at the school had been kept up, as I might call it, artificially, owing to the fact that Confirmation in that particular school had been continuously postponed for reasons which people in the diocese of Ross are familiar with.  Therefore, the number of pupils had been kept on beyond the normal time.  It was expected that for these reasons, and owing to the closing up of the Bartyes mines and the evacuation of the coast-guard station, that the attendance would be adversely affected.  In most of the years between 1914 and 1919 the average attendance was under 50.  It was expected, and there were reasonable grounds for expecting, that it would again fall below 50.  It was on these grounds that the Department fell in with the manager's suggestion, that the teacher who was in the school might be promoted to the principalship. That is so far as the post is concerned.</P>
      <P>The school cannot, according to the Inspector, be described as one of the most important and largest in South Cork.  It is a school that, on the whole, in the future will have to struggle to keep the attendance up to 50.  Apart from the School Attendance Act I think there is no reason why it should not be kept up to 50.  That is as regards the past.  As to the future, I cannot see we can re-open the case. The teacher was sanctioned and duly appointed.  That being so, I think it would be inadvisable, and would raise many more serious problems than have now been raised, if we were trying to solve the difficulty by re-opening the whole question again, and practically dismissing the teacher, or at least removing him from that particular position. I think that is out of the question. Another matter is, I think, the rules should be kept as much as possible. Circumstances will arise where departure may be necessary, but I hope the circumstances will seldom arise.  I think, on the whole, our observance of the rules is becoming better year by year, and compares very favourably with the observance of these rules by the previous Commissioners.</P>
