      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there are very considerable discrepancies between the figures for exports into Northern Ireland from the Free State as furnished by the Northern Government in their Year Book for 1924 and the figures for exports from the Saorstát into Northern Ireland for the same year as furnished by the Statistics Branch of his Department, and if he can give any explanation of these discrepancies.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistics issued by my Department accurately represent the value of the exports from the Free State into Northern Ireland, and I can, therefore, only suggest an explanation of the difference in the figures issued by the Northern Government.  The Northern Ireland Year Book refers to the value of the trade across the land boundary.  I think therefore, that the difference was probably due to the inclusion in the Northern Government's figures of trade which merely passed through Northern Ireland on its way to Great Britain. My Department records show that in 1924 over two million pounds worth of exports were consigned from the Free State to Great Britain via Northern Ireland.  These exports appear correctly in our statistics as consigned to Great Britain and not to Northern Ireland. The Deputy may rest assured that our Trade Statistics are the more precise and comprehensive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Northern Ireland Year Book will have a considerable circulation in newspaper offices and elsewhere and will be uncorrected by our figures?  Will the Minister also <Col N="1693" /> consider using his powers under the Statistics Act to issue a Year Book for Saorstát Eireann?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be considered, but I do not know that there is much good in issuing information of that sort to newspapers which might simply say that the Free State's statistics are unreliable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister get into communication with the Northern Ireland Statistical Department and see if some explanation could not be furnished for such divergency of figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion is founded on the fact that their trade is described as trade across the land frontier.  Our statistics deal with our trade to various people.  The Northern Ireland people might say that there is no discrepancy but that there is a difference in description.</P>

This £2,000 was lodged in April, 1924, and the Land Commission made an offer to purchase the estate, but possession of it was not obtained by the Land Commission until July, 1925.  The owner's agents wrote several letters to the Land Commission in connection with the arrears due to the owner by the Committee and the Commissioners communicated with the Committee and, being satisfied that the amount claimed was due by the Committee and that the Committee had not funds to meet the demand, issued to the agents on the 23rd instant, out of the money lodged by the Committee, a pay order in favour of the owner for the amount due.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he will state on what grounds the application of Mrs. Julia Cooney, of Clonmaine, Donaskeigh, for an allotment of land on the Scully estate near Donaskeigh was not granted; if he is aware that Mrs. Cooney is a near representative of a tenant who was evicted from this property; that Mrs. Cooney has two sons who are competent to work the land if they received a grant of land and that they are in a position to provide the capital required, and whether he will see that Mrs. Cooney's application receives careful consideration when other lands in the county are being divided.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he will state the policy of the Land Commission in regard to the granting of land to workers on estates which are being divided; if the possession of capital by these workers is regarded as a sine qua non before a grant of land will be made, and if he is aware that many workers are not in a position to provide such capital, and whether there is any fund available from which money can be provided for the purpose of supplying working capital to such men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In the distribution of lands by the Land Commission due regard is had to labourers living on the lands whom the Land Commission consider competent to work lands.  The Land Act provides that the Land Commission in making allotments must be satisfied that a proposed allottee is competent to work land and that it is his intention to do so and not to sell, let, or assign it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possession of capital is not a sine qua non but is obviously a very important <Col N="1699" /> element that must be taken into account when considering the suitability of a proposed allottee.  The Land Commission have no funds out of which a loan could be made for the purchase of stock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that it is only in very rare cases workers on estates that are being divided are in possession of capital? In the carrying out of the provisions of the Land Act in regard to the establishment of such men in holdings, is it the intention to make provision in the way of capital for these men?  Is the Minister aware that false statements may be made to the Land Commission by these men in an effort to suggest they possess capital which in reality they do not possess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Land Commission give a holding to an agricultural labourer they can be quite certain that he knows how to work the land, because he is a competent agricultural labourer.  They give him a holding, they build a house for him and make up the fences.  He has that free.  A labourer who gets an economic holding has five hundred or six hundred pounds' worth of property fit to be worked straight away.  In addition, he has what he always had, the ability to work elsewhere until he gets a certain amount of capital that will help him to stock the land.  Capital is important; but you can regard the labourer having three or four sons willing to work as being in possession of capital, even though that capital is not money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be surprised if the inspectors took the view that capital is essential.  It is important, but it is not essential.

    <Title>STREET TRADING BILL, 1925&mdash;FROM THE SEANAD.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad to the Street Trading Bill, 1925.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to ask the Committee to accept all the amendments that have been made to this Bill by the Seanad.  They were, in fact, amendments put forward at my own request in the Seanad.  The first amendment was inserted because there was some doubt as to whether the original definition of the Council of the County Borough of Dublin would include the Commissioners.  This amendment was introduced to make it clear that the powers vested in the Corporation under the Act would apply to and be exercisable by the Commissioners. The second amendment deletes the words &ldquo;residing in the City of Dublin&rdquo; from sub-section (1), Section 3.  It was thought the restriction in the granting of a street trader's certificate to a person residing in the City of Dublin might entail hardship to persons engaged in street trading, as it has been ascertained that many of the street traders reside outside the city bounds.  This amendment is introduced to remove the residence qualification for the purpose of obtaining a street trader's certificate.  The effect of the third amendment is to make it discretionary for the Corporation to grant a stall trader's licence.  Under the Bill it was mandatory to grant such a licence to every holder of a street trader's certificate.  Representations were made as to the necessity for allowing discretion in the matter, and it was thought reasonable to do so. The fourth amendment has the effect of protecting street traders from proceedings for selling elsewhere than in a market after the market has been opened.  This protection has already been given to hawkers and pedlars, and as a street trader will carry on business in the street it is considered that <Col N="1704" /> he should be protected.  I beg to move the acceptance of these amendments:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  In Section 1, line 31, after the word &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; the following words inserted: &ldquo;and includes any person in whom the powers and duties of that Council are for the time being vested.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>2.  In Section 3 (1), line 26, the words &ldquo;residing in the City of Dublin&rdquo; deleted.</P>
      <P>3.  In Section 4 (1), line 65, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; deleted and the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
      <P>4.  In Section 12 (1), line 8, after the word &ldquo;right&rdquo; the following words inserted: &ldquo;or brought under the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;To reduce the Vote on Account by £2,685,048.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Heffernan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred yesterday evening to the salaries paid to certain officers in the Saorstát, the rates paid <Col N="1705" /> here before the establishment of the Saorstát, and the rates paid elsewhere. I did not refer to judicial salaries, but they are worthy of note.  Before the establishment of the Saorstát there were in Ireland judges at considerably higher rates than are paid now.  There were then two Judges of Appeal at salaries of £4,000 a year; a Lord Chancellor at a salary of £6,000; a Master of the Rolls at £4,000; two Chancery Judges at a salary of £3,500 each; a Lord Chief Justice at £5,000, and six King's Bench Judges at £3,500 each. At the present time in Northern Ireland there is a Chief Justice with a salary of £5,000 a year; two judges with salaries of £4,000, and two with salaries of £3,500.  Here we have a Chief Justice with a salary of £4,000; three judges with salaries of £3,000, and five with salaries of £2,500.  In Northern Ireland there are five judges with salaries of more than £3,000; we have only one judge with a salary exceeding £3,000.  Of course the area is much larger and the jurisdiction and status of the courts are greater.</P>
      <P>In the matter of police the same thing applies.  Although the Gárda Síochána are not an armed police force they really do discharge all the ordinary duties formerly discharged by the R.I.C. and the duties that are discharged by the R.U.C. at the present time.  The pay of a sergeant in the R.U.C. ranges from 100/- to 112/6 per week.  The highest pay for a sergeant in the Gárda Síochána is 98/6; it ranges to that figure from 97/-.  In the same way a Gárda at the top of the scale would have 83/- a week, as against 95/- for a constable of the R.U.C.  We have there, as all through, shown our appreciation of the fact that this State must live on a more modest scale of expenditure than obtained hitherto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to national teachers there was a reduction of ten per cent. in salary.  So far, a reduction has not been put into effect in Northern Ireland. There was a cut made there lately, but it was not a cut to the same extent as here.  When that ten per cent. cut was put into effect, I was of opinion, having regard to the very sharp rise in the pay of national teachers before, <Col N="1706" /> that a further cut might be made, perhaps another five per cent.  On going further into the matter, it became clear to me that the position at the present time is that suitable candidates are not forthcoming for training in sufficient numbers.  We have had to allow people into the training colleges for training as teachers who would not have been deemed fit if better candidates could have been obtained.  These were people who were not up to the standard that the Department of Education thought requisite.  Any further reductions in salary would have had the effect of further limiting the number of candidates forthcoming, and we would have been obliged to fill up our teaching profession to a still greater extent with people who were not up to the standard of education and ability considered necessary.  It seemed to me that that would have been clearly pursuing a line of false economy.  If we are to have an educational system, we must aim at having competent people to carry out the work.  Since we are spending nearly four and a half million pounds on education, it would be no saving to the nation to economise so that we would not get that education well run and conducted by people fully competent to discharge the duties cast upon them.  There is no doubt that the sharp increase in teachers' salaries is one of the factors which cause the figures of the Free State to seem unduly high, compared with the pre-war figures, if you separate the Free State portion of Irish expenditure. In 1914-15 the Free State proportion of national teachers' salaries was about £1,020,000; in 1919-20, when certain increases had been given, it was £1,934,000; in 1920-21 it was £2,714,000; in 1921-22 it was £2,877,000; in 1922-23&mdash;the first year of the Free State's existence&mdash;it was £3,545,000; in 1923-24 the amount was somewhat down, because the ten per cent. cut took partial effect in that year, the figure being £3,467,000.  It would have been above the previous year's figure of £3,545,000 but for that cut.  In the year 1924-25 the ten per cent. cut operated fully and the amount payable for teachers' salaries was £3,229,000.  The Estimate for 1925-26 <Col N="1707" /> contained some provision in respect of the Christian Brothers' schools and it amounted to £3,281,000.  The Estimates for the coming year&mdash;1926-27&mdash;amount to £3,325,000.  That includes full provision for the Christian Brothers' schools, which are coming under the national system.  If the cut had not been carried out, the sum to be provided would have been well over £3,600,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think the present teachers did very well with the increases they got.  They certainly are better paid than they had any reasonable expectation of being when they entered upon their profession.  But what we ought to have regard to is value for money, and one does not get value for money if suitable people are not employed.  There is no use in taking the view of the most uninformed people in the country, who think it does not matter what sort of a return you get provided your outlay is extremely small.  In this matter the aspect I have emphasised is very important. It would probably be no use at all to have a widespread system, such as we have, at, perhaps, half the present cost, if we had inefficient people operating it all over.  It might be better even to take the advice of those people who want drastic economy and say that the education of children is a matter for the parents and should be left to them.  I have given a great deal of consideration personally to this question of teachers' salaries, and I am fully convinced that we would not get what this country needs, better education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter. We would not get economy in any true sense by further reduction of the teachers' salaries.  We may do various things to get better value for the money spent, but I think the Dáil is of one mind, that better and more education is one of the requirements of the country.  The view of the Dáil in relation to the Compulsory School Attendance Act, when it was before it, indicates that.  The Compulsory Attendance Act will undoubtedly involve a fairly substantial increase in expenditure.  There is absolutely no way of getting out of that.  Certain economies can be effected, and to some extent have been effected&mdash;for instance, by the amalgamation of schools. Further, economies may be effected in that direction, but I do not believe that economies can be effected which will offset the additional cost arising out of the enactment of the Compulsory Attendance Act.</P>
      <P>Yesterday evening I referred briefly to the question of superannuation of the people who went out as a result of the Treaty.  So far as those who went out are concerned, the Government has absolutely no responsibility.  We did everything to induce them to continue to serve and not simply go out and draw pensions.  We treated all transferred civil servants and members of the D.M.P. with every consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No; we discharged them.  But they do not come within the classes I mentioned&mdash;the D.M.P. and those who resigned.  So far as the people who resigned are concerned, that was a matter over which we had absolutely no control.  There were people who went because they did not care to remain in our service.  There were people who went because the increased pension seemed attractive to them and they thought they could get other opportunities of employment. Other people went because they feared <Col N="1709" /> that later on they would be penalised. Others were panicky.  A lot of irresponsible talk went on in various quarters which alarmed them and they went out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the question of issuing a statement that it is not the Government's policy to interfere in any way with the salaries and conditions of transferred Civil Servants?  If the Minister would do that it would have a reassuring effect and it would be good Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Norton asks is quite well known&mdash;that we are out to fulfil our Treaty obligations in the letter and in the spirit in respect of Civil Servants as well as in other respects. I think that is fairly well understood and it requires no assurance by circular.  If an assurance is of any use, it is an assurance of the character I give now, because I think that if I took the line suggested by Deputy Norton it would be an entirely wrong line.  I do say that the sort of thoughtless talk that we hear sometimes is bound always to have an unsettling effect.  When Deputy Gorey, for instance&mdash;without meaning it to have this effect&mdash;talks about a 10 per cent. cut all round, and leaves the impression that 10 per cent. will be taken off people who are secured a certain salary by the Treaty, his statement has an unsettling effect because it is accepted as serious and deliberate.  It tends to induce certain people to go out, take their pensions and be sure.  Nothing at all is to be gained except by making it absolutely clear that in respect of Civil Servants who have Treaty rights, as in respect of everything else to which we are bound by the Treaty, we intend to carry out our obligations in the letter and in the spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the discharges, first come the resident magistrates.  There was no option but to discharge them. There were, perhaps, a few amongst them who were unobjectionable from every point of view.  I certainly knew one.  As a matter of fact, I actually signed his letter of discharge.  I was assisting Mr. Duggan, in the Department of Home Affairs, at the time, and <Col N="1710" /> I signed the letters of discharge to the resident magistrates.  There was one man whom I would like to have kept, but the position was this: There was no civil organisation in the country. We were sending the Gárda Síochána out through the country.  We could not send them out except they had courts, which were fairly acceptable to the people, before whom to bring offenders.  I remember the Government deliberated very seriously as to whether they would risk sending the Gárda Síochána out without arms.  At an earlier stage, the Gárdaí had been in camp, armed with rifles, very much like the R.I.C..  The Government decided that they should go out as an unarmed force, but it was after very great hesitation that we came to that decision.  We did not know whether they would not be driven back or whether their position would not be made impossible.  If they had begun to arrest people and bring them before the old resident magistrates, their position would have been impossible.  We could not have got any sort of civilian force to operate successfully through the country and the conditions of chaos and turmoil would have continued longer and would have cost immensely more than the amount that falls upon us through the discharge of the resident magistrates.</P>
    <P>Some of the discharges of the Dublin metropolitan magistrates took place through the setting up of the new district court system, and little remark is called for in that respect.  No remark is called for in regard to the discharge of the Under-Secretary.  He was an officer for whom there was no place in the new system.  If he had been continued, he would have to be paid a salary substantially in excess of the pension he is receiving.  Two D.M.P. Commissioners were discharged. They had to be discharged.  It would have been impossible to secure satisfactory working of the police system without making that change.  There were nine Local Government inspectors and officials discharged.  Again, I was the Minister primarily concerned in some of these discharges.  Some of them were officers for whom work could not be found under the new <Col N="1711" /> system.  For instance, there was Mr. Charles O'Conor, a Commissioner. He was a man whom we were very anxious to employ, and we did make offers of other employment to him, but they were not offers he was willing to accept or bound to accept.  He chose not to accept them.  On the other hand, it was not possible, in the new organisation, to employ him on Local Government work, and he had to be discharged. As regards the others who had been members of the old Board, the Provisional Government was up against the question of getting the local authorities of the country to recognise their Government and not take part in the Irregular campaign.  Some of these officials were like Jonah&mdash; they had to be heaved overboard.  We heaved them overboard, because we had to keep the local authorities in hand. Any expenditure that that involved I have no hesitation in saying was good expenditure, and to whatever extent we did swell the superannuation list in that way we were wise in so doing, and we could not have done otherwise in the circumstances.  In regard to the discharge of the petty sessions clerks, practically the same thing applies. The new district courts had to be made acceptable to the people in a state of public opinion which was very touchy, and it would have been impossible, even with the replacement of the resident magistrates by the new district justices, to have had the new courts function if we had continued the petty sessions clerks or the Crown solicitors. There was absolutely no way at all of restoring the civil power through the country but by making a clean sweep in this direction, and I certainly think that if the Government had failed to do it in any niggling spirit of saving some £48,000&mdash;or, as regards these courts, some £32,000 per annum&mdash;they would have followed an unwise course.</P>
    <P>A couple of months' prolongation of the civil struggle would have cost a great deal more than the capital value of these superannuations.  The Crown solicitors were discharged for the same reasons as I have given, but they were not paid pensions; they were entitled to gratuities which amounted to <Col N="1712" /> £22,000 odd.  In the matter of engagement of new staffs the Government has pursued a line which I think has seldom been pursued before by a Government in circumstances that were at all similar.  We proceeded to divest ourselves as soon as we could and as fully as we could of power of patronage. Very few people were employed who became permanent civil servants for reasons that arose out of the previous struggle.  There were altogether 240 special certifications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>In all sorts of Departments. Of these, some 89 were really special certifications.  There were 53 posts of a professional or technical character which were filled by selection boards.  These were ordinary appointments and did not come into the category I am dealing with.  There were thirty-six others, five of which were cases where an official was already in the service and was promoted exceptionally because of special qualifications. There were 31 appointments that were made before the Civil Service Commissioners and their selection board machinery came into being.  Of the five special promotions, there was a draftsman in the Post Office, a copyist in the Public Record Office, a sorting clerk and telegraphist, and a telephonist. There were long service certifications of twelve people.  These were people who had considerable service and to whom promises of establishment had been given by the British authorities, and these promises were honoured by our Civil Service Commission.</P>

    <P>We had 32 cases of civil servants transferred from the British and Northern Governments.  Then we had 92 cases of certification where people were transferred from the Congested Districts Board to the Land Commission. When the Congested Districts Board was being abolished and the staff and work was being transferred to the Land Commission it was promised in the Dáil that those permanent officials of the Congested Districts Board who were taken over would be established.  Then there were nine cases of reinstatement of persons victimised whose cases were not covered by our <Col N="1713" /> Superannuation Act.  Some of them were people who were late.  One was a woman who had been in the Civil Service, who had married and resigned, but who became a widow and was certified back.  Then there were six certifications in the public interest. There were simply six people the grounds for whose certification were services of a public nature or, if you like to call it, as it was to some extent, a political nature, but not political in the ordinary party sense.  They were services of a definitely specific character. There were simply these six certifications, and of the others who have become established by this method, there were just thirty-one who were appointed before the Civil Service Commission and the Selection Board machinery came into being.  Just so far as there was an exercise of patronage by the Government these thirty-one people represent the exercise of patronage that the Government has indulged in, and as a matter of fact I do not know whether any of them were cases of an exercise of patronage.  I know of some of the appointments and I know that they were made absolutely without any sort of personal interest in individuals.  We had people like the Roads Inspector of the Local Government Department and the Secretary of the Central Savings Committee.  The latter was a temporary British civil servant who had experience in dealing with savings certificates, but being a temporary British civil servant he was not transferred in the ordinary way and therefore he had to be specially dealt with.  There were a certain number of young university men who were taken in and who were employed in various offices quite early in the life of the Provisional Government, and it was felt that they had proved their value when they had been three or four years at work, and that after that time they were not in a position to compete on any sort of fair basis in an examination with men who were fresh from their classes.  It was therefore felt that in fairness they should be certified.  Then there was the Director of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1714" /> I do not think that any of the thirty-one appointments could be described as patronage appointments in any sense that could be held to be at all objectionable. As a matter of fact, if all appointments were to be made on the basis on which these appointments were made they could not be objected to at all on the grounds of patronage.  In addition to the cases I have mentioned there were certain members of the Oireachtas staff, the clerk and the assistant clerk, principal clerk, ushers and reporters of the Oireachtas staff. In general, at any rate, the position is that so far as this Government was concerned it might be said, broadly, that there was no exercise of patronage, there was no filling of public offices with the personal or political friends of Ministers.  Certain people who had given exceptional services, who had made exceptional sacrifices during the struggle for national freedom, were specially brought into the public service, but the number was infinitesimal. As regards temporary servants, every effort was made when temporary staffs were being recruited to give preference to men who had given service in the I.R.A. and in the National Army, and up to the present, so far as temporary staffs are concerned, appointments have been practically, if not entirely, confined to National Army men.  That, however, it is fully recognised, is a condition of affairs that must change; one cannot for all time regard National Army service as giving exclusive rights to temporary employment. But when suggestions are made frequently throughout the country of public appointments being made of friends of the Government and of friends of individual members of the Government, I certainly have no hesitation whatever in saying that these accusations are baseless.</P>
    <P>We tried to get rid of the patronage element altogether.  We got rid of it partly because the power of patronage with a Minister who wants to do his work in any kind of reasonable way is a hateful burden.  Certainly there is nothing that gives more annoyance and more trouble to a Minister and causes <Col N="1715" /> him to make more enemies than to have the power of patronage.  Self-defence was one of the reasons why Ministers took steps as early as possible to get rid of power in relation to appointments. Another reason was because they recognised that the best interests demanded it, that considerations of qualifications and fitness would inevitably come in, that they must come in to some extent in almost all cases, no matter what efforts were made to keep them out, and we dealt with that through provisions in the Civil Service Regulation Act which were fairly rigid. They are much more rigid than the British Order in Council, on which the Civil Service Regulation Act was based, and they have been rigidly administered. There is no comparison at all between the administration of the Civil Service Regulation Act here and the administration of the system that exists in England under the Order in Council. We have done that, not because of political pressure, not because of outside pressure, but against outside pressure. Politically it would have been a great deal easier, it would have been yielding to political pressure, if the Government did not close the door to patronage as it did.</P>
    <P>You would find all sorts of people who, perhaps, in the abstract were in favour of competition and of impartial appointments, but who would have hopes that, if some other system existed, it might suit them, and for that reason would favour it.  I certainly am aware of this, that it was no sort of reluctant yielding to outside clamour that caused us to take the line we have taken in this respect, but that on the contrary there had to be some exercise of strength of will to do exactly as we have done.  This is a new country, a country full of suspicion, because it was recently an enslaved country, full of envy, jealousy and malice, and it is well, even though those lies go abroad and have no foundation, to refer to them again because credence may be given to them if there is no contradiction.  I say here, as elsewhere, that we have given full consideration to the question of getting good value for public money, and of reducing expenditure as far as it can <Col N="1716" /> possibly be done.  We have not created posts for people and have not put incompetent people into posts.  As soon as we could set up other machinery we got away from the use of personal discretion or personal intervention in the filling of posts.</P>
    <P>Since the setting up of the Free State there have been certain increases in staff.  There are new duties to be performed because new departments have been set up.  A department like the Department of Finance represents, very largely, a new department here. A great deal of the work that was done in the Treasury in London under the old regime has to be done here now. We have work to do in connection with the Army that was not done here under the old regime.  There were a great many troops here before the Free State was set up, but the administrative work in connection with them was done in the War Office in London.  That work has now to be done here.  The setting up of a separate fiscal system and of a separate customs entity also led to a great increase in work.  The customs staff had to be greatly increased even before the imposition of the protective duties because the customs revenue of Ireland was collected in the past in Great Britain.  The goods were shipped coastwise from Great Britain here, and almost all the goods that came into the country, before the setting up of the Free State, came from Great Britain, and no customs intervention was required. Therefore, the setting up of a separate customs entity led to a great increase in the customs staff here.</P>
    <P>The experimental protectionist policy which we have entered on has, of course, added to that considerably. Even in the matter of income tax, additional work has to be done here. Before the setting up of the Free State, the super-tax end of the work was done in London and not in Dublin, so that even where a substantial portion of the service was done here in the past all the charges in connection with it did not appear on the Irish Vote.  The same thing happened in relation to the Stationery Office.  The Stationery Office that was here in the past was simply a distributing branch <Col N="1717" /> of the London office.  The Stationery Office we have discharges all sorts of duties in regard to ordering supplies, dealing with contractors, checking accounts and doing work that was not previously done here.  Under the old regime, forms and printed matter were simply supplied in bulk to the Irish branch of the Stationery Office.  The Exchequer and Audit Office is a new service here.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General's Office, even so far as it discharged duties relating to Ireland, did not appear on the Irish Vote in the past.</P>
    <P>A great deal of additional work has been caused by new legislation.  The Land Act has caused a great increase in the staff of the Land Commission. The Department of Agriculture has had new duties thrown upon it by recent legislation.  The Board of Works has had new duties thrown upon it by the Drainage Acts, both the Drainage Maintenance Act and the Arterial Drainage Act of last year.  Both of these measures are already reflected in increased staffs in the Board of Works. If all those new duties are to be carried out staffs must be employed.  If the Arterial Drainage Act, for which there was a clamour from all quarters in the past, is to be carried out, then a staff must be provided.  In connection with that measure, as with others, the taking on of those new services has been reflected in increased cost.  Temporary work of all sorts has been a very heavy burden on the administration.  There was special work in regard to compensation and in regard to the Army, when it was much bigger than it is to-day. There is special work being done at present in relation to Army pensions. Nobody can simply take the figures of 1914 and the figures of the present-day cost of administration and, without looking behind the figures to see what they represent, find a comparison.  Regard must be had to what is being done &mdash;to all the work that falls on the Government of the Free State that did not fall on the Irish Votes under the British system.  It should also be remembered that with a Government, as with business, the smaller unit must inevitably have higher overhead charges. If it is very small like, say, the Island <Col N="1718" /> of Jersey, then it may be worked as a man works a shop with his own family without any charge.  I believe they have unpaid police and unpaid judges in the Island of Jersey.  But once it gets beyond that stage then its overhead charges will be higher than in the case of a bigger unit.</P>
    <P>If we try to tighten up administration and reduce costs it can be done in only one way.  It is done by the cooperation of the heads of various departments, and their Ministers, with the Officers of the Department of Finance, who are dealing with the matter; but it cannot be done except on a basis of good faith and with an interest in the public welfare.  If you had a head of a department who did not realise his responsibilities, who was desirous of concealing waste and wanted to maintain inefficiency, there would be only one way of dealing with the situation, and that would be to remove the head of the department and replace him by somebody who had a better sense of his responsibilities.  But if he was allowed to remain there, it would be impossible for the officials of the Department of Finance, just as it would be impossible for your Geddes Committee or your outside experts, to deal with the situation in that office. If a man set out to fool you, if the heads and the responsible officials in a department set out to fool anybody, they certainly could do it for a certain length of time, but they would be eventually found out and could be disposed of.  But nobody who has been in touch with public officials or who knows anything at all about the situation will suggest that there is not good faith and not zeal for the public interest amongst these civil servants.  I think anybody making a suggestion to the contrary simply brands himself as being a man who either is ignorant or who is unable to understand facts when he sees them and whose opinion is of no value whatever.</P>
    <P>I do not want to harp too much on what I regard as a silly suggestion about a Geddes Committee, but as I am on that point I will mention it again. All sorts of people talk about such a committee, but they have very different views about what should be done.  Some <Col N="1719" /> want experienced retired civil servants to come in and do the work.  I do not suppose it would be in order to talk about dead-heads or anything like that, but I have every confidence that the existing civil servant will do the work better than the civil servants who have gone out on pension.  You cannot get any progress in that way.  As regards bringing business men in, even if it were agreed that they could not do anything, you could not get them.  All of us know the difficulties of getting suitable business men for committees. Everyone knows that this would be a two or a three years' job and that business men would do it badly.  Where would you get business men of the reputation and standing that would be necessary to give any weight to the final findings of such a committee who are going to spend two or three years going over the offices in the Civil Service?  You simply could not get men to do that.  As Deputy Egan pointed out the other day, a man may be very good and very efficient in one line of business, and yet be an absolute fool when you take him outside his own particular line.  It would probably be found, I think, if you did induce some people to come in, that they would give up the job before they got very far.  Even in the case of the Geddes Committee in England, there were certain things that they declined to go into.  One was the matter of civil service pay.  They found that the question was too complex and difficult and would require too much of their time, and in their report they specifically refused to go into the question of pay. They had conditions which do not exist here.  They had a big mass of Treasury proposals for reductions and economies which they simply had to take and examine. It was because of these conditions that they were able to do work of value.  There is no use in proposing certain machinery that was successful and useful in one set of circumstances to be applied to a situation where those circumstances do not exist.</P>
    <P>In regard to a committee on policy, the Geddes Committee was practically estopped from considering policy.  It was simply told that it was not to hold off from making recommendations, but <Col N="1720" /> that its business was not to deal with questions of policy at all.  As to a Committee on policy here, that, in my opinion, would be ludicrous.  It would be a confession of absolute failure and incompetence on the part of the Dáil. There may be individual matters on which it would be wise to have a Commission where you would get some sort of an expert commission and where the issues involved were complex and difficult. We had a Commission to examine the Shannon Scheme and a Commission on Banking reform.  You might, perhaps, get an expert commission which would be able to give very valuable advice and assistance to the Oireachtas, but as for getting some sort of a commission of super-men who could examine everything&mdash;universal experts&mdash;the idea is ludicrous.  It is the sort of idea that would be all right for somebody who has to reel off stuff that is readable.  It would be all right for someone down in his constituency who wanted to play up to the crowd.  I have not any objection to people reeling off these things in their speeches in the country.  People making election speeches must please their audiences.</P>

      <P>But here something serious ought to be put forward by the Farmer Deputies.  I think I never listened to a more abject exhibition than the speeches we heard from Farmer Deputies here on this.  No sort of suggestion made; unwillingness to examine anything; unwillingness to have any responsibility.  As far as I can see what was at the back of the suggestion was simply this: &ldquo;Here is a certain service which is good, but it costs money and we will not say it is good; we will not say it should be continued, but we will set up a Commission who will say it should be continued.  Then we can say we can do nothing but vote for it, because the Commission say it should be continued, and we wash our hands of it.&rdquo;  We can get no further unless there is a facing up to the facts. If we had not serious work to do that ought to be done in a serious, responsible <Col N="1721" /> way, I would say, &ldquo;Certainly, appoint a committee.  It will take up time and cost a certain amount of public money; waste the time of certain public officials; but it will stop a lot of talk, and let it go.&rdquo;  If somebody objected to the design of the Dáil carpet and wanted a committee set up, although that would take up a lot of time I would be quite willing to set up a committee, because it is not a vital matter.  But when we are dealing with a vital matter, this method of shirking the issue, of refusing to accept responsibility, to examine the question and to put forward a definite policy, of refusing to say where money should be spent or should not be spent, is not good enough.  On these grounds, I certainly would not stand for this sort of thing, because I believe it is simply putting the matter on the long finger.  It is refusing to deal seriously with a serious question. It is a matter which is entirely unworthy to be put forward seriously by any Party.  If it were put forward in the spirit in which Deputy Cooper put forward his suggestions, it would be much more reasonable.  He is prepared to make suggestions.</P>

I daresay that for the amount provided in this year's Estimates you could stop the whole scheme at the present stage. <Col N="1722" /> We could give reasonable compensation to the farmers who had sown beet and reasonable compensation to those who are undertaking the enterprise for the expenditure that they have already incurred.  Next year more money will be required for that scheme.  There is to be a total expenditure of £2,000,000 and if Deputies think that expenditure should not be undertaken, they can say so, and it can be stopped, perhaps, as I say, at the cost of this year's Vote. Agricultural education can be put an end to if Deputies like.</P>

I regret to see people like Deputies Gorey and Wilson, and even Deputy Baxter, led or misled by Deputy Heffernan.  Deputy Heffernan referred to the Army.  I am very clear about the Army.  We have had recently a very serious state of affairs here.  We still have arms dumped and we still have people who have arms to use.  We have had the example of one Government upset and changed.  We have had the example of another Government that found it extremely difficult to maintain its position and to assert its authority, although it had the backing of the vast majority of the people of that country.  Until that time is a little further away than it is at present, some sort of a substantial standing force is necessary.  The time will come, in my opinion, when a different and a cheaper sort of army will suffice.  But the time has not yet come for any type of militia system.  If you did that now you would certainly have before any considerable interval a most serious situation.  I am not at all in agreement with those who say that the Saorstát should have no army.</P>

I think it is absolutely necessary for the safety of the country that we should have such a military organisation <Col N="1724" /> here that in case of necessity it can be expanded; that men can be brought into it; that there will be a trained nucleus on which a bigger force can be built up; that if this country has to be substantially garrisoned in a war situation it can be garrisoned by Irish troops; and if there has to be any sort of military law that it will be military law administered by Irish officers.  As far as I am concerned, whatever Deputies may think about the cost of it, I think it is absolutely necessary for the future safety and honour of the nation that an arrangement should be made that will admit of that being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be extremely glad if the Deputy will deal with that. Not only will the size of the Army go down, as it has been going down, but if it had not been for certain circumstances it would have been down lower than it is, and it can go down.  In addition to the numbers decreasing, I have no doubt that there is a continual tightening up of administration, a continual improvement in efficiency; and I believe that in addition to decreasing numbers the actual cost per head can be brought down. The problem of reducing expenditure is, as I have said many times, one of detail, and it can only be accomplished by degrees and by continuous endeavour. It is, however, bound to be impeded, when it is not completely prevented, by the continual taking on of new services and the continual entering upon additional activities by the State.  Officials and corporations are influenced by outside events and by the atmosphere of the times.  We see, for instance, how even conservative bodies like the banks in the time of the boon, lost their heads and lent money for the <Col N="1725" /> purchase of land at prices which could never have been justified.  In the same way, if new services are being continually imposed and undertaken, if new officials have to be continually employed to administer those new services, you are not going to have the same sort of effort made for the reduction of expenditure as would be made if the Dáil and the country were really desirous of reducing expenditure.</P>
      <P>I believe that in the past two or three years there has been, in the country at any rate, absolutely no demand for a reduction of expenditure.  There has been a dislike of taxation, but the demand has been for new expenditure all along the line.  Every community was asking for something new to be done for them, or for their class.  Some of the demands were completely legitimate and proper demands which should be met, as they referred to matters which should have been done long ago. Others were demands that should not have been met.  Generally, over the country there has been a desire for decreased taxation and increased expenditure. That is an impossibility. The fact that the demand for increased expenditure exists in the country is going to have some delaying effect on getting economies, even in those particular branches of administration where everybody thinks they can be made.  The atmosphere is one of employing new people, of the State taking on new duties that will certainly delay even the lopping off of old services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we do want to get expenditure reduced, there must be some facing up to the question of new services, and Deputies of all Parties will have to take their part in that.  It ought not to be left to the Government to take all the responsibility for turning down services. It is the duty of the Government to take responsibility for turning down services, but it is also a duty that rests with Deputies, and it will have to be faced.  I do not disbelieve entirely the idea that a cure for the present position of agriculture can be got by a reduction of taxation.  Any reduction of taxation that can be made is helpful, but to what extent reductions of taxation will go down to the small farmer is a matter about which I am extremely <Col N="1726" /> doubtful.  If we take a shilling off the income tax it will mean a million a year.  That would certainly benefit the commercial, official and professional classes, and those who have money invested either here or abroad.  But as to the extent to which it would get down to the farmer, I am extremely doubtful.</P>
    <P>I believe income tax is one of the taxes which, to put it mildly, is not wholly passed on.  If a customs duty is imposed on any goods that certainly goes down to the consumer.  It is entirely passed on by the importer, but if there is any truth in the suggestion of the commercial people that high income tax does reduce the amount available for new investments it is true that income tax is not passed on, at any rate in full.  I think all the income tax-paying classes and super tax-paying classes have much less money to play with than they had in pre-war days.  That is due to the fact that these taxes are not passed on.  They are personal taxes that are not on a flat level, and I believe owing to that to a very considerable extent they cannot be passed on. If we did reduce income tax by one shilling at a cost to the Exchequer of a million pounds, while other good effects would follow from it, while other classes would be benefited by it, I do not see how the farmer would.  I do not believe that a less profit would be taken by the distributor.  I believe the distributor would not say: &ldquo;Now that we are paying less income tax we will take less profits.&rdquo;  I think he would rather say: &ldquo;Now that our means of saving are augmented we will be able to do all the things that we would wish to do, in the way of savings and re-investments.&rdquo;  I do not believe the railway freights would be reduced.  I think of that shilling the farmer, when it came down to him, would get precious little.  If we made certain reductions in the beer and spirit duties at approximately the same cost it might be very delightful for the farmer to get his porter, if he was able to afford it, at a penny less; it might be delightful for him to get his whiskey at threepence a glass.</P>
    <P>In regard to most of the taxes that do exist I do think that unless there were enormous reductions, reductions <Col N="1727" /> that there is not the slightest possibility of getting, the effect would scarcely be felt by the ordinary farmer. It would be felt&mdash;if there are any such men&mdash;by the rich farmer, the farmer with investments, it would be felt by certain small classes of farmers, but undoubtedly for the ordinary working farmer the only thing I can see that might give him benefit would be a reduction in the price of tobacco. Probably he can still afford to smoke. If he cannot, I do not see what we can do for him.  But really the general economic situation in this country demands very serious consideration.  It demands more than simply clamouring for a reduction in taxation, which, if obtained, would not effect any substantial or appreciable improvement.  Many things are wrong with the country; the country is top-heavy economically. There is no doubt that owing to the conditions&mdash;the distributive charges and distributive organisation&mdash;even of those living very poorly at the moment, the burden is too heavy for the country to bear.</P>
    <P>Farmers, like everybody else, are not perfect in the carrying out of their work; there are certain improvements that they have not taken to that they might be expected to.</P>

      <P>You have, for instance, creameries that are flourishing one year and that have gone to pieces the next year, owing to the fact, perhaps, that the manager has not been all that he should be.  We have a state of affairs arising among farmers in an area that could not arise if there was a different standard of interest, perhaps a different standard of education amongst them.  There is the fact, too, that people with money, even with every reasonable security offered, are not willing to use it for any sort of development here.  There is no doubt, for instance, that the sugar beet concession is one, if all goes well and if <Col N="1728" /> accidents do not happen, that would give very substantial profits to the owners of the factory.  There is an element of risk in it.  The farmers may have disappointing yields in some particular year; the next year they may practically refuse to grow beet, and the factory may sustain big losses, but, on the other hand, all the prospects are that good profits will be made.  People outside the country are willing to put in big sums of money, but here for a very considerable time, only that great efforts had been made, money could not be got at all.  People would not put as much into that factory, even assuming that it was a gamble, a factory which had the possibility of starting a big new industry, as they would put, without a moment's thought, on a horse.  You have people here, for instance, who can drive in luxurious motor cars to racecourses and speculate fairly substantial sums, and if it came to speculating on some industry they would not put in a penny.  That is a spirit that certainly should not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to our banking system, we had people crying out because there was a banking inquiry; they did not want anything that might turn the eyes of the banking interests on this country.  I think all classes of the community, if the conditions are to be improved, have got to try and take stock.  We have got to try and get rid of certain old prejudices and predilections, and those who dislike the Free State, either from the right or the left, have simply got to recognise that it is here and that there is no use in fighting against its existence, or against any of the implications of its existence, and that full use should be made of all the powers and opportunities that exist. The commonest attack here is an attack on Labour.  I am putting that thing about the use of money in regard to the sugar factory against it.  I certainly think that the commercial and business classes here do not realise that there are responsibilities to the country and that they have got to try to do their best to get things going.  If there is not a general recognition that new efforts have to be made, and if there is not a general recognition that there <Col N="1729" /> must be co-operation and that the thoughts of all classes must be given to it, I do not think we will get anywhere.</P>

      <P>I am not referring to any particular Deputy.  The people who simply say it is a scandal that some civil servant should have a certain salary are refusing to do anything about the matter themselves.  They are refusing to face up to it; they are simply directing attention to the people and the Government.  Reasonable attacks on the Government and a considerable measure of attacks on expenditure are all to the good, but the campaign of directing the whole attention of the people on some one thing that has to do with Government action and saying &ldquo;this is what is needed and that is what is necessary&rdquo; is the same exactly as clamouring for new Government action, and we will certainly get nowhere by it.  We have all got to face up to the question as regards expenditure.  The suggestion that I would make to Deputies, in the discussion of the Estimates, is that they should consider what services should be sacrificed.  That is in regard to services where economies could be made.  Each service cut off means the cutting off of a staff and it means perhaps that other services could be reduced and other staffs could be saved. It gives the atmosphere for the reduction <Col N="1730" /> of staff, but if you have simply new duties being thrown on, you do not get that atmosphere.  There should be serious consideration, if we want to effect economy.  It simply is not to be done, and it is treating the whole matter as a joke to say you are going to cut off hundreds or thousands of supernumeraries or unnecessary staffs, or that you are going to cut the salaries of people with Treaty rights by 10 per cent.  There are certain things which misrepresent the situation altogether, and there are certain things that cannot be done.  There are no big supernumerary staffs who are not fully employed.  In every office work comes in tides; the amount of work fluctuates. This year a particular department might be very busy; there might be demand from the public for this, that and the other thing, and in that particular branch, before the staff that is got in to do the work might be fully got rid of, there might be slackness. But continual inspection is being made by the officers of the Department of Finance.  Inquiries are being made. But one cannot take a big department and say that in any section of that department there is not anybody who is not fully occupied.  Personally, I am sure that there is nothing to be gained in that direction.  If staffs are to be got rid of, services must be got rid of and Deputies in my view had better face up to that.  The services we have are really normal peace-time services, and nobody can tell what services should be got rid of except Deputies.  Deputies have got to make up their minds.  One can talk of scores of small services, but they are all matters of policy.  It might be a waste of money to have official reporters here to have the debates in this House taken down and printed. There are Parliaments where that is not done.  But even that is a matter of policy; it is a matter for the House to decide.  It is not a matter for some sort of commission or committee.  One could, without any hesitation, mention lots of services about which there might be a question as to whether or not they should be carried on, but it is a matter of policy.  If the Government <Col N="1731" /> does not press it, it is for those who are criticising the Government to make suggestions and see if the Government is able to put up any defence for them. Putting the business over on somebody else is really too futile to talk about.</P>

The Minister not only made no defence to the case put up, but he did not even attempt to answer the arguments for the need of economy. He ignored all the facts and the economic conditions of the country.  It is said that in politics there are strange bed-fellows.  It was a humorous situation to find the Executive Council and the Opposition at one in opposing a reduction in taxation and also opposing the setting up of a committee of experts which would endeavour to put the Departments of the State on a business footing.  I hope that the country will make a note of that strange alliance. Deputy Norton told us that the need of the moment was to maintain expenditure.</P>

      <P>One could hardly criticise without thinking.  We, farmers, are not prepared to hand over blindly to others the proceeds of our labours.  That would be putting us in a position of slavery, and we will not have it.  We have roused a spirit of class consciousness amongst our people. They sent us here with positive instructions to reduce expenditure, to impress these truths on the doctrinaires, whether on the right or left, and to tell them that this poor country of small agricultural holders, more than half of whom are uneconomic and another large section of whom are on the margin line owing to continued depression, is rapidly disintegrating. The Minister for Industry and Commerce the other night made an interjection when Deputy Heffernan was speaking in reference to expenditure and estimates.  He said that expenditure did not necessarily imply that all the estimate would be expended.  I interjected: &ldquo;Then why raise money to meet an estimate which you do not propose to expend?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the report of the Committee of Public Accounts of last year there is a paragraph on over-estimating.  Paragraph 5 of the second Interim Report says: &ldquo;The discrepancy between amounts estimated for and actual expenditure, and the consequent existence of balances, raises the question of over-estimating.  The circumstances of the year under review are, to a considerable extent, responsible for this. Under more normal conditions, departments will be expected to display the greatest care in drawing up their annual estimates, as the existence of large balances must be regarded as unsound financial administration and brings with it the danger of unnecessary expenditure on the part of departments. Furthermore, excessive estimates add unduly to the difficulties of framing the annual Budget.  The Committee will always feel bound to demand explanations where it transpires that departments have sought for more money than they require.&rdquo; That, I assume, is a headline, as the Public Accounts Committee is a continuing <Col N="1733" /> committee from year to year. The meaning of that is obvious.  It means that if an inflated estimate is put in, more taxes must be levied, or you have got to make provision for loans through the banks or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Dáil should assist the Public Accounts Committee in this respect so that, so far as human foresight can go, and so far as trained minds can be brought to bear upon this problem of estimating, the Estimates must very closely approximate to expenditure. That does not mean, if something unforeseen comes along, that they would be at liberty to go ahead.  It means that the departments, from year to year, must have their plans formulated well in advance and that few of those sudden interruptions to which we are accustomed will take place.  We have been taunted that we have not put up concrete proposals.  In the first instance, that is really a question for the Government.  Let us see the difficulties in which Deputies are placed.  The same will apply to this proposed equivalent to the Geddes' Committee. You get the year's Estimates, and you see the number of persons employed in the various departments.  How can any Deputy tell from that list whether they are employed to advantage or otherwise, and whether they are giving a fair day's work?  How can he tell whether the officials have sufficient administrative experience to come to proper decisions?  You can get a business man who is accustomed to dealing with large staffs to give a rough and ready guess.  Is it not futile for the Government to be arguing that this is a question for Deputies and that the honour of the House is involved in this proposal of a Geddes' Committee?  Is it not a fact that the control by the Treasury in England over the various departments broke down during the Great War and that this Geddes' Committee was set up to assist in the restoration of that control?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>You have it the wrong way.  Control by the Treasury was suspended during the war by the instructions of business men.  Business men filled up the various Departments during the war, and when it was desired <Col N="1734" /> to restore the control of the Treasury a Committee was set up and its decisions were accepted in nearly all cases.</P>

This is a voluminous report of the Committee of Accounts, but it would well repay perusal, and I think it will effectually dispose of the President's opposition.  In this report, it is clearly demonstrated that in the first year of the work of the Departments here the Treasury had not financial control and had not that check on expenditure which normally is wanted in any country, but which, in a poor country such as this is absolutely imperative.

      <P>Two years is evidently a very long time, according to the President, in the life and financial control of a nation.  It takes years to build up a civil service and to get men with that requisite training which the service requires.  The proposal of Deputy Heffernan to have a Geddes' Committee is a perfectly sound one and the Government should not resist such a proposal.  It is perfectly natural to call in experts.  Ministers themselves have no great administrative experience, and it is questionable whether better men, men with greater <Col N="1736" /> business experience, men with wider experience of the world and of national affairs, could not more easily be found, to see whether departments are insufficiently staffed or are over-staffed, or whether the amount of work transacted necessitated the number of persons employed.  That is really what is behind Deputy Heffernan's proposal. He is endeavouring to put the thing on a businesslike footing.  We are faced with the problem of very high taxation in a very poor country, a country which, I regret to say, is becoming poorer.  There was no attempt made to answer the assertion that the country is growing poorer.  We are told that a small reduction in taxation will not benefit the people.  I am prepared to admit that the effect of a reduction in the expenditure of a Department would be scarcely felt, but does that afford any reason for the continuance of a system which is wasteful and unjustifiable? We have to draw the line somewhere.</P>
      <P>Some years back Mr. Henry Ford, when faced with a very serious financial crisis in his affairs, adopted an heroic remedy.  He endeavoured to eliminate every part of his industry which was not productive or remunerative. In a varying degree we need something of the same sort in this State.  The Government taunted us with inability to produce concrete proposals. If we put up concrete proposals will the Government act on them?  Will they favourably entertain them?  I am prepared to put forward a few proposals.  I am not prepared to make the confession that I am barren in ideas.  Take, as one instance, where economy could be effected: the travelling and subsistence allowances made in all Departments of the Civil Service. The amount involved represents a very considerable expenditure in the year.  As you are aware, civil servants, and Deputies as well, are entitled to first-class travelling expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the first-class expenses be paid out of public funds?  That is the rub.  You could easily cut travelling expenses by half.  That matter of travelling expenses for Deputies and civil servants should engage the serious attention of the Minister with a view to some remedy being provided.  Take the question of subsistence allowances.  In the Second Interim Report of the Committee of Public Accounts, under the heading of Travelling and Subsistence, the following occurs:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Under the general heading of Travelling and Subsistence Allowances, complaint is made by the Comptroller and Auditor-General that vouchers were often not supplied in connection with claims.  The Committee concurs with his remarks on the importance of doing so on all occasions.  While agreeing that, in the special circumstances of the year under review, these cases may be allowed to pass, accounting officers will, in future, be expected to include in their accounts only such claims as are properly vouched.  The Committee found that the extent to which exorbitant claims for subsistence and travelling were paid out was not very considerable.</P>
      <P>Schedules showing the rates applicable to officers in the public service in respect of travelling and subsistence were produced.  The Committee taking account of the date on which these were drawn up would suggest that, having regard to present conditions, it might be desirable that they be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like to have some statement from the Government whether this very necessary step recommended by the Committee has been acted upon. We have here in the report of the Committee of Public Accounts (Minutes of Evidence) the rates of <Col N="1738" /> subsistence allowance.  In Class A, Rate 1 (per night) is entitled to 25/-; Rate 2, 20/-; Rate 3, 15/-; Rate 4 (per day of 10 hours), 8/4.  As regards the officers to whom those rates are applicable under the general rule, the following is mentioned: &ldquo;Officers on scale rising to not less than £600 (exclusive of bonus), and temporary officers with salary of not less than £600 (inclusive).  In some cases women on scale rising above £400 (exclusive), or with salary of not less than £400 (inclusive).&rdquo;  In class B, Rate 1 is allowed 18/9; Rate 2, 15/-; Rate 3, 10/-, and Rate 4, 6/3.  The officers to whom they are applicable under the general rule are officers, not included in Class A, on scale rising above £350 (exclusive of bonus), or whose salary exceeds £200 (exclusive), and temporary officers not included in Class A whose salary is not less than £300 (inclusive). In some cases women with salary over £150 (exclusive) or over £200 (inclusive) are brought in.</P>
    <P>There are other classes but I will not trouble the House by reading details. The amounts in each class are diminished and I may say in those other classes they come to a figure that is something within reason and within the capacity of the purse of this poor State.  In Class C you have the rates varying from 12/6 down to 10/-, 7/6 and 4/2.  These are items which must be taken into consideration when it comes to a question of endeavouring to balance the Budget.  We must not press unduly upon the people and, in the circumstances, we must have regard even to trifles; we have to look to the pence.</P>
    <P>The need of a Geddes' Committee is more apparent, perhaps, in the case of the Revenue Department.  Let us see the figures that are set out in connection with the Revenue Department.  In the Secretariat there were 166 officials in 1925/26, and for the year 1926/27 we are estimating for 170.  In the office of the Special Commissioners for Income Tax we made provision for 19 officials in 1925/26 and this year we are estimating for 25.  In the Solicitor's office we made provision for 17 officials last year, and we are estimating for 21 for the ensuing year.  In the Accountant-General's <Col N="1739" /> office there were 109 officials in 1925/26, and for 1926/27 we are providing for 134.  In the Estate Duty office the respective figures are 27; there has been no change there.  In the Stamping Branch there were 48 last year, and this year we are estimating for 50.  On the Office Keeper's Staff there were 43 last year, and for 1926/27 there are 45.  For the office of the Chief Inspector of Customs and Excise the respective figures are 1,069 and 1,150.  In the office of the Chief Inspector of taxes we had 412 last year, and I notice that this year there is a decrease of 3&mdash;a miracle.  There is a decrease in staff but the salaries have gone up.</P>
    <P>The total salaries, wages and allowances for 1925/26 were £400,225, and the amount estimated for 1926/27 is £406,930.  The bonus, although there is a decrease of five points in the cost of living this year, is estimated at £175,400, and last year it was £170,190. I quite agree there were some Votes where the reduced expenditure was due to the fact that there was delay.  For instance, take the case of the Property Losses Commission, in connection with which there was a delay in the payment of claims.  But we find long established departments, the Department of Agriculture for instance, with a very large balance in 1923-24 under the heading of salaries.</P>
    <P>I would like to impress on the House the need for the most careful scrutiny of the Estimates, either by a committee such as Deputy Davin suggested or some body which will prevent charges being made on the public which are totally unwarranted in view of our economic ills.  From those Estimates we could pick out at random items where very bad estimating seems to have taken place.  That is a system that we are called upon to alter and that is an abuse that we are resolved to check.  I have instanced one item in which economy could be effected&mdash;Travelling and subsistence allowances.  I will now proceed to another, and that is a revision of the question of bonuses.</P>

      <P>May I intervene for a moment?  Deputy Connor Hogan referred <Col N="1740" /> to travelling and subsistence allowances and he has quoted the report of the Committee of Public Accounts for the last year.  I think, in the circumstances, it is necessary for me to say&mdash;because the members of the Government and the spokesmen of the Government cannot say it for themselves&mdash;that the Minister for Finance has submitted this year his comments upon that item in the report for last year.  The comments are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister has for some time held the view expressed by the Committee as to the need for revision of existing rates for travelling and subsistence. The fares for railway travelling and the rates of subsistence for officials are determined, namely, by reference to scales of pay, and the scales of pay for the various grades in the Civil Service generally have been in process of settlement and in some cases, are still under consideration. It has not, therefore, been practicable hitherto to apply a complete revision of the travelling and subsistence rates.  Modifications have, however, already been made in the rates allowed for subsistence and for the official use of privately-owned motor cars.  The subsistence rates hitherto paid included an increase of 25 per cent. granted in February, 1920.  This increase has now been withdrawn in the case of all officers whose normal basic rate is more than 10/- per night.  The mileage allowances for privately-owned motor cars and motor cycles used on official business have been reduced by amounts varying from 9 per cent. to 25 per cent. in the rates formerly authorised for the various classes of vehicle.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Public Accounts will report in a couple of weeks, but in the circumstances I think it is only fair to all concerned that the comments of the Minister should be stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pass on to another subject.  On what basis is the cost-of-living index figure arrived at?  Is it based on the prices paid in the retail shops in Dublin and the cities or even in the profiteering establishments in the small towns and villages? Or is any regard had to the market prices of food products in this country&mdash;the prices that the producer receives?  I should like to know whether that is the basis taken, allowing a reasonable margin for profit and distributing expenses?  Is the figure of <Col N="1743" /> 90 arrived at in that way or is it based on the prices in the retail shops?  This is not a small item.  Even a drop of five points means a saving of £85,000 &mdash;a sum which is not to be despised. Not alone does this affect bonus, but it affects the increments that established officers receive.  It entails a higher sum on certain scales until a certain figure is passed.  An added sum goes for bonus, so that the official really gets it both ways.  For instance, if a man has a salary of £200, he gets bonus £127 5s., so that the total amount he receives is £327 5s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the £327 5s. bonus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not time, unfortunately, to teach the Deputy addition. If this man gets an increment of £10, the bonus is based on his basic salary of £210, which, according to the scale here, is quite a considerable sum. These are questions which need to be looked into.  I contend that there is a serious demand for revision of the principle on which this cost-of-living bonus is based.  It is not fair that the country should be held responsible for the profiteering activities of some of the retail shops.  The cost-of-living index figure on which the bonus is estimated should be arrived at in some other way than on the prices obtaining in these shops.</P>
      <P>I would suggest a further economy. The estimate for wireless broadcasting amounts to £29,100.  We had a supplementary estimate introduced since Christmas for something like £14,000 or £15,000.  That brings the charge up to £44,000 or £45,000.  This service is not at the moment paying, and, even if it were paying, it is questionable whether, on grounds of higher policy, we should maintain such a service. As we are losing on this wireless service, we ought to drop it.  The fees, according to the statement of the Minister for Posts, do not come within any appreciable distance of meeting the expenditure, but the Minister said he was confident that in a few years the station would pay its way.  But we have got to have regard to those things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further big saving possible, but now we are on debatable <Col N="1744" /> ground or, perhaps, I should say on the battleground&mdash;I refer to Army pensions. In Vote 64, there is under subhead (h)&mdash;&ldquo;Military Service Pensions Act; pensions granted under section 41 of the Act of 1924, £361,300.&rdquo;  In addition, there is a Commission sitting on the claims of applicants, which costs about £5,000.  We might say, as an approximation, that this service is costing us something like £370,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit absolutely nothing of the sort.  From first to last, we did not hold with their opinions or political ideas.  If it was expedient for the State to reduce the old age pensions, I submit there is occasion and need for drastic revision of the terms of the Act under which this money becomes payable, and a drastic revision also of the principles on which the Act was based.  If we accept Deputy Lyons' contention, that we ought to make some recompense to these men, I think the sum of £370,000 is far too much in the present condition of financial stringency.  The Minister for Lands yesterday, following upon Deputy's Cooper's suggestion, challenged us as to whether we were willing or not to scrap agricultural education.  We are not willing to scrap agricultural education.  Why should we scrap it when we see provided on the noneffective votes pensions amounting to the colossal sum of £2,500,000?  Some of them, of course, are Treaty obligations that we cannot get rid of, not even by trying the expedient of jumping from the frying-pan into the fire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But why should agricultural education be penalised, the one thing on which the country can hope&mdash;it may not be a very confident hope, but it is at least a hope&mdash;to endeavour in the course of years to repair its losses and the ravages of ten years of anarchy? <Col N="1745" /> That is scarcely a fair proposition to put up.  Are we definitely to cut the productive end, and is the productive end to sustain the sacrifices which the situation demands?  I contend that that should not be asked of us.  I speak on behalf of a Party that has thought out this matter carefully, and I say that we object to non-productive expenditure, and we hold that expenditure must have some regard to the capacity of the people to pay.  But we are not making a blind, futile cry for economy at any price.  We recognise that taxation is necessary for improvement and for development, and that if money is wisely spent on agriculture &mdash;because you can throw away money on agriculture as well as on anything else&mdash;it will eventually, and even in a comparatively short time, become reproductive and return to the nation many times over.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the Board of Works Vote.  Very large sums are in this year's Estimate for the Board of Works.  We are undertaking reconstruction, mostly in the building of destroyed barracks, and there are also comparatively small sums for drainage maintenance, arterial drainage and the Owenmore drainage.  With the Barrow drainage the total would not amount to more than £100,000.  But for New Works.  Alterations and Additions, we have the colossal sum of £673,790.  I quite admit that it is necessary to put up Civic Guard barracks and that we want a police force, but there is the fact that the money sunk in those buildings is dead; it never at any time becomes reproductive in the economic sense.  From the point of view of law and order this work is desirable and necessary, but the question is whether it would not be possible. seeing that this money has to be obtained either from taxation or by loan, in view of the present circumstances to go slow with this restoration work.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is speaking with a limited knowledge of the conditions under which the Gárdaí are housed in his constituency.  There is a further point in connection with this matter.  This force is costing a good deal of money, and there is an increase in this year's Estimates in respect of it.  It is a question as to whether some change is not really desirable. You can fill the country with police and yet fail to have an observance of law and order.  I think that the statutes ought to be furbished up to deal with criminals.  I should like to see&mdash;and I make no secret of it whatsoever but wish to give it the widest possible publicity&mdash;certain parts of the Public Safety Act continued in perpetuity, or at least until there is a different frame of mind in parts of the country, even the right to intern certain undesirable characters, if there is a certain amount of evidence, not sufficient to convict them, but where there is a moral certainty that people are actually engaged in disturbing the public peace, and I claim that it would be the best system, instead of increasing the number of the Gárdaí and thereby entailing very heavy expenditure on the State.  The business and productive community can be reduced to bankruptcy and beggary through the maintenance of law and order.  I admit that it is a farfetched argument, but still in the basic sense it is true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in the cause of economy.  The Deputy should know that the safety of the people is the supreme law, and if men engaged in malpractices require the attention of a very large police force, it is just a question as to whether it would not be more expedient to intern them than to pay those police for keeping an eye on their activities.  These are but a few of the economies that could be made. Not alone can economies be effected in the services, but they can be made in borrowing.  The Government, we learned from the Minister for Finance last night, is paying something like 5¼ per cent. on money borrowed.  Seeing that the Minister for Finance is such a very great and wise man, why does he not try to get revenue by other methods?  It is true that he has Savings Certificates, but I contend that the Post Office Savings Bank should be utilised more.  The rate of interest that it pays on deposits is 2½ per cent., and I do not think that it has been changed for the past twenty-five years.  Prior to the great war it was a well-known fact that the deposit rate of the Post Office Savings Bank compared favourably with the rate that was paid on consols&mdash;the Funded Debt.  I contend that the Minister, in order to attract money at a rate lower than he can borrow it to-day, should raise the interest on Post Office Savings Bank deposits to 4 per cent., and give that fact sufficient publicity.  Not alone would he then be able to borrow and finance his administration more cheaply, but he would create stability and generate an atmosphere of security.  The small depositor, even a depositor with £1, £2, or £5, would see that he had an interest in the stability, security and solvency of the State, and there would be less temptation for people to succumb to doctrines of anarchy.  The Minister referred to the money lying on deposit in <Col N="1748" /> the banks.  Remember that twenty-five years ago the banks gave only one per cent., or even less, whereas the depositor could always get 2½ per cent. in the Post Office.  Let him advance the Post Office rate to 4 per cent. and I venture to predict that there will be a very large increase in Post Office deposits.  Inasmuch as the small depositor often likes to get his money back easily, in fact, on demand and without any loss on the capital sum, this system would work with very great advantage, and with dual advantage, advantage to the investor and to the State.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to suggest that there is no demand in the country for a reduction of expenditure, I submit that he is quite wrong.  There is an insistent demand, subject always, as I say, to the needs of productive expenditure. No reflecting person objects to expenditure which will become reproductive, but it is the dead end of things that the country is objecting to. While it is earning less as the months and the years go by, it is faced with these overhead charges, and it asks itself: Why should people who have entrenched themselves be immune because they have no vested interests, while the working population has no such privileges?  The purchasing power of dividends from investments is now only nominal compared with what it was ten years ago.  The people are asking themselves how far the Government will go to try to mend this situation, and whether the question of economy will be faced or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I come after Deputy Connor Hogan, because I am afraid I cannot be as interesting on this matter as he has been, nor can I give the same financial recommendations that he has put forward for remedying the evils that the State is confronted with.  What we are discussing is Deputy Heffernan's amendment to the Vote on Account, based on the Estimates for public services for the year ending 31st March, 1927, and Deputy Heffernan suggests that these Estimates can bear a reduction of over £2,800,000.  I do not suppose that even Deputy Heffernan himself <Col N="1749" /> thinks that such a reduction is expected by any section of the House. In the course of the discussion we have gone very largely into a number of details.  I do not propose to do that, because that will arise in due course on the examination of the Estimates as a whole.  If Deputy Heffernan had confined himself to an amendment which would operate as a token vote, and in that way question the wisdom of the Estimates as they have come before us, I am afraid I would, of necessity, have had to support him.  I think the people throughout the country are becoming alive to the fact that they have a vital interest in this matter of budgetting.  I hope they feel they have a definite and decided interest in the action of Deputies as regards the voting away of money, and in the control they exercise on the expenditure of money on Government services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimates before us indicate the amount that will probably be required for the various services during the coming year.  All the details are comprised in the volume circulated to Deputies.  In connection with the criticism that have been launched from the Farmers' benches in support of Deputy Heffernan's amendment, the Minister, in his reply, indicated that the figures given here are to be taken as the irreducible minimum.  In fact, he invited us to consider the question that the maximum figures have not yet been reached.  The Minister, by his speeches, has shown that the Government do not recognise that there is any item in this volume before us that can be criticised as unnecessary expenditure. I do not propose to deal in detail with the Estimates now.  That will come on later.  As that is the view of the Minister the country has to recognise that in the opinion of the Government it will take a sum of over £21,000,000 to provide for the administration of the services of the State, organised on the lines that we find them to-day.  Notwithstanding what the Government may say as to the reasonableness of the charge, the people of the country, in examining these figures, will have to ask themselves what they mean in taxation, individually and collectively, and whether <Col N="1750" /> they can afford to pay for the services they are getting at this high rate.</P>
    <P>Obviously, as the Minister said, there are two ways of dealing with the matter. One would be to take the gross figure for these services, and say that instead of giving the Ministry £21,000,000 we would give considerably less.  Deputy Heffernan suggests a reduction of £2,800,000.  The other alternative is that the burden can be better borne by the people if in the ordinary course of events there is increased prosperity in the country.  There is no doubt that if prosperity comes the ability of the people to bear this heavy taxation will be increased.  But, looking at the country to-day, is there any Deputy so optimistic as to forecast any great increase in the prosperity of the country in the near future, whether through means of development or an extension of business operations? People I have been talking to agree that at the moment the country is passing through a great crisis; it is living on its capital, and to that extent we are getting poorer and less able to bear the weight of the taxation that is pressing upon us.</P>
    <P>Being a business man, I would like to compare the Government to a board of directors, and the ordinary community outside to the shareholders of the company.  Any company run on reasonably conservative lines will aim at the payment of its expenses first of all; secondly, it will aim at providing its shareholders with some dividend, and thirdly&mdash;this in my opinion is a very important factor&mdash;it will put a certain sum in reserve which can be made available for developments to take place later.  If we were living on those lines to-day the increase in our prosperity would not be very great, but it should be marked.  Is that, I ask, the position in our country to-day?  I venture to suggest that it is the reflex action that is taking place.  The directors of the company, or in other words the Government, are faced with the position that they are called upon to get a certain amount of money for administrative expenses, and in order to get that they are calling on the shareholders to encroach <Col N="1751" /> on their reserves so as to enable the company to pay its way.  If that is the position, I think we must look with some apprehension on the probable continuance of these overhead and other charges that we are called upon to face as taxpayers.  The farmers say &ldquo;All the taxation comes back to us.&rdquo; They say: &ldquo;We are the only producers; we are the men that control affairs.&rdquo;  I think, politically, they would like to be able to say on their platforms that they were the only people in the State who count.</P>

      <P>I do.  I say we are living here as a community.  The farmers, as well as labour, and the other classes form part of that community. The Minister for Finance, in dealing with the burden of taxation, has to distribute it amongst the various classes of the people who constitute the community.  All have to shoulder their weight of that taxation.  Under his Budget proposals the Minister has to try and arrange a reasonable method of collecting their share from each class: labourer, farmer, business-man and Government official.  It is nonsense to say that any one of us is going to escape from the effect of a comprehensive Budget which aims at taking a certain amount of money individually and collectively from us.  There is no use in Deputy Gorey saying that because a man is driving about in a motor car he is experiencing prosperity, while another man, without a motor car, is bearing the weight of taxation.  No matter what the state of affairs may be, there always will be people able to afford to drive about in motor cars.  Even if the State went bankrupt, you would still have left some members in the community who could afford to go around in motor cars.  Looking at this question of taxation, you must recognise that every section of the people contributes its quota to make up the national Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the discussions that have taken place on this matter some Deputies were inclined to discriminate between the classes.  Deputy O'Connell said that <Col N="1752" /> the more money you get, the more you spend and the greater the prosperity I do not follow that doctrine.  Ultimately you will reach the point where you will want to know where the money is to come from.  In actual operation what does taxation do?  The Minister for Finance here, or the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the other side, may, for instance, lay on taxes on some commodity or other, it may be whiskey or stout.  They may pile the tax on to such an extent that ultimately they find that by so doing they are actually losing revenue.  Why? Because people find that they cannot afford to pay the price that is charged, and that, of course, is the levelling of all things.  In the same way, if the Minister for Finance budgets for a sum of money that the country cannot afford to pay, then, ultimately, the Minister is not going to get the money. The money will not be there for him. The question of whether the people are able to meet the burden that is placed upon them is a serious one for the consideration of every member of the House.  If you continue to place a burden upon the people that they are not able to carry, then you are going to arrive at a point at which taxation cannot be got out of the people on any reasonable lines.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of whether the people are able to bear the proposed taxation for the coming year, which will be practically similar to that of last year.  If last year's experience was bad, this year's experience is going to be worse, because the people are less able to bear the taxation.  What is the condition of the country at present?  The consensus of opinion is that there is no money in the country.  The records of the Bankruptcy Court and the published list of judgments against people reveal an alarming state of affairs.  Down the country you will be told that the shortage of money is due to the fact that the farmers are not paying what they owe.  But an analysis of the whole situation, I think, will force one to the conclusion that the efforts of the Government in the last few years in collecting not only current taxes, but arrears of taxes, have left the people <Col N="1753" /> from whom that money has been taken in a very difficult situation financially. There may be a difference of opinion as to that, but I think the general concensus of opinion is that there are very few business concerns and industries in the country that are not in a very difficult position financially.  That being so, the efforts of the Dáil should be directed to cutting our cloth according to our measure.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I do not agree with the criticism that has been levelled at the salaries of civil servants.  From my experience I can say that we have got a very able body of civil servants, more particularly those who are heads of departments.  Any of the heads of departments that I have come in contact with are men who are not overpaid and who, in any other walk of life, would expect to get the salaries which they are getting, and would get them owing to their ability.  The question really is: have we a redundancy of staff in the Civil Service?  I do not think it can be said that civil servants are overpaid.</P>
    <P>I find fault with the Minister, not exactly for refusing to appoint this Geddes' Committee, but for his attitude of mind on the matter, when speaking for the Government.  His attitude seems to be: &ldquo;We are supreme, we are infallible, we are going to carry on, notwithstanding any criticism as to the amount of the Estimates; we are the best people, and we do not want advice or assistance from anybody.&rdquo;  I do not question the ability of the Executive Council, but I do question their attitude on this matter, which goes beyond the Executive Council.  If the Dáil is convinced that a radical reduction of expenditure is necessary, it is not sufficient for the Government to say that these Estimates which cover the cost of administration are not capable of reduction.  They should look at the matter from the point of view of what the country is able to pay.  I ask the Dáil to look at this question from the point of view of the people they represent and to ask themselves. &ldquo;Are the people able to pay this amount of taxation?&rdquo;  I think the country and the Ministry will have to call a halt in connection with expenditure, <Col N="1754" /> not that I do not desire to see improvements, but because the people are unable to meet this taxation.  It is up to the Government to recognise that and let us know what their policy is in connection with the matter.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Connor Hogan addresses the Dáil he usually affords a certain amount of entertainment, but I do not think that we have ever listened to such delightful nonsense as that to which he treated us this evening.  He succeeded, at least, in tying me up and, I venture to suggest, in tying himself up, in a maze of figures, and before he sat down he really did not know where he was. While disapproving of most of the speeches made in favour of this amendment, I am going to vote for it, and I want to give my reasons.  In the first instance, I am going to vote for it because, if, as the Government have told us, and as Deputies have said by their votes, this country is so poor that old age pensions must be cut, then it is certainly too poor to pay £1,200, £1,500, or £2,000 to certain officials.  In the second place, if the Government hold, as they have held, and as the majority of Deputies have held by their votes, that the country cannot afford to pay more than thirty-two shillings per week to labourers, married or single, employed on the Shannon scheme, then we certainly cannot afford to give officials up to £2,000 per year.  I do not say that these men are not worth that salary.  I daresay they are worth a good deal more.  But I do say that old age pensioners are entitled to more than nine shillings per week, or five shillings, four shillings or three shillings, which some of them are getting. I say that labourers, particularly married men, are entitled to more than thirty-two shillings.  When that case was put from the Labour benches, the argument advanced from the Government benches was that the country could not afford it.  I hold that the same argument should be used in relation to those officials who are in receipt of these large salaries.  That is the reason I am going to vote for this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing, I should like to say that the amendment does not mean, as many <Col N="1755" /> Deputies have said, a reduction of the total estimate.  It means a reduction of the Vote on Account.  It may mean eventually, of course, a reduction in the estimates, but even if it were carried now, it would not mean a reduction in the total estimate.  Deputies should not try to confuse themselves or others in regard to that.</P>
    <P>I have not very much to say on this matter.  I do not think any Deputy can have very much to say, except to repeat what has already been said. Between the Minister for Finance and Deputy Connor Hogan, everything has been said that could be said on the matter. I want, however, to refer to an interjection of Deputy Gorey's with regard to the dole.  It seems to be popular to refer to the dole and to the 50,000 or 60,000 who are unemployed in a sneering manner.  Will Deputy Gorey, or any other Deputy, tell us in what other way the unemployed can be provided for if you are not able to find work for them?  Are they to be allowed to starve?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is perhaps entitled to an explanation of my interjection. On the spur of the moment, perhaps, I am not in a position to give it as fully as I should like, but it is our experience, and the experience of public officials since the war, and even before the war, in connection with the giving of money in grants, that no country in the world has produced greater experts in this matter than the people in this country who are drawing money of one kind or another either from the British Government or our own Government.  My interjection was brought forth by an interjection of Deputy Norton when he said that we should learn methods of farming. I say that there is nothing to be learned by the people who are living on doles, pensions or grants in this country.  They know everything about the matter; it is a fine art with them, and in that respect they are in front of any community I ever heard of.  I do not assert that people out of work should not get some assistance, but when I see people refusing work at twenty-five shillings a week and preferring <Col N="1756" /> to draw a pound as a dole and do nothing, I think it is time to speak out.  When I see men who are offered employment refusing it and drawing the dole in preference, I say it is a public scandal.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey ought to know that men are not entitled now to receive what was once known as uncovenanted unemployment benefit.  The position to-day is that for every week a man works he gets his card stamped and he is entitled to one day's benefit&mdash;one 2/6&mdash;and if he does not work he will not get any unemployment money.  Further, if an employer goes to the Labour Exchange to look for men and if any man who is in receipt of unemployment money is offered work and does not accept it he is automatically cut off.  It is not fair or right for Deputies who ought to have some sense of their responsibilities to make wild and foolish charges such as these.  Deputy Gorey speaks about people in this country living on grants. The Deputy and the people whom the Deputy represents get as much of the grants and the doles as anyone else.</P>

      <P>I had no intention of taking part in this debate, because I thought it would be more opportune to discuss these Estimates at another time, but the Minister for Finance has thrown out suggestions that if Deputies thought a decrease were possible they ought to come forward and make suggestions.  I am going to touch on one point that I have some knowledge of; that is the cost to the State of the medical services to the Army.  I alluded to it on the last occasion when the Estimates were being discussed, and I allude to it again.  I do not think that any Minister is capable of justifying a total cost for medical services to the Army of £64,888, not including a <Col N="1758" /> great many subsidiary things such as fuel, light, water, even nurses, diet and clothing.</P>
      <P>At all events, when we come to the actual numbers of the Army, 16,000, including officers, we find that the cost of the medical services of the army, including officers, is over £4 per head. The cost of medical services to the men alone is over £5 per head.  That is out of all proportion to what the medical services should be for a young and small army.</P>
      <P>I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that there is here a very distinct way in which a substantial reduction might be made.  I am not going, on the present occasion, to discuss very fully the suggestion that I threw out on a previous occasion, that there was no necessity whatever for the continuance of St. Brican's Hospital, that only an hospital in connection with the training of the troops at the Curragh is necessary, and that anything further that is required could be secured quite easily by subsidising some of the city hospitals.  On the occasion on which I mentioned that last year, the President stated that it was not possible to have these men treated in a civilian hospital, because of the want of disciplinary supervision.  At the same time the Minister for Defence stated that he meant to keep open St. Brican's Hospital, because they were going to treat pensioners there.  I do not know whether that hospital has been turned into an hospital for pensioners or not.  I have no desire whatsoever to lessen the efficiency of the medical service.  I want to see an efficient medical service, but I do say that the employment of 78 medical officers for 16,000 men, including officers&mdash;that is a medical officer to every 200 men, including officers&mdash;means a great deal of money and that a distinct reduction could easily be made.  As I have stated before, I have no wish to enter into this discussion at the moment, but as the Minister has said that Deputies should point out where they saw that some reduction could be made, I assert what I asserted last year, that here is a service on which a distinct reduction might be made.</P>

      <P>I rose to intervene in this debate, because I felt that owing to the very strong Press campaign that has been in existence for the past few weeks, if not for the past few months, it is justifiable for any Deputy who has any knowledge of the financial affairs of the State to speak his mind.  I presume it would be much more popular at the moment to join in the scream of criticism that is arising against the Government expenditure; it would be more pleasing to the popular mind which follows stunts organised from time to time by, or emanating from, the Press.  But for one who wants to look at the affairs of the State, not from a Party point of view but from the point of view of the general progress of this country, one cannot find oneself equal to the task of joining in the common cry.  I have no doubt that there are parts of the Estimates where savings might be made; I have no doubt, as the last Deputy mentioned, that there are certain services a close inspection of which, in this House, might have the effect of bringing certain valuable savings.  I also agree with him that it is on the Estimates that this matter can be more suitably discussed.  I have found that the common cry of those who have opposed <Col N="1760" /> this Government&mdash;largely from the Left&mdash;has been that they have not done this thing or they have not done that thing, that they failed to institute this new work or that new work, and looking at it as a reasonable man and as a business man, with a knowledge of the relation of costs to the results, I know that the Government or any Government could not institute new services and new undertakings without calling on the nation to expend the money necessary for them.  It is, therefore, futile merely to call for a decrease in expenditure, while at the same time agreeing to the undertaking of new Departments for the service of the State.  Many of these new Departments, I have no doubt, are not showing immediate profit to the country; many of them will require the fullness of time to bring them to fruition; many of them that have been mentioned here will, no doubt, bring benefit to the country, but the results cannot reveal themselves immediately.  To allow oneself to be carried away by what virtually is a Press stunt is, to my mind, a sign either of weakness of mind or a lack of public interest and morality. The principal subject of attack has been the civil servant.  Woven in and out through the general fabric of the attack is the statement made from time to time that soft jobs have been made and positions have been found for the friends of the Government.  I am not making an apologia for the Government.</P>

      <P>If I had any grievance in this matter at all, my grievance would be that many of those who helped to build up this State, who spent years of their lives when they might have been equipping themselves for the making of profit, in the cause of the liberty of this country, have not been rewarded for the years spent in the service of the nation by being included in the ordinary service of the State to-day.  But I realise, as we all have to realise, that the State cannot afford that luxury and that the State could not afford at any time to be unjust. The State had to accept the service as they found it, and unless they committed themselves to much more criminal expenditure by expelling many of these civil servants and replacing them by their own friends, they had to retain those who were already in the service.  I do not think it can be truthfully said, in a general way&mdash; there may be instances&mdash;that the friends of the Government and those that the Government have represented in the past few years, have been put in positions under this Government. Neither am I an apologist for the Civil Service in general.  Many civil servants in the higher positions lent their aid and the power of their high positions against us in the struggle which brought this State into existence.  Consequently in the ordinary way they would not be the kind of persons who would be looked on in a friendly way by myself but I do recognise from the close acquaintance and knowledge I have gained during the past year, through my service on the Public Accounts Committee and because of other opportunities that come to a member in his interchanges with the Departments, that in general this State does get good service from its civil servants. There is a cry in the Press to cut down the numbers in the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>In the past year, from time to time, when Departments <Col N="1762" /> were being cut down we had an immediate outcry from various sections of the community that we must not put men out of employment, and demand was made on most of us personally to secure the reinstatement of those men in their employment.  That is a fact which I can state from my own personal experience.  Which way are we to turn?  Are we to keep men in employment because a certain amount of pressure was brought to bear on us to give them employment, or are we to do away with their means of employment? Charges are being made that in the higher ranks of the Civil Service men are being grossly overpaid.  I am one of those who believe that when you get good and excellent service it is hard to put a maximum limit on the amount you should pay for it.  The higher civil servants in this or in any other State have to bear very heavy responsibilities, and they are essential cogs in the machinery of Government.  They must be men of training, intellect and character.  I would stress particularly &ldquo;character.&rdquo;  In certain instances we could reduce the amount of remuneration paid to these men.  In the majority of cases, however, as the Minister for Finance has pointed out, owing to Treaty obligations, we cannot make their financial position worse, but in some cases we could reduce salaries by a certain proportion, say, 50 per cent. What, however, would be the result of that?  Many of the men in the higher ranks of the civil service are responsible for the handling and spending of huge sums of money, and are you going to put the responsibility for doing that into the hands of men who are underpaid? I venture to say that every State and every country will find that that is not a paying proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wherever you have higher officials underpaid, inevitably you have corruption. You will find that these men will discover other ways of getting money and the result will be that you will have a service on which the State cannot depend and which would be rotten with corruption.  I prefer that the State should pay handsomely for its services, for reliability, for honesty and for character.  I remember that a certain highly placed civil servant gave <Col N="1763" /> evidence before us on the Public Accounts Committee.  He is one of those whose salary should, according to the Press, be reduced.  I looked into his position afterwards, and I found that during the year under review he handled money totalling to the amount of five and a half millions, and, as a matter of fact, if that man had been dishonest or corrupt, he could have misappropriated anything up to £200,000, and it would have taken the State at least a year to discover and overtake his defalcations.  Is it not worth paying for character and paying properly men who handle money in an impersonal way to the utmost satisfaction of all concerned?  I repeat, you must pay for character.  I hold no brief whatever in a matter of this kind for the present Government, but I make my statement in the interests of the State as a whole, because I believe that the State will have to commit itself to new undertakings and to reproductive enterprises in this country, which has been moribund in such matters for half a century and more, and that expenditure of money in new channels is required.  I am one of those who will demand from the State the making of these ventures and the finding of the money to finance them.  I know that it will be said that that will increase expenditure and that it will be opposed by those who are calling for a reduction in expenditure.  You cannot have it both ways.  We are passing through an unprecedented period of depression, and it is easy to say that it is due to Government taxation and to Government mishandling of money.  Every sane man, however, knows that that is not true.  You cannot blame an act of God on any set of individuals.  We are passing through a period of depression which is due to preceding circumstances, over which we have no control.  I, and every other business man, have every reason to be well aware of it, but no good purpose will be served by raising a cry merely to catch the uneducated mind and by saying that all this is due to over-taxation.</P>

It is money sent out to pay for imports which should be spent on goods manufactured at home. The farmers are not the least sinners in this matter.  It is due to money being sent out through financial channels, through insurance and otherwise, money which this State will have to take immediate steps to divert into the financial channels of this country.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants to put a name on it I will do it. He has, in fact, done it already.  As I said in the beginning, I have no doubt that economies can be made.  I hope that ways and means will be found, and pointed out during the discussion on the Estimates, by which economies can be made.  I have no doubt that here and there in certain services a tightening-up process can be applied, and that a more careful scrutiny can be made with a view to effecting economies. I do not deplore this discussion. From many points of view it is good. It is good, for instance, for any Government to know that there are a critical public and a critical House to deal with.  For that reason, good may result from this discussion but what I do deplore is the attempt&mdash;this is not what the Press this morning called &ldquo;hysterical criticism&rdquo;&mdash;to substitute for Government by Legislature, Government by the Press.  That has not even the virtue of novelty.  It is merely copying what is going on in another country.  It is already sweeping over the provincial Press.  In my constituency a journal which has a wide circulation repeats the same catch-cries which appear in the Dublin Press and asks, &ldquo;What are Deputies doing?&rdquo;  From my knowledge of Deputies, especially those in my constituency, I can say that a good part of their time is spent in approaching Government Departments with a view <Col N="1765" /> to spending money for useful purposes in their constituencies.</P>
      <P>I deplore this attempt to substitute Press Government for Government by Legislature.  I deplore what I think is more criminal, and what I consider is the intention behind it.  Perhaps I should not say that.  Perhaps it may not be intentional, but it seems to me that the effect will be that representative Government in this country will be reduced in the estimation of the people, will be discredited, and those continued statements in the Press, to the effect that everybody is being lavishly paid for doing nothing, can only result in discrediting Government by Legislature.  Statements have been made about Minister's salaries, and these, I think, are the meanest and pettiest part of this campaign.  I venture to say that no business man in Dublin, and very few ordinary work-a-day professional men, could afford to accept Ministerial responsibility at the salary which the State pays.  Unless we are going to have a Ministry that will be open to corruption, and that will be amenable to pressure of a financial kind, the State must pay salaries to Ministers commensurate, at least, with the positions they occupy.  I have intervened in this debate as I felt it was my duty, as it is the duty of any Deputy who resents this Press campaign, to speak out my mind and support those who are endeavouring to back the Government in their efforts to re-create a strong economic life in this country, and to get the country over the period of depression, which is naturally the result of what has gone before.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCullough, in the course of his remarks, used words with reference to the responsibility of civil servants which might be misunderstood.  I would like to add a few words that, perhaps, he omitted to use.  While, of course, the success of administration does depend largely on the honesty of civil servants, still there is not the dependency on the honesty of an individual that one might gather if one adverted merely to the words used by Deputy McCullough. There is, of course, a most elaborate system of checks and counter-checks <Col N="1766" /> which means that dependence is not solely on an individual to the extent that some Deputies might gather.  On the other hand, unless our whole service is honest and efficient, the checks would not be successful.</P>

      <P>I am not going to follow the last speaker in nine-tenths of his remarks which, it seemed to me, would have been more appropriate on a resolution purporting to condemn the Press than on a Vote on Account.  I would suggest to him, if I am permitted to do so, that he should write a letter to the Press instead of expressing his views here.  There has been an amendment moved to the Vote on Account and that amendment is to reduce the Vote by a very substantial sum.  I deprecate any suggestions&mdash; some such suggestions have been made &mdash;that this debate that has gone on for last three days owing to the placing of this amendment on the paper, has been entirely futile.  I take it that the Deputy in moving this amendment has done so largely in order to bring about a general discussion on the whole of the Vote on Account and to have something in the nature of a protest made against the whole policy of the Executive Council.  In other words, I take this to be a token Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has made two lengthy speeches; I listened to both.  I must confess that at the end of the second speech I could not discover the faintest ray of hope that there was any remote chance of reducing this Vote on Account.  The debate has proceeded mainly upon two lines.  In the first place there has been an inquiry demanded&mdash;and I do not think the inquiry has necessarily been limited to a Geddes Inquiry&mdash;into certain services and their administration. Secondly, there have been some detailed proposals as regards individual reductions.  The Minister for Finance did not ask for the first argument, but I submit with all sincerity that he did ask for the second because the main argument from all speakers upon the Government side has been: If you think there should be a reduction, show us where the reduction can be made.  In regard to the inquiry the <Col N="1767" /> Minister has treated that proposal in a very light-hearted way indeed.  He drew a picture of the most ludicrous description as to the utter futility of setting up such an inquiry.  He even went so far as to say that it was a silly suggestion&mdash;that he could not get business men in this country.  I do not know if he has made an inquiry as to whether he could get them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>He has gone further and has suggested that to have an inquiry of this nature, or indeed an inquiry of any kind&mdash;no special nature has been prescribed&mdash;would be a shirking of responsibility on the part of this Parliament of its functions and duties.  I have a great regard for this Parliament.  If the British Parliament was willing to appoint a Commission, if it was willing to make, as he would suggest we here are anxious to do, such a farce of its representative institution, if it was willing to shirk responsibilities when it was up against a position which it considered to be a grave one, is it to be suggested that we here in the position in which we find ourselves &mdash;a position which no one will deny is of the utmost gravity for everyone in the State&mdash;should be differently placed to the British Parliament?  We are told that we would be in effect nothing but a pack of fools, that we would not be doing our duty to our constituents and to the country, and that the whole matter should be treated with scorn.  The Minister went so far as to say that you might as well set up an inquiry into the colour and texture of the carpet on the floor of the Dáil.  I think that is treating the whole subject with too much levity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see what harm this inquiry would do.  As has been stated previously in debate, if there is nothing to hide, why not allow the inquiry to take place?  It would certainly assuage the feelings existing throughout the country.  It would do no harm to anybody. As to the Minister's suggestion that his own staff or other Departmental staffs would not co-operate, or that <Col N="1768" /> they would fool the Committee of Inquiry by making misrepresentations to them, I am in entire disagreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation. I never suggested any such thing.  I never said that they would do it; I said that they could do it and that a Committee could not get at facts.  This must be done by the civil servants, and if we assume that they are not willing to do the right thing they could not be made do the right thing by such a Committee.</P>

      <P>The Minister now denies that that is what he meant. If he did not mean that they would, where was the point in saying that they could do it?  I do not believe for a moment that they could and I doubt very much that, holding the positions that they do hold, they would do it.  That is another of the reasons why the Minister will not have anything in the nature of an inquiry.  We have heard a lot about a Press campaign.  This question of an inquiry is not a new one.  I have actually spoken upon it myself before, and sometime ago at that.  Members from those Benches have also spoken on that subject.  Not only is it not new, but proposals that were made in regard to an inquiry, as well as proposals that were made two or three years ago in regard to various possible reductions of expenditure, have been treated just as the Minister is treating them to-day, with absolute and entire scorn.  Let the Minister continue to treat them that way; let the Minister go on saying that this Government and the conduct of its affairs are so far perfect and the conditions of the country require so little investigation that he is satisfied in his conscience an inquiry would serve no useful purpose.  If he is satisfied, <Col N="1769" /> his is the responsibility.  I am not satisfied and that is the reason why I join in the demand again, as I have previously done, for setting up something in the nature of an inquiry.</P>
      <P>The main question we are discussing is not so much whether this expenditure is too great or too little.  Deputies have said that to get good results you must make adequate payment.  With that I am in perfect accord; but the scale of payment must surely depend upon the capacity to pay.  The whole question that we have before us to-day is what is our taxable capacity and are we able to bear the present burden of taxation.  That question has been asked before, but so far it has been ignored from the Ministerial Bench. In the year 1895 a Commission, known as the Childers' Commission, was set up by the British Parliament and Sir Robert Giffen estimated that the taxable capacity of the whole of Ireland was £22,000,000.  He arrived at that figure by deducting what he called the amount of subsistence per head of the population which was, in his estimation, £12 per head.  Deputy Johnson suggested that 75 per cent. ought to be added to that sum.  I think the reason he gave was probably sound&mdash;the lessened purchasing capacity of the pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not run away with the suggestion that that was the whole of the taxable capacity. There are, of course, other products which should be included.  Sir Robert Giffen's estimate included linen and shipbuilding, but there are other industrial products, apart from agricultural products.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well&mdash; apart from the industrial products.  I take the Deputy's statement.  I agree that a certain figure should be added but I also suggest that a percentage <Col N="1770" /> should be added to the rate of subsistence because&mdash;as nobody will agree more readily than the Deputy&mdash;the rate of subsistence has also increased and, probably, in no less proportion.  At any rate, if that were so the figure of £22,000,000, being the surplus over the present-day subsistence allowance, would be practically the same as it was at the time of the Childers' Commission. We are asked to vote&mdash;not to-day but in instalments&mdash;a sum of £26,000,000 and we are not asked to vote that sum for the whole of Ireland.  We are asked to vote it for the Free State which, unfortunately, excludes some of the wealthiest portions of what once was Ireland.  Is it to be suggested that the Free State to-day, on the basis of the Childers' Commission estimate, is able to pay £26,000,000, when that Commission stated that the taxable capacity of the whole country, including the Northern Counties, was only £22,000,000?  I put these figures for the purpose of asking the Government whether they have considered what the taxable capacity of the country is and, if they have considered it, what is their conclusion?  If they have not considered it and if they are not satisfied as to what the taxable capacity is, then I say that that is a strong argument for an inquiry.  If an inquiry was thought necessary in 1895 and if a conclusion was then arrived at as to what our taxable capacity was and if now we are not satisfied as to what our taxable capacity is, why should we not have a commission now to inquire into the taxable capacity of the Free State?  But the Minister says &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the details of expenditure for which the Minister has asked for criticism, I am not going to weary the House at this stage by making the same speech that I have made on the Budgets for the last two years. But I will say that on those Budgets I demanded certain reductions, and I was not the only one to do so.  In company with others, I suggested that the Ministry of Fisheries should be abolished.  In company with others, I suggested that the Ministry of External affairs should be abolished.  In company with others, on two occasions, I demanded that there should be a further reduction in the Army.  Now, for the third time, in response to the Minister's invitation, I demand the same.  In regard to the Ministry of Fisheries, I should like the Dáil to bear with me for a few moments while I go into the question of the amount which is expended and the results therefrom. We have been asked constantly if we can show comparison between this country and countries like Denmark. I will endeavour to do so in regard to the question of fisheries.  Fisheries, everybody will agree, is an all-important question in the State of Denmark and should be so here.  Here we are asked to vote certain sums for the upkeep and administration of the Ministry which I seek to abolish.  We are asked to vote no less than £25,000 for <Col N="1772" /> the salaries and expenses in that Department. I submit that that Department should not exist.  I submit that that £25,000, or at least a considerable portion of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Can be saved by having the Ministry of Fisheries under the wing of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  We are asked to vote £25,000 for the salaries and expenses of this Ministry and the actual expenditure, as detailed in these estimates, of that Department, on fishing and fishery development is £34,000. The total amount to be given by way of loans to fishermen is the large sum of £7,000!  Expenditure is £34,000; loans are £7,000 and we are asked to pay £25,000 by way of salaries for that. Let us take Denmark.  There is no Ministry of Fisheries in Denmark.  It is conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture, and Denmark, it is undeniable, has to expend, and does expend as much of its time on agricultural development as we do here.  There is no Ministry of Fisheries there and the Danish expenditure for loans in respect of fisheries was no less than £20,000.  It is not to the loans or to the expenditure on development or in aiding the fishermen that I am objecting here. What I am objecting to is the cost of this expenditure, which far outweighs the amount expended.</P>

      <P>I will leave that to the President to deal with, when he comes to speak.  But whether the Constitution provides for a Minister for Fisheries now or not, we are masters of our Constitution for eight years, and two years ago we could have attended to this if we so pleased. I desire to point out once more that, in my opinion, a separate Ministry of Fisheries is an extravagence; that more money could be expended and more benefit might accrue to fishermen if the Ministry were administered, let us say by the Ministry of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Now, I come to the Ministry of External Affairs.  It is true that it may be necessary to have something to do with, and to have some representation at, the League of Nations.  I believe we succeeded in some point about the location of some Conference that was held there.  At any rate, I am only reiterating statements that I made on a number of previous occasions.  I do so purposely in order to show that this is not a Press stunt.  The Minister for External Affairs is not a necessary, separate entity.  There is no one&mdash;and this has been suggested time and again for the last couple of years&mdash;better able to conduct that function than the President himself.  That arrangement would be better in every way and it would save a sum of money&mdash;I do not say a large sum of money, because I am not putting forward these small items with the suggestion that they would bring about a serious reduction of expenditure at the moment.  That might be penny wise and a pound foolish.  But I object altogether to the attitude of the Minister for Finance. that in no respect can he reduce the expenditure beyond what it is.  The irreducible minimum, in his view is the amount we are asked to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army has been reduced, and we are told that it will be reduced in the future.  The Minister for Finance made a very interesting comment, by way, I think, of private opinion, on this matter in his speech to-day.  He said he thought the Army should be reduced. Then he went on to say that that was not to be taken to mean that he was in favour of the abolition of the Army.  On the contrary, he thought <Col N="1774" /> we should have a force in this country which, at any time we might happen to be involved in some great war, would be able to protect the country. I think that is an admirable argument. But I do not see why that argument could not be advanced in favour of a Navy.  As a matter of fact, I think if we had a Navy and if there were a war in which we were involved, we might have a much better chance of repelling invaders than we would have with an Army.</P>

      <P>There are milestones on the road to Dover, too. Therefore, I cannot agree with the Minister in connection with the upkeep of an Army of protection.  I do think, and I say this again, that it would be a good thing for the youth of the country to have something in the nature of a territorial force, but that anything in the nature of a magnificent display by way of a standing army to repel invasion is out of the question for a country like ours.  The Army costs a great deal.  Mention has been made of the cost of the medical service. The pension list has swollen considerably, and I presume it will continue to do so for some time.  But my proposal would be that instead of having an expensive standing army, it would be better, if necessary,&mdash;and I do not think that the necessity will now arise &mdash;to be in a position to have the Civic Guard armed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are three points, the Minister for Fisheries, the Minister for External Affairs, and the Army.  We have been asked for items in respect of which we would suggest a reduction.  I suggest a reduction in those.  That reduction would not make a great difference in the amount we are asked to vote, but I have shown that at any rate reduction <Col N="1775" /> can be made.  The Ministerial attitude &mdash;and when I say Ministerial I mean the attitude of the Minister for Finance &mdash;on this whole debate has been: &ldquo;There it is.  There is our Estimate. We cannot help it, and there it has got to be.&rdquo;&ldquo;There it is.&rdquo;  With that I am in total accord.  With his argument that he, and others associated with him, cannot help it, I do not at all agree.  He mentioned to-day the changes that were made and the cost of those changes and, with all respect. I think that the Government could have helped by not having a great many of these changes.  I say that most of them were entirely unnecessary, were sweeping to the last degree, and were, and are, and will be for some time, a gross extravagance on the revenue of the country.  Certain people in various Government services were given the option of staying on, and certain were dismissed.</P>

      <P>There were 276 Petty Sessions clerks dismissed, than which there was no greater piece of wilful extravagance in the whole history of the Government of the country. These Petty Sessions clerks were men who were trained, who had a knowledge of the routine, knew everything concerned with the administration of the law, the same law that we are administering now, and do not forget that.  These men were dismissed, they were put as a burden upon the revenue of the country, and men were put in their places who could not have had, and have not, anything like their experience and efficiency.  I say that in that regard the Government could have helped some portion of the position in which they are in to-day.  Then, take the judges.</P>

      <P>I want to get them from the Minister.  The point is that the judges were dismissed.  The actual sitting judges may be costing us less to-day, but the point that is put up on the other side of the account is: What did it cost us to dismiss the other judges?  I was asked to talk about R.M.'s.  The R.M.'s were very few in numbers, and for political reasons, we were told to-day, they had to be dismissed. Well, I am not quarrelling with the dismissal of the R.M.'s, but the R.M.'s used to be known as removable magistrates; they were sometimes known as resident magistrates, but mostly as removable magistrates.  But <Col N="1777" /> what I do object to is the dismissal of one form of removable magistrate and replacing him with another; what I do object to is dismissing one removable magistrate who was dismissable at the will of one Government and replacing him by a <i>quasi</i> judge who may be removed at the will of this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure some people would like to remove them.  I do not say that I would.  I did not catch what the Minister for Finance said.  Perhaps he would like to make a <Col N="1778" /> fourth speech.  The attitude is: &ldquo;There is the Estimate; the Government cannot help it; we have been landed with this baby; we had nothing to do with its production&rdquo;&mdash;an argument with which I entirely disagree&mdash;and &ldquo;There it has got to be.&rdquo;  In fact, the attitude of the Minister for Finance is that any reduction in this Estimate would be nothing less than a <i>reductio ad absurdum.</i> That is practically what he has said in regard to the proposed inquiry. That is what he has said in regard to suggestions made by Deputies for reductions here and there.  There is not one scintilla of chance, according to Ministerial utterances, of any possible reduction in any item of this expenditure.  The Minister did say that one of the reasons for the swelling of this estimate was that they had to get rid of old prejudices.  I would suggest that one of the means of reducing this expenditure would be to get rid of new prejudices.  I would suggest that, in the future, not as in the past, they should be less hasty in regard to their legislative proposals, in regard to the creation of new services, and in regard to the discharging of men who had done their duty well.  In regard to that point, I certainly would like once more to state that I have no quarrel with the salaries as paid to civil servants.  I have no quarrel with the amount that is paid to the higher civil servants, and certainly I have no quarrel with the amounts paid to those on a lower scale.  But I have a quarrel with salaries paid to people that I think the State could do without.  I think that there are certain offices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A few Parliamentary secretaries, for instance, are not, I think, indispensable.  In regard to the Civil Service itself, I desire to join with what has been said by other speakers&mdash;because I do not think it is fair to state that there has been any attack upon civil servants themselves&mdash;and to express my admiration and regard for the Civil Service and for the work it is rendering.  I also desire to place upon record my view that the Civil Service would be <Col N="1779" /> costing us less to-day if we had not dismissed some of the competent men who were in it and replaced them by others, and if we had not had, perhaps, to swell the numbers by introducing fresh legislation.  These are what I shall be told, and what I stand for, as my criticisms at this stage on this Vote on Account.  I take it that if this amendment is passed it will not mean that the Estimates will be reduced by one iota.  What we are virtually asked to do by this amendment is to say whether we are in favour of the Government policy in regard to this expenditure or whether we are not. If the amendment is carried and if the Government chooses, at a future date, to bring forward another Vote on Account, and to amend their hand in the meantime&mdash;they need not provide for the same amount; they might alter it; they might modify it, they might do various things&mdash;it will not prevent the country from going on.  It has been suggested that if this amendment is carried it will prevent the country from being carried on for the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say it will do nothing of the kind. This is only a Vote on Account.  Those who vote in favour of the amendment will only be voting to show, not that they believe there can be a great reduction in expenditure, but that there could be reduction in it.  They will also be voting for the purpose of asking for something in the nature of an inquiry into the administration of the services.  I must confess that going down through the list before us it is very difficult to discover where reductions can be made.  I say that candidly. I see many things there that must be provided for.  There are pensions of various sorts and descriptions, as well as legacies left to us from the Treaty under Article X.  I see in the list a hundred and one things that we cannot touch, but, even so, I ask, are we at rock-bottom in these Estimates? That is the question that we have to ask ourselves to-night, whether we cannot by some means reduce these Estimates somewhat.  If we can do that, then this debate will have done this service, that it will have focussed public <Col N="1780" /> opinion upon the necessity of going thoroughly into our whole system of revenue and expenditure and of seeing whether we cannot in the future do somewhat better than we have been doing, and carry on this country as it should be carried on according to its taxable capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there is, you mean?  Well, then, the Press report you wrongly.  To my mind, great retrenchments could be made in the Government services.  We are asked to provide, approximately, a sum of twenty-five and three-quarter millions for the upkeep of this State.  Some of us who were out in the fight for freedom&mdash;it is all right for Deputies to laugh who were not out&mdash;advocated that a sum of eight millions would be quite sufficient to run this country.  In 1903, when the late Mr. Arthur Griffith introduced Sinn Féin, he advocated the same thing.  It is estimated that for twenty-six counties it will take approximately twenty-five millions to run them.  The Ulster Government costs about seven and a half millions. When the citizens of Ireland made sacrifices for a free sovereign, independent country, they did so with the best intentions in order to allow the citizens <Col N="1781" /> to live cheaper.  A free country, to my mind, is one where you have education for your children.  I hold that you can have great retrenchment in the Government Departments, and if you want to reduce taxation you must start at the head.  The Minister for Local Government has succeeded in getting every local authority in the Saorstát to reduce the wages of the workers down to starvation point for the sake of economy.  But while he did that, he did not reduce the wages of his own staff.  We have ten Ministers, and every Minister has two or three secretaries. There is a huge staff of private secretaries.  One is paid £1,200 a year; the assistant private secretary is paid £1,000, and then you have an assistant to the assistant at £100 a year, and so on down along.  The majority of these could be done without.  The time has come when we should call for economy.</P>
      <P>The taxation in the Saorstát amounts to £8 per head of the population.  In the olden times the people were completely against taxation.  I think it is time that the present rate of taxation was reduced.  The Governor-General's establishment costs over £26,000 a year, while Deputies and Senators, with the officials, cost £141,850 or so.  We have a large number of Deputies, as well as Senators, whose election did not cost them as much as a 2d. stamp, as they were nominated by the Government in 1922, who could show good example to the people of the country by forfeiting their salaries.  Some of the Senators are drawing pensions from the British Government, which we have to pay.  I think it would be a patriotic thing on the part of these representatives if they were to forfeit their salaries. Their doing so would help to bring down the high cost of living and they would be acting as patriots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many ways in which retrenchment could be made.  The Minister for Finance has three or four secretaries. I think he could do with a less number than that.  The President has £500 a year for the use of his own motor car.  Well, a poor county surveyor is lucky if he gets £100 a year. The President has a salary of £2,500 a year.  I believe he is entitled to £5,000 <Col N="1782" /> a year because he succeeded in making the Saorstát after the death of President Griffith.  We must bear in mind, however, that we are out for economy. Every Deputy must realise that you cannot expect the sprats and the smaller fry to pay for the luxuries of the bigger fish, and by the bigger fish I mean the higher officials in the Government offices.</P>
    <P>We are the common people.  At least I am one of the common people, and I am not ashamed to be associated with them.  But if the people are overtaxed how can they live in this Free State?  We are supposed to be free. We fought for freedom but we have got slavery and high taxation in every county in Ireland.  There is not a county council in Ireland that has not mortgaged the rates for years to come. Why did they do that?  To enable the Free State to function.  Now we have got a Free State Government, and I ask Deputies if they are going to listen to the cry of the people and get the burden of taxation reduced.  If the taxation is not reduced then the best thing that can be done is to give a subsidy to the emigrants going to foreign countries.  It would be better to give £50 to every young man and woman between 18 and 21 years of age, to pay their passage to a foreign country and tell them that you have no room for them in this State, than to keep up the taxation as it is at present.  I do not agree with the views expressed by Deputy McCullough.  His idea was that the Government had done everything in its power to facilitate the people.  I do not agree with that.  I think that every Minister in the Government could make retrenchments in his Department. What do we want a Department of External Affairs for? What are we gaining by it?  What do we gain by the Minister for Fisheries or his Department?  The Boards of Fishery Conservators control the Department of Fisheries, and the foreign representatives control the Department of External Affairs.  I think it is about time we realised that we are gaining nothing by these Departments.</P>
    <P>On this Vote I wish to raise a question concerning the distress prevailing not only in my own constituency, but <Col N="1783" /> all over the Saorstát.  We have numbers of people who have to go without food and numbers of children who cannot go to a place of worship for want of clothes.  Women cannot do their marketing owing to their impoverished condition.  These people are citizens of this State who sent Deputies to this Dáil.  They are in a more impoverished state to-day than they were when England ruled in this country. It is our duty to try and relieve these people and place them in a position to earn a livelihood so that they can provide food and clothes for themselves and their children.  We have a Catholic Government, and yet they allow their fellow-Catholics to live under such conditions that they cannot go to a place of worship for want of clothing. What do the Government do? They levy taxation to the extent of eight pounds per head on individuals who are trying to exist under these conditions.</P>
    <P>I should also like to say something with regard to the friends of Ministers getting jobs.  Ministers may probably take offence at that.  I can prove that there are numbers of friends of Ministers in high positions who are not qualified to occupy these positions.  I make that accusation, and I can prove it.  If they are qualified now, they only qualified within the last six months. What do the people of the Saorstát think?</P>

      <P>Are they going to be represented by a Government who say they will not do this or that?  The Minister for Finance has declared that no retrenchment can be made in any Department.  He has declared in effect: &ldquo;This is the Estimate put forward by me and I am going to stand by it; and the Deputies behind me, when I press the button, must vote for it.&rdquo;  That is his attitude.  He forgets that the people are out for economy, that they want lower taxes and lower rates, and that they want the cost of living reduced. The cost of living cannot be reduced, unless the example is shown by the Government.  The example must come from the top.  They should <Col N="1784" /> do away with the secretaries to Ministers and save money in that way. The position of Governor-General should also be done away with.  The Treaty has been amended in regard to the boundary in order that the present boundary should be the boundary for ever.  If the Treaty can be amended in that way, why can it not be amended in order to do away once and for all with the position of Governor-General and thus save £26,706 per year?  We have ten Ministers, each of whom has two or three secretaries.  Why not abolish one secretary in each case and save ten thousand pounds per year? That would be £36,706 saved.  We are told these things cannot be done&mdash;that they are only small things.</P>
      <P>Then we have Senators who were nominated by members of the Dáil and who are drawing £360 per year.  It did not cost them a penny to become Senators and I think it is good enough to give them the honour of the title without paying them.  There are also Deputies belonging to the Government Party and the Farmers' Party who could live without drawing the £360 per year.  Let them forfeit that in the interests of the people.  Let them come down to realities and show they are genuine patriots.  As the President said in 1919, if we want to be free everyone must be a patriot and fight for Ireland.  Let these Deputies follow that advice.  Let Senators and Deputies who can afford it forfeit their salaries in the interests of the State. Let the President appeal to his Ministers to do without one of their secretaries and thus save £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCullough criticised the Press for publishing the actual facts concerning expenditure.  I think the Press should be congratulated for letting the people know the true facts and letting the people see how the inner circle is worked.  In the Parliament at Westminster there was a ring, and nobody knew anything only those who were in the ring.  Deputy Byrne is not here now to bear me out in that.  He knew the ring was there.  We want to show that there is no ring in the Saorstát Government.  Every Deputy is as much responsible for anything <Col N="1785" /> that is done as the Ministers and must hear the burden of responsibility as much as the Ministers.  There is no ring as far as the Saorstát Government is concerned.  It is time that the President should look to the real interests of the people and cater not for the classes, but for the masses of the people, including the working-classes.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this discussion, but Deputy Gorey wanted to know what my opinion was in connection with salaries, whether it coincided with that of Deputy Johnson or not.  At the moment, I am not concerned with the question of salaries.  I am going to vote for the amendment as a protest against the financial policy of the Government. For the past few years the Government has had no consideration for the poor, or the needy, or the working-classes. They reduced the old age pension by ten per cent. and the Farmers' Party and a large majority of the Independent Party supported that reduction.</P>

The Government may not have done what they should have done, but what have the farmers done for the country?  What have the independent business men done for the country?  Deputy Gorey says the workers will not work.  I say the workers will work, but they cannot get it.  Take the case of the Carlow Beet Factory.  I have been canvassing people to get them to grow beet in that district.  We find that the farmers in County Carlow, and probably in Deputy Gorey's constituency, are not sufficiently interested in their own business, from the financial point of view, to say nothing of the patriotic point of view, to grow beet for which they could secure about £50 per Irish acre.  That is the whole trouble.  The farmers say, &ldquo;Everything is wrong. The Government is doing this, the Republicans are doing that, and the business men are swelling their profits at our expense; we are paying all debts <Col N="1786" /> and all rates; we are paying everything.&rdquo; Yet that is the condition of affairs in the County Carlow.  Experiments in beet-growing in my own locality have shown that a return of £50 per Irish acre can be got from growing beet.  The sugar content of that beet was shown to be 18.3 per cent.  That was three points above the minimum for which they would receive fifty-four shillings per ton, and they would get two-and-sixpence for each point over fifteen.</P>

      <P>They got exactly ten points to the statute acre, 54/- a ton, and then the farmers say that they want a guaranteed price from the Government.  I am not standing up for the Government.  I am going to vote against their policy in connection with the draining of the Barrow, the Shannon scheme, and several other schemes. The farmers ought to be more interested in their own business&mdash;the development of agriculture&mdash;because the only solution of the problem in this country is increased productivity.  That is the way to reduce taxation.  There is no other means of doing it.  What is the position of the country?  Our small and large farmers are making a doctor out of one son, a clergyman out of another, a solicitor out of another, and they leave the poor Paddy or Biddy at home to work the land. There is only one policy that will bring about the upliftment of the people, and that is the cultivation of the land. There are sixteen million acres in the Saorstát, and out of that one and a half million acres are under the plough. Then we talk about farming.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I had been out of order, but I think most of the speaking in connection with this business was almost out of order, too. The financial policy of the present Government certainly is in no way in accordance with the wishes of the people of this country.  There is no question at all about that.  The Press and the people are against taxation: they want the reduction of taxation. I have no consideration for the Press, no more than anybody else, because the price of the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; is 400 per cent. above the pre-war price.  Let them first put their house in order and then they can ask the Government to put their house in order.</P>
      <P>Your policy in the past has been a damnable one for the poor of this country.  You have reduced the old age pensions.  You fixed a wage of 32/- a week for the Shannon scheme, while we pay salaries of from £1,000 to £2,000 a year to officials.  If the old age pensioners and the men working on the Shannon scheme have to live on a miserable pittance, I fail to see why the well-paid, well-groomed, and well-fed officials in Government Buildings cannot submit to a reduction of 10 per cent.  I intend to vote for the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not going to vote for the amendment, because I consider if this amendment were passed we would take too much money from the Government.  I consider that they have asked for just sufficient to enable them to carry on the functions of Government during the next financial year.  It has been suggested to me that I should <Col N="1788" /> vote for the amendment in order to show my dissatisfaction with the policy of the Government.  I am dissatisfied with the policy of the Government, but I think it is the usual practice in Parliamentary matters to move a small reduction in order to show your dissatisfaction and I do not think that I would be true to myself or to my constituents if I were to vote for this amendment, because the sum involved is too large. There has been a great deal of talk during the past three or four days in connection with the salaries of civil servants.  A great deal has been said about civil servants and their work which I think is unworthy of this House.  Any civil servants I have come in contact with are very hardworking men.  Some of them I know intimately, especially in the Local Government Department, and I know that there are men there who have to bring their work home at night in order to finish it.  In so far as offices being overstaffed are concerned, to my mind, in many offices there are not sufficient men to carry on.  My dissatisfaction with the Government lies in the fact that there is no provision, good, bad, or indifferent made in the Estimates this year for the relief of unemployment. The position is very little better than it was last year, if it is better at all, and I cannot understand for a moment how the Government could adopt such a callous attitude as to bring in an estimate, without making any provision, good, bad, or indifferent for the unemployed.  That is my principal objection to the Estimates as presented, and I am not going to say any more on them as the debate has gone on long enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that during my absence on Tuesday night Deputy O'Mara, in his new-found zeal for his constituents and the country in general, made an attack on me.  He told the Dáil that I was not in my place.  It is very seldom that I am out of my place and my record of attendance here will compare very favourably with that of any member of this House.  I happen to be twelfth in the Divisions in the last session and Deputy O'Mara had nought after his name.  Deputy O'Mara stated that since I became Mayor of Wexford <Col N="1789" /> seven years ago, a record that I am proud of, that Wexford decayed.  It is quite easy for anybody who does not know what he is talking about to get up in this Dáil and make such a statement, and Deputy O'Mara evidently does not know what he is talking about. He talked about shipping in Wexford. Shipping in Wexford, unfortunately, is on the decay for a considerable number of years, and since the amalgamation of railways a great deal of the shipping that was coming into Wexford has been diverted to Rosslare.  I have been endeavouring to get the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make some adjustments that will enable Wexford to get a fair share of its shipping. So far as the foundries in Wexford are concerned, I helped the proprietors there in every way possible to secure trade.  I am waiting for proof from Deputy O'Mara&mdash;and I defy him to give it&mdash;that any action of mine, at any time, is responsible for the decay in the trade of the Wexford foundries. Deputy O'Mara has been out of this House for a considerable time.  He taunted me with being out of it on Tuesday evening.</P>

      <P>You would have been sorrier if I had been here.  As I said, Deputy O'Mara has found new zeal and energy, but I have an idea that he did not find them until an &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; reporter called upon him and asked him for his views on the bacon industry.  Then his head swelled sufficiently to bring him to this House to put down an economy motion.  He taunted me with having no interest in his motion.  Neither had I, because I realised, and I have realised it more since he dropped his motion, that it was simply window-dressing and eye-wash. He certainly must not have had much interest in it himself, or he would not have withdrawn it yesterday evening when his time came to move it.  Deputy O'Mara was out of this House for practically twelve months, like a sulky child, I understand, against his party. I would suggest to him that if he drew <Col N="1790" /> his salary for that twelve months he ought to pay it back to the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to explain, for the information of Deputy Corish, that his understanding of what the reduction in the Vote would be is not in accordance with my intention. Efforts were made in the usual clever way by members on the Ministerial Benches, to inveigle me into a statement with regard to the actual proportion of the proposed reduction of this Vote and the total of the Estimates. I wish to say that in putting down the motion for the reduction I had no intention to fix any exact figure.  The Vote as it stands is really a token vote, and I am asking the Dáil to vote on it as a token vote and as a vote of disapproval of the financial policy of the Minister, as expressed in his Estimates and in his statements here yesterday and to-day.  I intended at one time to traverse the arguments made by the Minister and others, but now I only intend to deal with a few headings or with the main points we have tried to bring out.  I maintain that the Minister has evaded the real issue in regard to this Vote.  The real issue that we are putting up is the capacity of the country to pay.  We on the Farmers' Benches are convinced that the present taxation is really greater than the people are able to meet.  We say that from personal knowledge and because of our information with regard to the main industry of the country and with regard to the financial and economic condition of the people engaged in that industry.  Attempts have been made to show that we have endeavoured to prove that the whole economic depression existing in the country, with particular reference to agricultural economic depression, is due to overtaxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never said, nor have I ever heard it said on these Benches, that the taxation of the country is the only reason for the economic depression existing in the country.  Nor do I maintain that taxation is the reason, or the main reason, for the economic depression in the country.  I recognise that economic depression is caused by conditions apart largely from taxation, <Col N="1791" /> and on account of the conditions prevailing throughout the world, and that the conditions are not unique in Ireland.  But we do maintain that expenditure, and consequent taxation, is an important factor in the present depression.  We do maintain that the position of the farmer, and, through the farmer, the position of industry and commerce and trade and the condition of employment is influenced to a large extent by taxation.  We are of opinion, and we think that the Minister might deal with it, that taxation must be reduced if the agricultural industry is to go ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as is usual with him when he is caught, so to speak, in a tight corner, and when he is in an unpleasant situation, and has to meet criticism that touches, apparently, rather raw spots in his make-up, resorts, as usual, to a rather insolent type of address to Deputies in this House.  I submit that the Minister has not made his case stronger by throwing insults and taunts across the House, and I call the attention of the House to the fact that this is not the first time that we have had insolence of this kind from the Minister.  Deputies will remember a very unpleasant scene that arose in this House before owing to what I may call a very ill-mannered remark which fell from the Minister for Finance.  We are taunted with futility.  Futility is not a crime, but I maintain that glaring indiscretion on the part of the Minister is a crime, and we have had several instances of glaring indiscretion on the part of the Minister and most flagrant breaches of good taste.</P>
    <P>We could call the attention of the House to the statement made by the Minister on the occasion of the breakdown of the Boundary Commission. The House is cognisant of the statement made on that occasion by the Minister in reference to Mr. Justice Feetham, acknowledged by every man of good feeling and good sense to be altogether beyond the bounds of good taste and altogether beyond the type of criticism that should be used by a Minister towards a responsible judge <Col N="1792" /> who came to this country to do his duty honestly, as we think, on behalf of the Boundary Commission.  We know that the Minister made a statement that he was going to split the Cabinet from top to bottom.</P>

      <P>The Minister thinks that he is meeting the argument with regard to the Geddes Committee by saying that it is silly and futile. He is fond of making statements of that kind.  I wonder if such statements are argument?  In the opinion of the Minister the suggestion is silly and futile, but in the opinion of the House is it silly and futile?  When the British Government set up the Geddes Commission did they regard the suggestion for that Commission as silly and futile?  I am taunted with being a man of one idea, because I happen to be consistent.  That is a crime we cannot accuse the Minister of.  I am a man of one idea because I cannot do as the Minister suggests.  He can go down the country and make speeches and say one thing, and come up here and say another thing in this House.  Consistency, apparently, is not one of the virtues of the Ministry. We are not imputing anything to the Civil Service.  We accept the Minister's statement that the civil servants are all they ought to be, but we are faced with the problem that we are taxed up to a capacity beyond the power of the country to meet, and if such is the case we maintain that we will have to face the facts.  Now we are told that we will not face the facts and will not make suggestions, that we will not deal with matters of policy, and that we are lacking in moral courage on the Farmers' Benches.  We are prepared at any time to make suggestions with regard to matters of policy and with regard to cutting portion of the services.  We have no hesitation in making such suggestions, but we do not think that this is the time to make them, and we know that when we are asked to make such suggestions we are asked to make them on the spot so that we may make hasty, ill-considered suggestions that <Col N="1794" /> can be torn to pieces by the Ministry. We have made suggestions with regard to the reduction of Votes.  We have put them to the House more than once, We have proposed that the salaries of the Parliamentary Secretaries should be reduced.  We have put that to the House and we have been beaten.  We have supported the suggestion of Deputy Johnson that the salary of the Governor-General should be reduced and we were beaten, and if we propose any further reductions they will be put to a vote of the House and Ministers will be supported by the loyal party behind them and our suggestions will be defeated.  Now a great deal of play has been made with the question of policy, and that the House is to be over-ridden in matters of policy and in matters of this kind.  I read twice the terms of reference of the Geddes Commission, and I suggest that similar terms of reference would satisfy us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were not accepted by the Minister or the other Ministers arguing on behalf of the Government, and they were not prepared to give this Commission powers to deal with matters of policy.  We know that a committee of this kind, if set up, would deal with the details of departmental organisation and personnel and would find itself inevitably up against matters of policy before it could achieve any economies worth talking about, but there was no intention, and well the Minister knew it, that it should override or be superior to the House in these matters.  It would simply report to the House, and the House would then, sitting in session, and having full knowledge of its responsibilities, deal with the question of policy.  We know that a reduction in salaries will not involve any great reduction in taxes, but I am not personally satisfied that a thorough overhauling of the services and departments of State by an independent committee would not effect economies, that re-organisations could not be brought about, that changes in the personnel and departmental methods could not be made, and economies thereby effected.  In addition, we think that the committee, viewing things in proper perspective, and not from the point of view of those on <Col N="1795" /> Farmers' benches or the Labour benches, but in an independent manner, would be able to tell us that it would be possible and advisable in the circumstances with which we are faced to make cuts in particular services.  They could suggest that such a service is redundant.  They might say &ldquo;You need not wipe out the whole service but a portion of it; you can cheese-pare in certain directions.&rdquo;  As a result of its recommendations we would be able to achieve something in the way of economy. If that committee is set up we on the Farmers' benches would have no hesitation in going to it and stating what services we are prepared to jettison&mdash;what services must in the financial conditions of the country be jettisoned. We have got no hope from the Minister.  We are faced with the problem that we have a prospect of taxation for the coming year as high as in the past year, and we have Estimates which are really over £2,000,000 higher than payments out of revenue in 1924-25. We are faced with the problem of asking the taxpayer to meet these Estimates in the year of the greatest depression that has fallen on this country for a very long time.  We do not believe the depression in agriculture is a thing of a year.  It is probably a thing of many years.  We will be faced with that possibility for many years, and with the probability that the agriculturists and the taxpayers, owing to the depression, will not be able to meet the demands made on them.  The Minister for Agriculture, as a matter of good tactics, was put up to talk to us.  When he gets up to talk one is always in doubt as to whether we are going to have a cooing turtle dove or a petty sessions lawyer. Yesterday we had the cooing dove.  He was as mild as mother's milk.  Everything Deputy Baxter and I said was more or less right.  We had agreement on the fundamentals and on the premises of our argument.  The farming industry is being greatly hampered by high taxation; it was advisable taxation should be reduced and the farming community would be helped if taxation could be reduced.  We started with that premise.  We were then asked if <Col N="1796" /> we would advise a reduction in the Agricultural Vote.  That was a clever move.  We were taunted with insincerity. Why was not the Minister for Defence put up to defend the Army Vote; the Minister for External Affairs to defend the Vote for External Affairs; the Minister for Fisheries to defend the Fishery Vote?</P>

We tell the Minister we are prepared to face the country on this question. Let the President dissolve Parliament and face the country at a general election on his financial policy, and we will face him.</P>

If he goes to the people they will show him and the Minister for Finance that they do not approve of their financial policy.  We had a speech from Deputy Egan.  I notice he is very likely to come along as a kind of supernumerary supporter of the Ministers when things <Col N="1797" /> are beginning to look shaky.  He is a very excellent apologist for the Government. I do not take Deputy Egan's support of the financial arrangements of the Government in any great seriousness.

      <P>I do not like to make any statements in the Dáil which I would not be prepared to make outside. If the statement conveys that idea to you, or to the Dáil, I think the honourable and the honest thing is to withdraw the statement and I withdraw it.  In winding up I want to point out that we put forward an amendment to the Vote on Account as a protest against the whole policy of the Government with regard to finance as indicated by the Estimates placed in our hands.  The refusal of the Government to meet our demand for a Geddes Committee deals with only one portion of the demand we are making. I may say that the amendment can be looked at from different angles.  This is our angle.  There may be other angles, but from our angle I am going to ask the Dáil to support us.  I am asking Deputies on the Independent Benches who, in different places&mdash;the Chambers of Commerce&mdash;are constantly harping on the necessity for economy, to support us.  It is up to them now to support the assertions and the statements they have made.  They can do so by their votes.</P>

I am putting it to the Deputies on the Labour Benches, if they are satisfied that the provision made in the Estimates meets with their requirements, and if they are satisfied to have £26,000 for the Governor-General <Col N="1799" /> while the Minister for Local Government has reduced the wages of road workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in view of the concluding sentences that have fallen from the Deputy who has moved the amendment, and in view of the statements that were made by Deputy Hewat and Deputy Redmond.  The concluding words from Deputy Heffernan make a case for concentration against the Government forces on the part of one Deputy who thinks that the expenditure could be reduced slightly. An appeal is made to another section to vote against it, because there is not enough given, and to his own party simply to follow up the ramp there is about economy.  After two days' ramp I have heard from Deputy Redmond a suggestion that the Ministry of Fisheries is an expensive institution and the proposal, if his recommendations were to be taken, is that the expenses of that Department should be reduced.  By taking off £1,700, and I presume by including £1,000 or £1,200 for a Parliamentary Secretary, he is to make a saving of £700.  I make him a present of the sum saved in respect to the Minister for External Affairs.  £1,400 of a saving!  I am afraid even the saving that Deputy Redmond contemplates would be discounted by a charge that would fall on the funds by reason of a claim one of the two gentlemen I have mentioned has under the Military Service (Pensions) Act.  The total sum saved by <Col N="1800" /> reason of Deputy Redmond's economies would be £1,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sir J. Craig's statements attracted me in connection with the expensive nature of the medical services in the Army.  They are expensive, and I think the reason of that expensive incidence was explained here last year.  It is not fair to say that the cost of that service should be compared to the real strength of the Army, because other work besides that of attendance on the soldiers and officers of the Army has to be done by the medical officers. When I was Minister for Defence, I know that there were at least three Boards, each one of which would require one or two medical officers in almost constant attendance to deal with claims in respect to the Wounds (Pensions) Act.  Much the same thing can be stated in respect to a number of civil servants whose names are included in the return and who would appear to be doing no other work than acting as secretary to a Minister.  One of those in my own case has acted on three Committees, and there have been many occasions on which I required his services that I was not able to avail of them by reason of his attendance at one of these particular Committees. If we were to pay attention to this ramp that has been started on economy, this brainless, useless, nonconstructive portrayal of the country's infirmities&mdash;it is nothing short of it&mdash; we would come to the conclusion that this country was bankrupt.  Is it bankrupt?</P>

It would be bankrupt if all the people of the country were the same as the Deputy who has just spoken&mdash;bankrupt in intelligence, bankrupt in initiative, bankrupt in everything of use to the country. The other evening when I taxed a Deputy about comparing the Civil <Col N="1801" /> Service here with other countries, he said that was not his business.  He said: &ldquo;It is your business.&rdquo;  That is the critic!  &ldquo;If you can prove to me that our Civil Service is not more expensive than that of Germany, France or Denmark I am satisfied.&rdquo;  The Deputy seeks to get a majority by a combination that could not possibly maintain a Government.  If the three Parties he has invited to effect this particular economy were to succeed and were to remove the present Government from office, will they form a Government?</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat's contribution was to the effect that we were probably exceeding the taxable capacity of the country.  I failed to gather from Deputy Connor Hogan or Deputy Heffernan what tax they wish to reduce.  I heard two speeches. One lasted over an hour and the other might have been prolonged.  It was capable of considerable elasticity.  I did not hear either of them mention a tax that was hurting or a tax that was grinding.  There is no tax on tea. There is a small tax on sugar.  There is a tariff imposed with a view to rehabilitating the industrial activity of the country.  It was put on for that purpose.  It brings in revenue, but revenue was not the purpose for which it was intended.  The tax on motors, I am sure, does not affect the people for <Col N="1803" /> whom Deputy Connor Hogan or Deputy Heffernan speaks.  I am sure that the tax on beer and spirits does not hurt them.  I am positive that it is not the case either with the Corporation Profit Tax.  I am sure it is not the case with regard to the four shillings in the pound income tax.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points to be considered.  The real point which we have not been considering, and which is to a very large extent inseparable from the Estimates, is the means by which we are to discharge the obligations in the Estimates.  It is perfectly permissible to go into the second point, because it has been urged that taxation is heavy.  There is a particular item, I take it, in the Estimates that was not there last year.  I think it will be admitted by Deputy Connor Hogan and Deputy Heffernan that <Col N="1805" /> when last year's Budget was announced here they were perfectly satisfied.  They might not have expressed themselves as being perfectly satisfied, but it was better than they anticipated, much better.  The Deputy shakes his head.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Both; one is inseparable from the other.  Deputy Hewat when he made his statement did not really go into the Estimates.  He touched on them lightly, and the main point that he made was whether the weight of the Estimates was not too much and if we were getting beyond our taxable capacity.  In that connection we are told that agriculture is in a depressed condition.  We are told that the railways are in a depressed condition and I think at least one Deputy mentioned that there was a remarkable drop in the deposits in the banks last year.  These things getting out will, of course, not increase the confidence or the buoyancy which is almost inseparable from an improvement in business.  Since I came into the Dáil this evening I have taken the trouble to look over the Stock Exchange quotations for the banks.  I find that in one case a bank's stock was quoted in 1922 between £6 and £7, while the present price is £7.  Another bank's stock ran from £16 to £19.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a good many people making free with the banks in 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The present quotation of that bank is £20.  The quotation for a third bank was between £10 and £12, while the present quotation is £13 10s.  Another bank ran from £195 to £238, and at present the price is £275.  Another bank was from £4 2s. 5d. to £6 10s., the present price being £7 7s. 6d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not put in the case of the largest reserve, but I will indicate in a moment or two what it amounts to. The total reserves amounted in the case of the four banks to two and a half millions, and the reserves now amount to £3,300,000.  The fourth bank put £230,000 to reserve last year and the <Col N="1806" /> same amount the previous year.  The other figures are slightly complicated by reason of certain adjustments that had to be made, and in order not to mislead anybody, or to take advantage of what Deputy Hewat and Deputy Good know happened in the case of the particular bank in question, I simply put it down at an average of £250,000 a year in the case of that last bank. That is £1,300,000 of an increase in reserves since 1923.  There is another well-known firm whose quotations in 1922 were somewhere about 40 and now the equivalent figure is 110.</P>

As the Deputy occupied a very considerable time in addressing the Dáil on two occasions, when he gave those figures, it is really asking me too much to provide Deputy Heffernan with figures that he ought to have heard if he were here when they were given.  The case I am putting up is, if there is depression in particular cases, there is also evidence of an increase in the value of the capital of very important institutions in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>On the main motion now before the House, I want to raise a matter which involves a question of Government policy and, as such, is a matter of some importance. I propose to call the attention of the Dáil to a certain number of public servants who were removed from their positions because of complicity, or alleged complicity, in the troubles of 1922 and 1923 and whose cases have been before the Executive Council for almost two years.  There has been no decision so far by the Executive Council. I will delay the Dáil for a few moments to give a brief history of the case.  We know that during the pre-Truce period, when there was trouble with the British, there were many public servants, among them several teachers, who took an active part one way or another in the fight against the British.  They were employed, either actively as Volunteers, or as Intelligence Officers, or in other ways. At the time of the Treaty, not all of them, unlike the bulk of the people, went in a certain way.  Some of them took up an attitude of opposition to the Treaty and got involved in the trouble that took place afterwards. Some took an active part against the <Col N="1811" /> Government after the Treaty in the civil war.  Some got involved, although they did not take an active part, and were arrested or charged, rightly or wrongly, for taking such part.  In any case they were interned, and at the general release in 1923 they came out and went back to their schools.  They took up the positions they had before the trouble began and continued in them.  I raised this matter two or three times during the latter part of 1923 and eventually, about January, 1924, a special Advisory Committee was set up by the Government to call these people before them, to examine into their cases and to see whether or not they should be continued in the public service.  For one reason or another, which it is unnecessary to go into now, the Committee did not get to work until August, 1924.  They were then called before this Committee.  As a result, a certain number of them were allowed back and a certain number were not allowed back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it became known in October, 1924, that about twenty of these persons were not to be reinstated, deputations from the organisation which I represent met the Executive Council and met individually several members of the Council, and written communications were sent to them.  On one occasion Deputy Johnson accompanied me to see the President on this matter. Representations were made in many directions.  On the 9th April last year, a letter was addressed to me saying that the decision, which had been come to, did not preclude the reconsideration of any individual case upon personal application.  I want to lay special stress on that point because it is of more importance than appears on the face of it.  This personal application for a reconsideration of the case was insisted upon by the Government, and indeed I was rather led to believe that it was insisted on because such personal application by the individuals concerned would indicate that they were prepared personally to submit their cases to the Government and that they would, therefore, be acknowledging the right of the Government either to reinstate or dismiss them.  At that <Col N="1812" /> time, certain supporters of these people took up the attitude that the ordinary procedure with regard to collective bargaining should be insisted upon, and that the organisation which took up the case of these individuals should take up their case collectively and not individually.  That organisation took the view that, seeing that what had occurred and considering the circumstances in which it occurred, it was not unreasonable for the Government to insist that personal application would be made by each individual for reconsideration of his or her particular case and that if any one of them refused to do that, we would not support their case.  They took our advice and every one of them made application personally to have their cases reconsidered. I believe they all did so.  At any rate, I am only speaking for those who did, and if anyone refused to do so, that is his own concern.  I believe they all made that personal application. That was in May or June last year.  Some who did not appear before the Committee previously were called before it and three or four of them have since been reinstated.</P>
    <P>Up to this moment, however, in spite of repeated representations on our part, no decision has been communicated to either those who are making representations on their behalf, or to the individual teachers as to whether or not their individual applications for reinstatement have been considered.  I quite agree that there were many reasons for the delay, and I would hope that the final decision has not suffered by that delay, because we know that the further we get away from the unfortunate incidents of 1922 and 1923 the more likely are we to have a favourable decision on the matter.  That is briefly the history of the case.  So far as I know, there are some ten or twelve individuals now concerned. Some of them have despaired of any settlement being made in their case and a few have left the country.  Some of these men and women are actually working all this time in their schools. They are not in the same position as civil servants.  If the Government dismisses a civil servant he leaves his office and goes out of work.  That is <Col N="1813" /> not their position.  They are in their schools and are working there with the approval and consent of their managers, and with the approval of the people in the district.  No objections have been made; indeed, a request has been made that they should be reinstated. The Government have refused to recognise them and have refused to pay their salaries.</P>
    <P>This is what happened: One of these men was arrested in the autumn of 1922.  It was supposed he was arrested because of certain correspondence which he had written.  I do not know, and I have no means of knowing, why he was arrested.  He was brought to Sligo jail.  I put down a question on the matter and I got a communication from the Department of Defence in which it was definitely stated that as they had no evidence to show he was actively engaged in assisting the Irregulars, and as he had signed the usual form which we all know prisoners had to sign, he was released.  That communication is on record and the Department have it on their files, because I sent them a copy.  He came back to his school, continued teaching and was paid his salary.  He got a summons; a summons went out to anybody who happened to be interned or caught in the mesh.  He had been paid his salary all along and he did not go before the Advisory Committee.  He told me the reason he did not go before the Advisory Committee was that he did not believe he was implicated, inasmuch as he was getting his salary.  He was then dismissed.  That was on 30th April last, and he has not been paid one penny since.  He is continuing his work in the school.</P>
    <P>He made personal application for a reconsideration of his case and all this time he is awaiting a decision.  There was a case of a man in Dublin, a very active Volunteer in the old days, whose company took a certain attitude in regard to the Treaty, and he went into the Four Courts.  At the fall of the Four Courts he was lodged in Mountjoy and was kept there until the general release in 1923.  He went straight back to his school and has been working there ever since.  The <Col N="1814" /> Department have the means of finding out whether or not that man has been engaged in any illegal activities since. So far as I or anyone in any way connected with him can discover, he has not been.  He may have made&mdash;and possibly did make&mdash;a mistake in adopting a certain attitude, but when he was released he went back to the school. The general attitude of the Government may be summed up by a letter which I received from the Minister for Finance early last year.  I would ask Deputies to note this letter especially because I believe it states the attitude of the Government fairly.  This is an extract from the letter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We are really most anxious to overlook past complicity in the Irregular movement wherever there are reasonable grounds for anticipating proper behaviour in the future.  That this is our policy is manifest from our action in reinstating men who were actually sentenced to death by courtmartial and had their sentences commuted only by the merest good fortune.  On the whole you may take it as certain that the Government in making its decision, although dealing with past offences, was guided no more by the former activities of the teachers concerned than by their present attitude and behaviour.  We felt that we could undertake the responsibility of overlooking the complicity of teachers with Irregulars only when their present good dispositions justified us in anticipating proper conduct for the future.</P>
    <P>That sums up the Government attitude and it was affirmed on several occasions by the President in the course of interviews.  The Government were not concerned with what men had done in the past&mdash;they were willing to wipe the slate so far as that was concerned &mdash;but they were not satisfied with regard to the future.  That is quite an understandable attitude.  I will now instance how they judged what the future conduct should be.  This man appeared before the Advisory Committee. No indication was given as to the procedure that would be adopted, <Col N="1815" /> or whether the men would be tried. Some men regarded it as a kind of trial and they got legal advice as to how they should proceed.  The lawyer advised them: &ldquo;Do not answer any questions which will incriminate you.  You are not bound to answer any such questions.&rdquo;  I understand some of these men took up the attitude before the Advisory Committee of saying nothing with regard to questions which they thought would incriminate them.  It was afterwards held against them that they were not straight with the Committee because they did not answer such questions.  Allowance should be made for the fact that these men were going there not knowing what they were expected to do, or what the Government attitude towards them was.</P>
    <P>It has been said in some quarters that these men refused to sign an undertaking. My information is that no undertaking was ever put before them; they were never asked to sign an undertaking.  These men, since they were released, have been carrying on their work.  More than two years have elapsed in some cases.  Have any charges been made against them since? Are they guilty of any further illegalities? Is it not now clear to the Government, if it is the future rather than the past they are concerned with, that these men have proved they are quite willing to obey the law and give good service in their positions in future? The managers of the schools&mdash;the parish priest in most cases&mdash;have approved of the teachers being there, and the people of the district have also approved.  No matter what the decision of the Government may be, that state of affairs may go on.  The teacher will remain there because it is a matter for the manager and not for the Government or the Department to put him out of the school.  Is it better that that man would be under the authority of the Department and the Government, bound to obey the rules and regulations of the Department under the supervision of inspectors, or that he should carry on without any responsibility to the Government, the Department or the inspectors, and have full <Col N="1816" /> liberty to do as he likes in the matter of instilling doctrines that he should not instil into the minds of his pupils?  Undoubtedly a man will feel he has a grievance if he asks the Government to put him back into his job and the Government reply: &ldquo;No, we will keep you out; we will not reinstate you.&rdquo;  I think it would be a better proposition for the State if the Government were to say: &ldquo;We will treat you magnanimously. We will put you back into your place and recognise you.&rdquo;  That would create a better impression in every way and it would be a surer way of making the man a better citizen than leaving him, as he is now, with a sense of grievance and with a feeling that after all old scores might be forgotten. It was, perhaps, merely by the toss of a button that he was on one side or the other.  Fate was, perhaps, too much for him.</P>
    <P>There are all these considerations and, in view of the length of time that has elapsed, in view of the advisability of healing old sores and closing old wounds, and in view of the spirit of peace that exists between people who were enemies in 1921-22, I hold it is wrong not to recognise those men who are anxious to come into the service of the State.  I hold that teachers are different, in this way, from civil servants. The civil servant, if he is inclined to anti-State activity, is in a position to do a good deal of harm. The teacher is not so directly concerned. I have nothing to say for any teacher who would use his position in the school to do what he should not do.  So far as I am concerned, or anybody for whom I speak, the Government is free to take any action that it considers right in connection with any such teacher who so uses his position in the school.  I have no sympathy whatever with action of that kind.  What I am putting to the Government is that by recognising these men and paying them they will be in a position to control their activities.  The claim is made now by practically every member of the organisation with which I am connected that these old sores should be closed, but while that claim is made now, I promise the Government that if it were <Col N="1817" /> found that these men offended after reinstatement and recognition, they would have no sympathy whatever among the general body of teachers. The teachers would have regard to the fact that the Government, having the right to dismiss and dispense with the services of these people&mdash;a right which I do not deny&mdash;would have done the big thing and the right thing in putting these teachers back.  If, in those circumstances, they betrayed their trust in any way, I can assure the Ministry that neither the general body of teachers nor I personally would have any sympathy whatsoever with them. The Executive Council has let this matter drag on for quite a long time.  No decision has been taken.  Perhaps, in one way, that has been an advantage, because the farther away we get from those things the less important do they appear and the less is the desire for punishment.  They have been punished severely already.  They are now almost three years without recognition of their service.  Many of them have suffered great hardships in that time. I do put it to the Government that the time has come when they might deal in a proper way with this rankling sore in the organisation of teachers.  There is no question of danger because there are only ten or twelve teachers concerned altogether, and, of these, three are women.  Possibly, this matter counts for more than it really should amongst teachers.  This demand has been made by every branch of the teachers' organisation, and the Government knows that the vast majority of the teachers are supporters of the State, if not of the present Government Party.  I do not want to go into individual cases, but I indicated a couple of cases in which there is grave doubt as to whether or not there was real activity on the part of these men.  I do not know what took place before the Advisory Committee or what evidence the Government have in regard to them, but there has been no public trial.  In one case I quoted, the man actually signed the form, was let out and got back to his work.</P>
    <P>There were other cases where the men were very active, indeed, against the Government while the fight was on. <Col N="1818" /> But the Government have reinstated a man who was found in arms in an ambush against Government troops. He, as was indicated in the letter of the Minister for Finance, was actually sentenced to death.  On the other hand, a man who used foolish language in answer to a heckler at a public meeting on the occasion of an election has not been reinstated.  If we were all answerable for the statements we use on platforms at election times, especially in reply to hecklers, few, I am afraid, would escape.  To say that the greater number of these men were foolish, would probably be to describe their conduct accurately.  But what I plead for is a wiping of the slate and the putting of these men back in their jobs.  No good purpose will be served, but a good deal of rankling discontent will be engendered, by leaving them in the position they are in.  Comparatively, it is a small question, but it means a good deal to the individuals concerned.  It may be said that these men made no move themselves in the matter, but the position is as I explained. They made a personal application for reconsideration of their cases on the advice of their organisation. Having done that they thought that they had done all that they were asked to do.  They have never been asked to do anything else.  They have had no communication whatsoever from the Government since they made their personal application, except merely an acknowledgement.  I do hope that the Ministry will see their way to accede to the request that has been made to them by the whole body of teachers, and by people on this side of the House on more than one occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add one word to what Deputy O'Connell has said.  My interest in this matter is through the manager of a school where one of these teachers is at present working.  The teacher is perfectly satisfactory.  His conduct, from the point of view of the manager, who is a very strong supporter of the State, is quite satisfactory.  As a teacher he stands high.  The manager does not desire that he should be removed, but the difficulty that he is in at present is that, while the teacher is not being <Col N="1819" /> paid, and while there is no indication of the policy of the Ministry, if there was to be a change the manager would be in a very difficult position in trying to remove a man who has given satisfaction, both to the manager and to the parents.  In a rural district, as we know, it is not very difficult to stir up considerable strife as to who the teacher is to be, and I believe that while the conditions at the moment are such as to give no cause for alarm, the attitude of the Ministry should be to adopt what the manager in each case would be prepared to state to the Ministry. I think it is nearly true in every case that the manager is prepared to accept the teacher and I think the policy of the Ministry should be to wipe the slate and leave things as they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the plea made by Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Baxter.  As Deputy O'Connell said, I attended with him as one of a deputation to the President on this point.  Therefore I have a little knowledge of the case that was made, and some knowledge, perhaps, of the attitude of the Ministry with regard to it.  But that is, I suppose, twelve months ago, and quite a number of things have happened since that, I would hope, would affect the minds of the Government.  It is not necessary to re-state the position, following Deputy O'Connell, except to emphasise the point he made, that the teachers concerned are, in fact, teaching in schools.  It was urged that the Government should not accept liability, in the way of payments, for men or women who, they had reason to think, were not loyal citizens, that their effect upon, shall I say, the growth of civic morality was such that they could not be trusted.  That argument is never used in respect of teachers as a whole. Its weakness lies in the fact that these teachers are in a position, and have been for some time, to do all the evil things that may be charged as possibilities against them, that the evil effects, if there are such, of their reinstatement remain as they have been for the last two or three years, and that the children are being infected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the Government's responsibility, true.  But whosoever responsibility it is, the Government are parties, in a way, by the very fact that there are teachers in daily contact with these suspects and they are being recognised and paid. I do not know what the actual point of distinction is between the people who are still unrecognised and others who were not active in their particular districts in the actual leading of the opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Deputy from Clare who has been speaking a good deal on another subject is familiar with the actions of a teacher who was most active in that part of the country and who has been reinstated. I am very doubtful where the line of distinction can be drawn.  I am afraid that it is an arbitrary line which cannot be fairly defended.  But supposing it can, I am going to ask the House to remember the incident that happened here two days ago.  You had the entry into the House of Deputy Sean MacCurtain.  He had been imprisoned for several years, with a number of other men arrested by the Northern Government, in circumstances similar to his own.  As a result of representations made, amongst others by the Ministry, of pressure brought to bear on Ministers in the North and Ministers in London, and the demand by the public for reasonable consideration of their cases, these men were released, and it was proclaimed that this was an evidence of a new spirit which was intended to wipe the slate clean, so that life could go on free from those grievances which had been in the minds of many for quite a long time.  I ask that that same idea should be given effect to in the case of the teachers. Taking into account the statement made by Deputy O'Connell, the assumption underlying this plea is that these teachers are willing to enter into and to undertake to give loyal service.  If that is the assumption, the answer must be that you will not accept their promise. I think it will be difficult to distinguish between the promises made under these circumstances by any of <Col N="1821" /> these teachers and the promises made by hundreds of others who have been reinstated in one position or another whose past conduct was at least as reprehensible in the minds of the Government as that of the teachers concerned, and I cannot, on the logic of the case, see what reason the Government can have for refusing to reinstate at this stage.</P>
    <P>But, apart from that, I would ask them to give expression in these cases to the same spirit as was shown when a plea was made and a response given by the Northern Government and the British Government in respect to Deputy Sean MacCurtain and a number of others.  Supposing these men are not reinstated, what is going to be the position?  As sure as anything in politics there will, some time in the future, be a change, at least, in the personnel of the Government, and also, as sure as anything in politics, these men, staying on at their schools, will eventually be reinstated by some Government at some time in the future.  If that is admitted, what, then, will be the value of maintaining this sense of grievance in their minds until that day comes?  Is it that you desire to punish? If it is punishment, then one can understand it, but if it is not a desire to punish, and if it is admitted as a likely thing, as almost a certain thing, that if these men remain on at their schools as they are to-day that eventually they will be reinstated, is it not better, in every interest, that they should be reinstated now than to have a sense of grievance carrying on and a temptation, at least, to convey those grievance to the children and the people round about them?  I think that every consideration should be given to the plea that is made now publicly on behalf of these men and women, and I hope the Government will accede to the representations that have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was addressing <Col N="1824" /> myself to Deputy Gorey's argument and was showing him where it led to.  Deputy O'Connell has raised this question and has put it very strongly before the Government again and again.  He pleaded the cause of these teachers in interviews with different Ministers, and in writing he put different considerations up to the Government.  During the last twelve months, and even longer, the matter has been again and again considered by the Government.  The Executive Council weighed all the circumstances of the case for and against.  So far as leniency to the teachers who were guilty of complicity in armed resistance to the State is concerned, the Government feels that it has gone to the limit. It is not a question of amnesty.  I would ask Deputies in the different parts of the House to understand that.  The question is whether men who were guilty of complicity in armed resistance against the State should have their conduct overlooked.  Their conduct was the subject of a careful investigation by a committee of men who served the old Dáil.  At least two of the members of the committee were in the old Dáil, and all were in the old movement before the split.  These men carefully considered all the evidence that was put up in these cases.  They decided that in a number of cases the Government had no reasonable grounds &mdash;I might say no shadow of ground&mdash; for believing that the future conduct of these teachers, so far as unconstitutional action against the State was concerned, would be better than it was in the past.  Hence it is that the Government, having weighed and fully considered the arguments in favour of wiping the slate clean, are compelled to come to the decision that what I may call the final findings of this committee on the matter must stand, and that in, I think, fourteen or seventeen cases&mdash;I am not certain of the number &mdash;the complicity cannot be overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first batch were interviewed by the Committee some time in the summer of 1924.  About a year after three more were interviewed.  I wish to make it quite clear   decision was based on opinions that these men <Col N="1825" /> held&mdash;even the voicing of those opinions.  It was only if they were concerned in armed resistance or in the organisation of armed resistance, or helping, promoting or inciting to armed resistance.  So far as reinstatement was concerned, complicity even was not regarded as a bar&mdash;again, I say, not to amnesty, but even to being received back and receiving their salaries from the State that they had been trying to overthrow.  Complicity was not regarded as a bar unless it was complicated by other circumstances, especially the circumstance I have now to mention, that having fully considered the case the Government came to the conclusion that the future attitude of those individuals could not be depended upon.  I want to make that quite clear.</P>

      <P>As I said, Deputy O'Connell in the interests of those teachers put up the case, and in a memorandum which he submitted he stressed portion of a reply from the Minister for Finance that &ldquo;the Government was most anxious to overlook past complicity in the Irregular movement wherever there were reasonable grounds for anticipating proper behaviour in future.&rdquo;  I may say that so far as the teachers are concerned the Government consider that much greater leniency was shown in their case than in the case of any of the ordinary public servants.  There were in all some 55 cases considered.  In a number of these cases, say about 20, complicity was not established, and when I say &ldquo;not established&rdquo; very often the phrase used is &ldquo;not fully established.&rdquo; In a number of cases&mdash;some 18 altogether&mdash;complicity was found, and it was determined that the circumstances were such that the Government might exercise leniency, and the Government determined to exercise leniency.  There were two cases in which there had been sentences of death which had been commuted to penal servitude and then an amnesty.  In these cases the Government believed their protestations of good conduct in future. In another case a man was sentenced to 15 years penal servitude.  These cases were overlooked and the teachers were allowed to go back, because there did seem to be a chance that they would turn over a new leaf.  In at least one of those cases evidence has since come to light that that promise has not been kept&mdash;that one at least of the individuals is still a member of an illegal military organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Some of the cases I can tell of are not malicious.  It is quite true that a number&mdash;I think 18 or so out of 20&mdash;did apply to have the cases re-examined. They were re-examined, and even after that I think about three or four were reinstated and it was agreed that they should get their salaries.  It is said that a lot of allowance should be made for the circumstances.  I think I have shown that the Government did make a good deal of allowance and, as far as the Government can see the matter, they could not reasonably, having regard to their sense of duty to the country, make more allowance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson raised the question as to what any future Government will do in those particular cases.  This particular Government can hardly be expected to answer that or be responsible for that.  They have quite enough to be responsible for at the moment.  They have to use the lights they have in considering the conduct of these particular, shall I call them, semi-public servants. That is to say, the Government have weighed all the arguments for restoration and against restoration and wherever they considered there was any reason for tilting the scale in favour of leniency, that is the course that they have followed.  It is not a question as to whether a person may be perfectly satisfactory as a teacher.  He may be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">

      <P>He may be satisfactory even from that point of view and still there may be no good reason for believing that he would be satisfactory from the State's point of <Col N="1828" /> view.  I will say that all along the assumption underlying Deputy O'Connell's plea was that the teachers were willing to give loyal service.  That is one of the principal differences between Deputy O'Connell and the Government. The Government feel that in these particular cases they cannot rely on anything which by any stretch of the imagination could be called a reasonable likelihood of loyal service from those individuals.</P>

      <P>I would like to say, in regard to what the Minister for Education has just announced, if this is the final word on behalf of the Government, that I regret it exceedingly. With regard to the guilt or complicity of these people, the manner in which that guilt was established, if it had been established, was not satisfactory. It was never established in any regular court in any public way.  An Advisory Committee was set up, and the teachers were called before it, but they got no opportunity whatsoever of seeing any charge made against them until they came before the Committee.  There is nothing on record except the report of the Committee, which none of us have seen, as to what took place.  We have varying accounts of what took place. The Minister himself says that they were asked hypothetical questions.</P>
      <P>Now a man after coming out from prison is not always in the best position to answer hypothetical questions at an inquiry of this kind.  I want to stress this: the manner in which their guilt, if they were guilty, was established was rather peculiar.  It was certainly not established in open court where they could have had the help of a legal adviser if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the man Flynn; he was imprisoned for some foolish letters that he wrote, and was afterwards released because he signed a form and went back to his school.  There has been no charge against him since, so far as I know.  The Minister says he was not satisfied with any assurances that they gave or could give as to what their <Col N="1829" /> conduct would be in the future.  I put it this way: Two and a half years have elapsed and these men are teaching in their schools, and it is not said, and I do not think the Minister can say in the case of those on whose behalf I am pleading, that they have done anything otherwise than shown their inclination to obey the law and carry on their work in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Department, although, in effect, they are not under the jurisdiction of the Department.</P>
    <P>Now, what method has been taken by the Government to find out whether or not they are prepared to give assurances? What method has been taken to find out whether or not they are prepared to give those assurances that they are asked for?  It is not satisfactory to ask hypothetical questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They were also asked definitely if they would give an oral promise and they refused.  The hypothetical questions had reference to written declarations put before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'CONNELL Mr. T. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can gather, in no case did they get any satisfactory explanation of what was being asked of them.  They said they would do as any other teacher would do, namely, carry out the rules and obey the Department.  They understood that was what was being asked of them, and they gave that assurance. One wrote in afterwards, and said he quite misunderstood what was being asked of him, and that he was quite prepared to give any assurance necessary upon his side.  As Deputy Norton has said, two and a half years have elapsed since that time, and they know perhaps better to-day.  That period of probation, if you like, has been served by those teachers.  I do not see why the Government are adopting this attitude. There is no danger to the State and I make a plea again that the Government should reconsider their attitude to these teachers.  I put this to the President and the Minister for Education, that if these teachers should make personal application again for the reconsideration of their cases they should get the opportunity of appearing <Col N="1830" /> before the Committee, or before some committee, in order to re-state their position and attitude.  They never got such an opportunity.  They were never again invited to appear before the Committee in any way.  I think it is hardly fair that they should be judged entirely by their attitude before that Committee.</P>
      <P>They were brought into a private room before three members of the Advisory Committee; they did not know what was to take place; some of them were legally advised not to answer any questions that would incriminate themselves in any way.  Now their whole career is being judged by what took place before that Committee.  I do not think, in all the circumstances, that that could be regarded as fair, and I strongly urge the Minister for Education and the Executive Council to review the cases and to give these men an opportunity of stating their position and their attitude towards the Government and towards the State.  I believe if that is done they will satisfy the Government that they are prepared to give loyal service, and to give any assurances that may be necessary to that effect.  If they are concerned with any illegally organised body, or are not prepared to say that they will not be concerned with any such body, I have nothing to say for them, but I think they would give any assurances in that direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I would raise a question regarding the delay in bringing to trial certain <Col N="1832" /> prisoners.  The first case is one of J.J. Mack, and the second is C.F. Ridgeway's case.  Mack is charged with murder. There was already a trial for the murder of one named, I think, Bergin, and the prisoner on trial then was, if I remember rightly, found not guilty. The facts of the case have been already made public.  The prisoner in question, Mack, was never tried.  He was arrested in October, and it was expected and promised he would be tried by the court that opened on the 9th March.  His friends have now been informed that his case is not likely to come before the court until June.  Inasmuch as the case in question is a matter of a murder which was committed in December, 1925, and that it could not be and probably is not a case where the evidence has to be sought, or the facts in regard to the crime have to be sought, I think there is no good reason for the continued detention and imprisonment of the person who is under charge of murder, and the continued postponement of his trial.  The other case is the one of Charles F. Ridgeway, organiser of the Transport General Workers' Union, a very much milder case.  The charge is one of conspiracy and intimidation.  The case came before the District Court in Dublin on 8th July last year.  He was remanded on bail to the Circuit Court commencing on the 14th July.  He was brought up at that court, and placed in the dock about 2 o'clock that day, and was informed by the judge that the case would be heard at the November Circuit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, of course, is quite a simple case.  The court opened on the 17th November, and there was no word of the case during the time the judge sat. He attended on bail, and of course when the court ceased its sitting he remained a free man untried.  He was then notified to attend the court sitting on 16th February this year.  Towards the latter end of the sitting he was notified that the case was to be tried about two o'clock on a certain day. When the case was called, a consultation took place between the barristers and the judge, during which Mr. Carrigan, the Crown Prosecutor, offered to drop the case on terms.  This is a <Col N="1833" /> rather extraordinary incident&mdash;or at least I hope it is&mdash;in the course of a prosecution by the State to have an offer made to withdraw the case if a certain thing entirely unconnected with the case took place, that being that some guarantee be given that the pickets who were acting as strike pickets outside the Metropole would be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>This was an offer made to the prisoner and his representative which, after being refused, was mentioned in public in the court.  I cannot understand why the Crown Prosecutor or the State Prosecutor, in a case of that kind, should go out of his way to offer to withdraw a prosecution if something was done which was not connected with the case and why the prisoner should be allowed to go free.  No undertaking was given in respect of these strike pickets; the prisoner was remanded again and his case will not come up until perhaps June.  I do not know when, but at least it will be some time hence.  That is to say, the fourth court will have been held in this simple case before the man's trial takes place. He has had to have, in attendance, witnesses each time he was called up, and men cannot be reasonably expected to leave their work to come to the assistance of the prisoner, time after time, in such circumstances. Now the unpleasant feature of this case, that seems to me to demand a certain amount of consideration if not explanation, is that the Crown Solicitor or the State Solicitor is interested in the concern, and his near relatives have been very intimately interested in the concern over which this trouble occurred.  The brother of the State Solicitor, once a partner, is a director of the Metropole Company, and the father, who died a year ago, was chairman of the company.</P>
    <P>It is not pleasant to think that, acting on the instigation of the State Solicitor, Mr. Corrigan, the brother of the director of the company, at which premises the strike exists, should make a proposition in regard to the strike which, if accepted, would mean the release of the prisoner.  Why there should have been a further remand in these circumstances is, in my opinion, an <Col N="1834" /> extraordinary proceeding and requires consideration and explanation.  The case should not have been mentioned; the offer should not have been made; no proposal for dropping the charge should have been made on conditions of that kind, and if the proposal to drop the charge were made on conditions which might be justified, and if those conditions were not accepted, the charge should have been proceeded with.  I say it is unfair to the prisoner in such circumstances.  I am assuming, when I talk of the general question of delay in bringing prisoners to trial, that this is not a peculiar case, that it is not an isolated case, and that there are frequent delays in bringing prisoners to trial.  I think that the utmost possible effort should be made to avoid continuous remands and continuous imprisonments where men are not on remand, and that prisoners should be tried at the earliest possible moment, even if it may mean an increase in the judiciary.  If this is an isolated case, if it does not represent a considerable number of similar delays in bringing prisoners to trial, then I think some explanation is required as to why in this particular case the matter has not been brought to an issue long ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether the notice that Deputy Johnson gave covered quite all the matters which he raised.  He warned me through you, sir, that he intended to raise the general question of delay in bringing prisoners to trial, with special reference to two cases&mdash;ex-Lieut. Joseph Mack and the case of Mr. Ridgeway.  He has, of course, raised other matters.  He has complained of certain proposals or certain alleged action on the part of counsel for the State in connection with one case.  And, very strangely from him, he seems to have complained of the action of the judge in the case.  He said it is very difficult to understand why there should have been a further remand in these circumstances and that it requires some explanation.  It is not for me to say why there was a further remand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>But when a case of this kind is brought before the court it is presumed by the judge, without doubt, that there is evidence in the hands of the Crown, to be brought before the court, in relation to the prisoner; also when the representative of the State puts forward a plea that there should be a further remand, it is almost automatically given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time I recognise that I am emphasising what must be very obvious to the Deputy when I say it is not for me to explain judicial action, and the remand was judicial action.  Every remand in this case was judicial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of the delay in bringing prisoners to trial, there has, of course, been inevitable delay in the last few years.  We had the beginning of a new judicial system and certain parts of the machinery were revised. It was, for instance, provided in the Courts of Justice Act of 1924 that there would be a Court of the High Court Circuit, and that criminal cases outside the criminal jurisdiction of the Circuit Judge would be referred to that.  For various reasons, with which it is unnecessary to deal now, it was thought better not to proceed to constitute that Court of the High Court Circuit, but simply to have a Central Criminal Court dealing with cases outside the criminal jurisdiction of the Circuit Judges, and the Courts of Justice Act of 1926 was introduced for the purpose of enabling these accumulated cases to be tried in the Central Criminal Court and to provide as speedy a trial as possible for prisoners awaiting trial. When that Act passed a sitting of the Central Criminal Court was held in the month of January.  At that time there were 120 cases for trial before the Court.  The Court sat on 18 working days and finally disposed of 20 cases. The nature of the cases brought for trial before the Central Criminal Court in January were for the most part murder, attempted murder, and so on, and a considerable period of time was <Col N="1836" /> necessary for the determination of one case.  For instance, at the January sitting of the court three murder cases occupied half of the 18 working days. The Central Criminal Court adjourned in January to enable the Circuit Court Judge to take up the criminal business of the Circuit Court.  The Circuit Judge sat until the beginning of March and upon his adjourning, the Central Criminal Court resumed its sitting on the 9th March and will adjourn to-morrow until the 14th April, when the present sittings will be continued until the 23rd April.  At the beginning of the present sittings 110 cases were on the books for trial at the Central Criminal Court; of these, 23 have been disposed of up to date, leaving 87 still to be heard.  At the sittings of the Central Criminal Court and Circuit Court the hearing of cases is arranged with a view to giving priority to those cases in which the defendants are in custody.</P>
    <P>After the passing of the Courts of Justice Act, 1926, it was found that some persons were in custody for a considerable period, and their cases have been given priority over other custody cases where the period of imprisonment awaiting trial is less.  A few exceptions have been made to this general practice and then only because the particular nature of the case and its importance demanded an early trial.  Accordingly it must be remembered that the fact that 87 cases remained for trial at the Central Criminal Court does not mean that 87 persons are in custody.  In roughly 70 of these cases the defendants are on bail and there are only 22 persons in custody at the moment awaiting trial at the Central Criminal Courts.  Of these 22 some five or six have already been placed upon their trial but, by reason of disagreements of the juries, have been remanded for a further trial. With a view to clearing off all arrears it has been arranged that there will be a continuous sitting of a Criminal Court at Green Street Courthouse until the end of the month of July.  Upon the conclusion of the present sittings of the Central Criminal Court on the 23rd April next, the Circuit Judge will open a fresh criminal sitting of the <Col N="1837" /> Circuit Court, which will last from the 27th April to the end of May.  On the 2nd of June a fresh sitting of the Central Criminal Court will be held and will continue until the 2nd July, when the Circuit Judge will resume again and continue his sittings until the end of July.</P>
    <P>With regard to the particular cases mentioned by the Deputy, Joseph Mack, who was charged with the murder of one Joseph Bergin, was arrested on the 23rd October, 1925, and was returned for trial to the Central Criminal Court on the 20th November, 1925.  The next sitting of the Central Criminal Court after his remand for trial was held in January, but as I have already pointed out, it was ascertained that there were awaiting trial at that sitting many persons who had been in custody for a longer period than Mack, and accordingly their cases got priority. Similarly, at the present sittings of the Central Criminal Court, persons who had been longer in custody were given priority over him, and only in a few cases, where, owing to their importance, immediate trial was necessary, were persons in a shorter period than Mack tried.  I have had inquiries made and am informed that Mack will probably be tried before the present sittings of the Central Criminal Court end &mdash;that is, on some day between the 14th and 23rd April.</P>
    <P>In the other case mentioned by the Deputy, C.F. Ridgeway, the defendant, was returned for trial in July last to the Circuit Court on a charge of unlawful assembly and was remanded to bail and has since been at liberty.  This case was not taken at any of the criminal sittings of the Circuit Court since the committal, as it was desired to give priority to persons who were in custody and to persons on bail who had been returned for trial on a date prior to that upon which he was returned.  It is thought, however, that his case will be disposed of at the sitting of the Circuit Court which will start on the 27th April.  I think that is all the information I am in a position to give the Deputy arising definitely from his notice.  I am not in a position to discuss the other matters to which he referred, <Col N="1838" /> and I have no comment to make on his statement.  It seems to me to be an unworthy suggestion, that the action of the State counsel in a particular prosecution was determined by the business circumstances of a brother of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I will undertake to inquire into every possible method towards mitigating the inconveniences <Col N="1839" /> arising from delay in prisoners being brought to trial.  As I said, on the general question, that is likely to be steadily decreasing inconvenience. Owing to the problem that arose about the Court of the High Court Circuit an <Col N="1840" /> accumulation took place which is only being worked off now.  I do not think in the future there will be a recurrence of delays in bringing prisoners to trial; delays as long as those which occurred in some cases within the last year.</P>

As the military fired in the execution of their duty, the claim could not be entertained as a charge against Army funds.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>A scheme for improving the sewerage of Clonbur has been under consideration by the local authority, but I am not aware that the present lack of sanitary accommodation is such as to become a serious menace to the health of the inhabitants.  The proposals put forward by the sanitary authority would serve about six houses. On the 26th of last month it was pointed out to the Board of Health that a simple septic tank without aeration should give adequate treatment to the small amount of sewage involved, and if at a later period aeration is considered necessary a suitable filter could be easily added.  It is not necessary to resort to compulsory powers for a sewerage scheme if only way-leaves are concerned.  If land is required for treatment of sewage and it cannot be acquired by agreement, an application for the compulsory acquisition of the lands may be made.  What is apparently intended in this case is land for back gardens or back yards, and a proposal <Col N="1702" /> of that nature could not form part of a sewerage scheme.  The provision of gardens might conceivably be considered for the purposes of a housing scheme, but there is no power vested in the local authority to improve private property within their district. I am not aware of the petition referred to by the Deputy.  I will refer the matter to the Land Commission for consideration.</P>
