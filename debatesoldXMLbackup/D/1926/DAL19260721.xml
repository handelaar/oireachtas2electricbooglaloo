      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the military barracks, Dunmore, Co. Galway, with the lands attached thereto, have been let, and, if so, to whom and on what terms, and if not, and having regard to the fact that the local priests and people are desirous of obtaining possession of this property for the purposes of a school and recreation ground, and are prepared to pay a fair price for same, he will favourably consider their application.</P>

      <P>The barrack has not been let.  A proposal to reconstruct a portion of the barrack for the accommodation of the Gárda Síochána is under consideration, and until some definite arrangement is reached we are unable to take any steps for the permanent letting of the property.  In the meantime the land attached has been let after due compliance with the terms of Section 2 of the State Lands Act, 1924, to Mr. Michael Fleming of Dunmore for six months at a rent of £5 for the period. An application has been received from Canon Curran for a lease of the premises for the purpose of erecting a school, and this application will be considered if the property becomes available for letting.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister state why this temporary letting was made seeing that an application was sent in by the parish priest on behalf of the residents of the district <Col N="2320" /> to have this place set aside for the purposes of a school and recreation ground?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The letting was made because it was considered to be the best way to dispose of the lands temporarily.  If there was any application sent in by Canon Curran prior to the period during which the letting had to lie upon the Table of the House, the Deputy had plenty of time to give notice of a question.</P>

      <P>If the application was made by Canon Curran after the date on which the letting was made under the terms of the State Lands Act, 1924, then obviously nothing could be done further than what I have set out in the reply&mdash;that the application will be considered if the property becomes available for letting.  There was a certain period during which the details of the letting had to lie on the Table.  Deputies were aware of it and they could have then intervened.</P>

Kildare, was sent to him the information as to what progress had been made by the Land Commission in acquiring those lands would be furnished; that on the 2nd June, 1926, such a list with a <Col N="2322" /> copy of the letter of the 1st April, 1925, was sent to his Department, which has not yet acknowledged it, and whether he is now able to give the information asked for.</P>

    <Title>CIRCUIT COURT RULES.  (RESUMED DEBATE.)</Title>
    <P>Motion by Minister for Justice:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil hereby approves of the &ldquo;Rules of the Circuit Court&rdquo; made by the Minister for Justice on the 13th day of July, 1926, under Section 66 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 (No. 10 of 1924), and resolves that it is expedient that such rules shall come into operation on the 1st day of October, 1926.</P>
    <P>Amendment by Deputy Johnson:&mdash;</P>
    <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;Dáil&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the words &ldquo;refuses to approve of the Rules of the Circuit Court because the Rule-making Authority has not <Col N="2323" /> formulated rules which will enable all cases to be brought to trial in the simple form that at present exists, without the necessity for &ldquo;pleadings&rdquo; and the heavy charges upon litigants which the system of &ldquo;pleadings&rdquo; will involve.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on the amendment has turned very largely on the question of pleadings and their precise value in securing the due administration of justice.  On the one hand we have it contended that these are merely unnecessary formalities calculated to create delay and to pile up costs against litigants.  I have been unable to share that view, and nothing that has been said in the course of the debate has convinced me that it would be a desirable thing to dispense with pleadings in dealing with jurisdiction as great as that which is now exercised by the Circuit Courts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson made one comment that, perhaps, was somewhat sounder than most of his comments.  It was that the £50 limit, based on the limit of the jurisdiction of the old County Court, is scarcely reasonable now in view of the altered money values, and that even assuming that we were to adhere to the conception that cases that would have come within the jurisdiction of the County Court in the past might now be allowed to go without pleadings, that there is a case for extending the limit up to £100.  There was considerable discussion with the Rule-making Committee on this and other matters before these rules were made, and the view of the Committee in favour of the proposal set out in the rules was very definite and emphatic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it to the Dáil, however, that in view of the expression of opinion here, and in view of certain knowledge I have as to the opinions in the Seanad, I am prepared to leave over until next Session the further consideration of this set of rules, that is the Circuit Court Rules, and to have further consultations with the Committee with regard to them.  I would be prepared to take up again this question of pleadings and to go into the matter <Col N="2324" /> at greater length and in more detail than has been possible up to the present.</P>
    <P>I have no very great confidence that I will be able to induce the Committee to change their view on the matter; I am prepared to admit that, and I will discuss with them again this question of pleadings or at any rate the raising of the limit below which pleadings can be dispensed with.  I will bring to their attention the views that have been expressed here in the course of this debate. I therefore propose to withdraw the motion seeking the approval of the Circuit Court Rules and to proceed with the consideration of the District Court Rules.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, withdraw the motion. There are two or three suggestions regarding alterations in the rules that I want to make.  Would the Minister now, in view of the absence of any discussion on the rules, desire that we should submit to him proposals for alterations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it now?</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the amendment restricts us to a particular thing, the question of pleadings. If Deputy Johnson is accepting the Minister's proposal, that would involve the withdrawal of the amendment. Then, before the Minister's motion is formally withdrawn, Deputies who want to make suggestions can do so, it being understood that eventually the motion will be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the action the Minister has taken, and I <Col N="2325" /> think it is promising of a very great improvement in the character of these rules as compared with the consequences that would result from the rules if they were put into operation as at present. I therefore ask leave to withdraw my amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Now with regard to the form of the discussion&mdash;I think we should ascertain what particular rules Deputies desire to draw attention to, and then take them in some kind of order.  What rule does Deputy Hewat desire to speak on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak on Rule 6.  I have some comment to make on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take the opportunity of expressing to the Minister for Justice, as far as I and those I am interested in are concerned, the obligations we must feel under to him for meeting the demand that has been made for further time for the consideration of these rules.  As regards Rule 6, which deals with the Sessions and Sittings of the Circuit Courts, there seems to be in this case an omission to provide for the vacation judge, and I think it is desirable that a vacation judge should be appointed to sit during the long vacation so as to hear cases from all the different circuits and so avoid the very considerable delay and also to deal with any urgent matters. Of course it is not unusual to have a vacation judge sitting.  I ask that on the reconsideration of the rules this question should receive attention from the Minister and from the Rule-making Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say a few words in regard to Rule 155, which refers to pleadings.  Now that the Minister has expressed the intention of giving further consideration to the views put forward by Deputy Johnson, I wonder would I be in order in putting forward my views.  I am desirous of urging on the Minister the necessity for giving more serious consideration <Col N="2326" /> to the matter that Deputy Johnson has discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy White can go into any matter he pleases dealing with the rules, but it is understood that the Minister is not pressing his motion now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>The people whom I represent are anxious for cheap and expeditious law.  I submit that we are getting that at present.  I have no great fault to find with the procedure in the Circuit and District Courts except, perhaps, the high cost to the taxpayer. The present system is, in my opinion, sufficient, and is as expeditious a system as obtains in any other country. It would be made more effective and more expeditious if the Minister would accept Deputy Johnson's amendment as to pleadings.  I would strongly urge the Minister to consider the point which Deputy Johnson made yesterday afternoon with regard to the value of money, now and pre-war.  By accepting the proposal to substitute £100 for £50 as the limit of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court without pleadings, the Minister would be merely following the ordinary fluctuations of the period. The business and farming community want cheap and expeditious law, and I urge the Minister to give due weight to their representations, as well as to the opinions of the two branches of the legal profession which the Minister has consulted, as mentioned yesterday.  If he does so I am sure that he will see the justice of our contention in limiting the jurisdiction to £100 without pleadings.  There are a couple of other matters which I desire to bring to the notice of the Minister.  These are mainly with regard to small and flimsy cases which are sent for trial by the District Justice to the Circuit Court. In almost seven out of ten cases that go before a jury in the Circuit Court, the jury find the prisoners not guilty and the taxpayer has to foot the bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">

      <P>With what rule is the Deputy dealing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not dealing with any particular rule.  I would refer the Minister to the Circuit Court held in Lifford in March last.  There were <Col N="2327" /> thirteen cases for trial and in these cases there were only three convictions, so that ten, or eleven, small cases fell through and the taxpayers had to pay the witnesses' and other expenses.  In a way, this may not be an important matter, but it is very important from the taxpayers' point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is criticising, but he seems to me to be criticising Donegal jurics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>Not exactly Donegal juries, but the sending of flimsy cases to trial, not alone in Donegal but in every other county.  The result is that the costs fall on the ratepayers.  The Donegal jury is above suspicion.  I have often been a Donegal juror, and that is sufficient recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if this involves any criticism of the District Justices.  I am taking it as not seriously intended and I am allowing it to go at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few items to which, in view of the Minister's invitation, I would like to call attention.  They are somewhat technical, and, therefore, somewhat beyond my capacity to make clear, but the Minister, I have no doubt, will be able to pick up the intention.  I am asked to direct the attention of the Minister to Rule 191 (d), which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be presumed that the party moving had notice of such judgment within three days after the date thereof, unless he satisfies the court to the contrary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am asked to make representation that that period of three days is too short, that the inaccessibility of many parts of the country would mean that three days would be inadequate for the parties concerned to have notice and to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Rule 195, which deals with execution, there is no provision made regarding the exceptions in respect to the value of tools, clothing, and such like.  I do not know whether there is any particular value in putting in an exception in these rules, inasmuch <Col N="2328" /> as it is already contained in the statute.  I draw attention to it for consideration by the Minister.  Rule 296 has been drawn to my notice, and I am asked to state that where a few instances are stated here, amongst others, which may be the subject of interlocutory motions, they should be considered with a view to extending the list.  For instance, discovery of documents and the answering of questions before trial by the judge's direction are matters that should be inserted, and also the examination of sick witnesses out of court.  The desirability of adding these items to the list is a matter that can be considered.</P>
    <P>A more important matter, from my point of view, is concerned with Rule 403, which deals with appeals in criminal cases.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Applications for a certificate required by Section 63 of the Act shall be made to the court immediately on the termination of a trial or within three days thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is represented to me that three days may not be a reasonable period in which to allow a prisoner to decide upon questions of appeal.  The accused is probably in prison, and affidavits will have to be drafted and settled by counsel, so that the consequent rush will often amount to a denial of the prisoner's rights in the matter.  It is pointed out that interviews with men in prison are pretty commonly recognised as rather troublesome, and that a lot of time is spent in securing them. That may be avoided in many cases near the city, but in country districts, where appeals may be in question, it would be more difficult.  The net result is that it is suggested that three days is too short a period within which a prisoner must lodge notice of appeal. As regards Rule 175, it is suggested that a special jury is a luxury which is not required in the Circuit Court, and, in any case, the costs of a special jury are apparently, intended to be the same as in the High Court, that is to say, twelve guineas.  These are the matters to which I have been asked to draw the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are going through the rules now I might as well <Col N="2329" /> submit to the Minister requests that have been made to me in regard to alterations that are desirable.  In regard to Rules 201 and 211, I wish to put forward a request that the county registrar should be empowered to deal with applications.  I think that would be more or less relieving the court of some of the formal matters that can be quite as well dealt with by the county registrar without going to the court. Rule 277 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All affidavits shall be sworn before the county registrar or a commissioner to administer oaths for the High Court, or where the person making an affidavit resides outside Saorstát Eireann, or is for the time being thereout, before any person duly authorised to administer oaths, in the country where such person ordinarily resides or is.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suggest, for the convenience of people making affidavits, that affidavits could also be taken before a Peace Commissioner.  Rule No. 429 sets out that any originating document or process of the court requiring to be served on three classes of bodies, which are named, may be served in a certain manner.  I would suggest that the Minister add to that list a fourth class, namely, societies under the Friendly Societies Act.  I think these points cover the suggestions I am in a position to make at the moment.  I take it that when the rules come up for criticism later on an opportunity will be afforded for making any criticism we may have to offer, but in globo these are the suggestions made to me as to suitable alterations.</P>

      <P>I hope that the feeling that the House has indicated in the course of the discussion in regard to Rule 155 will help the Minister to secure the concurrence of the Committee in having the amount with regard to pleadings increased.  That I hope will be one of the results of the postponement of sanction of these rules.  Rule 201 deals with the life of a decree.  The life of a decree in a District Court is six years, and the life of a Circuit Court decree is renewable every year.  That, of course, involves considerable expense in the renewal of <Col N="2330" /> decrees.  I do not know why the system relating to the District Court has not been applied in relation to the Circuit Court in regard to these decrees. It is very troublesome to be obliged to renew decrees every year that are not executed or are not paid.  Another very important thing not provided for in the rules is registration in relation to a decree of the Circuit Court.  The result of that is that in cases where there might not be assets that would be realisable, but where there might be other tangible assets, those who would have to sue for debts would have to proceed to the High Court.  That is a very costly procedure, and I think it could be made a good deal more simple if registration were allowed in the Circuit Court as it is in the High Court.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the Minister's statement that Rule 450 is not to be accepted as final and that the provision relating to a reduction of one-third on High Court costs as costs of the Circuit Court will be reconsidered.  It could be made considerably easier than that, and I do not think that provision is at all fair.  I do not think a reduction of one-third would be quite enough.  Civil bills under these rules will have to be recorded by the registrar. That will involve considerable expense, because we all know that a great number of Civil Bills that are issued never come to trial.  Seventy or eighty per cent. of them never reach the stage of trial, and the costs involved in having them sent through the registrar to be recorded is going, to some extent, to penalise business. I think that the system that prevailed before in regard to civil bills might well have been continued.  I think it would have been in the interest of litigants.  Besides, this method will impose work that is heavy and that is going to be of no avail, as far as I can see, on the registrar.</P>

      <P>If the Minister would accept the suggestion that the issue of processes should continue to be through solicitors' offices, instead of through the county registrar, it would simplify matters very much.  At the present time a solicitor can issue Civil Bills for £50 through his office.  Under the new <Col N="2331" /> Rule 91, the Civil Bill will have to be sent to the county registrar or the registrar of the Circuit Court to be approved of, before being issued.  I would suggest to the Minister that in the event of the sum of £50 being extended as the sum to be sued for, without pleadings, processes should be allowed to be issued in the same way as at present, through solicitors' offices, and that in the event of processes being issued for a higher amount, they would have to go through the hands of the county registrar.</P>

      <P>Go gceaduíonn an Dáil leis seo na &ldquo;Rialacha Cúirte Dúithche&rdquo; a dhin an tAire Dlí agus Cirt an 9adh lá d'Iúl, 1926, fé alt 91 den Acht Cúirteanna Breithiúnais, 1924 (Uimh. 10 de 1924) agus go mbeartuíd go bhfuil sé oiriúnach na rialacha san do theacht i ngniomh anladh lá de Dheire Fómhair, 1926.</P>
      <P>That the Dáil hereby approves of the &ldquo;District Court Rules&rdquo; made by the Minister for Justice on the 9th day of July, 1926, under Section 91 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 (No. 10 of 1924) and resolves that it is expedient that such rules shall come into operation on the 1st day of October, 1926.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will see that in these rules a clear distinction has been drawn as to procedure between the cases in which jurisdiction has been conferred on the District Court by way of transfer from the former Petty Sessions Court, the former Justices of the Peace and cases of a civil nature in <Col N="2332" /> which jurisdiction has been conferred on the Court by Section 77 (a) of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  The procedure of the District Court in cases in which jurisdiction has been transferred to them is to be found in Part I. of the Rules.  That procedure is based very largely on the Petty Sessions Act of 1851, and on the procedure which became established by custom in the Metropolitan area in dealing with cases in which jurisdiction was given under the Dublin Police Acts.  Many changes, have, however, been made from the old procedure with a view to simplifying proceedings in the court and also with a view to saving expense. In connection with proof of service, for instance, under the old procedure it was necessary that the person effecting service of any summons which was the originating document of the court should attend personally before the court and give proof of service on oath. That meant in many cases that a person had to travel considerable distances to give this purely formal evidence, and in any prosecutions by the police a defendant who was convicted had usually to pay the travelling expenses of the Gárda who attended to prove service.  Rule 16 provides that instead of the former method of proving service proof can be given by a statutory declaration to be endorsed on the back of the summons.  This will relieve the person effecting the service of the necessity of attending before the court, and in cases where a defendant is convicted it will relieve him of the necessity of paying the travelling expenses of such witness.  In cities it may be more convenient for the person effecting service to attend court and give evidence as to service.  Accordingly, the rule empowers the former procedure to be continued in any court area in which the Justice may so order. There is another rather material point of difference between the former procedure in cases of summary jurisdiction and the new procedure.  Whereas under the former procedure a most complicated form of order book had to be kept by the clerk and signed by the Justice, under the new procedure a simple Justice's minute book is provided for by Rule 49, and in this new <Col N="2333" /> minute book short particulars of each case and the order made thereon will be entered and signed by the Justice. If any party, for the purpose of appeal or otherwise, desires to have a copy of a formal conviction or of a full order made, he is entitled, under Rule 50, to obtain a certified copy of that full conviction or order.</P>
    <P>The procedure as to the civil proceedings will be found in Part II. of the Rules.  That procedure is, to a large extent, based on the former procedure of the County Court.  It has, however, been simplified and, we think, improved in many respects.  Proof of service, in civil proceedings, can be given by statutory declaration in the same manner as proof of service in summary proceedings.  A special method of obtaining judgment in the office of the District Court has been provided for in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  It is thought that the time is scarcely ripe yet for extending that special procedure to the country generally, but probably after a period of a year or two it can be extended. It is thought that this procedure will be of considerable convenience to litigants. Provision is made also in this part of the Rules for the hearing of cases in the District Court as to the examination of debtors under Part II. of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, and also in interpleader cases, jurisdiction in which is conferred on the court by Section 22 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act.</P>
    <P>Under Part III. of the Rules there is provision for the exercise of licensing jurisdiction, and here also the procedure has been simplified.  Formerly an applicant for a certificate of transfer of a licence had to make three separate applications to the court.  Under the new procedure only two applications will have to be made.  Parts IV. and V. of the Rules deal with appeals to the Circuit Court and the High Court, respectively. Under the Petty Sessions Act of 1851 complicated procedure was laid down for appeals from the decisions of justices.  This has been very considerably simplified.  The costs in civil proceedings are now, we think, very reasonable.  Since the circulation <Col N="2334" /> of the draft rules I have had a further conference with the Committee, at which the figures set out in the rules as now made were agreed upon.  Deputies will realise that the costs which are now prescribed are a reduction, in many cases, of fifty per cent. on the costs as first submitted.  The scale now made is considered fair.  That, I think, gives the general framework of the rules.  Later I would be prepared to deal with any points of detail that Deputies may raise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the House to consider the position that we are asked to approve of in these rules.  We are asked to alter, in some cases for the better&mdash;it is a matter of opinion whether for the better or for the worse&mdash; and in some cases for the worse, existing statute law.  We are asked by the making of Rules of Court which, in the main, deal with practice and procedure, to agree to embody what are, in fact, in some cases, considerable modifications and considerable amendments of the law, not merely amendments for the purpose of fitting in procedure with the new requirements of the Courts of Justice Act.  I am not going to pretend to argue the case of the powers of the rule-making authority: whether they have exceeded their powers or whether we should assist them to exceed their powers if we pass these rules.  I do say that the House ought not to agree to any confirmation of the existing law in this formal manner, even where we think that the existing law is such that it ought to be amended, unless we are going to do it by way of statute.  I think that the attempt to alter the law in some cases to the detriment of a prisoner or an accused person by a mere rule of court, is not what we ought to be asked to do.  If there is going to be an amendment of the law regarding the rights of the citizen, then it ought to be done by regular Bill procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that the existing courts, in so far as they are acting upon set-out rules, are acting upon the statute. I have not been able to find any reference existing to Rules of Court of the old Petty Sessions courts.  I <Col N="2335" /> think the procedure of those courts was based on the Petty Sessions Act in respect of the country, and by a special Dublin Act in respect of the city.  If we are going to alter that Act in any way beyond the mere alteration for procedure purposes, then that has to be done, I submit, by formal presentation of a Bill and a thorough examination of the Bill by the usual processes.  In the Courts of Justice Act&mdash;I think the Minister referred to this a week ago&mdash; there is in Section 91 a reference to the powers of the rule-making authority. The rule-making authority is authorised to make rules for certain things which, as far as I can understand the section, are confined almost wholly to the procedure of the court.  It includes &ldquo;the granting of summary judgment in appropriate cases, the use of the national language in Saorstát Eireann, and the fixing and collection of fees and the adaptation or modification of any statute that may be necessary for any of the purposes aforesaid.&rdquo;  I think it can be shown that certain of the modifications or adaptations of the existing law which are sought to be effected by these rules are not necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect the new procedure.  I believe that in some respects the procedure of the statute ought to be altered, but I think it is not wise, to say the very least, for Parliament to hand over its authority to make these alterations of statutes to a Minister advised by a rule-making authority.  I think a very important question of principle is involved, and we ought not to become parties to the work of altering statutes by reference to a Minister.  The Minister complained yesterday that I had spoken too generally when I was dealing with the Circuit Court Rules.  I will attempt to remedy that defect and deal in detail with what I am now to speak on.  We will take Rule 4, which deals with the jurisdiction of the Justices.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The jurisdiction of the Justice in cases of summary jurisdiction shall be exercised by him within his district as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(c) In cases of indictable offences in any court area, irrespective of where the crime is alleged to have <Col N="2336" /> been committed or the defendant has been arrested or resides.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Courts of Justice Act, 1924, Section 79, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that the jurisdictions by this Act vested in and transferred to the District Court shall be exercised by the Justices severally as follows:&mdash;In criminal cases, by a Justice for the time being assigned to the district wherein the crime has been committed or the accused has been arrested or resides.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So the Courts of Justice Act limited jurisdiction, and the Rules of Court seem to attempt to set aside that by saying that the Justice may exercise jurisdiction within his district &ldquo;in cases of indictable offences in any court area, irrespective of where the crime is alleged to have been committed.&rdquo; That seems to be a contradiction, and it seems to be an attempt to abrogate authority in the Courts of Justice Act, and would, therefore, I presume, be <i>ultra vires.</i>  Not so many years ago, but still probably only familiar to those acquainted with the agitations under the Balfour régime, we know how attempts used to be made to bring a prisoner from the place where he was arrested to another place to be tried by a Removable.  Though this may not be the intention in the present proposals, it is a possible and, I think, an undesirable development, especially in view of the specific authority and limitation set out in Section 79 of the Courts of Justice Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it has been interpreted so by quite competent lawyers, and&mdash;I am speaking not as a lawyer&mdash;it is an interpretation that I have placed upon it.  However, I call attention to it.  Rules 6 and 7 are taken from the Petty Sessions Act, 1851.  Several of these rules are taken practically verbatim from that Act.  I want to call attention to Rules 6 and 7. I ask the House to remember that we are now invited to re-enact formally these provisions taken from the 1851 Act, and also to remember the condition of the country at the time that Act was passed.  I suggest that if we are going to revise legislation and statutes regarding cases of summary jurisdiction we ought to revise them in the light of present conditions, and not in the light of conditions of 1851. For instance, the question of open court is very important for the public. The right of the public to hear cases tried, even in the early stages, is one that has been fought for and eventually has been established, but in these new rules confirming the Act of 1851 there was a discretion given to the Justice to say whether or not the court should be open.  If we are revising the procedure of courts we ought to so revise it as to ensure that the court shall be an open court and that it shall not be within the discretion of the Justice to close the court.  But in any case, if we are to alter this matter it should be by legislation, and there is no need I submit, to state in these rules what is already set out in the 1851 Act, because presumably the courts are bound by the statutes, and except in so far as the rules are necessary as a modification for the purpose of carrying into effect the Courts of Justice Act, they will really be of no effect if they run counter to the 1851 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take Rule 25, which contains provision for a remand: &ldquo;The Justice may either admit such person to bail ...or by warrant remand such person to prison for a period not exceeding fourteen days to the next court for the court area for which the Justice is sitting or to any other court within the district of such Justice.&rdquo;  Two points are raised there.  Under the 1851 Act <Col N="2338" /> the Justice is not empowered to remand for more than eight days, and this is an extension of the powers of the Justice, to the detriment of the citizen, sought to be embodied in the Rules of Court.  It is possible to allow a longer period of remand when both parties agree, but without that agreement the Justice is bound by the 1851 Act not to exceed eight days.  I think it is wrong for us to consent to embodying, to the detriment of the citizen, such a change as the extension of the period to fourteen days would involve.  But let us assume that a prisoner is admitted to bail.  We find that the Justice may call on such person to appear at any court within his district.  In the case of the larger counties some of the districts are very wide; unfortunately the usual accused person who appears before these courts is not blessed with very much wealth, and the very prospect of having to travel from one end of the district to the other means involving the accused person in very great expense, I think unjustly to the accused.  The court area is quite large enough without asking the accused to have to appear at a place which may be 60 miles away and may be more.  I think that that is a distinct defect and a defect against the interests of the citizen, who is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty.  I think that that is a very important defect in these rules, apart from whether they are within the powers of a rule-making authority or not.</P>
    <P>In Rule 26 we find a distinct and, possibly, a very important, and not at all a necessary change.  I refer to paragraph (b): &ldquo;Whenever a person shall appear or be brought before any Justice charged with an offence... such Justice shall examine such witnesses and receive such evidence in proof of such charge as shall be produced before him within his jurisdiction; and if in his opinion such evidence shall be prima facie proof of the said charge such Justice shall thereupon ... commit the person accused to prison or shall admit him to bail.&rdquo; Except the words &ldquo;prima facie&rdquo; the whole paragraph is taken from the Act of 1851, but in that Act the words are <Col N="2339" />&lsquo;sufficient proof,&rsquo; and it is not quite understandable why these words should be deliberately deleted and attenuated to the words &ldquo;prima facie.&rdquo;  The tendency there is distinctly against the accused.  In the one case the Justice has to be satisfied that there is sufficient proof to warrant the committal. But these new words put in, not by process of amendment of the law, but by a change of rules, seem to me to be beyond the authority, and certainly an undesirable change from the point of view of the accused.</P>

      <P>What is the difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference, else why was the change made?  Rule 27 deals with the procedure of admitting to bail.  The paragraph opens:&mdash;&ldquo;Whenever a Justice in the exercise of his discretion sees fit to admit to bail a person charged with an indictable offence such person shall enter into a recognisance,&rdquo; and so on.  Here again is quite a definite and not at all a requisite change of the law, a change quite distinctly against the interests of the accused.  Section 16 of the Petty Sessions Act, 1851, deals with the admission to bail of persons charged with indictable offences and makes certain provisions.  Paragraph I gives certain classes of cases where the question of bail is at the discretion of the Justice. But paragraph 2 says: &ldquo;In every case where any person shall be charged before any justice with any indictable misdemeanour, other than those hereinbefore mentioned&rdquo;&mdash;other than those where there is a discretion&mdash;such &ldquo;justice, after the taking of examinations, instead of committing the person to prison shall, on the application of such person and on being satisfied as to the sufficiency of the bail offered, admit him to bail in manner aforesaid.&rdquo;  That is to say, the accused person in these particular classes of misdemeanours has a right to bail.  But we are asked to agree to an alteration giving the Justice a discretion in all cases of indictable offences.  That is a very important attempt to make a change in the law, and I certainly think that we ought not to be retrogressive in our legislation at this stage as compared <Col N="2340" /> with 1851.  The right of bail secured in 1851 should not be taken away by merely allowing the justice a discretion. Now let us take Rule 35: There we find a scale of fines with alternatives of imprisonment.  &ldquo;For any sum not exceeding 10/- the alternative imprisonment is 7 days; exceeding 10/- but not exceeding fourteen days,&rdquo; and so on.  I find, on examination, that those alternative periods of imprisonment are the same at present.  They are based upon Acts which have been in operation for many years.  I submit to the House that on the lines of the argument which the Minister has recognised as effective in regard to the sum of £50 as the limit of jurisdiction&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I went a little too far when I said that the Minister recognised the argument as effective, but the argument that the value of money is not as great as it was 50 years ago or as it was up to the war is effective, and it is not reasonable to put into the mouths of the justices the phrase &ldquo;ten shillings or seven days, £1 or fourteen days,&rdquo; because although the wording is &ldquo;not to exceed seven days&rdquo; we know that where the fine is 10/- in practice the alternative is seven days. Now I say the alternative period ought to be half in each case.  We should remember that at whatever period the scale was drawn up ten shillings then would buy, let us say, 50 loaves of bread, whereas it would buy only 25 loaves to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of choice; it is perhaps a matter of one's experience of what jail is worth.  I daresay there are Deputies in the House who would disagree with Deputy Hewat.  Perhaps when he has had experience of six months he might think £30 was cheaply bought.  However, I submit to the Minister that this is a matter that really requires revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Rule 37, again, is a proposal which I think ought not to be agreed to by the House.  The rule says: &ldquo;The justice who shall hear and determine any <Col N="2341" /> charge or complaint...shall have power to order any party to the said charge or complaint other than the Attorney-General or a member of the Gárda Síochána in his official capacity to pay to the other party such costs, including the cost of any adjournment and any witnesses' expenses as to him shall seem meet.&rdquo;  That is to say, the justice is to be empowered to order the payment by one party to the other of such costs and such witnesses' expenses, without limit, as he may think fitting, but he may not be empowered to order costs to be paid by the State.  I think that is unjustifiable.  If we are going to modify the law in any way it ought to be done by statute, and by a regular process of Bill procedure.  We ought not to re-enact in this form any provision which would make it impossible for the justice to award costs against the State.  It is just as possible for the State, through its police authorities, to deal unjustly with a citizen as for a private individual to deal unjustly with another individual.  If a citizen is being charged unreasonably then costs ought to lie against the State as well as against any other person.</P>
    <P>There is no limit to the amount of the costs that may be granted, and I am reminded of a precedent.  I gather that under the Dublin Police Act of 1842, which is sought to be extended over the whole country by these rules, there exists power to give costs to an unlimited extent.  Some of us remember the case of the batons&mdash;the &ldquo;Up the Mollies&rdquo; case which came before the court when Mr. Devlin, of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, was prosecuted and three charges were heard for disturbing a public meeting.  They were dismissed in favour of the defendant and fifty guineas costs in each case were awarded.  It might as well have been 150 guineas.  The power sought to be given here is unlimited, and I submit that this defect, apart from the other question, which is a more important one that the justice is definitely and deliberately prohibited from awarding costs against the Attorney-General or the Gárda Síochána.  These are the chief points I want to bring before the notice of the Dáil.  I submit I have shown that in several of the instances <Col N="2342" /> I have given there is a clear attempt to alter the law by a process of rule-making, and that is not within the authority of the Minister.  In any case, in so far as its being changed to the detriment of the accused, the House ought not to agree to such change taking place.  If there is to be any change in the law regarding procedure and practice beyond what is necessary for the working out of the Courts of Justice Act, such change should be made by the introduction of a Bill which should go through the ordinary stages of examination.  I, therefore, intend to ask the House not to agree to the passing of these rules.</P>

      <P>During the discussion on those various Rules of Court it has been very noticeable that the Dáil has lacked the guidance that might be derived from experience.  Those Deputies who have the advantage of being learned in the law, with the single exception of the Minister, who could not help being here, have been conspicuous by their absence.  I have no knowledge of proceedings in the High Court or the Circuit Court, and so I refrain from speaking on their rules, but as regards the District Court, I have some knowledge of the courts that preceded them, the Petty Sessions Court.  I was a Justice in them for fifteen years.  I also appeared in those courts as a plaintiff and a defendant. I was convicted and fined one penny, and costs were given against the other side, having conducted my own case.</P>

You will have experienced people dealing with the rules, and bad rules are better than no rules.  In the District Court you are dealing with the defendant or litigant, who knows about as much about the Rules of Court as Deputy Lyons knows about the Standing Orders in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I am sorry he is absent.  He was here some time ago. I shall substitute the name of any other Deputy present if it is wished. The litigant who goes into court is largely ignorant of the law and absolutely ignorant of those Rules of Court.  I suggest that the tendency reflected in those rules to codify and make everything formal will be a disadvantage to the litigant.  To illustrate my case I am not going to take as many instances as Deputy Johnson, but I shall take Rule 16, which deals with the service of a summons.  In the past in the Petty Sessions Court the person who served the summons, usually a policeman, had to appear in the Court and prove service.  Rule 16 provides that the person who served the summons shall make a statutory declaration on the back of the original summons and that such statutory declaration shall be considered sufficient evidence of the service and that it shall not be necessary for the person effecting service to personally attend, which is a split infinitive.</P>

      <P>The normal procedure would be merely a written form on the back of the summons. There are obvious conveniences in that from the police point of view.  It is inconvenient to have a large number of policemen to attend in court when they ought to be elsewhere on duty. From the point of view of justice and fair play it is desirable to have the men who served the summons there because, as I say, no reasonable man on a minor case, such as cattle straying on the road or not lighting up in time, where the penalty is a small one, will brief a barrister or instruct a solicitor, and he might not be able to attend himself. In my experience the policeman who served the summons was always asked did he serve it, and he was usually asked, what did the person say?  The answer was that the wife said her husband could not attend because he was a cattle driver and had to be at the fair.  The Bench knew attendance would mean the loss of a considerable sum of money to the defendant, and that in order to meet the charge punishable by a fine of 2/6 he might lose two or three pounds.  If you only have your written formula the Justice will not be able to ask why the man was not present.  He will treat the nonappearance of the defendant as a form of contempt and increase the penalty. I suggest in Rule 16 the rule should be the exception and the exception should be the rule, that in cases, possibly in the city of Dublin, I think it might be desirable to dispense with the presence of the summons-server, but, broadly speaking, the expenditure suggested may change the fee required. <i>Viva voce</i> proof of service should be the normal procedure, and where it is proved that it is exceptionally inconvenient and imposes undue burden on the police, then a Justice might be permitted to depart from it.  We cannot at the present time amend these rules, but I take it that they are not rules for all time, that they will need revision when there is some experience of their working.  Therefore I put this particular case before the Minister, in the hope that when the time comes to revise these rules he would consult the Justices who had experience of their <Col N="2345" /> working and amend this particular rule in the direction I suggest.  As regards the rules in general, I agree, on the whole, with Deputy Johnson's criticism, but I would call attention to a certain omission.  The rules for the High Courts and the rules for the Circuit Courts prescribe a certain mode of address to the judge.  As far as I have been able to discover there is no mode of address prescribed in the rules for the District Court.  It is open to a litigant in the District Courts, as far as I see, to call the Justice, Minister for Justice.  I know the mode of address that would be adopted outside the court by a disappointed litigant, and I do not suggest that the Minister could frame rules to meet that particular case, but it is desirable that all the rules should, as far as possible, be standardised and follow the same lines.  In their whole arrangement the District Court Rules differ very substantially from the other two sets of rules, and when the time comes for revision, I hope that the Minister would have that fact before his mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support Deputy Johnson's contention that we should not agree to the Minister's motion.  The latter part of Rule 25 has been alluded to by Deputy Johnson &ldquo;where there is to be a remand of such person to prison for a period not exceeding fourteen days for the next court of the court area.&rdquo;  The Deputy has taken exception to the rule as it makes provision for a period of remand as long as fourteen days.  The situation I see is, in, say, a rural area in the extreme west of my constituency, about which I had occasion to make representation a few weeks ago to the Minister so that another court should be held in that area owing to the distance litigants had to travel.  The courts are held for that district once a month, but the district has about the worst railway service in Ireland. What would be the position of an accused person charged in that area if no court is held there for a month? The nearest court in the district is across in Leitrim, and would be ten or fifteen miles away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2346" /> As far as I know the court in Leitrim is not held within fourteen days of the court held in the adjoining area of Cavan.  The Justice has his time fully occupied and may not have a vacant day in a fortnight so as to arrange to have a special court for the hearing of such cases.  It is a hardship that a man should be kept so long without having an opportunity of proving to the Justice his innocence. According to the rule, a defendant resident in Swanlinbar area would have to be taken across to the next District Court in County Leitrim.  If he is to prove his innocence he should be given facilities to do so.  It would be necessary for him to get witnesses and to bring them to an adjoining county to prove his innocence.  He will also have to get a lawyer to go there, so that the expense involved will make it difficult for the ordinary accused person to prove his innocence.  Undoubtedly justice will not be done if that rule is applied all over the country.  The rule might do if it was applied to the City of Dublin or to places where the courts are held weekly or fortnightly.  The liberty of the citizen must be the predominant thought of all, and we have to consider how far that liberty will be endangered because of the difficulties that are placed in the way of parties appearing in court to prove their innocence.  It seems to me that it makes it impossible for a defendant to prove his innocence if he has to appear in a court with his witness twenty miles away from his own area. To ask the Dáil to agree to a rule like that is.  I think, expecting too much from those who have a knowledge of the rural districts.</P>
    <P>Rule 22 (a) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever any person shall appear as a witness either in obedience to a summons or by virtue of a warrant, or shall be present in court and shall be verbally required by the Justice to give evidence, and shall refuse to be examined upon oath concerning the matter of the information or complaint, or shall refuse to take such oath, or, having taken such oath, shall refuse to answer such questions concerning <Col N="2347" /> the said matter as shall then be put to him, or shall refuse or neglect to produce any such accounts, papers, or documents as aforesaid (without offering any just excuse for such refusal), the Justice then present may adjourn the proceedings to the same or any other court in his district for any period not exceeding eight clear days.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the same story.  It means that the accused will have to appear in another court, and the nearest court may be thirty or forty miles away.  In an area that is badly served by the railway I am positive that the liberty of the citizen is going to be endangered by the acceptance of that rule, to a greater extent than by any of the other rules.  Rule 124 says:&mdash;&ldquo;An affidavit grounding an application for an examination order may be sworn before a Justice or a Commissioner for Oaths.&rdquo;  Rule 178 says:&mdash;&ldquo;Any affidavit to be used in a District Court may be sworn before a Commissioner for Oaths or a Justice.&rdquo;  I want to ask the Minister where does the poor Peace Commissioner comes in?  Does he come in at all where an affidavit is to be sworn?</P>
    <P>Section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act specifically provides</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that a Peace Commission shall have all the powers and authorities which immediately before the 6th day of December, 1922, were vested in a Justice of the Peace.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It gives these in detail, and in further explanation we find:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It may be noted that the expressions &lsquo;oath&rsquo; and &lsquo;affidavit&rsquo; in the case of persons allowed by law to affirm and declare include affirmation and declaration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, is it not possible that it shall be legal under these rules not to have an affidavit sworn before a Peace Commissioner? It seems an extraordinary change from the position that was created by the passing of the Courts of Justice Act and also the Enforcement of Law Act of 1924.</P>

I want to know exactly did we vest in the Peace Commissioners power to have affidavits sworn before them under the Courts of Justice Act, and if we did why is it not legitimate under these rules that the Peace Commissioner shall have the same power as was conferred on the Justice of the Peace or the Commissioner for Oaths?  I think there are some Peace Commissioners who are members of the Dáil, and I think they are just as competent to see that an affidavit is made properly and in order as many of the Commissioners for Oaths down the country.  As Deputy Johnson asked, is it right that we should seek to alter by rules what we have already established by statute?  I want to know from the Minister whether it is accepted that the Peace Commissioners are empowered to have affidavits sworn in their presence under certain conditions, but under certain other conditions they are not?  I do not know what the charge for these oaths is&mdash;perhaps a couple of shillings, perhaps four or five shillings.</P>

I can see great difficulties, indeed, for many of our poorer people who have already sufficient difficulties to overcome, when they are confronted with the position <Col N="2349" /> of searching for ages for qualification for an old age pension if the Peace Commissioner is not competent.  If he has authority in one case, why should he not have it in the other?  If we give him authority by an Act of the Dáil are we trying to take that authority from him now under the Rules of Court?  I want to have that cleared up.  I support Deputy Johnson in his amendment, and I hope he will press this if the Minister is not prepared to agree to follow the course he has already indicated in the matter of the Circuit Court rules, that is, to withdraw his motion and give an opportunity for further consideration of these rules during the period that will elapse between now and when the Dáil meets in November.

      <P>The Minister has behind him his staff; he is very well served.  We got the rules of court ten days before the Dáil was to adjourn along with a dozen other measures crowded into a long and strenuous session. We are expected to swallow everything in these rules, and expected to say that they are correct and to give them our approval.  I say that is asking too much.  The Minister ought to have consideration for the inability, perhaps, of the Deputies who are asked to examine these.  While appreciating the fact that the Minister is anxious that the rules should be got through, the Minister is served by a staff equipped with knowledge of what is in the rules.  These rules were running on for a long time.  Deputies who are asked to give their approval have not that advantage and they are certainly entitled to get from the Minister sufficient time to enable them to examine the rules or to get assistance in the examination of the rules.  I have no doubt, whatever, if the rules are closely and carefully examined that many flaws would be discovered in them, and <Col N="2350" /> in view of the possible necessity to amend them later on, it would be advisable for the Minister to follow the same course with regard to the rules of the District Court that he thought it advisable to follow in the case of the Circuit Court rules.</P>

I do not see that it would be feasible for me to dispense with the officials of my department, neither do I see that it would be feasible to provide the Deputy with a similar staff.

I do not want to over-paint the picture, but I submit that this is what would happen, that the Deputy or any other Deputy would go to some legal friend.  He would throw him a copy of the rules and say: &ldquo;Give me something to say on these.&rdquo; The man would skim through the rules in his armchair that night or perhaps two nights in succession and give him hasty, ill-considered, superficial comments, and the Deputy would stand up here with a certain gusto and eclat and unburden himself of these comments.

      <P>Taking Deputy Johnson's points in order, I congratulate him on the fact that he has been more detailed and specific in dealing with these rules than in dealing with the Circuit Court Rules.  He dealt first with Rule 4, and he dealt with it inaccurately owing to an apparent confusion between the district to which a particular Justice is assigned and the component court areas of that district.  Section 79 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, applies to the entire district of a Justice.  Rule 4 applies only to the particular court area within a Justice's district in which cases are to be brought. Section 79 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided that the jurisdictions by this Act vested in and transferred to a District Court shall be exercised by the Justices severally as follows:</P>
      <P>In civil cases, by a Justice for the time being assigned to the district wherein the defendant or one of the defendants ordinarily resides or carries on any profession, business or occupation;</P>
      <P>In criminal cases, by a Justice for the time being assigned to the district wherein the crime has been committed or the accused has been arrested or resides;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2353" /> The provision dealing with licensing cases sets out a Justice for the time being assigned to the district wherein the licensed premises are situate. That section applies to the whole district of a Justice.  There are thirtythree Justices in the area of jurisdiction of the State.  Rule 4 applies only to the court area within a Justice's district in which cases are to be brought.  The whole rule is governed by the jurisdiction of the Justice, and that jurisdiction is to be found in Section 79 of the Courts of Justice Act. The rules do not confer or purport to confer any jurisdiction on a Justice in any case in which he has not jurisdiction under the Courts of Justice Act.  So much for the charge that we are really attempting to legislate by Rules of Court.</P>
    <P>The Deputy passed from that to Rules 6 and 7, and dealt specially with the question of open court and the exception which it is proposed to make to that general position.  He says that matters of this kind cannot be dealt with in the atmosphere of 1851.  That is a general maxim that I would have no hesitation in subscribing to; but there are certain things which do not alter even in such a length of time as that between 1851 and 1926, and the need for this discretion in a Justice to close his court exists to just as great an extent now as then.  The only case in which a Justice may exclude the public is the preliminary investigation of indictable offences, and the only class of case in which power of that kind is ever exercised is that in which charges of a sexual nature arise.  I submit that it is not in the public interest, it is not for the general good of the community, that the Justice should be deprived of the discretion of deciding to hear the preliminary investigation of a particular indictable offence in camera.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2354" /> Rather than attempt definition I think it is better simply to give that discretion to the Justice.  There are cases from time to time in this country, as in any country, of a particularly revolting nature, the publication of which in the Press, or the hearing of which by the general public in the locality in which they occur, would not be in the general interest.  That rule is inserted in recognition of that fact.</P>

In particular rules may be made for all or any of the following matters, viz., for regulating the sittings and the vacations and the districts of <Col N="2355" /> the Justices and the places where proceedings are to be brought and the forms of process, summons, case stated, appeal or otherwise, and the conditions which a party who requires a case stated or an appellant must comply with in civil cases or in criminal cases or in licensing cases as the case may be, and the practice and procedure of the District Court generally, including questions of costs and the times for taking any step in the District Court the entering-up of judgment and granting of summary judgment in appropriate cases and the use of the national language of Saorstát Eireann therein and the fixing and collection of fees and the adaptation or modification of any statute that may be necessary for any of the purposes aforesaid and all subsidiary matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The adaptation or modification of any statute that may be necessary for any of the purposes aforesaid.&rdquo;  Deputy Johnson stressed the word &ldquo;necessary,&rdquo; and, by jumping very hard on it, he sought to convey the impression that it must be absolutely necessary&mdash;something in the absence of which the whole court machinery would fail.  I do not think that we need take it in that way just as strictly as the Deputy, for the purposes of his argument, endeavoured to convey.  The rule-making authority has power, amongst other things, to deal with &ldquo;the adaptation or modification of any statute that may be necessary for any of the purposes aforesaid.&rdquo;  It is necessary for the due administration of justice under the system which we have created by the Courts of Justice Act to extend this period of remand.  The courts are held in some areas not more frequently than once a month.  In others they are held fortnightly, and only in some populous areas are they held as frequently as once a week. The State is divided into 33 districts. There are 33 District Justices functioning, and it is simply not always possible, administratively, to deal with a prisoner within a space as short as eight days.</P>

      <P>I say that the rule-making committee has been given power to make any necessary adaptation or modification of any statute, and that this is a necessary modification of a particular statute.  With regard to the power that it is proposed to give to a District Justice to remand to another court area, that, of course, is inserted to deal with custody cases only.  No Justice would ever remand on bail to another court area, but power is inserted to enable him to deal with custody cases.  In many court areas courts are held monthly, and it may not be possible for a Justice to get to that particular area within a fortnight. It is reasonable to leave it within his discretion to remand, if necessary, to a neighbouring court area in which he will be due within that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that the power to remand on bail to another court area was not contained in the rules.  I say, in fact and in practice, no Justice would ever remand on bail to a different area.  Why should he? If bail can be given, there is no reason whatever to remand to a different area. There may, on the other hand, be good reason for using the powers to deal with custody cases, and it is with a view to dealing with custody cases that the rule has been framed.</P>

      <P>The fact is that if the joint ideas of Deputy Baxter and Deputy Johnson were to be carried out one would want at least double the number of district justices that we have at present, and we just cannot have them.  These rules constitute a reasonable effort to meet the requirements of the case.  It has been necessary to add some five or six days to the remand period and, on the other side of the same issue, it has been necessary to take power to remand a prisoner to another area than that in which he is originally brought forward.  I do not know that there is anything unduly harsh or unfair to the prisoner in either of these provisions.  In regard to Rule 26, Deputy Johnson rung the changes on the sinister change from &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; to &ldquo;prima facie&rdquo; in connection with the preliminary investigations of an indictable offence.  Everyone knows that in connection with a preliminary investigation of an indictable offence, it is not the business of the Justice to decide whether the defendant is guilty or innocent.  It is the business of the Justice simply to decide whether evidence has been put before <Col N="2358" /> him which constitutes a prima facie case.  That is the expression that is always used in connection with these preliminary proceedings&mdash;is a prima facie case established?  If it is, the Justice has no more to do with the matter but to return for trial at the court which has jurisdiction to try that particular offence.  There is nothing sinister at all in the change of language from the petty sessions position to these new rules.  It is simply that the more correct expression, the more technical and the more commonly used expression, &ldquo;prima facie case,&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;sufficient.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>An examination of the Deputy's points on specific rules does not lead one to accept his preliminary objections to the rules, that they were in fact an encroachment of existing rights and existing liberties and an attempt to do by means of rules what should be done, if it were done at all, by legislation.  I expected that the Deputy having made that preliminary charge would support it with some substantial instances and some substantial arguments.  In fact I put it to the Dáil that he has utterly failed to do so and that he has shown no sufficient cause why approval to this set of rules should be withheld and the District Court left without rules for a further period of four or five months.  I simply want to say in connection with these rules, as in connection with the other set of rules for the High Court and the Supreme Court, that have been approved of by the Dáil, that they are necessarily tentative, that their effect in operation and in practice will need to be carefully observed and that we hold ourselves <Col N="2360" /> perfectly free to bring forward to the Dáil at any time or from time to time such amendments as may appear necessary.  In that spirit I recommend the rules to the Dáil and I ask that they be approved.</P>

He has statutory power to administer oaths, but as regards taking affidavits for court purposes, my advice is that he has no such power at the moment.  If he has not we cannot confer it on him by rule.  We can, as I pointed out, where necessary alter or modify a statute, but we cannot confer an entirely new power upon a peace commissioner. Without committing myself on the question whether or not it would be desirable that he would have such power, for the moment we cannot give it to him by these rules.</P>

      <P>In the Schedule to the Fifth Report, page 22, Order 83, before the first line, to insert the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;The Second Stage of a Bill shall not be taken earlier than the third day after the Bill has been printed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the Schedule to the Fifth Report, page 24, to add at the end of Order 90, after the word &ldquo;report,&rdquo; the words &ldquo;on a day not earlier than the third day following the date of the Second Reading.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to ask the House to agree that these two amendments should be inserted in the proposed Standing Orders.  It will be seen by any Deputy who has taken the trouble to look into the paragraphs referred to that the object of the amendments is to ensure that a certain period will elapse between the introduction of a Bill and the passing of a Bill.  The object is to ensure that unless very exceptional circumstances arise which are dealt with in paragraph 127 dealing with the suspension of Standing Orders, a Bill shall not be able to be carried through all its stages within less than six days. I think the suggestion is one that <Col N="2363" /> should commend itself to the House. I think it is a very moderate attempt to put into the Standing Orders what would, in the normal course of things, be secured to the House, but without such Standing Order may possibly&mdash;I only put it as a possibility&mdash;allow of a Bill to be brought forward, ordered to be taken for Second Reading the same day or the next day, and again ordered to be taken on the Committee Stage, Report Stage and Final Stage within another day or two.  We have not got a very long tradition which guarantees that there shall be a period between the introduction and passing of a Bill. I think it is not outside the recollection of the House that motions and Bills have been brought forward and orders made for discussion at an earlier stage than I think is justified in the case of any legislation.  I believe that we ought to make it a normal thing which should only be departed from very exceptionally, that a Bill before coming into law should be before the House for a reasonable period.  I am trying to make the very minimum between the First Reading and the Final Stage six days.  As I said, I have not touched on Standing Order 127 which would allow in any case of urgent necessity a departure from even the Standing Order which would be amended if my proposal were accepted.</P>
    <P>As the Standing Order is printed, the intention has been to allow the House to state when the next stage will be taken, and in the ordinary course that would be a date of from two to five days forwards, but in the absence of a Standing Order to the contrary the House may decide to take the next reading of a Bill on the following day, and again, the next reading on the next following day.  I think that you ought to provide against that being done for the protection of the House and the rights of the members. The alternative, as I see it, to having a Standing Order which would safeguard the members in this matter would be to impose an obligation upon Deputies to be always and ever present in the House during the sitting of the House.  That is an obligation that ought not to be imposed.  It may be <Col N="2364" /> quite well and reasonably argued that the defence of the member is in the Chair, and in 99 cases out of 100, and even in 999 cases out of 1,000, that may be sufficient, but even Homer &ldquo;nods,&rdquo; and there may be changes in the chairmanship.  We ought to have a Standing Order for the guidance of the Chair, and the security of the members in regard to legislation.</P>
    <P>The normal procedure will, I have no doubt, be that a longer notice than I am seeking to provide for would be given to members in the case of successive stages of a Bill, but it may well be that a measure may be brought forward which does not seem to excite opposition, and with the acquiescence of the majority of the House, so often given on a motion from the Ministerial benches, the next stages would be taken to-morrow.  There may be in the minds of Deputies who were not present at the time very important provisions in regard to that measure, and those Deputies ought to have the opportunity of examining Bills and to be secured in that opportunity by the Standing Orders.  That is what I want to provide for.  I think it is not quite satisfactory to leave this matter entirely at the option of the House which may be sitting at the time, to say when the next stage shall be taken, without some general security for the members who may not be present.  It will be noticed that Section 82 closes with the words &ldquo;If leave to introduce a Bill is given an Order shall be made for its Second Reading and the Bill shall be printed.&rdquo;  The question arises as to when that order may be made for; it may be made for the next day, and if the Second Reading is taken the next day Deputies may not have had the opportunity of reading the Bill. But the Second Reading is then taken. I want to provide that three days shall be secured before the Second Stage, and similarly I want to ensure that the Report Stage shall not be taken up on a date earlier than the third day following the Second Reading, so that if there is any change of a material character in Committee an opportunity will be secured to Deputies to come to the House and to record their views on the Report Stage.  I think it is <Col N="2365" /> necessary that there should be secured for the House this minimum period for the consideration of a measure before the Final Reading, and I think that we ought to have in the Standing Orders a regulation of that character.  I therefore ask the House to agree with the amendments which I have put down.</P>

      <P>I suppose the Dáil has never had a more perfect instance of complete unselfishness than when they heard Deputy Johnson pleading the case of the Deputy who is not regularly here.  I did not know that Deputy Johnson had very much sympathy with that Deputy as a rule.  I could have imagined Deputy Johnson, with perfect justice and with a better right than any other Deputy in the Dáil, repudiating that Deputy and stating that it was his business to be here.  I understand that he has moved both his amendments together, and that places me in something of a dilemma, because I agree with his first amendment, but I am somewhat doubtful about his second.</P>

      <P>There is this to be said for the amendment, not in the interests of the Deputy who is not here, but in the interests of the constituent who cannot be here, that apart from cases of exceptional urgency when all parties would agree to setting aside the Standing Orders, it is right when Bills are introduced that constituents should have some knowledge of them. A three days' interval after the Bill is in print is barely sufficient to enable a summary of the Bill to be published in the Press, to have it read by people in the country and to enable them to impart their views to their representatives for Second Reading.  I think that there is a good deal to be said for Deputy Johnson's point of view.  Not only is it desirable that Deputies should have three days to consider a Bill, but it is very desirable that persons affected by Bills, persons whose professions or trades or everyday manner of life are affected, should have time to communicate with their representative <Col N="2366" /> and give him their views.  Deputy Johnson's amendment covers that.  I do not think it has been moved in any sense as a vote of censure.</P>
      <P>We have had very fair play from the Government whenever we have asked for additional time to consider matters, but I think that the principle proposed by Deputy Johnson in the first amendment is a sound one.  I am not quite so clear with regard to the second amendment.  Perhaps it will save time if I discuss them together. The principle of it is sound, but I recognise that in other assemblies where the tradition that Deputy Johnson speaks of is established, such procedure is frequently departed from.  I happened to have occasion last night to look up the proceedings in the House of Commons on the Irish Free State Constitution Bill, a matter of some importance, and I found that the Second Reading was taken on one day and all the remaining stages on the following day.  I have very often found it the case of British Acts that they have been hurried through in a manner which most of us would regard as unseemly and which Deputy Johnson would regard as positively indecent. If we have a Division upon this amendment, subject to what I hear from the Minister, I will vote for it, but I think the second amendment is one that would be better left to the general feeling of the Dáil.  If the rule is made it will be very often departed from, and a rule that is constantly being departed from is valueless.  On the other hand, I think that under ordinary circumstances the first amendment would not and should not be departed from. If it is made a rule it should remain a rule, a rule which will be of value not only to Deputies but to the world outside.</P>

      <P>This amendment would need to be read and considered in the light of the new Standing Order which deals with the suspension of Standing Orders.  As I see it, if the amendments which Deputy Johnson seeks now to incorporate into Standing Orders were approved by the Dáil, it would be possible for even one Deputy, under the new Standing Order regarding the <Col N="2367" /> suspension of Standing Orders without notice, which provides for unanimous consent, to block a Bill which a Government charged with the duty of preserving the public peace or safety deemed to be urgently necessary, even though that view held by the Government who, after all, are primarily responsible, might have the support of the overwhelming majority of the Dáil, conceivably of every one except one dissenting Deputy.  I think the Dail ought not to put itself in splints in the fashion that Deputy Johnson asks it to do by this amendment.  I think there ought to be some consideration for the rights of the majority as against the tyrannical minority.  Minorities are always tyrannical, and the conception of one Deputy, in the face of perhaps quite a serious national position, blocking the progress of a Bill which not merely the Government but nine-tenths of the Dáil or ninety-nine hundredths of it felt it necessary to pass, is simply ludicrous.</P>
      <P>It may be said that for the purpose of my argument I am taking an extreme case.  There are other cases not quite so extreme and yet to my mind entirely convincing.  Let us take the case of a Bill such as the Finance Bill, or other Bills, which fall in in that way, and the progress of which it would be generally recognised desirable to expedite.  We should not prohibit ourselves from passing such a Bill through all its stages even in less than the six days that Deputy Johnson is inclined to stipulate.  Take a Bill regarding which there is no question, a Bill felt by all parties to be urgently necessary; it should be even possible to take its Second Stage on the day on which it reached the hands of Deputies. I can conceive a situation in which it would be desirable to take all stages of a Bill in a day.</P>

      <P>Possibly without notice in the Parliamentary sense of a certain number of days.  The majority of the Dáil would have to decide, guided by the Chair, on the reasonableness of the date proposed for Second Reading.  Deputy Johnson invites the <Col N="2368" /> Dáil to erect a barricade against itself and to put splints and fetters upon itself that would prevent it from passing a Bill which it felt it was urgently necessary to pass.  He seeks to create a position as I see it&mdash;I may be wrong, and if I am wrong the Deputy will correct me&mdash;by which one Deputy in the House could hold up the progress of a Bill which every other Deputy felt to be urgently necessary in the public interest.  If I am right in that, and I think I am right, I feel it is scarcely necessary to add anything further in the condemnation of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask what circumstances does the Minister anticipate as arising that will determine that such an extraordinary change should be made as that we should come here and find a measure that the whole Dáil wanted held up by one Deputy.  What exceptional circumstance does the Minister see ahead that would make it necessary to pass the Second Stage of a Bill without notice introduced the previous day? Why should the Dáil decide to put itself in that position?  Standing Orders, after all, are not framed for a dav; they are for a time, in the future, when even a more autocratic party than the present Government Party are in power.  It is quite conceivable it would be the desire of such a party to see measures rushed through, at the eleventh hour.  We have tasted a little of that kind of thing ourselves in the last couple of days.  Whatever the Minister for Justice may think about the tyrannical minority, there ought to be some protection for what Deputy Cooper says are the interests of the constituents.  When Deputy Johnson made the point that the absence of a Deputy from the House might make a difference I have no hesitation in saying that the absence of Deputy Johnson, at times, would make a difference, and the absence of the Minister for Justice at times might make a difference, perhaps, to the advantage of the House.  Rightly or wrongly, if we agree that there is no substance in this amendment of Deputy Johnson, we are putting the Dáil in the position that a <Col N="2369" /> Bill can be taken without notice and pass its Second Reading.  Then, where will the Dáil be and where will the majority of the people be when they find, on examination, that such a measure contains principles that are not acceptable in the best interests of the country?  I think Deputy Johnson is not asking too much in this amendment of his.  The Minister for Justice made no case against it.  While he made an effort to draw a picture of the exceptional circumstances that we should anticipate, he did not indicate what those exceptional circumstances may be.  Would he point out some very exceptional circumstance, even in the life of the present Dáil, which, in the interests of the country, it would have been well that the condition he wants to create should have been in existence?</P>

      <P>I have, I suppose, more interest in the Standing Orders than anybody else.  Let us take the case of a tyrannical majority. Standing Orders are no protection whatever against a tyrannical majority. As soon as you get a really tyrannical majority, if that tyrannical majority has no regard for the rights of minorities in the House, nor for the rights of people outside, it will have still less regard for the Standing Orders.  I want to see that we have Standing Orders which can be fulfilled. Deputy Cooper has given us an example of the way that the Free State Constitution Bill was passed in the British House of Commons.  I wonder, assuming the British Commons had an order similar to that proposed here, whether that Standing Order would have been allowed to stand in the way.  In my opinion it would not have been allowed to stand in the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position that has to be envisaged is that the Chair must be given as much power as the Chair can reasonably exercise.  These proposed new Standing Orders were drawn up as a result of our experience.  They were submitted to the Committee on Procedure and <Col N="2370" /> Privileges, and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, of which Deputy Johnson and Deputy Cooper are members, decided that they should first be submitted to a conference drawn from different Parties, and including Deputies who might be deemed to have a special interest in and knowledge of Standing Orders.  That informal conference made a considerable number of changes in the draft submitted to it, and then the amended draft came forward to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges considered the draft and made further alterations, and the fifth report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges expresses the unanimous view of that Committee.</P>
    <P>When the report came before the Dáil, Deputy Johnson moved to have it sent back, and it was again considered by the Committee, and, Deputy Johnson dissenting, it was decided to make no change.  Deputy Cooper was not present at the meeting of the Committee which came to that conclusion. The fundamental point about Bills is this: When a Bill has been introduced into the House, it passes out of the possession of the particular Minister or Deputy who introduces it and comes into the possession of the House, and the House can do what it likes with it. If the House decides to do wrong, that is the business of the House, and those in the House who do wrong will have to pay for it by well-known and established processes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Others will pay as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Others will pay as well.  Whenever wrong is done there is always evil done to others than the wrongdoer.  But the wrongdoer will pay, and the wrongdoer cannot be prevented by Standing Orders from doing the wrong that he wants to do if he is bent on it and has a majority.  No Standing Orders that we can frame will keep the dreadful, tyrannical, autocratic majority that may be looming up for us in the future from doing something wrong.  It is not possible.  As a matter of fact, the proposals contained in the draft Standing Orders put forward by the Committee, <Col N="2371" /> of which I happened to be Chairman, embodies our actual practice.  A long time has been given for certain Bills, a shorter time for other Bills, and if Deputy Johnson's amendment were inserted it would be a reasonable minimum provision for a certain number of measures.  As a matter of fact three days is an unreasonably short period for a very considerable number of measures, and the majority of the important measures that have been considered by this House have had a period of more than three days elapsing between the introduction of the Bill and the Second Reading, and very considerably more than six days between the introduction of the Bill and its passing by this House.</P>
      <P>Three days is an unreasonably short period, but if it is inserted that three days be the minimum, then some provision must be made for the exceptional case.  In the actual drafting of the Standing Orders, in which there is a misprint in Standing Order 127, as I previously pointed out, unanimous consent would be necessary to suspend Standing Orders, and, consequently, unanimous consent would be necessary to take the Second Stage of the Bill earlier than three days from the date of the introduction.</P>

      <P>If that Standing Order were in existence with myself in the Chair and the present Government in office, or with any Chairman or Government in office, that Standing Order could be overridden if it were wanted to do so.  The Standing Order would not be observed; it could not be observed.  Some provision must be made for finding machinery to deal with exceptional cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The machinery in the Standing Orders under which we are working provides for two things: Firstly, that the Chair must be convinced that it is a matter of urgent necessity to take the Second Stage of a Bill without notice, and, secondly, that the majority of the members who have taken their seats must be in favour of so doing.  I am convinced, after experience, that the duty <Col N="2372" /> of deciding whether it is a matter of urgent necessity that a Bill should be taken without notice to another Stage is one on which the Chair cannot properly decide.  The simplest case to give as an example is that of the London Agreement.  Let us take the president of any executive council which had concluded an agreement amending the Treaty.  If he comes back to the House, finds a fairly full meeting of the House, and says to the Chairman&mdash;who is a person with no political responsibility: &ldquo;It is a matter of urgent national concern that this matter should be discussed to-day and that I should have an opportunity of seeing whether the majority of the House is willing to discuss it to-day,&rdquo; I do not think the Chairman would say: &ldquo;I do not think it is a matter of urgent necessity.&rdquo; He could not, and no Chairman could say it either to the present President, Deputy Johnson, Deputy Baxter or Deputy Hewat, if any of those were President, because the word of the person upon whom the Dáil had actually devolved the responsibility has to be taken as to what is a matter of urgent national importance.  I think the Chairman would not disagree with him. Therefore the Chair should not be given power which it could not exercise.</P>
    <P>We had an example yesterday of a different question in which the Chair could and did intervene.  The Minister for Finance made a statement on the Land Bank.  Deputies expressed a desire to discuss that statement.  The Minister had made no provision for its discussion.  Deputy Heffernan raised the matter as one of urgent public importance, so that there could be a discussion. It seemed to the Chair that it was a matter which ought to be discussed, and the Chair therefore was able to put the Minister for Finance into this dilemma: that either he agreed to a discussion at the time which seemed reasonable to the Chair, or that a particular Standing Order was construed in favour of the Deputy so that he would get one-and-a-half hours' discussion. The result was one-and-a-half hours' discussion for the Deputy.  It was a case where the Deputy was protected by the Chair; but there are cases <Col N="2373" /> where the Chair can intervene and cases where it cannot intervene.</P>
    <P>No Standing Order which the House can make can give adequate protection to minorities in the House against a majority which is as vicious&mdash;I will use the word &ldquo;vicious&rdquo;&mdash;as the kind of majority which is painted for us occasionally; such a majority would have no respect for the Standing Orders if it had no respect for minorities, and no respect for the Chair.  You must cater for the ordinary case, and actually our experience is, as far as I have been able to find out, that Bills come to the House and the House makes an order by general agreement.  When an Order is made for the Second Reading it is made without objection or made as is frequently done here when the Minister says: &ldquo;We will take the Second Reading next Wednesday,&rdquo; and some Deputy says: &ldquo;We want the Second Reading next Friday,&rdquo; and the Minister says, &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;  The Order is then made for the Friday, not the Wednesday, as was originally proposed. If real objection is taken, a motion must be made by the Minister, and that motion can be debated and divided upon.  The Order is not automatically made, the motion must be discussed.</P>
    <P>If it is decided to put a Bill through all its stages in one day, we must pass a motion introducing the Bill, pass a motion that the Second Stage be taken, closure the debate on that motion, debate the Second Stage, pass a motion for the Second Stage, make a motion to take the Committee Stage, debate that, closure it, pass the Committee Stage and closure it in the same way.  It is a long process, but it can be done by a majority.  It seems to me easy for the minority to make its influence felt in those different processes.  My experience, and my reading in the matter, leads me to believe that you cannot make Standing Orders which will give you protection against people who do not really want to be reasonable.  You simply cannot do that.  The position in which we are in this House is that a suggestion by the Chair has very great weight and is, I think, as yesterday, almost always accepted and generally agreed with as to how the work is to <Col N="2374" /> be done.  If you cannot get agreement, the House is a sovereign assembly, and Standing Orders cannot be used to prevent the House declaring what it really wants.  I think Deputies must remember that is the exact position.  If the House wants to pass a Bill in one day it may do so.  The House may be wrong, but the Standing Orders will not prevent it from doing as it wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House ought to be very grateful to you for your assistance in connection with this proposed amendment.  Deputy Johnson's amendment at first seemed to me so entirely reasonable that I could not see why the arguments raised in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should have turned it down.  But not having had the advantage of the discussion that took place at the Committee, of course I was not in a position to hear the other side of the case.  We have heard the case made by the Minister for Justice and your very lucid remarks on the practice of the House. I am now thoroughly convinced that while in principle the House ought to adopt and recognise the period of three days as between the introduction and the Second Reading&mdash;it is, if anything, rather a short period and should be extended&mdash;cases of emergency must, however, from time to time arise.  By practically the unanimous wish of the House a state of urgency may be declared which might necessitate very much more prompt action in dealing with a Bill than would be formulated in connection with Deputy Johnson's amendment.  I think really the House must largely be guided, as far as the protection of the minority is concerned, by the Chair, and I think that is provided for in our Standing Orders very fully.  Of course an autocratic <Col N="2375" /> majority might be very oppressive to a small minority.  We sometimes have words of wisdom let fall from a small minority.  Still I think we ought to take these things as they come.  I think we have to make our own traditions as they are really the greatest safeguard we can have.</P>
      <P>I started with the impression that Deputy Johnson's amendment was unanswerable, and I am now prepared, if necessary, to vote against it.  That indicates the value of debate in matters of this kind.  The debate elucidated the position which we were confronted with just now.  I think it is rather a serious matter as far as the privilege of the minority is concerned, but I think the safeguard we can best look to is in public opinion, which will always operate against autocratic action in connection with any proceedings of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I might explain that I am not particularly concerned with the autocratic majority.  That is not the fear I have before me.  It is the too acquiescent, and, perhaps, negligent minority, and the procedure that might well take place because of that casy acquiescence in suggestions and decisions of the Ministerial bench. We are not unfamiliar with the practice resulting from attempted accommodation between one party and another. An arrangement made in one part of the day to take a certain measure at a certain time is altered, and it is taken at an earlier time, and a general reshuffling of the time-table of the House is decided across the floor of the House.  That can be done with perhaps 25 people present, and an order can be made under such circumstances that a Bill which does not appear to be controversial should be taken.  That is the decision of the House.  It is not a tyrannical majority that is making that decision.  It is done with the acquiescence of those who are present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputies who may be particularly interested in that measure may not be present at the <Col N="2376" /> time.  The House has made an order and the decision lies.  It is to prevent the possibility of that being repeated in such a way as would deprive Deputies of the right to discuss legislative proposals that I make a distinction between a legislative measure and the ordinary business of the House, on finances, motions, and so on, because we are committing ourselves to something against which the people outside have no remedy except through the House.  I realise that the opinion of the House is probably against me in this matter, but, I call attention to the consequences that I foresee under these new orders.  As Deputy Hewat said, we must make our own traditions, and the making of them may take a long time if they are to be on the right road.  But we have been making traditions already&mdash;we are in the way of making them&mdash;and some of these traditions, I think, are not good.  They ought to be the reverse.  I fear that this process will probably allow bad traditions to grow up.  I think it is a bad tradition to allow legislative measures to be passed through, even though they appear to be non-controversial, without time for adequate consideration, for a public expression of views on them, and for the closest possible examination and comparison. As I say, even the least controversial measures ought to secure a minimum time before they become law.</P>
      <P>I would point to the absence from the Dáil, up to the present, of regular party machinery which makes a minimum fixed period requisite.  In my view the existence of well-informed, well-organised party machinery makes the absence of rules of this kind permissible. In other places there is always some kind of machinery working up, looking after and examining closely Bills with their possible implications.  We have not that here.  Consequently the more necessity there is for being assured of time for adequate consideration. I think what will come out of the new rule is the necessity for using that process which the Ceann Comhairle has suggested, of debating and discussing every proposal to take stages of a Bill, and rather to encourage all the more what is called obstructive tactics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2377" /> I think that the necessity will result from this of much more effectively organising the machinery of the Parties, and whether that will be good for the House or not I am not entirely satisfied. I think if we are going to run the risk of having legislative measures passed through the House without an assurance, secured them by Standing Orders, of adequate consideration, all this Parliamentary machine will have to be very much tightened up for the protection of the interested Deputy or Deputies; or we shall endeavour to prevent facilitating the passing of Bills whether they are controversial or not. And I do not think that that is going to be an improvement.  I regret that the feeling of the House is against the proposal to ensure by the Standing Orders that a too acquiescent, perhaps negligent minority, an artificial security, if you like, not against, as I say, a vicious and tyrannical majority, but against the consequences of its own carelessness.</P>

      <P>My intervention in this debate is, first, because I was responsible for the original draft of the new Standing Order, and, secondly, because I was Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It is no harm to say that Deputy Johnson was always the most valuable and diligent member of that Committee, so that when the views of the Committee are to be expressed in the House they are most effectively expressed by him, since Deputy Fitzgibbon, the present Justice of the Supreme Court, left us.  When Deputy Johnson expresses a contrary view to the Committee I am left to express the view of the Committee.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges are well aware of my views with regard to the passage of legislation, and so are Ministers, but perhaps the House is not so well aware of them.  I am quite clear that no legislation should be passed hurriedly, not even non-controversial legislation.  I have urged that view constantly and wherever I have had power I have seen that that view is made operative.  It is not right to say that this is a new scheme.  What is in these draft Standing Orders really embodies what we have been doing; <Col N="2378" /> and what is, from the point of view of the Committee, objectionable in the proposed amendment is, that it would unduly fetter the House.  Now I want to make it as clear as I can that we should not make a tradition, and I do not think that we have made a tradition, of the very rapid passage of measures without due necessity. Neither should we prevent ourselves, when the necessity arises, from passing a measure with less than three days between First and Second Stages.  But if we could continue, and if this House and future Houses could continue, the atmosphere, of what I consider, on the whole, reasonableness that has prevailed in this House in dealing with the fixing of stages of Bills, I think the House would not have a bad tradition.  I do not think these Orders should be used for the purpose of passing measures through with undue haste.  I give it as my considered view to minorities here that, to prevent the practice of constantly passing measures through the House with undue haste, they should make use of every opportunity which parliamentary procedure allows them.</P>
