      <P>There are fourteen drainage districts situated entirely or partly in County Kildare.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is not now responsible for prosecutions with respect to unlicensed dogs.  The effect of Section 39, sub-section (1) of the Finance Act, 1925, makes penalties for failure to licence dogs excise penalties, for the recovery of which proceedings <Col N="1589" /> can only be brought by the Revenue Commissioners or their officers.  The Gárda Síochána, however, have been instructed to call on dog owners to produce their licences.  A list will be compiled of those who fail to take out a licence and will be supplied to the Revenue Commissioners so that they may institute proceedings.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether there is at present sitting a Departmental Committee of Inquiry into the Training College system, and, if so, whether he will state how long this Committee is in existence, what are its terms of reference and personnel, has any interim report been issued or has any oral evidence been taken; what outside bodies, if any, have been invited by this Committee to place their views before it and on what date were such invitations, if any, issued; whether the scheme for the establishment of preparatory colleges was a recommendation from this Committee, and, if so, whether the Minister will state what body or bodies, if any, were consulted by this Committee before such recommendation was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE (replying)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Committee consisting of the following officers of the Department, viz., the Chief Inspector <Col N="1591" /> of the Primary Branch (Chairman), one of the General Inspectors of the Department, a senior Inspector of the Technical Instruction Branch, the General Organising Inspector of Agricultural Science, and the Principal Clerk of the National Education Office, was set up in December, 1924, to examine the existing arrangements for the recruitment and training of teachers.</P>
      <P>The Department felt that the monitorial system had failed in its purpose, and had under consideration the question of the substitution of residential Preparatory Colleges situated mainly in the Irish-speaking districts as a means of recruiting suitable candidates for the teaching profession.</P>
      <P>At an early stage the Committee satisfied itself that the monitorial system should be abolished and Preparatory Coleges substituted.</P>
      <P>The outline of the proposed scheme was explained to a deputation from the Executive Committee of the Teachers' Organisation in February, 1925.  The matter was also discussed with representatives of the Managers and Ecclesiastical Authorities; with representatives of the Irish Colleges and of the Gaelic League, and with several other bodies connected with educational activity.</P>
      <P>In March, 1925, the Committee submitted an Interim Report recommending the abolition of monitors, the revision of the pupil-teacher system, and setting out the lines on which the proposed Preparatory Colleges should be set up.</P>
      <P>During the discussion in the Dáil on the Estimates for 1925-26, the President intimated the intention of the Department to proceed with the establishment of Preparatory Colleges.</P>
      <P>In July, 1925, the Minister for Education, in the tour of various centres for the Irish course, discussed the scheme with various parties interested in education, and endeavoured to obtain their views as to the manner in which the scheme could be worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 15th October, 1925, a full outline of the proposed scheme was sent to the Executive of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, and they were <Col N="1592" /> informed that the Committee would be glad to discuss the whole question with the representatives of the Organisation on a suitable date about the end of that month.  A meeting, however, with representatives of the Teachers' Organisation did not take place.</P>
    <P>Pending approval of the Preparatory College proposals, the Committee deferred its inquiry into the general question of the training of teachers, but has now resumed its sittings and is at present collecting evidence from persons who have knowledge of the inner working of the Training Colleges.  Some Inspectors who had been teachers, and who had undergone a course of training, have already been examined.</P>
    <P>The following bodies either have been invited or are about to be invited to place their views before the Committee:&mdash;The representatives of the Management and of the Staffs of the Training Colleges, Professors of Education in the University Colleges, the Managers' Association, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, and such other persons or bodies as appear to be in a position to give assistance to the Committee.</P>

According to medical evidence supplied by the claimant, his disabiliay at present consists of varicose veins, which, I am advised, could not arise as a result of injury from barbed wire.  In the circumstances, no award could be made to him within the terms of the Army Pensions Act, 1923, and he was so informed on the 30th September last.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question I would refer the Deputy to paragraphs 92 and 93 of the Interim Report of the Roads Advisory SubCommittee on the taxation of road vehicles, dated February, 1925.  Effect was given to the recommendation by the issue of an Order on the 15th of October last reducing from 12 tons to 9 tons the legal laden weight of all heavy vehicles not licensed before that date except in the cases of the four County Boroughs.  The answer to the second part of the question is in the affirmative.  In every case where a definite proposal is submitted the Council is asked for information necessary to consider the holding of a local inquiry. <Col N="1594" /> The whole matter was fully explained to the County Councils by a circular letter dated the 28th May, 1925, a copy of which I will give to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is yet in a position to state the result of the further inquiries he promised to make in connection with the financial position of the Limerick County Council; and if he will state what is the total amount of Agricultural Grant withheld from the County Council owing to defaulting annuitants up to February 16th, 1926.</P>

      <P>I am in correspondence with the Chairman of the County Council as to the delay in completing the abstracts of accounts, and I will inform the Deputy of the position when a reply has been received.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, the amount withdrawn from the Guarantee Fund in respect of land purchase arrears in the county up to February, 1925, which was not met by the county share of the Estate Duty Grant was £13,134.  This amount is charged against the county share of the Agricultural Grant.  During the year ended 16th February, 1926, the draws from the Guarantee Fund in respect of land purchase arrears in 1925, including arrears, etc., under the Land Act, 1925, exceeded the repayments by a sum of £2,693 18s. 6d. This amount is recoverable from the proportion of the share of the county in the Estate Duty Grant for the current year.

The Committee recommended that the hours for the commencement of fairs should be fixed. The Department have not at present any general powers to regulate the hours for the holding of fairs; and the powers of local authorities, where they have any, are varying and indefinite. The matter is, however, being considered in conjunction with the Department of Local Government, with a view to possible legislation.

    <P>Deputies will remember that last year there was a discrepancy of a fortnight between the termination of Summer Time in the Saorstát and in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  As a result of that, serious inconvenience was caused to railway companies, and <Col N="1601" /> there was a certain amount of dislocation of postal services in the country. Complaints were made as to the hours of delivery.  If this Order is endorsed by the Dáil and Seanad it will secure uniformity with the termination date in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and France, and bring us into line in the matter.  There is no need to alter the date of commencement, which is the same in the Saorstát, Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The Act passed last year was a permanent Act, leaving a certain elasticity as to dates which can be varied by a special resolution of this kind, provided the Order changing the date is endorsed by both Houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment last night I was dealing with a fact which I think is of the utmost importance when considering the questions that were raised by Deputies Heffernan and O'Mara in their speeches (apart from the questions raised in the motions they have on the Order Paper), as to the effect on agriculture and industry of the amount of taxation and the conclusions that were drawn that the present depression in both agriculture and industry arose out of, and were caused by, the existing amount of taxation.  I was pointing <Col N="1602" /> to the fact that the trouble in regard to agriculture seemed to me to be very much deeper in its causes and would consequently require radical remedies.</P>
      <P>In 1925 the area of ploughed land throughout Ireland was the lowest of any year since 1847, whatever may have been the position prior to that year.  There has been a continuous decline up to 1914 in the area under the plough since the 'fifties, and it was only during the European war, under a certain stimulus of high prices and also the stimulus of compulsory tillage, that the area of ploughed land was increased. Since 1918 there has been a new period of decline, leading to the minimum of 2,154,000 acres for the whole country in 1925.</P>
      <P>When it is borne in mind that general agreement is reached amongst experts that ordinary arable land which is tilled produces two-and-a-half to three times&mdash;speaking very moderately &mdash;the amount of food that the same land under grass would produce, we can see that the causes of the decline of wealth in the country are not temporary, and are not due to local and immediate circumstances; the decline of wealth is due to some deep-seated causes which have been operating for many years.  I urge that it is necessary to deal with this problem, having regard to the fact that the causes of the decline in gross national production from the land are not temporary but are deep-seated, and that it must be dealt with radically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the representatives of the farmers are very short-sighted when they think only in terms of prices that are obtained for produce in England and when they think of the present incidence of taxation as the effective cause of any present depression in agriculture.  My complaint with the present agitation, and with the speeches made on the matter&mdash;not that one is satisfied that every penny raised is well spent and that the utmost economy is already arrived at&mdash;is that the agitation is tending to divert people's minds in the wrong direction in looking for the cause in taxation.  It is not by any means the cause, and, no matter how much effect the agitation would have upon expenditure, it is not <Col N="1603" /> going to bring about the change, especially in agricultural conditions, that is sought for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan said it was necessary to give some inducement to farmers to produce more from the land. I am not going to controvert that.  We know, as a matter of fact, that in practice some inducement may be required, and it was the inducement, during the war, of high prices for agricultural produce which led to the increased productivity of the soil.  What do Deputy Heffernan and others who think with him expect will come out of the present situation in England in regard to prices?  They are inclined to lay stress upon the condition of the English market and the supplying of the English market.  They are supported in that view by nearly every public writer, who says the only market is the English market.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that the trend of public opinion in England&mdash; predominant public opinion&mdash;is to reduce prices of agricultural produce.  If that becomes effective we will have to face the possibility that prices in the English market are going to be lower, not higher, and any decline in total taxation which may come about by a little economy here and a little cut there is not going to have any appreciable effect upon the agricultural producer's market.  The prices in England may become lower and, if they do, how is any reduction in taxation here that is appreciable going to remedy the situation?</P>
    <P>I would like Deputy Heffernan and others to consider the possibility and the desirability of increasing the home market for agricultural produce and to seek out ways and means of securing that increase.  I find that in the year 1925, there were imports of farm produce, outside wheat and flour, to the extent of six million pounds worth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Outside wheat and flour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for produce other than wheat, flour or maize.  I am speaking mainly of bacon, butter, cheese, eggs, lard, barley, oats, oat products, malt, potatoes and other vegetables. <Col N="1604" /> The amount came to £5,751,000. There is an Irish market which is supplied from outside.  There is another market waiting, or there is a market which should be waiting&mdash;the demand, which is not effective at the moment, of, say, three or four hundred thousand people for agricultural produce.  Those people cannot buy except in very small quantities, and then only of the cheapest possible kind, because they are unemployed.  If we were to take the families whose bread-winners are unemployed and the families whose bread-winners are under-employed, we would find that the absence of purchasing power amongst these families constitutes the loss of a very big market for Irish agriculturists in this country.</P>
      <P>Everybody would be delighted if we were to find some new country whose demand for foodstuffs would be wholly directed to Ireland; people would almost think we had found a gold mine.  There is here a potential demand from three or four hundred thousand people, including bread-winners and their families, waiting for supplies, in addition to the large number of people who are buying imported agricultural produce.  I would ask the Deputies on the Farmers' benches to consider whether it is not to their advantage to assist in any movement which will put these unemployed and under-employed men in work in the towns and also to secure for those who are already employed continuance of fair wages even though&mdash;you have the right to demand it, I admit&mdash;we impose upon the town dwellers some kind of an obligation to spend the wages they receive in Irish produce.</P>
      <P>I put it forward as a proposition to the agriculturists that their interests lie in creating, or assisting to create, amongst the townsmen in Ireland a market for their own produce.  I say it is better to assist in the creation of that market than to rely so much&mdash;as they are now relying&mdash;upon extensions of a market in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question immediately arises as to how this potential demand of unemployed town workers is going to be made effective.  While I am prepared to commend any efforts made that promise success&mdash;such as the efforts <Col N="1605" /> that have been made in recent legislation to create new industries and assist existing industries&mdash;my fault with the present estimates lies in this, that there is no sign that the Government has set itself to the task of putting unemployed men on works of utility so that they may earn wages out of which they can buy Irish agricultural produce.  It remains for the Irish agriculturist to assist in endeavouring to promote industries in the towns, but it is for those who are responsible for the government of the country to ensure that those people who are being deprived of direct access to the means of life shall have some kind of employment offered and guaranteed.  The policy that has been entered upon by the Government in regard to employment and in regard to wages is a policy that cuts right to the roots of agricultural prosperity in Ireland, in so far as that prosperity depends upon having an Irish market.</P>
    <P>It is disastrous to Irish agriculture that townsmen&mdash;the customers of the farmer&mdash;should be cut down to the barest minimum and be thus deprived of an opportunity, however they might desire it, to buy the bacon, butter, eggs and poultry which the small farmers of the country would produce.  You are forcing, by a policy of low wages, the recipient of low wages to look for the poorest fodder and not the best quality of farm produce.  It is because I think that the policy of the Government, so far as it has been exhibited, is a policy which is going to assist the continuous decline of agriculture in respect to the home market and is going to assist in the emigration programme that has been the cause of so much grief, and it is because there is no sign in the estimates that the Government is rising to its responsibilities in respect to employment or in respect to the maintenance of manhood among unemployed people, that I am prepared to support any proposition, whether it be a reduction of £2,000,000 or a reduction of £100, which will show the country that the Dáil is not satisfied with the fiscal policy of the Ministry, in so far as it has been propounded.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Heffernan's motion for reduction were carried, it would mean not merely a protest on the part of the <Col N="1606" /> Dáil, but it would mean that a future Ministry would have to come to the Dáil at an earlier stage for larger sums. I think that would be a good thing in itself.  I believe it is necessary, if the Dáil and the Government are taking into account the necessities of the present situation, that the Government should come before us within the next couple of weeks with propositions which would probably involve the borrowing of large sums of money, directed seriously to productive purposes and to ensure that those who are willing to work and able to work shall be provided with work.  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that, when the estimates come forward for detailed consideration, we shall find many opportunities of criticising cases in which economies can be made.  I, therefore, promise Deputy Heffernan that, so far as I am personally concerned, I shall be quite pleased to support his amendment. But I again say that the endeavours made by Deputy Heffernan, by Deputy O'Mara, and by others writing and speaking outside, to attribute the present depression to the taxation of the country, is putting the country upon a wrong track and will not lead to the finding of the secret of an improved situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>One would expect to hear some further arguments advanced in defence of the policy of the Ministry in connection with the Estimates that have been put before the Dáil and the country.  Deputy Heffernan's amendment is only putting in words here the opinions that have been expressed by his Party since the election of 1923.  In the course of the demand that is being made&mdash;not without a good deal of justification&mdash;for a reduction in national expenditure, the Farmers' Party are not as loud in their protests and exhortations as they might be if they desired to make political capital out of the policy of the Ministry.  I want to make this perfectly clear, because the attitude of some of the Ministers of the Front Bench would lead one to believe that they question our right to criticise here their policy when they make a demand, through us, for money for the services which they have to carry on. We have said little on this subject up <Col N="1607" /> to the present, but what we have said we are prepared to repeat in the presence of the Ministers.  We give our opinions because of an honest desire to induce the Ministry to adopt that policy of retrenchment which we feel the country requires.  We conceive that to be our duty, and what is our duty is also the duty of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister has at all times turned down, with very little apology, this demand for a Committee to go through the various Departments, to consider the Government policy, to take stock of the position and to make recommendations that would lead to retrenchment. The Minister may have satisfied himself that this Committee could do very little.  He or his advisers may think there is very little room for saving in national expenditure.  But neither the Minister nor any other member of the Executive Council nor any Deputy on the Government Benches has said anything to convince us that good would not accrue from the setting up of a Committee such as this.  Our suggestion is only putting in concrete form what we believe any Party would be obliged to do if they occupied the position that the Government occupies at present.  If the Deputies on these Benches, or on the Labour Benches, were in the position of the Government, they would have to take stock of the position as it is at present.  They would have to take stock, too, of the country's capacity and, in the light of that, they would have to say that the country was hardly able to give the money they were demanding.  They would be obliged to say: &ldquo;Our expenditure must be cut down.  In what departments can we effect savings or economies without injury to the country's welfare?  How are we to set about this work?&rdquo;  I believe that they would find one way, and one way only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what advice the Minister gets from an inter-departmental inquiry, that advice will not be given from the same point of view as that of the plain man in the street, who has to regard the problem from two angles. He is the man who has to pay for services offered for his benefit.  The advice <Col N="1608" /> the Minister receives is given from the viewpoint of the man working in a Government office who has an eye to efficiency and who, perhaps, would desire to see things satisfactorily done, regardless of cost.  We cannot take up that attitude, and we can see no other way of making a positive effort to effect economies&mdash;economies that will not entail dislocation&mdash;than the method I have suggested.  If this suggestion were adopted, the people of the country would know that, after careful consideration, definite conclusions had been arrived at by men who had set themselves to do a specific work. Nothing, I say, has been urged by the Minister for Finance or by any Minister of the Executive Council, to show why this should not be done.  We honestly believe that the task cannot be performed in any other way.  I repeat that the demands on the taxpayers are too heavy.  The work of a Committee like this will boil itself down, perhaps, mainly to two things. The first point you would be up against would be: &ldquo;What are the possibilities of reducing the number of officials in Government departments at the present time?&rdquo;  What are the possibilities for carrying on the essential services of the State and at the same time reducing the number of officials necessary to carry on these essential services?  What are the possibilities of an alteration in Government policy that would clip off expenditure and effect economies without doing injury to the country's industries at present or in the future?  If the Minister could give the House figures as to the number of officials who were transferred under the Treaty in 1921 to the present Government; if he could give the salaries and bonuses that are paid to these officials; if he could give the number of officials appointed since the Treaty and the salaries paid to them, with the figures for each Department, we would then know better where we stood.  But at present we and the country are entirely in the dark as to what the possibilities are, either for reducing the number of officials, or the salaries paid to them. This Committee would be put in possession of these facts.  As Deputy <Col N="1609" /> Heffernan said yesterday, they would have to consider the reorganisation of departments; they would have to consider Government policy and make recommendations.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture says something under his breath.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture knows perfectly well that I am not, and I question if he himself is, in a position to say whether all the officials in his department are necessary, or whether the policy of that department is in every respect a necessity for the advancement of the agricultural industry.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture cannot expect that I can pass judgment as to whether or not his department could be run at a lower cost than at present.  I say that if I were through that Department for six months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is asking approximately £29,000,000 from the country this year.  I quite agree that there is a good deal in what Deputy Johnson says, but while we hold, and I believe rightly hold, that the £29,000,000 will come very largely from the agriculturists, these are not the only millions that they will have to pay. There are other millions, millions that cannot be reduced by one single penny. The Minister will admit that the millions for land annuities cannot be reduced by a single penny.  The millions in respect of local rates have been reduced in practically every case to the minimum, and they can hardly be reduced by one penny.  They have to be paid.  We are up against the proposition: can the £29,000,000 that the Government asks for the carrying on of the essential services of the State be reduced?  If we consider the plight of the small farmer we have to exclaim that this sum must be reduced, because the people have not got the money and cannot find it.  I hold that not alone do the bank deposits show a falling off, not alone does our export trade show a <Col N="1610" /> debit balance, but I am perfectly satisfied that two-thirds of the farmers are carrying on, trying to pay their purchase annuities, trying to pay their rates, and trying to pay the national taxation, by depleting their capital.  By that I mean the selling off of their cattle and other stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not the slightest hesitation whatever in saying that not alone are we selling less, but that our reserve or capital is being decreased at a rate that the country cannot estimate.  I believe that the position is really so serious that unless stock is taken, unless something is done to call a halt, we will find, after a year or two, at our present rate of progress, that half the farms will not be carrying one-third of the stock that is necessary to make the holdings economic, and that, while the other half may not be in such a bad position, they will be very near it.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture knows quite well what the position is; he knows that thousands of farmers to-day are not able to pay their land purchase annuities and have not a hoof on the land.  Other men are paying their annuities by taking perhaps their second last cow to the fair.  I am not over-stating the case; I am talking of conditions exactly as I know them.  That is really a very serious aspect.  It is all right for Deputy Johnson to suggest that a reduction in taxation would not be a remedy for all our ills.  I am in thorough agreement with him in that. But when you get the farmer in the position of having always to hand over whatever cash he has to the rate collector, to the Land Commission, to the shopkeeper for his clothes, or for whatever provisions he may require, never having any money in hand to put into his holding, to improve his stock, either in quantity or quality, how can you expect increased productivity?  I say without any hesitation whatever that the accumulated misfortunes of the last two or three years have reduced the farmers to the condition that their stocks and capital are depleted, that they see no prospect of being able to restore their stocks, and that their productivity must inevitably become worse than it is at present.  If that is the position, what are the prospects for <Col N="1611" /> farmers for the next two, three or five years?</P>
    <P>What is the connection between that and taxation?  I say again that the farmers in the end pay a good deal more than 75 per cent. of the total taxation of the country, either local or national. Will Deputy Johnson name somebody, none of whose taxation is paid by the farmer?  Take any man in Dublin.  It is agreed that he pays taxation. Where does he get the money to pay it?  The man driving a coal car has his taxation paid by his employer, but where does the employer get the money?  It is true that he may get it from the doctor, the lawyer, the civil servant, but where do they get it? Every penny that a business man in the town gets comes to him either from the farmers and the country people or from the workers in the town.  Suppose it comes from a worker in the town, where does such a worker find it?  He may be a worker under the urban council and be paid out of the local rates. He may pass some of his money back to the man who paid the rates, but that man paid the rates from money that was paid to him, and in nine cases out of ten that money has come in from the country.</P>

      <P>The man in the country gets it when he labours in the fields, takes his produce to the town or the city, and markets it.  You may ask: Where does the man who buys that produce get the money?  When you go into it you can trace back every penny to the land.  What does all that mean? It means that no matter how you tax the people, whether by means of super-tax, income tax or otherwise, inevitably that tax is pushed back to the people on the land, and the result, the cumulative effect of all this, over the last few years of loss and heavy local and national taxation, is that the farmers to-day are reduced to the position that they have no resources, no reserves, to fall back on.  Many of them have very little credit; their productivity is going down, and the prospects for the present and for the next few years are so <Col N="1612" /> serious for them that unless a radical change is made in the administration of the country's affairs, unless a great number of people are prepared to come down to a standard of living lower than that which they enjoy at present, and have enjoyed for at least a few years past, the difficulties that this country will be faced with in carrying on and paying its way will be so great, so prodigious, that the farmers will have to give way in the markets that they hold and will be driven out of them, because the costs of production for them will be so high that they will not be able to compete and hold their own.  They will lose their present customers; they will not have anyone else to fall back on, and where will they and the country stand?  Deputy Johnson made the point that he thinks the position would be improved for the farmers of the country by putting the 300,000 people unemployed in a position to buy.  I think that was the number the Deputy gave us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, that if that number were in a position to buy our position might be better.  I put it to the Deputy, however, that what we are most concerned with at the present time is to get a price for our products that will leave us some margin to pay the demands made upon us&mdash;something that will enable our farmers and their families to live and carry on.  If we are to hold the markets that we have at the present time, I believe that first of all we must increase the quantity and the quality of our products, and secondly, that we must reduce the cost of production.  These are the only means by which we can hope to hold either the home or the foreign market. I have no hesitation in saying that if the farmers of this country were putting on the market here a commodity that was dearer and not as good as one that came from another country, and as a result that the people here demanded the foreign product, they would be justified in their demand so long as the farmers here were not prepared to give them as good and as cheap an article.  We are going to find <Col N="1613" /> it increasingly difficult to meet foreign competition.  The only means left to us to meet it are (1) to increase the quantity and quality of our products, and (2) to reduce the cost of production, so that we can sell as cheap, if not cheaper, than the foreigner.</P>
      <P>The cost of production to the farmer in this country must always be affected by what he has to pay out.  Usually the first demand made on him comes from the local rate collector.  Then he has to pay his Land Commission annuities and to provide the necessaries of life for his family.  All these charges tend to increase the cost of production for the farmer.  He must get the highest price for his products if he is to be in a position to meet the demands of the shopkeepers, of the National Exchequer and the local rate collector. Unless he gets that he will not be able to compete with the foreigner.  The cost of production presses so heavily on the farmers of the country at the present time that when they have met all these demands they have nothing left for themselves.  That position must be changed and altered.  Productivity, as regards quantity and quality, must be increased, but how is that going to be done?  If the farmer is not in possession of capital he will not be able to extend his field of operations.  At the present time no farmer can increase his supply of stock unless he has capital, and the difficulty of getting capital at the moment is almost insurmountable. The bankers are recognising this difficulty and feel that the land is not a very valuable security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain that if the farmers of the country are to be in a position to get the credit facilities essential to enable them to increase their production, to extend their operations so as to improve the standard of the produce they have to sell, then there must be a reduction in national taxation.  We recognise that will not do everything, but at any rate we feel that a reduction in national taxation will do a great deal to relieve the small farmers of the country.  There is an impression in the minds of the people, that little thought is given to the plight they are in or to their inability to pay.  They are disheartened and discouraged by <Col N="1614" /> that feeling.  They feel that there is a moral obligation on the part of the Government to give evidence itself that it has confidence in the future of the country, that it is prepared to set an example itself by coming down to a lower standard of living, and that it will try to carry on with a smaller sum of money than is asked for now. If the Government is prepared to do that, then it will make people understand, as Deputy Heffernan said yesterday, that if they make an effort to grow more, to sell more, and to have more cash, it is not all going to be collected off them in taxation.  That is the feeling that is in the country, and it is up to the Government to give evidence itself of a change of mind.  If the Government is not prepared to do that, but rather intends to go through with this Estimate, then it occurs to me that perhaps there is some political motive in it: that as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said yesterday, they feel they will not require until later on all the money they are now asking, and will have a little nest egg for next year, near the time of the general election.</P>

If they were in touch with the needs of the people, I suggest they would have made a real effort to bring about a reduction in national expenditure. That policy has not been adopted.

      <P>I just want to say <Col N="1617" /> finally that our action in this matter is consistent with our attitude since we came here after 1923.  When we came in here we put the point that if there was to be a 10 per cent. reduction in certain Votes, the 10 per cent. reduction should be made all round, even in the Deputies' allowances.  We are not satisfied with the Estimate the Minister for Finance has put before us.  We do not feel that the capacity of the country to bear it, at the present time, is such as would give us confidence in supporting it.  We are asking for a reduction of that Vote and that a Committee be set up to go into the Government offices and see how many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of the officials can be lopped off, and what can be done in regard to internal alteration of Government policy, so as to make the running of the Government machine less expensive to the country than it is at the present time.  We feel that that is not an unfair demand, and we believe that if the Minister agreed with it he would be putting himself right with this House and with the country, that he would be making it clear to the people that he was prepared to let a Committee go into the Government offices to see how administration is carried on. If, as he said yesterday, men want to fool them, and if nothing comes of it, he will have a share in the thanks.  But his attitude at the present time is not one that would give anyone confidence in supporting the Estimate he has put before the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much fault to find with Deputy Baxter's diagnosis of the position when he says what is wanted, in the first place, is improvement in quality and increased production, and what is wanted secondly is a lowering of the overhead expenses of the farmers.  That is a fair enough diagnosis of the position.  I am glad he put the first thing first, because this matter of improvement in quality and increase in quantity is a first necessity.  I will agree with him also, whether it be a second or a third, or a fourth consideration, that there is wanting a lowering of the overhead expenses of the farmers.  We are at <Col N="1618" /> one there.  I will make any concession he likes in regard to taxation.  I will take taxation as part of the farmers' overhead expenses.  I will agree with him for the sake of argument.  A good many factors go to make up the farmer's overhead expenses, and taxation is one of them.  I also agree with him that the farmer is in as bad a position as he says, that thousands of farms are unstocked, and that there is no money to stock them, that the farmer is dispirited, and suffering from all the ills he says he is suffering from at the moment.  I will not go into questions of degree.  I will agree with everything Deputy Heffernan and Deputy Baxter stated about the condition of the farmer, if only for the purpose of clearing the ground.  Having agreed with that, and that it would be useful to reduce taxation, I wish to point out to the Dáil that from start to finish of their long speeches, we did not get one single suggestion from either Deputy Heffernan or Deputy Baxter as to where or how or in what direction taxation should be reduced.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooper, in his speech on these Estimates, at least attempted to face the situation.  He said yesterday that it is perfectly obvious to anyone who examined the Estimates that any decreases that could possibly take place in general taxation as a result of lowering the salaries of senior officers of departments would be infinitesimal as compared with the total taxation. I think he suggested £40,000 or £50,000. I am not quite sure of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought. I do not want to go into what the consequences would be of employing second-rate men for first-rate posts. He did make that point, and I understood that Deputy Heffernan agreed with him to some extent that possibly the cutting of salaries would have very small effect compared with what is actually needed.  I do not know, though I have listened very carefully to Deputy Baxter's speech, whether that is his point also.  But this <Col N="1619" /> I do know, that from start to finish of a long speech, in which at least he gave me the impression, and I think he gave the Dáil the impression, that he was very much impressed with the position of the farmers and the necessity of relieving the farmers, he never made one single suggestion as to how taxation should be relieved.  He omitted the point which Deputy Heffernan made.  He omitted, at least, to say whether he agreed or disagreed with Deputy Heffernan that any cut in the salaries of Civil Servants would only be a very small proportion of the total needed to give any real relief to the farmers.  He did not say that.  Neither did he make any suggestion of any kind as to how taxation should be relieved.  There was just one suggestion, the old suggestion when you are not prepared to face up to the practical difficulties, appoint a Commission. I will leave that point for a moment and come back to Deputy Cooper's speech.  He said that a change of policy is needed&mdash;if there is any big reduction of taxation it can only come as a result of a change of policy.  That is quite true.  That was also a point made by Deputy Baxter.  Deputy Cooper went further and did what it is the duty of a Deputy to do&mdash;just what we are sent here for.  He stated, generally, at least, the directions in which reductions might take place.  He took up the Estimate of the Department of Agriculture and he put his finger specifically on certain items.  He said: &ldquo;Abolish these services and you will save several hundred thousand pounds.&rdquo;  He named the services, certain services which are done by instructors of the County Committees of Agriculture.  That is the proper function of Deputies, and not a Geddes Committee.  No matter who they may be or what superhuman intelligence they may possess, they are not the representatives of the people of this country, and it is only the representatives of the people of this country&mdash;in other words, this Dáil&mdash;who have a right to say what the policy of the Government or any Department of the Government shall be.  I asked Deputy Heffernan, not for the purpose of <Col N="1620" /> catching him out, but genuinely for the purpose of getting the information&mdash; because I propose to take Deputy Cooper's suggestion seriously, and I must take it seriously, because I realise that it is only on these lines you can get a reduction of taxation&mdash;what he had to say to it, but there was no comment.  Neither was there any comment from Deputy Baxter.</P>
      <P>There is nothing abstruse about the schemes of the Department of Agriculture in the counties; they are old and they are well known.  I should say that Deputy Baxter knows exactly what a county instructor does and does not do, and what he should and should not do.  He knows exactly what this service is, every detail of it, and when it was put forward here as a suggestion that it should be abolished there was not a single word from the Farmers' Benches.  When it was put forward here as a suggestion that the service is useless and that the abolition of it would save £100,000, there was not a single word from Deputy Baxter.  He draws a heartrending picture of the farmer at the moment.  He points out to us the immediate and pressing necessity for a reduction of taxation, but there is not a single word from him but a Geddes Committee.  Let a Geddes Committee take the responsibility of saying that the functions of the Instructors of the County Committees of Agriculture should be abolished!  Why is that?  Surely that is the function of Deputies.  Surely it is making little of the Dáil and making little of the Deputies of this House to say we must get in some three members of some Chamber of Commerce or some three farmers to say what the policy of this country should be, and that we have not got sufficient mental or moral courage to face up to the consequences of abolishing certain services&mdash;to say in all the circumstances whether these services should be abolished.  I do not think I ever heard such a proposal as that we should set up a Committee of some alleged supermen&mdash;I used to think they existed but I think I know enough now &mdash;to perform the functions not only of the Government staffs but of the Dáil.</P>

In other words, that we should hide behind them.  This Dáil, representing the people, composed of men whom the people sent here to run their business, should hide behind three or four super-men! We are to say we can never do this; it is unpopular, and consequently we must got the Geddes Committee before we do it.  I say again I never heard such a suggestion, and I hope there are not many belonging to any party in this Dáil who would give any support to any such suggestion, because it amounts to this, that the Oireachtas of this country is bankrupt mentally and morally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is really what it comes to.  May I get away from that and get back to the suggestion that Deputy Cooper made.  He pointed out rightly, and we have to face up to this, that any reductions in salaries will only make very small changes in our expenditure compared with the total. I think the Minister for Finance, Deputy Johnson and other Deputies examined the question as to what the effect of reduction below a certain limit, if you like, in the salaries of responsible senior officers who have executive control and responsibility would be.  I merely make the point, which seems to be generally admitted, that only a small reduction compared <Col N="1622" /> with what is necessary can be made by any cutting in salaries.  No.  You must have a change of policy, and a change of policy must be decided by the Dáil.  If you want reductions in taxation, you must decide now what services you are going to drop.</P>
      <P>In case there is any Deputy who has not sufficient information on that question, I should just like to give a little information about my own department, or rather about services which you can fairly call agricultural.  The cost of agricultural services at present is about £2,600,000.  When I speak of agricultural services, I include the Department of Agriculture, forestry, the Land Commission, sugar beet, credit societies, and the Agricultural Grant in relief of rates.  That comes to £2,600,000.  The Department of Agriculture costs about £470,000 net.  To the net figure in the estimate we must add about £50,000 that comes on from another Vote.  I can save £180,000 if I get the consent of the Dáil to drop the new services which I have taken on, which are non-contentious in the sense that they were supported by every party in the Dáil&mdash;I am leaving out the contentious ones.  By dropping the Live Stock Breeding Act, the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, the Dairy Produce Act, the experiments in sugar beet done by the department and the additional money which we have spent in buying high-class live stock outside the country, I can save £180,000.  You can have your choice and tell me which I shall drop, but take the responsibility in the way of giving your opinion.  I leave out forestry, which is only a small item.  I can save £100,000 to the Land Commission&mdash;I should say £150,000&mdash;if I am allowed to carry on land purchase at the same rate at which it was carried on in 1914.  In that connection I would give a rather interesting figure to the Dáil.  The staff of the Land Commission has been increased by about 150 officers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As compared with 1920-'21&mdash;the outdoor and indoor staff, in order to carry out land purchase at the rate at which it was demanded it <Col N="1623" /> should be carried out.  In spite of the fact that there has been an increase in the staff of the Land Commission by 150, there is a decrease in the total salaries of over £18,000.  How has that been effected?  Only a very small proportion of that is due to the drop in bonuses.  In spite of the fact that since 1920 there are 150 new officers in the Land Commission for the purposes of the Land Act of 1923, there has been a decrease in the total salaries of £18,000. That has been effected entirely, so far as it is not due to bonus, by a drastic reduction of the salaries of the senior officers.  On the Commissioners of the Land Commission alone there is a saving of £18,000.  I will put it in another way.  With the same establishment as regards numbers that was there in 1921, calculating their salaries at the existing bonus&mdash;not the 1921 bonus&mdash; and putting that against the salaries of the Commissioners to-day, there is a saving of £11,000 per year alone.  There is a saving of over £1,000 on the senior officers of the Secretariat; there is a saving of over £1,000 on the salaries of the three or four senior officers of the inspectorate staff.  That has reference to the senior officers of the Land Commission.  That applies more or less to the Department of Agriculture and applies to practically every Department of the State that I know anything about.  In any event, on staff alone I could increase the saving of £18,000 by another £40,000&mdash;namely, the cost of the new staff&mdash;a total saving of close on £60,000, but for the Land Act of 1923 and the rate at which it is demanded, it should be put into operation. You can add to that £100,000 extra for the improvements sub-head. You can get close on £160,000 as a result of new services.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that some of the increases are due to the appointment of temporary inspectors and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but I am dealing with salaries as they are this year.  No one suggested that permanent men should be employed to do temporary work.  I may say that I am dealing with the Land Commission plus <Col N="1624" /> the Congested Districts Board, as the present Land Commission includes both services.  £150,000, I think, is the cost of the sugar beet experiment.  It may be right or wrong, but let us have it from someone whether we ought to drop it.  I heard a suggestion the other day that the scheme was good, but nobody was quite sure whether the subsidy was too big or too small.  One organisation that should be quite sure of it is the Farmers' Organisation.  In any other country in the world sugar beet would not be the responsibility of the Government.  Farmers' organisations would have explored the ground, would have got information all over Europe, wherever they ought to get it, would have made certain contingent arrangements with certain manufacturers, and would then come to the Government and say: &ldquo;Will you finance this?&rdquo;  We had to do all this on our own.  We did the best we could. In any case, there it is, and I can drop it and save £150,000 per year on a new service.  The amount for credit societies is £75,000.  That is the sum on the Estimates, but it may not be all spent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy ought to accuse me of play-acting &mdash;he did not quite finish, but I will finish it for him.  I was never more serious in my life.  I am trying to show the Dáil that if they want to reduce taxation they must take the responsibility of coming forward here and showing what services are to be dropped, and not hide behind a Geddes Committee or any want of knowledge. <Col N="1625" /> They have all the knowledge necessary on this question, or they should have all the knowledge to enable them to come to a conclusion.  We have increased the grant to agricultural rates by £600,000.  That has to come out of taxation.  I am against dropping that. Does the Deputy say it ought to be dropped?  In any event, all these increases amount to £1,100,000 roughly. In other words, new services which are non-contentious and demanded by all parties for agriculture are costing £1,100,000 more than when we took over.  We have increased the expenditure on agricultural services from £1,500,000 to £2,600,000&mdash;close on sixty per cent.  We can save that sixty per cent. on those services by dropping them.  There is no other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I dwell on this is because you must go through the estimate of every other Department and make up your mind what is to be dropped.  There is no other way.  There is no use in building your hopes on docking the salaries of senior officers, which are far lower than they are in England, of course, as they should be, far lower than they were when we took over, and far lower than they are now in Northern Ireland.  You have just to weigh up considerations like these.  If I decide that no one should get any higher salary than £800 am I going to get an efficient man as head of the establishment branch of the Department of Finance&mdash;that particular super-man whose business it is, with his branch, to do exactly what Deputies want the Geddes Committee to do?  In talking about a Geddes Committee the suggestion is that you can get super-men, outside men, who have been immense successes in their own business, men of immense experience, ability, intellect and all the rest of it.  You can get those men, but they are probably earning four thousand or five thousand pounds in other countries.  They can come in and examine the staffs of the various departments and see whether every official is working.  You have an establishment branch there in the Department of Finance for that specific purpose, and the same people who pin all their hopes on a Geddes Committee &mdash;on the super-men outside&mdash;who <Col N="1626" /> they agree would be worth three thousand or four thousand a year, would tell you that you must not pay more than £500 or £600 to the First Division Civil Servant who is the head of the establishment branch, let us say, of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I need not labour that point.  I think all parties are agreed that there is not much in it.  You then come down to the question of policy&mdash;a question which no Geddes Committee should be asked to interfere in, or could interfere in.  What are you going to drop?  I welcome any suggestions of that sort, and Deputy Cooper made definite suggestions. He suggested that agricultural education, so to speak, should be dropped.  I am not quite clear as to what he meant, but I think I can make it clear in a moment.  First of all, I may say I do not agree with him, while I welcome the suggestion and would like to hear it debated at length.  I am absolutely open to conviction on the point.  I take it what the Deputy has in mind is the work of the inspectors of the County Committees of Agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>His suggestion was that those agricultural schools and farms, of which there are five, should be, not so much abolished as changed and made commercial farms.  The suggestion has been made here that there should be commercial farms&mdash;that we should buy farms in every county and run them as commercial farms.  Deputy Cooper's suggestion is not quite the same.  His idea is that the method of running them should be changed and that they should be run as commercial farms, otherwise you would lose money. Now let us see what that means.  These farms are all agricultural schools. There are about twenty-five students in Athenry, between twenty and twenty-five in Clonakilty, and about the same number at Ballyhaise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What is happening in Ballyhaise is that there is something <Col N="1627" /> wrong with the water and the students have to go to Athenry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty to twenty-five students and a staff of twenty-nine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the fallacies. The teaching staff would average about four.  It numbers five at the Albert College, three or four in Clonakilty, three or four in Athenry, and I do not know about Ballyhaise.  These pupils do two years' course and a one year's course.  Those who do a one year's course or a six months' course are all farmers' sons who are going back to the farms.  There are about fifty of them in the Albert College, about fifty in Athenry, and about the same number in Clonakilty.  They are charged fees in accordance with the valuation and I think the lowest fee is £3 5s.  The amount of the fees would not cover half their costs.  That is the first big loss.  As regards the second, it should be remembered that these farms are experimental farms and are used for the breeding of high-class stock animals.  We send out through these farms all our sows and boars and we sell them at half the price which we would get for them in the show-yard. We sell a valuable sow at £8, whereas we would get £14 for it in a show.  We have to go to Scotland because we cannot get them here, and buy a hundred animals at an average of £40 each and put them into the congested districts at £15 or £20 each.  We do the same with regard to pedigree stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only in so far as we cannot breed that stock we have to go outside to buy it.  The policy of the Department is challenged in buying high stock animals in the open market at high prices and selling them at low prices to small farmers.  There is a big loss there and there must be.  Again, all sorts of experimental work is done there.  All plant breeding is done in the Albert College.  For the purpose of getting a good line of oats there would, perhaps, be 500 failures.  Black Tartary is a Department oat and it took a long time before they reached the position of being able to put that oat throughout the country.  It is a first-class oat and is used all over the south <Col N="1628" /> because it is suitable to the land.  It is just a question of what exactly the gain to the farmer is as between using that oat with its higher yield and using an inferior one.  All that is purely experimental work.</P>
    <P>Again, there is a lot of other experimental work done.  I recently visited one of the colleges and saw twenty-five extremely nice cattle, about one and a half years old and well finished. I said to the manager that he was going to get a great price for them. The manager replied: &ldquo;Yes, I would get a magnificent price if I could sell them now.&rdquo;  They were conducting experiments as regards the value of silage and hay.  We have a record of what they did.  The manager explained that he could not sell the cattle until the experiment was finished.  He was certain that there would be a loss of at least £2 a head three months later. As a matter of fact, they were sold at £3 a head less.  When these farms begin to pay, I hope there will be some Deputy who will have sufficient sense of the value of the work that they should be doing, and who will suggest that they should be closed, for the moment they begin to pay they should be closed, because their work will have been done.  All work in connection with mosaic leaf roll which has gone out through the country came from experiments in the Albert College.  I mention that in view of what Deputy Cooper said.  Now as regards county committees.  Instructors do a lot more work than that in connection with winter classes.  An instructor has to run the whole live stock scheme.  He has to run the whole live stock scheme of premium bulls, boars and so on.  He has, in addition, to take out from the Albert College, or from Clonakilty, anything like a new line of oats or any results they get and make them available to the farmers.  The instructor, if he knows his work, ought to be the guide, philosopher and friend of every farmer in the district who wants advice. You may not be satisfied with the results. It may be said that the farmers ought to be better educated, but I know no better way than this of educating them.  You cannot bring them to the school, as they cannot afford to <Col N="1629" /> come.  That is all I have to say on that point.  I say again that I welcome this criticism.  We will, perhaps, have to make a great many sacrifices which we would be sorry to make.  We might, perhaps, cut off a great many services after great searching of hearts, but there is no other way.  I agree that overhead expenses should be as low as possible.  If the Dáil is serious, let it face the issue.  Let Deputies come and make suggestions and we will be willing to meet them.  We are just as serious as any Deputy of any party here in our endeavours to make the particular load which the country has to bear equal to the ability of the country to bear it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Mara spoke yesterday, and his speech was just what I would expect from him.  I tried to follow it carefully, but there was no point which I could get, because, like a great many other Deputies, he goes very well until he comes to the point, and then he stops dead.

      <P>The Deputy was careful to use the word &ldquo;since&rdquo; and not &ldquo;because of&rdquo; an Irish Government coming into existence.  That is just like him.  Anyone who likes can draw the inference.  The Deputy is a business man also, and he proceeded to quote figures for the year 1870, dealing with the production of the country.  These figures were a long time pre-war.  The Deputy went straight away and applied them without any adaptation to existing conditions and drew his own conclusion.  If the Deputy were outside the Dáil we might get somebody to suggest that he should be on the Geddes' Committee, as he is a man who knows all about big business affairs and high finance.  This is the sort of nonsense trotted out here.  He does not represent the business men of the country. There is, apparently, every reason why this country should be thriving and prosperous and flowing with milk and honey but for the Irish Government.  I have heard that song before.  I have listened to it in various forms for the last six or seven months. I have heard that people were living on leaves and that the country was a God-forsaken wilderness.  I have seen it stated in the Press by leading men that all our misfortunes were due to our Irish Government.  I never heard any of our business men, non-sentimental, non-Irish, practical business men, even hinting that the conditions here were not peculiar to this country, and that you have distresses also in England, in Denmark, and practically all over Europe, distress which, in some respects, is even worse than it is here.  I have been in these countries and I have heard the same talk as I have heard here, but that is carefully hidden.  The whole suggestion is that the conditions here are unique and are confined to this country and that we do suffer from a double dose of original sin.  That campaign is an evil one.  I do not believe it will succeed, but so far as it is there, it is an attempt prompted by various reasons to do what de Valera failed to do in 1923, namely, to smash the spirit and morale of the country.  I do not believe it will succeed, <Col N="1631" /> but the only spokesman which that campaign has here is Deputy O'Mara.  That was his sole contribution to the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture, in his very able reply to the statements that were made from the Farmers' Benches, appeared to place all the blame for the demand for a reduction in taxation upon the farmers. Anybody who has followed the situation in the country, and who has noted the campaign that led up to this <Col N="1632" /> demand, must realise that demands for a reduced taxation have equally come from business men, or those who call themselves business men, and who are associated with the Minister's Party. I believe there is some justification for the setting up of a Committee, but not necessarily on the lines suggested by Deputy Heffernan.  It would be better, I think, to have a Committee composed of members of this House.  That Committee could go into the whole question of Government expenditure.  The members of this party have not, as far as I remember, on any occasion, either inside or outside the Dáil, made any demand in regard to this matter.  Speaking for myself, I must say that the Government Party&mdash;the majority of the members of this House&mdash;having made up their minds definitely that 32/- per week should be laid down as a standard of living for semi-skilled workers, there should be some close investigation into the question of why £32 per week should be given to highly-paid officials associated with Government administration.  There should be some attempt to make it clear that high salaries of that nature are being paid to the best advantage.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to support any resolution which would mean that outside experts should hold inquiry into Government administration, make investigation into matters of general expenditure, or interfere in any way with Government policy or the policy of the majority of the members of the Dáil.  I do believe there is need for the setting up of what might be called an Estimates Committee which could be composed of members of different parties, particularly those of the business element backing the Government. They could investigate the expenditure in different Departments and ascertain where savings could be effected without any disastrous result to the general community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By inference the Minister for Lands and Agriculture has admitted that a saving of £50,000 could be made on the present Estimates.  That saving could be utilised for the purpose of relieving some of the unemployment that exists. The figure the Minister mentions would give work to between seven and <Col N="1633" /> eight thousand unemployed at the amount laid down by the Ministry as the basis of the standard of living of semi-skilled workers.  Those men could be employed for at least four weeks in the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHenrikBeamish" hpid="Mr. BEAMISH Mr. BEAMISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BEAMISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Where would the saving come in then?  You would take the amount off the Estimate and then spend it again.  That is a peculiar kind of proposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHenrikBeamish" hpid="Mr. BEAMISH Mr. BEAMISH">

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister for Finance who, presumably, will reply, if he has any objection to the setting up of what might be termed an Estimates Committee representative of the different parties in the House.  If the Minister's answer to the appeal made by Deputy Heffernan for the setting up of a Committee is that he believes such a Committee would be fooled by his own civil servants, then the Minister himself is foolish if he thinks the majority of Deputies here will allow themselves to be fooled so easily as he appears to think.  There are plenty of members of his own Party who have been speaking outside the House demanding a reduction in taxation, and there are also members of the Public Accounts Committee, who would give very useful assistance on such a Committee as has been proposed, and they would not be so easily fooled as the Minister seems to think.  If there is nothing to be hidden, what objection has the Minister to the setting up of a Committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan has been taunted with not going through the different Estimates and pointing out where savings could be effected.  If you think it advisable to reduce the standard of living for the ordinary worker, why do you not start at the top? Why do you not begin by making effective savings on the salary of the Governor-General, on the salaries of those connected with the Ministry, and, if necessary, on the allowances to Deputies? <Col N="1634" /> That could quite easily be done.  Deputy Baxter agreed that, a cut of 10 per cent. having been made on the allowances of teachers and old age pensioners, a similar cut could quite easily be applied to the allowances made to Deputies.  If a percentage could be taken off the allowances made to Deputies, a percentage could also be taken off in the case of the members of the other House, who do not give one-tenth of the time to the conduct of the business of the country that the members of this House give.</P>
    <P>I understand that certain people appointed by the Government are at present engaged in revising the Constitution. If it is considered desirable to revise the Constitution and certain Acts passed by the Oireachtas, such as the Ministers and Secretaries Act, with a view to effecting a reduction, the sooner the recommendations of that body are brought before this House the more the people will be satisfied.  I never could understand&mdash;I believe there was an explanation given that it is purely by agreement with the British Government&mdash;why the Governor-General should be paid £10,000 a year when the Prime Minister of England is paid only £5,000.  It is time we came down to bedrock on those matters and spoke out our minds, even if we are only speaking on our own behalf.  In every other country outside the Free State, there is a classification in regard to Ministries.  In no other country but the Free State will you find Ministers, extern or intern, responsible or irresponsible, in receipt of the same salary.</P>

      <P>They are not always responsible to this House for what they say and particularly for what they do. You have in the case of the British Cabinet some members in receipt of £5,000 a year, and others in receipt of £2,000.  If responsibility for work done is to be the basis upon which salaries are paid and upon which a higher salary can always be justified, a distinction could be drawn between the salaries of certain members of the Executive Council and extern Ministers. This matter could be properly <Col N="1635" /> inquired into by a Committee such as has been suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there are extern Ministers who have as much work to do, and perhaps have greater responsibilities than some of the members of the Executive Council.  I agree to that extent.  If you are really out to effect a saving in the salaries of the Ministers, that matter cannot be discussed adequately in this House; it is essentially a subject for investigation by a Committee such as Deputy Heffernan suggested.</P>
      <P>As regards Parliamentary Secretaries, if we are to go on the basis of the amount of work done, as far as my observation goes a salary of £1,200 cannot be justified.  I notice in the Estimates for this year that so far as the Department of Finance is concerned, provision is made for a Parliamentary Secretary's salary of £1,200 as against £1,000 for the same office last year. There was a far greater amount of work to be done by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance last year than there is to be done this year.  There was a good deal of work last year in connection with compensation claims and other matters, brought about as a result of the Civil War.  Last year there was far greater work and responsibility placed on the Parliamentary Secretary than there possibly could be this year.  Now, we have the Minister asking for an increase of £200 for that one item.  I would like to hear some arguments put forward in justification of that request.  I hope some justification will be given for many such matters raised by the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the Army, the Minister indicated yesterday there was a possibility that a saving of £500,000 would be effected in the Estimates to be submitted for the year 1927/28.  He did not indicate whether that saving would be brought about as a result of a reduction in the numbers of officers or men, or a reduction in pay.  If certain officers in the Army, major-generals and colonels, who have a salary of £1,200&mdash; in one case the salary is £1,400&mdash;had to <Col N="1636" /> climb the ladder of life in the commercial world, I doubt very much if they would be in receipt of salaries even approaching what they are now receiving from the taxpayers of the country.  I would like to know from the Minister when he is replying, whether the reduction of £500,000 is to be brought about by reduction in the pay of the higher officers or by a reduction in the numerical strength of the Army?</P>
    <P>In the case of the Department of External Affairs, we have an increase in the estimate this year of some hundreds of pounds for the entertainment of foreigners.  It looks rather curious and a bit circus-like that, in the present state of privation and semi-starvation, we should be asking the taxpayers to provide an increased estimate&mdash;though it be the small sum of £600&mdash;for the entertainment of foreigners.  We have a growing number of people in our own country in a state of semi-starvation, and the foreigners who come here come for their own good and not always for the good of the Government.  If the Ministers, or the Governor-General, desire to entertain foreigners, they should do so at their own expense and not at the expense of the taxpayers.  If Deputies desire to entertain their constituents&mdash; and they very often have to do so&mdash; they have to do it at their own expense. The Ministers and the Governor-General should entertain these foreigners at their personal expense, if they desire to provide entertainment.</P>
    <P>If I may return to the question of Parliamentary Secretaries, I think this Committee, if it is set up&mdash;and I hope the Minister will leave it to a free vote of the House&mdash;might inquire into the duties of the Parliamentary Secretary to the President and ascertain whether most of the duties of that individual&mdash; I am not speaking personally and I refer to the future as well as to the present&mdash;are more of a political nature than of the nature of work on behalf of the taxpayers.  From observation here, I should say the main work of that individual is concerned with gathering his flock together when the bell rings for a division.  If the Committee be set up it might make inquiry as to the work done by the occupant of <Col N="1637" /> that office, regardless of who he may be for the time being.  When I speak of matters of this kind, I speak in an impersonal way and I am not referring to the present occupants of the different positions personally.</P>
    <P>From a cursory examination of the Estimates, I have taken these few items by way of reply to questions asked Deputy Heffernan for reasons for the setting up of this Committee.  I have looked fairly carefully through the Estimates to discover whether there is more money made available this year than was made available last year for providing work for those who are out of employment.  So far as I can judge from the Estimates, there is not as much money provided for the coming year for the doing of such useful work as there was last year, in spite of the promises made outside and inside the House.  We had supplied to us recently a statement by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture showing that tillage in this country has been considerably reduced in 1925 as against 1924.  That statement shows, I think, in a way, that wherever there is a reduction in tillage, there must be a reduction in the number of people employed.  There must be some cause for the reduction in the amount of land under cultivation as compared with 1924 and 1923.  We are promised great things in the coming Budget&mdash;one hundred per cent. tariffs and subsidies for tillage&mdash;though I believe there is some little contention going on about that at the present time.  But if we wait for the 13th April, a very unlucky day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>We will know how far the prophecies made during the course of the last nine or ten months will be justified by the Budget statement. Deputies who have any realisation of the position in the country know that things are not improving.  I should like to be in a position to make the opposite statement.  I was one of those Deputies who thought that, as a result of the good harvest last year&mdash;undoubtedly it was a fairly good harvest &mdash;the position would be considerably improved to-day compared with that of 12 months ago.  Unfortunately, it <Col N="1638" /> is quite the reverse.  There is very little to indicate at the moment that things are going to improve before next harvest, and, unless the Government waken up to a realisation of the actual position in the country, they will probably be called upon later to deal with a situation that will not be of a very nice character.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister for Finance will leave the demand for the setting up of an Estimates Committee to the free vote of the House.  If he does so, I believe that Deputies will decide, at any rate, to set up a Committee confined to members of the House.  If the Minister has nothing to be afraid of or ashamed of, I see no reason why he should refuse the demand made by Deputy Heffernan.</P>
      <P>The present system of administration was formulated by civil servants sent over here on loan from the British Government or asked for by our Government. The higher Civil Servants during the past three or four years have had a very difficult task in keeping the administrative machinery properly oiled and they are entitled to every credit for the difficult work they have done.  But the setting up of an administrative machine suitable to the Government of this country is a different matter from the setting up of an administrative machine suitable to Great Britain.  Many useful suggestions may be made, as a result of examination of the present system, by Deputies, if the proposed Committee be established. Even if no saving were effected or no effective recommendation brought in, the setting up of the Committee would satisfy the genuine demand of the taxpaying public for investigation.  It would satisfy the people as to whether or not any saving can be properly brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from the speech we listened to a few moments ago from the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, that it is the duty of those on the Government Benches to support the present policy of the Government with regard to expenditure. In fact, if one were to read through the interesting speech delivered by the Minister, one would come to the conclusion that the object he had in mind <Col N="1639" /> was to put forward arguments in support of the maintenance of that expenditure. I hope I am not misunderstanding what the Minister had in mind, but I think, with regard to that aspect of the question, that the Minister is taking up quite a wrong attitude.  I do not think that any of the Parties in the House has any other view than this&mdash; that the present taxation is too high and that the present expenditure is too high.  Possibly that view may not commend itself to every member of the Dáil.  But might I remind those who disagree that that particular view has been expressed within the last few months by two leading members of the Ministry.  I need only remind Deputies that within that period our President made a very important speech&mdash;doubtless it was at one of the by-elections&mdash; to the effect that the taxation of the country was too high and that the burden was greater than the country could bear.  I am not tying the Ministry entirely to the statement of the President at a by-election.  I do not know that it was not on the same day exactly that the same words were used by the Minister for Finance in another place.  As one read the speeches in the newspaper, the statements struck one as being almost identical.  Having this admission from two important members of the Executive Council&mdash;that the taxation is too heavy and that the burden they are putting on the country is too great&mdash; surely it is not a question that needs further argument as to whether it is the duty of Parties in this House to see how they can lessen that burden and reduce that expenditure.  I think I am right in saying that this is not a Party question.  I hope it will not be treated as a party question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind it is an obligation cast upon every Deputy sent here to represent any portion of the Saorstát to do what he can to lighten that burden and to ease that load.  It appears to me that, when we come to regard the question from that point of view, we ought confine ourselves to the problem as to what means we can adopt for lightening that burden and for reducing the expenditure that created that burden. I would like to see Deputies confine themselves to that aspect of the question. <Col N="1640" /> Proposals have been put forward for the appointment of a Committee to go into the whole question of departmental expenditure and to make recommendations.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture made strong statements with regard to the appointment of such a Committee.  He said that to appoint outsiders to perform such a duty would be an admission of what he called &ldquo;bankruptcy of ideas&rdquo; on the part of the Dáil and that if such a Committee were appointed it ought to be appointed from members of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Government is practically a new duty thrown upon this country.  With one or two exceptions no member of the Dáil has more than five years' experience of the art of government, so that I do not think I am unfair in saying that we are by no means experts in the art of government.  Speaking for myself, I have only been some three years a member of this House, and I find that every day, even now, I am learning a good deal of the art of government.  I do not know if other Deputies have reached that seasoned stage when they have nothing more to learn, but if the three years I have spent here have taught me anything they have certainly brought home to me the fact that, even in five years, one will not get complete experience in the art of government.  Therefore, if we have to go outside the Dáil I do not think we ought to be too proud to do so.  If there are others who can teach us anything, I think we ought not to be above being taught lessons in the art of government, or in other walks of life.  It has been suggested by the Minister to whom I referred that we have before us all the particulars and all the data that would enable us to come to a conclusion as to whether there was extravagance and overstaffing in Departments.  Have we that information?  As I understand the information that is put before the House in these Estimates, it gives us the number of individuals that are in different Departments and the expense of maintaining these individuals.  But as to what particular task these individuals perform, as to whether they <Col N="1641" /> are all necessary or not, I certainly cannot form the least idea.  I do not know whether other Deputies are in a better position than I to form an opinion, but we have only one side of the picture, and even that only gives very superficial information.  How can we form any idea, on the information before us, as to whether these Departments are overstaffed or understaffed? It is useless for the Minister to argue from that point.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we have had to deal with an immense amount of legislation. If we were to ask a Committee of a dozen Deputies to take up this task it would certainly be a whole-time occupation for them.  I do not know whether, in view of the work of the House, we could get Deputies to undertake it.  But even if we could, assuming for the moment that they were qualified, could we expect them to give up their Parliamentary work?  So that no matter what point of view you look at it from it would be, I think, unreasonable to expect that Deputies could, in the first instance, deal with such a task, from the point of view of experience of Government, or from the nature of their own work here, give the necessary time to perform such a duty in a proper manner.  The Geddes Committee has been mentioned as a possible solution of the difficulty with which we are faced.  We have only looked at the problem from one point of view, that is, the question of what we call national expenditure.  The reference to the Geddes Committee included local expenditure, so that if we were to expect a committee of this House to do the work that the Geddes Committee did by exploring national and local expenditure I am afraid that the proposal put up by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture would really be an impossibility.</P>

It was a committee on those lines that many of us had in view, and I am only reading from the terms of reference, which were given to me by Deputy Heffernan, as to the work performed by that committee. The very heading of the terms of reference included &ldquo;national and local expenditure.&rdquo;  It has been said that a committee of that kind could not deal with questions of policy.  I will read from the terms of reference to show how the Geddes Committee did deal with questions of policy:</P>
      <P>In so far as questions of policy are involved in the expenditure under discussion, these will remain for the exclusive consideration of the Cabinet, but it will be open to the Committee to review the expenditure and to indicate economies which might be effected if particular policies were either adopted, abandoned or modified.</P>

That being so, it appears to me that if a committee is to do effective work we must not limit it simply to reviewing the work of existing departments.  The reference to it must be a wider one. The basis on which our Government has been modelled is the basis of the Government on the other side.  I have always held&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that the Government and the departments that are essential for a people of some forty odd millions do not form the most economical basis for the Government of a people of some three millions.  I am only referring to its administrative side.  That Government has to deal with a huge amount of work outside the four corners of the sister isle that I am not dealing with at all; I am only putting it on the basis on which it appears to an ordinary man in the street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it essential for the governing of a people of some three millions that we should follow the lines adopted for the governing of some forty millions?  I think that the time has arrived when the Government has succeeded in getting over a number of preliminary difficulties&mdash;and I give them every credit for getting over them so successfully and so quickly&mdash;and that we are in calmer, water, that we should face these economic problems.  I suggest to the Government, in view of the admissions of the President, in view of the admissions of the Minister for Finance, made in public, in no heat, in surroundings that would not draw from them statements that had not been carefully considered, that it is up to them, and to us also&mdash;it is not alone a responsibility of the Government, but of all&mdash;to try to provide some means whereby this whole question of government and its expenditure might be considered by those best qualified to consider it and to put forward a report that we might debate.  We have been told that a committee similar to the Geddes Committee would not be suitable, that the Geddes Committee really did no good work.  I do not know whether the view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be of any assistance to us in forming an opinion as to <Col N="1644" /> whether the Geddes Committee did or did not do good work on the other side for the State.  I have before me a statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to a deputation, within the last few months.  Speaking of the Geddes Committee, he said:</P>
    <P>In 1921-2, as you know, the Geddes Committee overhauled the whole of our expenditure and, with the great weight of public opinion behind it, effected most important reductions. In fact, in one year, £100,000,000 was saved, an achievement never paralleled in time of peace in any country in the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;In 1921-2, as you know, the Geddes Committee overhauled the whole of our expenditure, and, with the great weight of public opinion behind it, effected most important reductions.  In fact, in one year £100,000,000 was saved, an achievement never paralleled in time of peace in any country in the world.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the other side.  It bears testimony to the success achieved by the Geddes Committee. That Committee had a problem to face similar to the one that now presents itself to us, and naturally we turn our minds in the direction of that Committee to see if something of the same kind could not be accomplished here.  Perhaps I might make some comparisons before I come to any conclusion as to the necessity of having some such Committee here to overhaul our expenditure, and to consider the question whether the burden of our taxation cannot be reduced.  In the Free State the taxation amounts to £7 6s. 10d. per head of the population. That was the figure given to me by the Minister for Finance in reply to a question that I put to him some months ago. The figure, I should say, deals only with national expenditure.  I will come <Col N="1645" /> later on to the question of local expenditure. If I were to compare the figure that I have given in the matter of national expenditure here with the figures that obtain in other countries, I would be told, I imagine, that the conditions in these other countries were altogether different, and that the comparison was useless.  Therefore, I will only make a comparison with Great Britain, because, as I pointed out before, our system of Government is based on the system in existence in Great Britain.  In the latter country the taxation amounts to £15 7s. 2d. per head of the population.  To make a comparison between the taxation per head of the population here and in Great Britain, you will have to deduct from the figure relating to the latter country the cost of war burdens and expenses on imperial services.  If you deduct the charges in respect of these matters from the total that I have given for Great Britain, you will find that they amount to £11 10s. per head of the population.  The result is that while they pay £3 17s. 2d. per head of the population for State administration, we pay £7 6s. 10d.  We have no national debt and no imperial services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are any that I am not aware of I am open to be convinced as to the unwise application of the comparison.  The Deputy will see from the figures I have quoted that the taxation here in a poorer country is nearly double the amount it is in the richer sister country.  That is a figure that ought to have had a considerable influence, and I am sure it had, with the members of the Executive Council before they made their statements to the effect that the burden of taxation was too heavy here, and that the expenditure we were incurring in the Free State was really heavier than we could bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now there is the question of the burden of local taxation.  Remember that when you are considering the burdens that fall upon agriculture and other industries in this country, it makes very little difference as to whether <Col N="1646" /> they come out of one pocket as ratepayers or out of the other pocket as taxpayers.  What is the position with regard to local rates?  In the years 1922-23 the burden of local rates in the Free State amounted to £1 3s. 1d. per head of the population.  These are the Minister's own figures.  In 1924-25 the burden had increased to £1 13s. 5d. per head of the population, an increase in two years of between thirty and forty per cent.  If you work out what that increase amounted to in the two years you will find that the total figure came to over one and a half million pounds. That was an additional burden that the local ratepayers had to bear.  That is a matter that I think ought to be inquired into.  We have at the present day an effort on the part of the Government, supported by the Dáil&mdash;we cannot, therefore, blame the Government wholly&mdash;to cast a number of burdens on to local funds that some of us believe ought to be discharged out of national funds.  I need only mention as an instance the upkeep of the roads. At the moment their upkeep is a very serious matter for the local authorities. Up to this we have said here that was a burden that must be discharged by the local authorities.  How long we can maintain that position is very doubtful. While on the one hand there is anxiety to cast additional burdens on the local authorities, on the other hand there is a desire to take from the local authorities some of the income they have had heretofore.  Take the Bill that is before us at the moment.  A number of the fines that arise under certain sections of that Bill fall into the hands of the local authorities.  Within the last few weeks I had my attention drawn to the matter by one of the local authorities. It was pointed out to me that if the Bill passes through in its present form it will take some hundreds of pounds annually from the income of a particular local authority.</P>
    <P>Is it right that we should cast additional burdens on the local authorities, while at the same time we take some of their income from them?  These are problems that I say ought to be considered very carefully.  The time of this House is occupied with so many other matters that we cannot give the <Col N="1647" /> attention to the problems I have mentioned that they demand.  In the discussion that is to follow I hope that these proposals will not be dealt with in a party or in any hostile spirit.  Let us turn our minds towards arriving at some solution of the important question which presents itself to the House and to the country.  If we face the problem in the spirit that I urge I am perfectly certain that we will arrive at a conclusion that will be helpful.  In the time at my disposal I have not been able to see any better means of dealing with a problem of this character than through a committee such as the Geddes Committee, composed of persons, for the reasons I have given, outside of this House.  I make no reflection on members of the House in suggesting that the committee should be composed of outside persons.  If there are members who can afford to give time to their Parliamentary duties and also to the work of this committee, then by all means take them on, but I would like to have on the committee impartial persons with experience in the art of government, whose decisions and recommendations would carry considerable weight.  Without being in any way contentious, I would like to remind the House that that policy has already been adopted by the Government in other matters.  When the Government had to deal with the Shannon scheme proposals they did not hesitate to get the best brains and ability they could to advise them, and in the last few months, when they wanted to get views on the banking question, they went to America for the chairman of the very important Commission that they have set up.  That being so, we should not hesitate in dealing with this problem to go outside our own country for the help and guidance of people to assist us.  I would urge on Deputies the necessity of getting the very best brains they possibly can to deal with this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody will seriously find fault with the great necessity there is for national economy, or with the necessity there is to keep our taxation and expenditure <Col N="1648" /> as low as possible.  It is quite unnecessary to labour these points.  Candidly, I was disappointed with the general tone of the speeches I listened to in connection with Deputy Heffernan's motion to reduce the estimates by a sum of over £2,600,000.  I think I may say that the speeches of Deputy Heffernan and Deputy Baxter bristled with generalities.  It is, therefore, very difficult for anybody to discuss them because they carefully avoided details. The estimates before us number no less than 66, but not a single one of these was referred to definitely by Deputy Heffernan, Deputy Baxter or Deputy O'Mara in their suggestions for economy. As I say, one finds it very difficult to deal with generalities.  If any of the Deputies I have referred to had gone through the list of estimates and made a definite suggestion for cutting down expenditure, then we would have something to discuss.  I had a run through these items myself for the purpose of seeing whether there was any particular one under which I thought there could be any serious economy effected.</P>
      <P>Certainly I am not prepared to say at the moment that there is any serious possibility of cutting down any of these Estimates without interfering with the efficiency of the services.  Economy is of course, a very excellent thing, provided it is arrived at by right lines.  For instance, take the first large figure I see here&mdash;Revenue Department, £232,000. That is made up largely of wages and salaries.  Does either of the Deputies propose to cut these wages and salaries by 10 per cent. or 30 per cent., or by anything?  If so, does he realise or appreciate to any extent the degree to which the machinery of the Revenue Department would be upset?  Then we take the Old Age Pensions, which run, I think, into over £3,000,000.  Are these Deputies prepared to go down to their constituents and advocate the cutting of the Old Age Pensions for the purpose of relieving taxation on the farmer? We come to another big figure, Property Losses Compensation.  That amount of money surely must be paid.</P>

    <P>Another big figure is superannuation and retiring allowances.  A great deal of that money we are committed to by the Treaty.  You cannot get <Col N="1649" /> away from your obligation.  You must pay.  The bulk of these people are entitled to their superannuation allowances; you cannot stop them.  Then we have £50,000 for relief schemes. The whole country is crying out for relief schemes.  Is any Deputy prepared to vote against these relief schemes and go down and face his constituents afterwards?  Then we have the supplementary agricultural grant.  Are the farmers prepared to waive that and say &ldquo;we do not want it,&rdquo; in order to relieve taxation?  Are they prepared to cut down the Civic Guard?  In short, what are they prepared to do? Are they prepared to cut down the £1,250,000 which is the total vote for education?  If we are going to discuss this question we have to get some definite concrete facts.  Give us something we can examine and discuss, and see where it leads us.  Deputy O'Mara, who I am very glad to see back amongst us again after a somewhat prolonged period of political repose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>He has suddenly wakened up to the necessity for national economy, and he has produced what to me are fantastic figures.  He is extraordinarily quick and ready to ask for relief for the Irish people.  He bases his estimate on some figure that was before the Childers Commission.  The Childers Commission happened a long time ago.  I was quite a small boy when it was set up, and I really would not have any particular degree of confidence in the figures which that Commission produced as applied to the present-day condition of Ireland.  He made the extraordinary statement also that the bank deposits have gone down six millions in a certain period of years and that all that money went in taxation. For a business man, that appears an extraordinarily loose and reckless statement. What has he to support that? Is not it possible that some of that six millions deposit was utilised, as Deputy Myles Keogh suggested, for buying motor-cars, for stocking farms or for paying losses of one kind and another?  I am not at all convinced by <Col N="1650" /> Deputy O'Mara's figures.  In any case, I hope now that he has taken up the question of economy that he will keep the pace up and give us the benefit of his advice and counsel as often as he possibly can.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general suggestion that was made&mdash;originally, I think, by Deputy Heffernan, and supported by Deputy Baxter and Deputy Davin, and in a somewhat different form by Deputy Good&mdash;about this Geddes Committee to advise and overhaul our expenditure and to see in what way we can effect improvements, I am not at all convinced that any so-called Geddes Committee&mdash;I do not know why we copy the word &ldquo;Geddes&rdquo; from England&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would be very much more appropriate.  I quite fail to see what advantage we would gain.  After all, we are not too modest about our own abilities as Deputies.  At any rate we were sent here by the people to do the work of the nation, and there ought to be sufficient talent amongst the various members of the Dáil to criticise the Estimates and to produce constructive suggestions to meet this great expenditure, but we seem to be always dealing in generalities.  I think if the Deputies as a whole cultivated a critical spirit and tried to come down to some concrete facts we should get some work done.  I have tried to visualise this so-called expert Committee.  I have always found it very difficult to define the word expert.  I do not know what an expert is.  A great many people claim to be experts on many matters and a number of people would not agree with them.  For instance, Deputy Good is an expert in his own business. Possibly I may know something about mine.  Deputy O'Mara, I have no doubt, knows something about his, but none of us knows anything about the other's business.  I may be an expert in, shall I say, making malt or on sugar beet.  You never can tell.</P>

      <P>Neither can you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. EGAN Mr. EGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>For instance, I do not claim to be an expert, like Deputy <Col N="1651" /> Gorey, on coursing greyhounds or on building or engineering works like Deputy Good.  Furthermore, I do not think I would be very much use and I do not think the ordinary business man would be in the particular matter of going to a Government Department and saying how they are to do their work.  Possibly the only men who would be of some use in that respect would be ex-civil servants who have gone through the mill and are familiar with the routine of the offices.  If Deputy Good, Deputy O'Mara and myself were to go on this Committee to examine the present system of bookkeeping and suggest economies where staffs had not enough to do and so forth, first of all we would have to start on the assumption that we were prepared to devote all our time to it. Candidly, I think it would be an exceedingly difficult matter to get representative business men in Dublin who would be prepared to devote their whole time, even if they had the necessary ability, to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, they would have to be educated into the whole system.  It would take a very appreciable time before the average business man could get the complete hang of the way the work is done in an utterly new line of business, with which they had no previous contact, and during the time of coaching a great part of the time of the officials would be occupied and, I am afraid, to a very great extent, the whole machinery of the various departments would be thrown utterly out of gear.  Candidly, I fail to see where this sort of expert is to be had.  They would have to be paid very well, if you are to get experts of the type Deputy Good has referred to.  It is not quite a parallel case.  The only people you could count on as being of any use would be people who had definite knowledge of the particular work and who had personal contact with it.  I cannot see, even if you get that Committee, how they would be in any better position to judge economies than the people who have to face the work every day.  One would think, from the speeches we have heard, that the Ministry are utterly deaf to any suggestions <Col N="1652" /> of economy.  Anybody who has ever tried to get any money out of the Minister for Finance knows the difficulty. Anybody who comes in contact, to any extent, with Government Departments, knows the kind of scrutiny that every bit of expenditure is subjected to.  In fact, the complaint usually is that they are not sufficiently liberal.  I have never heard the Secretary of the Finance Department referred to as being liberal.  I would like to know has any Deputy ever said that the Minister for Finance is too liberal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. EGAN Mr. EGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Economy must be at the expense of someone else.  Some of the newspapers are particularly active in advocating economy.  In answer to a question by Deputy Johnson yesterday, the Minister for Finance stated that a sum of £13,000 was spent on official Government advertisements.  I wonder how the gentleman who wrote the article in the newspapers would take a suggestion from Deputy Heffernan or from the Dáil that we should scrap that.  I wonder how many of the people who write vigorously and even ably about economy would face with equanimity a cut of 10 or 15 per cent. in their own salaries.  Economy nearly always means economy on someone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly it is the duty of the country and of the Government to keep an eye on expenditure and to keep taxation as low as possible, but I submit with great respect to Deputy Good, Deputy Heffernan and Deputy Baxter that we are the elected representatives of the people, that we are here for the purpose of doing this work and we are paid by the nation for it.  It would be a very humiliating thing that we should make a confession of failure or that we should admit that we are utterly bankrupt of constructive criticism.  If we put our backs into the work, we can bring sufficient scrutiny to bear on the Estimates. Any information that we want in regard to the numbers of staffs and so on in connection with the running of these departments will be placed at our disposal by the various Ministers <Col N="1653" /> concerned.  I have never known a Minister to refuse any reasonable information and I certainly would not for a moment support any such refusal.  I think we ought to be perfectly capable of carrying on our own work here without the employment of experts from America or any place else.</P>
    <P>There is more to be said for the suggestion that a committee of the Dáil should examine these Estimates than for the suggestion that a committee of outside experts should do it, but I do not think that that sort of examination in actual practice will be found to be a solution of this difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Baxter, and I think also Deputy Heffernan, emphasised particularly that a great deal of the depressed condition of agriculture was due to taxation.  I do not agree with them in that.  Taxation is, of course, one feature of it but there are a great many other features.  A certain amount of the taxation paid by the average farming family is taxation that they need not pay if they do without certain things.  The person, for instance, who does not take beer, or stout or spirits, or who does not smoke, pays no taxation on these.  I doubt very much if the over-taxation of the farmer is such a very big factor as Deputies Heffernan and Baxter try to make out.  I agree it is something.  I agree it should be kept down as far as possible.  I do not think, however, that there is anything to be gained by exaggerating.  It does not matter what particular government happens to be running the country at present.  We are suffering from the natural reactions of the great European War followed by our own Civil War, and these reactions are as inevitable as night following day.  It is not a matter for governments; it is a matter of time.  The pendulum one of these days will swing back.  These cycles of depression come, just as we had our boom times during the war, and we have to put up with them.  At the same time, it is our duty to try and improve matters in every way we possibly can, and I, for one, am not convinced that this proposed committee is going to do the wonderful things expected of it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Egan started off by saying that the crying need of the present day is reduction of expenditure. Having gone through a few Votes, he stated that he could not see where any expenditure could be reduced. Therefore, he asks: &ldquo;What is the good of getting an expert?  I cannot find it and how will the other person find it?&rdquo;  That is the argument. The very fact that Deputy Egan, who is a business man, is not able to find where expenditure can be reduced, is the reason why we should have an expert. We are sent here to criticise expenditure; we have failed to reduce it within reasonable limits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to the details.  When the Deputy, speaking as a supporter of the Government, confessed his inability to carry out what he had stated was so very necessary for the country, what is the remedy? To keep going on as we are going? That is no remedy.  Our remedy is to set up a committee of experts.  We are asked what experts can we get.  I have known governments to send to India to get an expert to examine into a certain department to see how it should be run.  I am sure you can get experts from England or America or other places, skilled in the work of these Departments, who, after investigation, would see how many redundant officials there were.  I do not say they would be business men, but men skilled in that particular work.  Whom did they get, for instance, to investigate the working of the Lough Swilly railway when the men in charge said they could not see what was wrong?  They sent for a former manager of the Midland Railway, Mr. Tatlow, and he explained what was wrong.  We can now do the same.  Is not that a reasonable suggestion which would help the Government, and is the Government not wrong in refusing to take up the matter in that way?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows what is behind it.  The Deputy was very particular in referring to old age pensions and other things, but he never said a word about that.  According to the Estimates submitted, there are decreases amounting to £1,700,000.  If you examine into the items closely, you will find that, properly speaking, they are not decreases at all.  Property losses compensation, one and a half millions; relief schemes, £320,000; credit societies, £25,000; personal injuries, £27,000&mdash;these are not decreases of expenditure due to administration. Does anyone mean to tell me that on a total estimate of £27,000,000 it would not be possible to make a reduction of 10 per cent., having regard to the fact that the country requires a cut, and that if the people could support an expenditure of £27,000,000 last year, they are not in a position to do it this year? Is not that plain common sense?  The Estimates, as submitted, show the necessity for thorough investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good has been comparing our expenditure with England.  Just to show the difficulty surrounding this matter, I just jotted down a few items to show Deputies how this £7 16s. of national expenditure per head is made up.  Social legislation and old age pensions account for £1 per head; education, £1 5s.; Army, £1; Police, 10/-; pensions, £1 15s.; Land Commission, 6/-.  Added together, these total £6, before you start at all to administer the affairs of the country.  It is on the balance of £1 16s. per head that any reduction must be made.  Otherwise <Col N="1656" /> it is a question of policy.  Will we abolish the police?  Will we abolish the teachers?  A very good thing&mdash;perhaps we should.</P>

After all, we are laymen in these matters, looking at a mass of figures that would puzzle a Philadelphian lawyer, and we are asked to criticise and show where reductions could be made.  The suggestion made by our Party does not deal with generalities at all, but asks that experts skilled in the administration of Government services should be got to investigate and see how many redundant heads we have got in our services.  That is not a proposition that should be turned down, and I am sure the Minister for Finance, if he thinks over it, will find it is a very excellent way of dealing with the matter.</P>

We are suggesting means by which the Government could find out where reductions could be made, and it is up to the Government to say that £27,000,000 are too much and that expenditure must be reduced by the reduction of certain services hereinafter mentioned.

I am not afraid or ashamed to say that we can find people in this country who can carry on the work of Government as well as those in other countries.

      <P>I am not impressed either by the manner in which business is done in England.  If anything, I believe there has been a very considerable tightening up of the administrative machinery here, as compared with what it was when we took it over.  I believe that there are men here who are as capable of doing that work, and inspired by as patriotic motives in doing it, as any people in any other country, and I am certainly against this idea of <Col N="1659" /> bringing in outsiders and always looking to other countries to instruct us how to do our business.  Deputy Wilson blamed Deputy Egan for not being able to point out how these Estimates could be reduced.  He takes it for granted that they must be.  He starts off with that assumption.  I am not taking that assumption at all.  He does not consider that the answer to the problem may be that there is no place in which expenditure can be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out, by interjection and otherwise, ways in which you would not want the assistance of experts to bring about reduction.  We could divide the amount by ten or twenty, and we could say to the Government: &ldquo;You will have to carry on with that.&rdquo;  You could, for instance, abolish old age pensions or, as Deputy Cooper suggested, abolish agricultural education, or, in fact, abolish all education. It is really not a question of money, but a question of service for money spent.  I am not impressed by the parrot cries for reduced taxation. Anyone who wants to inscribe his name on the roll of fame, or to get into a small panel in the newspapers in the morning, has only to cry: &ldquo;Reduce the burden of taxation.&rdquo;  We have people, from Deputy Seán Lyons to Colonel O'Callaghan-Westropp, who never say anything but &ldquo;the burden of taxation is too heavy and must be reduced.&rdquo;  That is the parrot cry that is echoing all over the country.  Nobody, so far, has been very helpful, not even Deputy Wilson, who wrote a very intelligent letter to the Press recently. I was expecting to hear better things from him than those I did hear, but he will, perhaps, have another opportunity. The question fines itself down to what Deputy Egan has said, namely, that if we want to reduce the burden we must be prepared to say what service is going to be dropped.  It is one thing, if we are not getting service for the money that is being spent.  That is a serious matter, but nobody has said that.  The real question is, which service is to be dropped if this sum is to be reduced?  One would imagine, listening to the kind of talk that goes on about the burden the country is asked <Col N="1660" /> to carry, that the people who collect the money are people who are really apart from the country, that they are people who collect the money, put it in their pockets and then walk off with it.  That is not happening except to a small extent, though it may happen if Deputies support a certain Bill which is about to come before us.</P>
    <P>Every man who calls for economy should refuse to allow that measure to pass, as it will have the effect of sending money out of the country.  One would imagine that all this £29,000,000 is finding its way out of the country. Comparisons are made as to the proportion of people paid by the State with the total population of the country. I could imagine a state of affairs, if we were, for instance, wise enough to nationalise our transport service or our building industry, in which all the people who work the railways in the interests of the State and all who build houses in the interests of the community would be paid by the State, and you would have the newspapers saying that the country could not carry that burden, forgetful of the fact that these people are giving productive service to the State.  The community agrees that certain services must be done for the country and the machinery for doing that is the machinery of administration. Hearing some of these criticisms, you would imagine that those people who are paid by the State never pay any taxes.  You would imagine that civil servants never pay any taxes, never buy a pound of butter or a fresh egg.  The teachers, of course, are Deputy Gorey's &ldquo;betty norry&rdquo;&mdash;as somebody called it&mdash;but from the latest returns I find that they pay in income tax £85,000 a year.  In direct taxation alone they pay £102,000 a year to their pension fund, not to mention what they pay in road taxes for their motor cars.  Civil servants do the same. I suppose if the Minister could reduce income tax by one shilling, the newspapers, and many others who call for a reduction in the burden of taxation, would sing paeans of joy.  I, however, am thinking of the man described by Deputy Baxter.  He, too, would say with the newspapers as he says also at present with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping that I would have had an opportunity of hearing more from Deputy O'Mara, because he is getting more interesting every day.  He read from some book yesterday a statement about the salaries that are being paid in America. That, too, is quoted very often in the newspapers for the edification of those who do not know the facts.  He told us the population of the United States, but he did not tell us whether the particular Ministry to which he referred was dealing with the whole population. He forgot to mention, until a Minister here reminded him, that there were 30 or 40 different Governments in the United States.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesOMara" hpid="Mr. O'MARA Mr. O'MARA">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Washington does not govern the United States, except to a very small extent, and it deals to a large extent with external affairs.  I am sorry that he did not also read out what the Deputies in the United States are getting.  We would be glad to hear that.  Deputy Heffernan told us that he met a business man who, if he only got the chance, could do with one-tenth of the number of people the Minister for Finance uses.  I am not impressed with these business men and I refuse to burn incense at their shrine.  I never met any of these super-men who are supposed to do big things in a big way. I once met a business man from America who suggested that the one salvation for this country was to roof it over.  That gentleman is like Deputy O'Mara's bank manager who is more than anxious to lend money to farmers. I have never met such a bank manager, and I would like to know where he is. If his whereabouts could be discovered <Col N="1663" /> the police would have to regulate the queues outside his bank.  There is a great deal of unreality about this talk of reduced expenditure.  What we should devote our attention to is whether we are getting the proper kind of service for the money expended.  I regard this matter as something like a co-operative society.  We are putting our money into a certain fund and we expect that fund to do certain work.  I do not agree with those who say that the higher civil servants should have their salaries reduced and that savings could be effected in that direction.  I have come into contact with some of these men and from my experience of them I would say that if you want to see real work done in the civil service you would want to go among the higher branches and among the higher executive officers.  I do not believe that there is any reason in looking for a reduction of taxation in that direction. One might usefully ask, for instance, what is the salary of the manager of the Dublin United Tramways, or what is the manager of Messrs. Clery's paid. How would the suggestion be received that the salaries of people responsible for the administration of huge sums of money should not exceed six or seven hundred pounds a year?  There would not be agreement on that point from those who believe that no one in the Government service should get more than £500 a year.  It all comes back to Deputy Wilson's point that if you want to have the economy of the type asked for, if you want to take up the position that you will insist on the Government spending less of your money and have more of the spending of it yourself, then you must decide that the community shall not carry on some of the services now being carried on and, if those services have to be carried out, you must carry them out yourself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take National Health Insurance, which is a favourite subject for economists. The service that the National Health Insurance carries out is an important service.  Even now the business men and Chambers of Commerce do not propose that the National Health Insurance should be done away with.  If it is dropped, other means must be found to meet the difficulties of the <Col N="1664" /> people whose health breaks down; otherwise they will be thrown back on the rates.  Everybody says that education and more education is necessary; but you do not want to pay this big bill for education.  Are the parents of the children prepared to pay for education out of their own pockets, and are they prepared to ask those who may have no children to give them a helping hand?  That is more or less what is happening at the present time.  Each of these services will have to be examined. If you want to have these things done economically, you must take up the position that while you have a Government responsible to the elected representatives of the people, you must allow that Government to do the work, subject to whatever constructive criticism the representatives of the people in the Dáil can give.  There will be plenty of opportunities for doing that when the Estimates come up for consideration.</P>
    <P>If we are to be believers in this idea of big business and mass production, we ought to agree that a centralised body can give more economical service than if the work is distributed amongst units scattered throughout the country. From different parts of the country the call now comes that the roads should be a national service.  If the money does not come out of one pocket it will come out of another.  Why are the ratepayers calling out that the roads should be made a national service? It is felt, although, perhaps, they do not know it, that the roads can be more economically made and better maintained by a central authority operating a central service than if the work is left to twenty-six or twenty-seven authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Each central authority receives the revenue from the road users, not the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'CONNELL Mr. T. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Another proposal might be to distribute the revenue amongst the local authorities and let them do the work.  I do not think that will be regarded as an economical proposition.  I would be surprised to hear a business man making a suggestion of that kind.  The work can be more economically done by the <Col N="1665" /> central authority, and the same thing applies to all other services.  When the roads are being maintained by the central authority no doubt there will be a cry from the economists that instead of saving you have another half-million added to the national expenditure. Deputy Good will be quoting the number of pounds per head that taxation means to the country; at the same time he is asking that a new service should be put on to the central authority.  We cannot have it both ways.  If we nationalise our services more money will have to be collected and distributed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the local authorities are at present called upon to bear the expense of maintaining roadways.  The road users pay a certain amount into a national fund. That is not as it should be.  The authority that receives the income ought to deal with the expenditure.</P>

I have no doubt as to which would be the preferable method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister for Lands and Agriculture to remove a misapprehension from my mind.  He accepted everything that Deputy Baxter said with regard to the position of the farmers and the effect of taxation.  He rather said he was accepting it for the sake of argument.  I would be glad if he would say he accepted, merely for the sake of argument, Deputy Baxter's description of the position of farmers and agriculture generally.  I look on the matter as extremely serious.  I believe things are bad, although I do not quite agree with the picture painted by Deputy Baxter.  Matters are not quite so bad, if you take the country as a whole.  The Government should face the situation in a more serious fashion than they propose to face it.  I believe it will be necessary for them to spend <Col N="1666" /> not only the amount provided in the Estimates, but much more money, in order to save the position.  I believe that something on the lines suggested by Deputy Johnson is necessary.  It is necessary to find money immediately, either by borrowing or otherwise, to retrieve the position before it is too late.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant to convey that probably I could get on common ground with Deputy Baxter if I said that farmers needed as much relief as we could give them.  We could start on that.  We could afford to disagree as to the intensity of the distress from which farmers are suffering.  We might have different ideas as to the degree of distress that prevails; but for the purpose of this argument we could have it that farmers are entitled to as much relief as we could give them.  I do not deal with the question of how far farmers are in distress, or what are the particular factors that influence that state of affairs.  I merely start from the point that it is our duty to give them as much relief as we possibly can. That exactly was Deputy Baxter's point of view.  We could also agree that a reduction in taxation was a necessary factor.  We could agree that taxation was one factor that affected the farmer, and a reduction in taxation would give a certain amount of relief. I do not profess to go into the question of what exactly is the condition of agriculture. There is no necessity at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing that emerges from this discussion is the view-point that official Labour holds with regard to salaries, and with regard to the position of those who are paid either a wage or a salary.  I have listened to Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Johnson, and I think it would be difficult to reconcile their views with those of Deputy Doyle or the Deputy from Limerick.  The view-point of Deputy O'Connell is that if any man has a salary from £500 to £2,000 or £3,000, it should not be touched.  He is giving value for his money, according to Deputy O'Connell, and the country can afford to pay.  There should be no question of paying any man up to the figure he mentions.  The same thing, I presume, would apply to the professional classes&mdash;according to Deputy O'Connell.  I suppose, in a way, we ought to agree with him, from the point of view of class pride.  It is a poor community that cannot afford a few gentlemen in every class.  It is a poor community cannot afford a few aristocrats.  The new aristocracy has come to stay.  We hear of two or three motor cars in certain families&mdash;one taking the older members of the family out, another taking the younger members of the family, and, perhaps, a two-seater in addition.  Deputy O'Connell does not find anything wrong in that. Deputy Doyle, who knows the position of the agricultural worker and the small farmer in his constituency, finds nothing wrong in that either, and finds nothing wrong with the view-point of the official spokesmen of his Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing emerges clearly from the discussion&mdash;that it would be altogether wrong to ask outsiders to come in and deal with this question.  The view-point of Deputy Egan, Deputy O'Connell and a few other Deputies is: &ldquo;We are quite capable of dealing with anything that may arise here.  We are able to do our own business and nobody can teach us anything.  Why should we ask anybody to come here?  We have really nothing to learn from anybody in finance or in anything else.&rdquo;  The <Col N="1668" /> English people, when they were in a certain position a few years ago, did not hesitate&mdash;their national pride was not lowered one iota&mdash;to seek outside aid to put their financial position right. I take it that the average English business man at the head of a department there knew almost as much about the business of running his department as the business men of our departments know.  Considering that the Englishmen had centuries of experience and tradition behind them, they ought to know almost as much as our men. Some doubt was expressed&mdash;I think by Deputy O'Connell&mdash;as to whether these charges really went back to the land at all.  The business people want a certain percentage of profit on their turnover.  If you put the question to any business man, he will tell you that he wants to get a certain percentage of profit on the capital he invests and that if he does not it is no good to him. He gets that profit and he passes on the charge ultimately to the man who cannot pass it on.  The farmer is the man who cannot pass it on.  His profits do not stay with him, but his losses always do.  I do not think there should be any doubt in anybody's mind at this hour of the day that the agricultural community are the only people who are carrying this load and who cannot pass it on.  I heard reference made to the wonderful harvest we had last year.  The only man who ventured on a sarcastic interjection was the Minister for Lands and Agriculture. He ridiculed the claim of Deputy O'Mara and some other Deputies that we had a great harvest.  We had not a great harvest.  The last harvest we had was one of the worst, from the point of view of yield, that we had for some time, and it was one of the best from the point of view of cutting the corn and saving it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>£13,000 is a good sum to go into their pockets, and some of them would abuse the enemies of the Government whole-heartedly for that. I can picture certain quill-drivers about town&mdash;the proprietors of gutter-organs &mdash;digging their quills very deeply at the prospect of £13,000.  Perhaps it explains the abuse that several members of this House come in for.  A good deal of play&mdash;I will not say cowardly play or dishonest play&mdash;has been made with local and national expenditure by people who are not facing the position. Nobody wants to face the particular. They all want to deal with this question in general terms.  You hear people talking about the Government's responsibility for the condition of the rates down the country, when the position really is that nobody is responsible in that respect except the ratepayers of the county and their elected representatives. But they want to pass on the blame to somebody else.  When discussing the Estimates here, it is pretty much the same thing.  We have general statements but no particular statement. We are not facing the position as it should be faced.  Exception is taken to our demand for a committee of experts.  In my opinion, the only competent men to put on that committee to deal with Civil Service administration would be ex-Civil Servants&mdash; capable men who retired from permanent positions and who know their business.  &ldquo;Why not a Committee of the Dáil?&rdquo;  was the question asked.  I do not call myself a capable Deputy <Col N="1670" /> and I know I would be absolutely lost if I went into, say, the Local Government Department, or any other Department, and tried in two or three months to see what could be put right.</P>

      <P>Somebody referred to increased production as the cure.  No doubt it is a partial cure.  But if you want increased production, the people who are to give that production must see some return for their extra effort.  The system of sucking the result of the farmer's toil from him is so complete that there is very little real inducement to increase production.  I am rather doubtful of the response you are going to get until this position has been made right. Three years ago, when it was suggested there should be economy and when the reduction in teachers' salaries and old age pensions were made, we advised that it would be the right thing to have a ten per cent. cut right through the whole administration.  Everybody should have stepped into the same boat then.  That was not done.  I held that opinion three years ago and I hold it to-day.  The Government should have stepped into the boat with the rest of the community then, and shared the load equally with them.  I think they were wrong when they did not, and I think they are wrong still.  The position was not bad in 1922, or early in 1923, when we were discussing this question.  But the position is bad now. And if the people are required to effect economies, the Government should show example from the top.  There is not a Deputy in the Dáil with a spark of patriotism but will agree to the suggestion. I think the Government lost a golden opportunity that time, but it is not too late yet.  It would put them right with the people and it would be evidence that, whatever the position, the Government and every citizen of the State are in the same boat and are prepared to hang together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson has one invaluable remedy for every economic ill this <Col N="1672" /> country has ever suffered from&mdash;that is, to pay more in salaries and to pay more in wages.  As a result, the appetites of the people of Dublin are going to increase. So much are they going to increase that they will provide a market for the farmers' surplus produce. Really, when you come to analyse the question, there are very few people in Dublin who are not eating almost enough.  There may be some but they are very few.  The little bit more that they would eat would not appreciably affect the position, to quote the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  I do not think it would add very much to the extent of our home market, but it would increase still further the gap between the industrial employee and the agricultural employee.  There is something wrong, and what Deputy Johnson refered to is not the cure for it.  Something more is required.  I recently consulted an authority on boot-making in this country as to how the tariff affected the industry, and he told me of the case of a new factory near the Border.  A few hands were imported, men who could not be dispensed with, but otherwise the firm recruited its staff locally from raw labour who knew nothing about the business. Gradually the standard of the article improved, because it was a very good article for the money, and increased orders were coming in.  The firm increased its staff and went to Cork for trained men.  It did not want to take in any more green hands off the streets of Dundalk.  They picked up a few in Dublin also.  They had not these men very long until they found that they had to be got rid of, because they were a nuisance in the factory.  That shows one thing; if anything is to thrive in this country you have to get rid of the old atmosphere, get rid of the doctrine that has been preached here, not by Deputy Johnson, but by some people who went before him&mdash;the doctrine of &ldquo;ca' canny&rdquo; and &ldquo;go slow.&rdquo;  The continuance of these men in that factory would mean failure, and anyone who likes can put that in his pipe and smoke it.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence of lack of money in Dublin.  There is more evidence of the spendthrift in Dublin <Col N="1673" /> than of the lack of money.  The cinemas and other houses of entertainment show that, and most of the money spent on this class of thing is leaving the country.  If there is a blister on the public mind at present it is this, that the public believes that the members of the Government are not inclined to share the same bed with them, are not inclined to get into the same boat with them and to belong to the same crew.  They see that the salaries of members of the Government are secure for some years, and that they are not going to give away anything to the rest of the people.  I think it is time for the Government to see the situation and put themselves right.  I consider that there is nothing wrong with Deputy Heffernan's proposition, and I think that the Government should avail of it.  If it did nothing else it would clear the air.</P>

It may not be the best time for them, but when the position is desperate it is the time to put the ship right, and I appeal to the Government to put the position right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a good deal of talk in connection with civil servants, and as an ex-civil servant, as the official of a Civil Service organisation, and as one who can speak on behalf of civil servants, I think I should say a few words in connection <Col N="1674" /> with some of the things that have been mentioned to-day, particularly by Deputies on the Farmers' Benches.  Deputy Heffernan wanted a committee of experts set up to inquire into departmental expenditure and organisation. He has been supported in that by Deputy Baxter and Deputy Gorey, and their speeches, particularly the speech of Deputy Baxter, would lead one to believe that it would only be necessary to set up this committee, with authority to go into Government Departments for it to find in these Government Departments civil servants as thick as daisies in the summer.  I want to assure Deputy Baxter and the Farmers' Party generally that if any such committee were set up, it would find no redundancy of civil servants, but in many cases a shortage of civil servants, as is proved by the fact that in many cases overtime is being worked, due to shortage of staff.  I think it a pity that the Minister for Finance did not accede to the request of the Farmers' Party, and I am quite sure that if he could take Deputy Baxter, Deputy Heffernan and Deputy Gorey into Government Departments and give them an idea of the work done there by civil servants, we would have less of this thoughtless criticism of civil servants.  In one particular office of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, I know that until recently&mdash;and it may be so at the moment&mdash;as many as 700 and 800 hours overtime were being worked in the week, due to shortage of staff, and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, if he makes inquiry into the matter, will be able to confirm what I say.  That goes to show that, far from there being a redundancy of staff, there is in a great many cases a shortage of staff, and I know of no case&mdash;and I have a knowledge of the Civil Service generally&mdash;where there is a redundancy of staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another side of the Civil Service besides that which pays officers £500 a year and over, and that is, the Post Office side.  Lest Deputies might imagine that every person employed in the Civil Service is a well-to-do official I want to call the attention of the Farmer Deputies to the fact that in the Post Office there are 2,500 auxiliary <Col N="1675" /> postmen who work not more than thirty-five hours per week and who, in many cases, because of the fact that their Post Office hours of employment are during the day, cannot get outside work to supplement the meagre pittance that they receive from the Post Office.  In addition to those, there are 1,100 people in the employment of the Post Office who work not more than eighteen hours per week.  In many cases their work amounts only to six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen and sixteen hours a week, and they receive as an average&mdash;in fact I might say as a maximum&mdash;10d. per hour.  An auxiliary postman, who has in many cases twenty years' service, is paid no more than 1/2 per hour.  Twenty-four years' service might be spent by a man in the Post Office without any hope of appointment to the permanent class, deprived, by reason of his hours of work, from any opportunity of supplementing his Post Office income.  In the face of that we have had here a general suggestion that everybody in State employment is a well-to-do, comfortable employee.  I would like Farmer Deputies, when talking about the Civil Service in future, to remember that branch of it.  Deputy Baxter told us that taxation was very heavy, and that he thought it should be reduced, but although he had a copy of the Estimates before him and spoke for quite a considerable time, he did not tell us what particular item of expense should be reduced and in respect of what matters a reduction should be made in the Estimates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Baxter talked in generalities, but he did not tell us, perhaps because it might be unpopular to do so, in respect of which particular item a reduction should be made. After painting a very doleful picture of what would happen if taxation was not reduced, he wound up with the admonition that there must be a radical change in taxation.  I suggest to Deputy Baxter, even at the risk of Deputy Gorey's displeasure, that there is need for a radical alteration in something <Col N="1676" /> besides taxation, and I suggest to the Farmers' Party that there is need for a radical alteration in farming methods in this country.  I suggest to Farmer Deputies that they might well take a leaf out of the book of their competitors, and if they did that and looked after agriculture as their competitors do, they would have a little less time for thoughtless criticism of the Civil Service.  Complaints have been made that the Vote is too high, but my complaint is that there is practically no provision in it for relieving the burning problem of unemployment as it exists to-day.  Judging by the Vote, unemployment is to continue in the deplorable condition in which it has existed during the past few years, and the unemployed, if we are to take the Estimates as a criterion, need hope for no improvement in their plight during the forthcoming year.  As far as I am concerned with this question of taxation.  I am prepared to stand over and openly to advocate an increased Estimate and heavier taxation if it would go towards saving the hungry men and women and the helpless children from the poverty, misery and destitution which they have endured for the past few years and which apparently is to confront them for another twelve months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think at the moment that it is necessary to go very much into this question that was touched on by Deputy Cooper, and, I think, Deputy Heffernan, of the precise amount of the real reduction shown this year, because it would involve a very close discussion of the amount that might be put to capital expenditure and the amount which would have to be found out of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, an actual reduction because against the automatic decreases, decreases which do not involve any effort on the part of the Government but yet which represent a proportion of the decreases, there are also new forms of expenditure.  There are new items, or greatly increased items which are clearly and definitely capital items.  Deputy Cooper questioned whether it was wise to undertake the amount of capital expenditure that we <Col N="1677" /> were undertaking.  I feel that when we have regard to the situation in the country and to the fact that we have taken steps in regard to unemployment insurance that have not been taken in adjacent countries, steps which we have had some difficulty in deciding were justifiable, it would not be right to refrain from undertaking capital expenditure somewhat in advance of the time that we might undertake it, but capital expenditure which is useful and justifiable in itself.  On the other hand, there are people who say that a great loan should be raised for national reconstruction, as it is called.  I have no objection to the raising of a loan for any national purpose. I have no doubt that for any reproductive or good purpose we could get very substantial sums of money, but I see no purpose in raising a loan in advance of the preparation of schemes.  Some people said, immediately the Shannon scheme was mooted, that we should go looking for money.  That would be unnecessary and would have been wrong from a business point of view.  It would simply have meant that we would be paying out, say, 5¼ per cent. for the money that we borrowed.  We would have it lying in the Exchequer getting the maximum of, say, 3 per cent. from the banks for it.  No matter what arrangement we might make to deal with the money we could not get as much for it as we were paying. There is another point as regards raising money in advance of schemes, or greatly in advance of the time when it must be expended.  So far as this matter of capital expenditure and of the present relief of unemployment is concerned, it was really a matter of the elaboration of suitable schemes of expenditure. The Government had never been blind to the necessity for giving employment as far as it could be done in the circumstances of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper, as the Minister for Agriculture said, did make what I thought was the type of speech that ought to be made by Deputies when criticising expenditure, and calling for a reduction of expenditure.  The Deputy's speech was in striking contrast to the speeches made by Deputy Baxter and Deputy Heffernan.  To my mind, <Col N="1678" /> the gist of their speeches was: &ldquo;Put no responsibility on me; let some other fellow take the responsibility and let some other fellow do the thinking, but do not ask me to do anything about it. I will cry, in general, for economy, but put the responsibility on somebody else.&rdquo;  There was reason in Deputy Cooper's demand for a Geddes Committee, because he made that part of his proposals.  He was prepared to suggest economies and along with that to suggest a method of reviewing administrative expenditure.  There is some reason in that, but there is no reason in the attitude of Deputy Heffernan. Deputy Heffernan said that the first time he spoke in the Dáil in November, 1923, he advocated such a committee, and was still advocating it.  Apparently he is a man of one idea.  Perhaps the fact that he has no other idea explains his frequent lapses into futility that we are aware of.  There could really be nothing more futile than to refuse to express an opinion on proposed economies, to be afraid to express an opinion on proposed economies and to suggest that outsiders and persons not representing the people should have the responsibility thrust on them.  The danger and harm I would see in a committee such as that would be that it would simply act as an agent for postponing consideration of those questions by Deputies who feel that they should be considered.</P>
    <P>The Government has given consideration to these matters and is dealing with them in its own way.  That may not satisfy Deputies.  If it does not, they ought really to do some little thinking and some little research on their own behalf, and should not simply ask that somebody else be appointed to do what is their business.  Of course, there is a great division of opinion as to what sort of a committee should be set up.  Some people want a committee to examine the question of administration, some want a committee that will report on policy, some want a committee not consisting of members of the Dáil, while some want a committee consisting of members of the Dáil.  The real fact is that in general this demand for a committee of inquiry is a parrot cry and it is not worthy of members of <Col N="1679" /> the Dáil to come here and repeat it.  It is all right for a leader writer on a newspaper to throw out any sort of suggestion that can be written brightly about, that would interest the readers of his paper and improve its circulation. It is all right for him to do that.  He has no responsibility to the people, but it is up to Deputies of the Dáil to face the thing in a more serious way and to search about in their own minds and see what they want.</P>
    <P>A great deal of attention has been given by the Government to the question of economy.  We have at no time neglected it.  If we had not given constant attention to the question of economy, the costs of expenditure would be a great deal higher than they are. I wish to say this, that if there continues to be in the country and in the Dáil a demand for new services that we have had experience of in the past, no Government can keep down expenditure, and expenditure will not be kept down.  We must be prepared to deny ourselves to some extent of new services if we want expenditure to be kept down.  If we want it to be reduced we will have to face up to considerable cuttings-off in services.  It may quite truthfully be said, and said in no cynical way, that every country is always overtaxed.  Every country would benefit by a reduction in taxation, but it could only get that reduction in taxation by sacrificing certain things, and it will always be a question of weighing whether it is better to lose services or get the reduction in taxation.  That question arises on such a thing, say, as expenditure on agricultural education. In fact, it arises all along the line.</P>
    <P>I might mention certain things that will indicate that we have not been unmindful of the need for economy.  We have not fallen into the error of thinking that we should live on the British scale.  Of course, the whole system here was based on the British system.  We had a great number of British civil servants transferred to us&mdash;some 15,000 or 17,000.  We have actually in the Service at the moment 15,886 transferred British civil servants, with Treaty rights.  There were others who <Col N="1680" /> have since left the Service.  We have these people with their scales of salaries and with their assured rights which cannot be touched.  Deputy Gorey, who has just gone out, talked about a ten per cent. cut all round.  Such a ten per cent. cut would be the most reckless extravagance that we could indulge in, because, no doubt, enormous numbers of civil servants who have their Treaty rights would leave the Service if we attempted to apply a ten per cent. cut.  They would think that other cuts would follow, and we certainly should have a tremendous inflation of our pension bill.  I repeat that there could be no more reckless extravagance suggested than that of an all-round cut on the salaries of civil servants. Our civil servants, certainly our higher civil servants, are not paid unduly high salaries.</P>
    <P>The salaries paid are lower than the Northern Ireland salaries.  For instance, the Secretary to the Department of Finance here, has a salary of £1,500.  The salary for that Department in Northern Ireland, which deals with much smaller area and with smaller sums of money and where there is a Government with a limited jurisdiction, begins with £1,500 and goes up to £1,750.  For the general body of our heads of Departments a salary of £1,200 a year is fixed.  Corresponding people in Northern Ireland have salaries which begin at £1,200 and run up to £1,500.  The salaries in operation when we took over were on a higher scale than at present. For instance, the Secretary to the Department of Agriculture is at the present time paid £1,200 a year.  He replaced a secretary who, under the British regime, had £1,800.  The Secretary to the Department of Local Government has £1,200.  He replaced a man who held under the British regime and had £1,800 a year.  The head of the Prisons' Board has £1,000 a year, replacing a man who had £1,200.  Then when we come to the police we had here for an all-Ireland area an Inspector-General at a salary of from £1,800 to £2,200; a Deputy Inspector-General at from £1,300 to £1,500; two assistant Inspector-Generals, £1,000 to £1,200. The Chief Commissioner of the D.M.P., whose district embraced only the Dublin <Col N="1681" /> Metropolitan area, was on a salary scale of from £1,300 to £1,700; the Assistant Commissioner of the D.M.P. had a salary of from £900 to £1,000. The Commissioner of the Civic Guard has a salary of £1,300; the Deputy Commisioners £1,000, and two Assistant Deputy Commissioners, £900.  The Commissioner of the Civic Guard has charge of the whole Saorstát area at a salary of £1,300.  The Commissioner of the D.M.P., whose district only embraced the Dublin Metropolitan area, was on a salary scale of from £1,300 to £1,700.  Then take Education.  The Secretary to the Department of Education has £1,200.  In the old days we had in charge of primary education a resident Commissioner at a salary of £1,500.  We have one Assistant Commissioner dealing with Secondary Education at a salary of £1,000.  We had two Commissioners in the old days at a salary of £1,000 each.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Agriculture has referred to the Land Commission. In the Land Commission there were three Commissioners at a salary of £2,000 a year each, and two assistant Commissioners at £1,200 each.  Our Commissioners' salaries are now £1,300 to £1,500.  The numbers and the salaries are very substantially reduced.  We have an Attorney-General who does all the legal work of the State at a salary of £2,500.  Under the British regime there was an Attorney-General at a salary of £5,000 and a Solicitor-General at a salary of £2,000. I could give very many more instances such as these.</P>
    <P>I want just to explain to Deputies, when a suggestion is made that we have paid no attention at all to economy, that on the contrary there has been a most consistent attempt to get down rates.  In our new appointments we have reduced the rate very substantially. I will give the mean of the various scales; that is, taking the entire salary a man on a particular scale would get during his years' service and dividing that by the number of years.  In the junior administrative grade for a man, the British mean of the scale was £350; ours would be £325.  Of the women's scale, the mean under the British would be £300, ours <Col N="1682" /> £250.  In the case of the higher Executive officers, the British mean is £450; ours is £425.  Women, £350; ours, £315. Junior Executive, men, the British mean is £250; ours £220.  Women, the British, £200; ours, £170.  There is a similar reduction in the case of the clerical grades.  For men, the mean of the British scale for the clerical grades is £154; in our new appointments it is £129.  Women, £122 the British, and with us £107.  In the same way, as regards the second line of administrative officers, for an Assistant Secretary under the British in Dublin the normal scale was £1,000 to £1,200.  Our scale is £850 to £1,000.  In Great Britain the highest salary for the Civil Service is £3,500.  In Northern Ireland it is £1,750.  In Dublin, at the change of Government, it was £1,800 plus bonus.  We have now £1,500 plus bonus as a maximum scale.  In addition to this reduction of the rates of salaries, we have made other changes.  We have increased the daily attendance of all civil servants by half an hour.  That was the most we could do, having regard to Treaty conditions, and perhaps it was as much as would have produced an increase of output.</P>
    <P>The annual leave in the case of higher officers has been reduced by 25 per cent.  Subsistence allowances on travelling have been reduced to practically pre-war scale.  We always have to have regard to the fact that for, at any rate, all the higher ranks in our Civil Service we want first-class material and no advantage will be gained by cutting salaries in such a way that people of ability will not enter.  If we fail to get boys and girls of that standard the country will certainly pay very dearly for it later on. We are close up against England and our people have the right of sitting for British Civil Service examinations and can enter, without any obstacle, the British Civil Service, and while we can, and ought to, pay lower salaries here, having regard to existing conditions, and while we will get good people at lower salaries, they can only be lowered to a certain extent.  If we do decrease them too much we are going to have a Civil Service that will not be of the right material and will not <Col N="1683" /> have the right morale or the right spirit.  Really the successful administration and government of the country depends very largely on the quality of your Civil Service.  No Government that can possibly be appointed, if it has not an efficient and zealous Civil Service at its hand, can make any good of the country.  We have a very good Civil Service.  We have certainly in all the higher ranks of the Civil Service that I have come in contact with, men of great ability, great zeal, great public spirit and great independence.  I certainly do think that we have a Civil Service to which the country may be grateful for the extraordinary work that has been done in very difficult times.  The idea that it is an outrageous thing for a civil servant to have £1,000 a year is simply the idea that comes from the talk of all the disgruntled through the country, the fellow who could not get the job for which he tried, the fellow who could not pass the examination for which he sat.  They are always the people who are loudest about the outrageous salaries.  We have to have regard to salaries offered in competing occupations, if we want good people, people of ability and ambition, to enter our Civil Service. We must have regard to what will be earned by the doctor, the commercial man, the solicitor, or what will be earned in other walks of life outside.</P>
    <P>We have had people complaining about the bonus and saying that it should be cut away.  It is quite obvious in regard to all the lower grades of the Civil Service, in regard to, say, the Post Office grades, that you could not cut the bonus away.  You might as well say the agricultural labourer should be brought back to pre-war rates of pay.</P>

      <P>He is low down, but to say that he is back to pre-war is to say a ridiculous thing.  Even in the grades higher up, the person who now has a bonus has nothing like the <Col N="1684" /> amount that corresponds to the increase in the cost of living.  The person who had £500 without bonus in pre-war days was immensely better off than the man who has £500 plus bonus at the present time.  As a matter of fact, these grades have actually been cut; they have been cut by the fact that the bonus is cut substantially on the higher salaries.  If you take into question the income tax, which the civil servant cannot escape and which all sorts of other people do frequently manage, to some extent, to escape, sometimes legally, the civil servant who had a salary of £500 pre-war had actually £487 5s. cash to spend.  The same civil servant now, with £500 plus bonus, after deduction of income tax, has £641.  That means that while the cost of living has gone up about 90 per cent., the salary of that particular individual has gone up 31 per cent. There is nothing really to be said for the proposal that the bonus should come off to any extent further than it has already come off.</P>
      <P>If we come to Ministers' salaries, which have been referred to, and compare them with Northern Ireland, we find that the Prime Minister in Northern Ireland has a salary of £3,200; the President here has a salary of £2,500. A Minister here has £1,700; a Minister in Northern Ireland has £2,000, and that is an area that is very much smaller.  In South Africa the Prime Minister has £3,500, and other Ministers have £2,500.</P>

      <P>You can produce them, but, as a matter of fact, you cannot compare this country except with countries organised as we are. For instance, there was no comparison in Deputy O'Mara's mention of the <Col N="1685" /> salary of the Secretary of Commerce in America with the position here.  In America they have a different system of Government, a system which would certainly not be suitable here.  I think it is a well-known thing that no one of the people holding that sort of position in America could at all live on the salary paid here.  I know a secretary in America who said his offical salary did not pay the rent of his flat.  It might be a good thing to have only the wealthy and the people who are interested in commercial organisations and concerns in Ministerial office; it might be a good thing to fix your salary so as to confine Ministerial offices to those people.  I do not think it is a good thing, and I know, even with the salaries we have here, that on two occasions members of this Dáil refused to accept Ministerial offices, because they said it meant so much of a loss to them, or involved such a loss to them by taking them away from their business, that they could not do it.  As Deputy Johnson once said very aptly, you have in this talk about Ministers' salaries a manifestation of the slave mind.  You have all this sort of jealousy and envy in the country.  As far as it goes, it is simply a question of jealousy and envy.  I do not think that it merits any other consideration.  The suggestion that no economy should be proposed by Ministers without proposing a reduction in their own salaries at the same time, is equally ridiculous. That is only put forward by people who do not want anything to be done. If they were serious and had any thought&mdash;I do not accuse Deputy Heffernan of having any thought&mdash; they would not put it forward.  It has often been suggested that we drove out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You need not.  It has been suggested that a large number of civil servants were forced into retirement by the Government and that if that had not been done a great deal of money would have been saved.  There have been retirements under the Treaty <Col N="1686" /> to the number of 1,502.  Those retirements were not due to any action of the Government.  We could not prevent the retirements.  There was a time when such a debate as this would probably cause considerable thought, because people were afraid that their position would be prejudiced if they did not go, and they went.  Some of them, of course, genuinely did not want to serve under an Irish Government because of political prejudice, but others simply went.  At any rate, 1,502 went.  Discharges numbered 349.  Of those, 34 were Resident Magistrates; 13 were members of the Marlborough Street College staff; one was an Under-Secretary in Dublin Castle; two were Dublin Metropolitan Magistrates; nine were Local Government Inspectors and Auditors. As a matter of fact, I had to do with the discharge of most of these when I was Minister for Local Government. There were some of them whose discharge I did not regret; there were others whose discharge I did regret. But it was necessary at the time not to get the local authorities up against the Government.  Owing to the part that the Local Government Board had played in the political struggle before the Treaty, it was impossible at that time to retain them.  There were two Dublin Metropolitan Commissioners; 276 Petty Sessions Clerks and 12 other officials over the service.  That really disposes of the suggestion that the Government has discharged people and wantonly thrown great charges on the State by dealing improperly with officials.</P>

    <P>I can deal in the same way with the appointments.  Deputy Baxter asked for certain returns which I will give him, but they will take some time to prepare.  They will show that there is no more truth in the allegation that we filled the Civil Service with our friends and swelled the staffs, than there is in the suggestion that we swelled the superannuation list by useless and unnecessary discharges.  We have as I say, consistently had economy in view.  All along the line we have looked to economy.  We have done many things.  We have had also at the same time to undertake new services.  Those new services have been less than the new services <Col N="1687" /> demanded of us.  If economy is wanted, the Dáil will have to face up to the question of services, and there is no use in them following a &ldquo;will-o'-the-wisp&rdquo; and thinking they are going to effect big savings by reduction in staffs or chopping off staffs.  Certain economies are being effected; more will be effected, but nothing that is going to do anything towards relieving the parlous conditions of agriculture can come from that.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance concluded his speech.  I take it, by the way he looked at the clock, on the understanding that a division was going to be taken.  The Minister is making a very important statement, and if he desires to continue it I take it the Dáil will allow him.  It will not prejudice Deputy Connor Hogan in speaking after him.</P>

      <P>I understood Deputy Hogan was going to resume the debate to-morrow, having regard to the motion he was moving.  I should like to know exactly where we are.  This is an important Vote.  I presume that the Dáil generally is of opinion that it ought to be disposed of this week and I have to give notice that we will sit <Col N="1688" /> later to-morrow night in order to deal with it: and also that we will take it on Friday and possibly come back on one day next week to finish it.  I do not want to take Deputies by surprise. I wanted to have a late sitting on Tuesday, having this in view.  I understood the debate would finish to-night with the Minister for Finance's speech. That apparently is not the intention. We are prepared to sit it out, but we must get through with the business.</P>

      <P>This debate is technically in Committee, but the rules are not being observed&mdash;that is to say, Deputies are allowed to speak for much more than ten minutes.  As a general rule, Deputies in those circumstances only speak once on the same topic, but Deputy Heffernan may certainly speak again as far as I am concerned.</P>

Lewin, Castlegrove, Co.
