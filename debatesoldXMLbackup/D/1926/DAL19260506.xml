      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that an award for £10 was made by the Indemnity Committee to Mr. Edward Spearman, of Graigue, Poulnamucka, Clonmel, for a bullock seized in the interim period after the Truce and before the Irregular outbreak; that Mr. Spearman incurred legal costs to the extent of £5 15s. in connection with the presentation of his claim for hearing by the County Court Judge in Clonmel, and if the Minister will take steps to see that Mr. Spearman receives compensation for his losses in this respect also.</P>

      <P>The award referred to by the Deputy represents the full amount of the Committee's recommendation and this has been paid.  I informed the Deputy on the 25th June last that I was advised that the loss in this case could not properly be made the subject of a report under Section 15 of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923. No payment could, therefore, be made on the judge's recommendation, either in respect of the original loss or in respect of the costs awarded by him. As the full amount recommended by the Indemnity Act Committee has been paid, no question of any further payment arises.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say if it is not a fact that this gentleman was allowed to bring forward his claim in court, that the claim was heard in court by the judge without demur and a decree granted, and <Col N="1192" /> that he incurred costs to the amount of £5 15s.  In view of the fact that he was allowed to pursue this course in the law court, is it not reasonable to expect that he should be recouped the costs he incurred?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether the claims of Mr. Patrick Walsh, junior, of Ballymacadam, Cahir, Mr. J. J. Mason, Gormanstown, Ardfinnan, and others in the same district, for compensation in respect of cattle seized in the interim period between the Truce and the outbreak of Irregular hostilities in 1922, have yet been heard by the Indemnity Committee, and if he will take steps to expedite the issue of awards in these cases, and whether he will state why my letter of the 9th April last, addressed to the Secretary of the Minister for Finance in connection with these claims, has not been answered.</P>

      <P>The first claim mentioned by the Deputy has been considered by the Committee and a paying order in discharge of the award will be sent to the claimant's solicitor at a very early date.  The letter to which the Deputy refers was received in the first instance by the pre-Truce section of my Department, where considerable difficulty was experienced in tracing the claims from the particulars supplied.  I understand, however, that a reply was sent to the Deputy's home address from the offices of the Indemnity Act Committee on 3rd instant.  The second claim was disposed of by a payment of £23 made to the claimant through his solicitor on 24th February last.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that on the occasion of the shooting of John J. Murphy by troops of the National Army in August, 1924, at Killenaule, <Col N="1193" /> Co. Tipperary, an officer and a soldier were placed under arrest by the Gárda Síochána, and if he will state why further proceedings were not taken by the Gárdaí against this officer and man in regard to this shooting.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion in question no arrests were effected by the Gárda Síochána.  The lieutenant in charge of the troops, at the suggestion of the Gárda Síochána, marched his party to the police barracks for the purpose of having the ammunition checked.  Two rounds of ammunition were missing, but one was subsequently accounted for.  The private whose ammunition was missing, was placed under arrest by his own officer.  The further investigation of the matter was left to the military authorities.</P>

      <P>The number of claims to unemployment insurance benefit current on the 26th April, 1926, the latest date for which statistics are available, was (a) for men, 14.578; (b) for women and juveniles, 2,581.  It is not possible to state the number of claims disallowed from the 30th of April, 1925, because statistics relating to this aspect of the work of the Department are rendered at certain fixed periods; but between the 4th of May, 1925, and the 6th of April, 1926. the number of applications for benefit received at the local offices of the Department, was 87,617.  Of these 76,822 were allowed, and 10,795 <Col N="1194" /> disallowed.  The amount of unemployment insurance benefit paid direct to claimants and through associations having arrangements under Section 17 of the Act of 1920, between the 1st of May, 1925, and the 29th of April, 1926, was £676,058.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that Mrs. Tubbritt, 22 Baker Street, Waterford, has been refused unemployment insurance benefit on the grounds that her employment did not come within the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and if he will state on what grounds it was decided that her employment did not come within the scope of these Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Mrs. Tubbritt has been refused unemployment insurance benefit because there were no contributions to her credit.  Contributions which had been paid for Mrs. Tubbritt by her employers in the erroneous belief that they were legally payable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, could not be admitted because it was found that she was not an employed person within the meaning of these Acts.  The grounds on which it was decided that Mrs. Tubbritt was not an employed person within the meaning of the Act were that her employment was employment in domestic service, and that she was not employed in any trade or business carried on for the purpose of gain.  It has already been intimated to Mrs. Tubbritt that an application for the refund to her of the value of those contributions would be entertained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Mrs. Tubbritt claims that she was employed as office cleaner, and that her work comes under the category of charwoman, rather than that of domestic service?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Mrs. Tubbritt was employed by this bacon factory the same as many other women, and that she was dismissed through slackness of work with half-a-dozen others?  Is he also aware that she was entitled to a week's holidays under the agreement come to between the general body of the factory workers and their employers, and that she considers that she is not really a domestic servant at all, inasmuch as she works in the factory and does the same work as the others.  Would the Minister say if the women who clean out Leinster House and Government Buildings are liable to pay unemployment insurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That analogous case I cannot answer at the moment. To say merely that this woman is insurable because she was employed in a factory does not bring her within the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  If she was performing service which is of the domestic service type in a factory, then she is not insurable, and she does not come within the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  In regard to this woman, it is alleged that a previous claim to benefit had been admitted on her behalf, but on that occasion she had signed herself and had been admitted, as a cleaner in a bacon factory; that is to say, she had been admitted as a bacon factory worker, but later she signed as being an office cleaner at the bacon factory. That proved to be the case, that that actually was her employment, and that is not insurable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's answer, although the age of this woman cannot be traced in the register owing to some pages having been torn out there is in the possession of the family an old prayer book which gives the age of every member of the family, except the youngest, with the date of birth.  Moreover, the family with which the father of this woman and all her people had been employed are prepared to give evidence in support of her age.

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether the drainage works constructed in the townlands of Ardamagh, Keelagh, Mullaloughter and Mullacrogher, Ballyhaise, under the relief schemes, were carried out under the supervision or according to the plans of a competent engineer; whether he is aware that the excavation work done there at a cost of £200 is rendered useless, as the sides of works have fallen in, and whether immediate steps will be taken to inquire into the way the money is at present being spent there with a view to having more benefits brought to the district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The work referred to was a cutting with a view to providing outlet for drainage from a lake to allow turf cutting along its banks.  The work was started by the local farmers according to the plans of a local engineer, but was not completed.  As there was a great deal of unemployment in the district the Land Commission completed under the relief schemes the cutting, which was through a hill and reached a depth of 25 feet.  Last February, owing to very heavy rains, the banks slipped and the hill cutting was abandoned.  The Land Commission then had the original outlet drain cleared and rocks removed, with satisfactory results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the original plans of the local engineer made allowance for constructional work, including the putting down of piping in this drain, and that these plans were entirely ignored?  Will the Minister further inform me if this work carried out under his Department was under the supervision of any competent engineer, or was it merely left to a number of unskilled workers without any engineering knowledge to do this work?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course any work of this kind is carried out under the supervision of the Land Commission engineers.  These engineers are recruited for a purpose quite different to the class of work for which engineers are recruited for the Board of Works. That shows the difficulties of a body like the Land Commission, a body which exists primarily for the division of land, having to do work which is not their function at all.</P>

Kildare, who has five sons and who tills a considerable portion of his small holding, the remainder being reclaimed land, has not been allotted any of the Bury Estate, adjoining his holding, which has just been divided, with the exception of about sixty acres, with the dwelling-house and garden, and whether he will inquire if a portion of this remaining land can be assigned to this man.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission have taken into account the claims of the uneconomic holders in connection with the lands of this estate which have been already divided.  John Cassidy whose valuation is £23 10s. had to be left out.  I do not know about the acreage of the lands about the house, or the size of the house.  I cannot say what the Land Commission may do with it.  It may not be suitable for division, it may be woodland.  If it is divided it will be divided primarily among the uneconomic holders.</P>

    <P>And question, being again proposed, on the motion made by Deputy Heffernan on that date:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Vote be reduced by £400,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Debate was resumed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>in connection with this amendment, on the last day I was on the point of making suggestions as to how this amount could be arrived at.  I am not in a position to produce figures to sustain this cut of £400,000.  We are in a position to make suggestions as to a lesser sum, but still a very substantial sum, by which this Vote could, and should, be reduced.  If I give some comparative figures as to the position in 1914 and 1920, it will explain how the cuts can be effected.  I will not deal with the higher officers inasmuch as very little saving can be effected in that direction.  Only a few officers have to be dealt with, and it is easy to deal with these under the sub-heads.  I will deal with it when coming down to the lower ranks.  In 1914 surgeons in the old R. I. C. had £400 salary, and that continued up to 1920, when those salaries were reviewed by the British Government.  In 1920 that salary was fixed at £700, and that remains to-day. We know the position in 1920, and we know the position from 1916 up to 1920, and a great strain was put on the police in those days to retain their offices.  We know the circumstances that brought about that rise.  But the peak point was only reached in 1920. The rank of county inspector in those days carried a salary of £350 to £450. In 1920 that salary was raised to £700 <Col N="1204" />&mdash;£900.  In the present time the corresponding rank in our Gárda Síochána is £650&mdash;£800, very little less than the peak point reached in 1920 at the height of the trouble.  The same thing applies to the D. I.  His salary was £135 to £300, and in 1920 it jumped to £350 to £600.  Our corresponding officer is paid a salary of £310 to £585.  The head-constable of the old R.I.C. was paid 42/- per week to 46/- a week.  In 1920 that was raised to £310&mdash;£355.  In other words the salary of 42/- to 46/- was raised a little over £6 per week. The corresponding officer in the Gárda Síochána has now a salary of £280&mdash; £300.  Sergeants in the old R. I. C. had 35/- to 37/- per week in 1914.  In 1920 that was increased to £5 per week, rising to £5 12s. 6d.  We pay a salary to the corresponding officers now of £4 7s. Od. to £4 18s. 6d.  A constable in the old R. I. C. was paid 23/- to 31/- a week.  In 1920 that was raised to 70/- &mdash;95/- a week, and we pay a salary of 60/- to 83/- a week.  Up to 1920 recruits in training were paid 20/- a week.  That was then raised to 70/- per week, and we pay them a salary of 50/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I am not going to make many comparisons with the police forces of other countries.  I am not in the position to do so.  I have not the details. Perhaps we may compare favourably with the other countries.  I do not know.  But I do say that in approaching this question there are only two channels in which we can obtain a reduction.  We have only to consider whether we could obtain a reduction in pay or a reduction in the strength of the force.  I do not believe it is advisable to have a reduction in the strength of the force.  It may be said that they have not enough duties to perform.  There is no reason why we should not give them enough duties to perform.  There are several other activities which could be assigned to them along with what they are doing at present.  I could mention one item just now.  That is revenue duty from gun licences.  I have been told this year in connection with gun licences that any individual who carries a licence to keep a gun, can shoot game anywhere he likes, without any interference <Col N="1205" /> whatever from the Gárda Síochána.  I understand that that is the duty of the revenue officer who never appears in the country to enforce the revenue laws.  I have been told by officers of the Gárdaí that they have no jurisdiction to go in on the fields and enforce the Game Laws.  This is a law that I hold cannot be enforced without the Gárda Síochána.  They are the only people who can do it.  It is ridiculous to think the revenue officers can do it. They cannot.  To enable the revenue officers to put these Game Laws effectively into operation would need a tremendous force in the country.  Men have gone around on week-days and especially on Sundays in battalions and they shoot game of every description without a game licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Would legislation be required to enable the Gárda Síochána to take action?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of trespass largely.  The Deputy knows that the ten-shilling licence is now gone and there is an all-in £2 licence, the holder of which can shoot game. Therefore, it does narrow down to the simple question of trespass on lands that people are not entitled to go in on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my point. My point is that the holder of a permit to keep a gun has been using that permit to shoot game all over the country. They trespass on other people's land. Other people do not take the law into their own hands and there is not compliance with the revenue law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>What revenue law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The taking out of a game licence.  They are not taking out game licences.  They do not take them out.  I do say that nobody is able to deal with this particular thing except the Gárda Síochána.  Their duties, I submit, should be extended in that way, and in several other ways, too.  I would not be prepared to say that the force could be or should be reduced.  I believe they want to be properly organised and given proper training with <Col N="1206" /> regard to the fishery law also.  There is wide scope for them there in enforcing the fishery laws.  I cannot see that there is anybody capable of enforcing these laws except the Gárda Síochána. I am not prepared to say that the force should be reduced.  I am prepared to say that the proposition of increasing it, if necessary, should be considered. I do not say that it is necessary to increase it, but I do say that if it is necessary to have it increased it should be increased in order to deal with these matters that I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>Having made up my mind that the strength of the force ought not be reduced, the only other direction in which we can reduce this Vote is in connection with the question of salaries. Deputies know the circumstances that arose in 1920, and how they arose. When the sub-heads come to be dealt with on those items these points will be thrashed out.  I do recommend for the Minister's consideration the matters I have mentioned.  A reduction can be effected and, I think, considering the economic conditions of the country, that the time has arrived when serious consideration should be given to that end in order to secure possible economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (An Clár)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a practice of mine to read the official reports.  It is an occupation that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would describe as redundant.  But sometimes one does drop on a gem that is worth reading, and usually you do find it in the speech of the Minister for Justice.  Here is one which, I submit, is worth reading for the House.  Advancing an argument against Deputy Heffernan's motion for a reduction, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is a patch in North Clare, for instance, that is just about as bad as bad can be.  The conditions there are very bad from the point of view of crime.  There is a very settled determination in crime, and a very settled attitude of hostility to all laws and hostility to all ideas of the administration of laws.  You would not find the equal of it in any other county in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> Further on, he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;People stand apart from the police, some are in definite and settled hostility, in a kind of anti-social and anti-civilised way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not read this for the purpose of a joke.  When a Minister comes to the Dáil and hides himself behind the privileges of his position in order to libel a law-abiding people in any county in this State, it is a serious matter.  It is serious when he comes here to besmirch the fair name of any body of people in the State.  I hold that is a position that should not be tolerated, and I challenge the Minister to name the district and repeat the statement outside the Dáil, so that he may have an opportunity of proving that statement.  He has come here and made a general statement without producing any proof.</P>

I would like also to know whether Deputy Dr. MacNeill agrees with the Minister's statement.  The Minister says there is not a county in all Ireland as bad&mdash;&ldquo;You would not find the equal of it in any other county in Ireland.&rdquo;  I wonder did the Minister ever hear of Malahide, which happens to be in his own constituency?</P>

      <P>MacNamara was the name.  He was a large landholder in North Clare.  It is time we got away from that sort of thing.  If the Minister wants to make any statement reflecting on the people of any district, he should tell us on what information he bases that statement.  He should also tell us what is the attitude of the forces he sends into those districts. The Minister should tell us how many C.I.D. or plain-clothes men, whom nobody knows, are engaged in Clare.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would tell us how many of those men are in the district he refers to, and perhaps he will tell us of the provocative attitude on the part of some of those men when they enter these districts.  I will give the Minister an idea of the attitude adopted by some of his plain-clothes men in Clare. I know one district, a perfectly peaceful and law-abiding district, where it was announced that a meeting of the local branch of a trade union was to be held and a Deputy of this House was billed to speak at that meeting. Does the Minister consider it is the duty of one of his C.I.D. men, when the check at the door was relaxed, to force his way into the meeting and watch the proceedings, when he knew perfectly well it was a general meeting of the local branch of a trade union at which a Deputy of the Dáil was announced to speak?  If it was urged on the meeting&mdash;on the members of the organisation&mdash;that the C.I.D. man should be ejected, what a chain of outrages you would have, all because of this particular man outstepping his duty!  In other districts in North Clare the C.I.D. men have adopted a similar attitude.  I do not know what the Minister considers a law-abiding citizen !  I have a certain idea of what a <Col N="1209" /> law-abiding citizen is.  The people in North Clare tell me that the attitude of the men the Minister sends down is provocative.  Those men go into the district, not to try to prevent crime, but with the settled opinion that crime exists there already, and they act as if that were the case.</P>

      <P>We have asked you for facts.  Where are they?  We are told that there was an attack on the Gárda barracks there.  What were the local representations regarding that report?  Does the Minister know that there was a dispute between the ordinary Gárda and the C.I.D. and that this is what it terminated in?  It is not that the people of the district have shown open hostility to the Gárda.  I have nothing to say to the ordinary Gárdaí; they are doing their duty all over the country as well as it is possible for men to do it under difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>When a Minister comes in here and, hiding behind his privileges, besmirches the character of the people of North Clare, that is a thing that should not be allowed to go unchallenged.

What he did, in fact, was to <Col N="1210" /> read out figures showing the rates of pay in the R.I.C. in the years 1914-1920 and then he read out the figures of pay to corresponding ranks in the Gárda Síochána to-day.  Having done that, he practically left the matter there. He did not say what I was waiting for him to say&mdash;that the pay of the Gárda to-day is excessive and in respect to what ranks it is excessive.</P>

The pay of the police all over Britain and the area of the British jurisdiction was increased in that year, and it was not because of any special emergency or any special desire to retain the services of the police here that their pay was raised in 1920.

      <P>We may as well have them in order to complete the picture. The inspector-general was paid in 1914 at a rate of from £1,500 to £1,800; in 1920 he was paid from £1,800 to £2,200.  The Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána is paid £1,300.  The deputy inspector-general was paid £1,000 to £1,200 in 1914, and in 1920 he was paid £1,300 to £1,500.  The deputy-commissioner to-day is paid £1,000.  The assistant-inspector was paid in 1914 <Col N="1211" /> from £700 to £800, and in 1920 from £1,000 to £1,200.  The assistant commissioner of the Gárda is paid £900. You had a commandant at £600 in 1914, and £1,000 in 1920.  You had a barrack master at £400 in 1914, and £750 in 1920, and the functions of those two officers are performed to-day by chief superintendents, whose pay is from £650 to £800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the point at which Deputy Gorey began.  He began, I think, at county inspectors and worked down to the ranks.  I agree that the three big factors in the total cost of the Force are the strength, the pay and the equipment.  In the matter of strength Deputy Baxter told us the other day that there has been a small reduction.  &ldquo;Small&rdquo; is a relative term.  There has been a reduction of 20.9 as compared with the position in 1914, taking the R.I.C. and the D.M.P. together, and contrasting that with the strength of the Gárda Síochána.  That is not a small reduction.  Outside the metropolitan area in 1914 you had 7,859 R.I.C.  To-day outside the metropolitan division you have 6,011 Gárdaí. It is a very substantial difference. Passing to equipment, I showed that in 1926 we are doing for £3 10s. per head what was being done in 1914 by Dublin Castle for £3 17s. a head.  That is rather a striking figure when you take into consideration the difference in the purchasing power of money between 1914 and 1926.  It is a figure, incidentally, which neither of the morning papers quoted, though it was the most important fact which emerged on the discussion the last day on the Gárda Síochána Vote.  The fact was not given to the public that the equipment of the police in 1914 totalled £33,000, and that in 1926 the total is £26,870. Deputy Good got up and told us that an old business bird could not be caught by chaff, that the Minister said with certain emphasis and justifiable pride that he was doing with less police now than in 1914, which, of course, is a fact, that what he wanted was a per head comparison, and when he was given the per head comparison, at £3 10s. in 1926 for the Gárda Síochána, and £3 17s. in 1914 for the police at the time, neither of the Dublin morning <Col N="1212" /> papers published it.  Why?  Are not the public entitled to get facts like that?  It was about as important a fact as emerged in the last day's discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Important facts of that kind which the Government give out ought to be disclosed to the public. We have dealt with strength.  I think the strength is not excessive.  I think the reduction of 20.9 in 1914 is a very substantial reduction.  When you remember that 100 Guards are on special duty, solely engaged on Customs duty on the border, and that Ardnacrusha makes a demand on fifty, I think the present authorised strength, 7,622, is not excessive for the needs of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with an amendment, and expected to take that amendment seriously.  There is a reduction down in the name of Deputy Heffernan for £400,000, and the Deputy justifies that by saying that there are 2,000 too many Guards.  Deputy Gorey does not think there are too many, and even suggested that there might be need, for an increase, but are we going to have Deputies voting for this amendment, one because there are 2,000 too many Guards, and the other for an entirely different reason.  I think we ought to know where we stand with regard to the Farmers' Party in the Dáil.  The amendment is put down in the name of one Deputy. He speaks in terms of &ldquo;we.&rdquo;&ldquo;We&rdquo; think this and &ldquo;we&rdquo; think that, and then we discover that &ldquo;we&rdquo; do not think anything of the kind, and that in fact a prominent member of his Party is not prepared to accept the fact that there are too many Guards. It is all very well to say the pay is too high.  The pay of the police here is 15 per cent. below that obtaining in Britain and Northern Ireland.  Deputies say it should be lower still, but you have to take factors like that into account. There has been a 14 or a 15 <Col N="1213" /> per cent. cut, and if Deputies are prepared to come along and say there should be a further cut, let them say it quite openly, not simply read out a column of figures and merely hint at it.  I do not think there ought to be a further cut.  I do not think that the 60/- for the Gárdaí after training is excessive.  If you get a good man and get good service from that good man, he is not overpaid at £3 a week, and it is in contrast to a rate of from 70/- to 95/- per week in 1920.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>What I object to in regard to this Vote is that a member of the Farmers' Party puts down an amendment to reduce the Vote by almost half a million, and Deputy Heffernan says that that is done because there are 2,000 too many police, <Col N="1215" /> whereas Deputy Gorey, who, presumably, will support that amendment, says he does not think there are too many police.  In that kind of situation it is difficult to know where we are.  You might have this position.  Deputy Heffernan says that there are 2,000 too many police, but the pay is all right, whereas Deputy Gorey says we have not too many police, but the pay is too high, and we will probably have Deputy Wilson taking a third course.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of strength and too many stations, it may be of interest to Deputies if I read a resolution which I received recently from a Co-operative Society in Limerick.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That we, the members of the Committee of this Co-operative Dairy Society, Ltd., representing fully two-thirds of the Civic Guards district of Shanagolden, having learned with no little amazement of the contemplated removal of the Civic Guards station from Shanagolden, desire to protest in the strongest possible manner against the disbandment of the local Civic Guard station, as it is our considered opinion that any change in that direction will not conduce towards that respect for law and order, which, we believe, can best be maintained only by the continuance of the existing station at Shanagolden. We direct that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the Chief Commissioner of the Civic Guards, Dublin, and to our representative, Mr. P.K. Hogan, Rathjordan House, Herbertstown.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the kind of resolution that comes in, except that it is rather milder than the average one, when there is any suggestion of closing down a Gárda station, and we, in the Department, have challenged and sifted every proposal for a new station, and have only yielded when the need for it was established to our complete satisfaction. We have adopted a most cautious and conservative attitude on the question of extending the number of stations. After we reached what we believed would be our full establishment, cases were put up so complete and convincing <Col N="1216" /> that we had no alternative but to yield.  Then when, here and there, we attempted to withdraw from a station, or to change to another area, the opposition was always intense, as in this case of Shanagolden.</P>
    <P>Generally, I just want to put it to Deputies that, analysing these three big factors towards the total cost of this force&mdash;namely, strength, equipment and pay&mdash;there is no evidence of extravagance.  The people are getting value for the money expended on the force, and, if the majority of Deputies believe that, then this amendment to reduce the Estimate by nearly half a million pounds should be rejected. Supposing it were not, and suppose Deputies made the mistake of taking Deputy Heffernan and his amendment seriously and the Vote were reduced by half a million, there would be no alternative but an immediate and drastic reduction of the strength. Does any Deputy think that that would not have immediate repercussions throughout the country?  The thing is really as fine as this: that when Gardaí are withdrawn from their ordinary duties for some special purpose and special calls from a Department for a single week, that is reflected in the crime statistics of that week.  You have always the pressure there, and when you reduce the strength that stands against that crime and pressure, you see the results reflected immediately in the statistics of that week which we get in the monthly confidential reports of the Gardaí.  You could say by these statistics when there was a particular call on the police that was a distraction and diversion from their ordinary preventative and protective duties.</P>

But taking it generally as the offences that are reported to the police, I assure the Deputy that when there is a specially <Col N="1217" /> heavy call on the police for duty on behalf of this or that department, you find that diversion of the police from their ordinary duties reflected in the statistics of the number of offences reported in that period.</P>

      <P>In speaking of crime, does the Minister take into account, for instance, the work of one member of the Gárdaí that I have experience of who brought eight cases in court which resulted in eight dismissals, one after another?

      <P>Offences reported &mdash;the Deputy can include under that heading anything he likes.  Without just quibbling over the matter, I want to show that when the police are diverted to some special duty like a census of traffic or something of that kind on behalf of one or other department, you find that diversion reflected in the statistics of offences for the period in which they were diverted.  I would not contemplate with any equanimity the reduction of the Gárdaí by 200, not to speak of 2,000, and I may <Col N="1218" /> claim to know the situation rather intimately.  Back since September, 1922, I have had month by month from the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána a confidential report showing the condition of every county, and I have watched the upward curve and the improvement with considerable pleasure. But, on the question of a reduction of strength, I believe you could not reduce the strength of the Gárdaí by scores without having a reflection of that in the absence of that security of personal property which citizens at present enjoy.  If the people would prefer to face that, would prefer to fall back a bit in the degree of order and protection and decency of life there is in the country and save a certain amount of money, then undoubtedly the Dáil can do that.  But I do not think that is the feeling of the country.  I think that the people would be glad to have even a little more security of personal property, order and decency in the general life of the country than at present rather than less, and I believe that the people are prepared to pay for it.  I believe, if it is shown that there is no extravagance in the matter of pay, equipment and general maintenance of the force, that that meets the frame of mind of the ordinary citizen.  I have attempted to show that, and I have gone to the point of boring Deputy Hewat, representing the business and commercial community here&mdash;to the length of boring him with particulars&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Almost to tears&mdash; in the matter of insisting on giving him particulars of equipment leading up to the conclusion which I have spoken of. Strength cannot be gone into in just that detailed way, but I have shown a reduction of 20.9 in the strength as against 1914, and 1914 was a very normal, humdrum year, with no particular calls on the police.  Then there is pay. The pay stands at fourteen or fifteen per cent. under that of neighbouring police.  I do not think it should stand lower.  I am not prepared to say, given a good man and a good service from him, that £3 per week is an excessive rate of pay for a rank-and-file member of the Gárda Síochána.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like just to say a word on a matter that the Minister has opened up which, to my mind, is one of the most serious statements ever made in this House.  I refer to the statement that the people are in such a state of mind as immediately to add to the number of offences reported as soon as there is any withdrawal of the number of Gárdaí or diversion from their normal occupation and duty.  I am not doubting for a moment the Minister's statement, but it is so serious that it would be important to have a closer inquiry.  I feel sure these offences are catalogued and classified, and it would be some satisfaction to know that the offences which increase in number with the withdrawal of the Gárda are minor offences&mdash;offences against order, regulation, statute, and not what might be classed as crimes of violence against persons or property&mdash; in fact, what might be called moral offences.  It would be a fearful state of things if we had to admit that it was only the presence of the Gárda that restrained people from committing those offences.  It is very hard for me to believe it at any rate, and I think that if it is shown by the Minister's records that the latter statement is the truth, then a Commission of Inquiry composed of clergymen, moralists and educationists is imperatively demanded.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy not making a mistake in speaking of the people of the country?  It is not the people of the country&mdash;using it in that broad sense&mdash;who commit crimes and so on.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>He suggests that there is found spread over the country a certain criminal class, waiting for the opportunity, waiting for the absence of watchfulness, to commit those offences. <Col N="1220" /> If that class is not evenly spread over the country, if it is in a particular place, then one would say that it is bad administration from the police point of view if you relax vigilance in that particular place.</P>
      <P>I think the whole position as shown to us by the Minister deserves very close investigation.  It is rather a tremendous indictment of the character of the people.  I do not distinguish between this alleged criminal class, that is waiting always for the opportunity to commit offences, and the average man.  I do not think that there is such a thing as a criminal class waiting for the absence of supervision to commit offences. There are criminals who are frequently found out and frequently find themselves in prison.  There are many other criminals that do not find themselves in prison because they are not found out. I make the suggestion to the Minister that it would be worth while giving to the Dáil the fullest information that he has graphically or by means of a statement upon the matter, because it is certainly worthy of the closest inquiry.</P>

      <P>I wish to express agreement with the statement made by the Minister.  I do not believe that the country would stand for any reduction in the Gárda, and I do not believe the country wishes any such thing.  I also agree with Deputy Gorey that the activities of the Gárda might be extended. There are many ways in which they could be of more service than they are.  One is in regard to unlicensed gunmen to whom Deputy Gorey referred. They are trespassing upon other people's property.  I think there might be more activity also displayed by the Gárda in the prevention of road trespass in many parts of the country.  There was a letter in the papers yesterday showing the necessity for more supervision with regard to road trespass.  I think it might be pointed out to the Gárda by the Minister that they might give more attention to road trespass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point I want to touch upon, and which I deliberately avoided in the discussion the other day, but which I think might properly be brought to the notice of the Minister on this general discussion with <Col N="1221" /> a view to getting some information upon it.  Apart altogether from the number of the Gárda, there is the question of the organisation of the force in the country.  We recognise that, on the whole, and in the conditions, the force is satisfactory.  But there is the consideration that it is a new force, composed entirely of young men, the great majority of whom had not great opportunities for education and for the understanding of the problems with which they find themselves confronted when sent down the country to handle the people, for that is what their work amounts to.  Their ability to preserve the peace is very largely determined by their ability to understand the people with whom they come in contact.</P>
      <P>The Gárda, I hold, will not be doing the best in maintaining order and winning respect for the law by trivial prosecutions and by exasperating action.  There is necessity, on the part of the Gárda, to be able to discriminate between what cases should be taken to court&mdash;in what cases it is wise to take action and in what cases it is wise to leave action alone.  I suggest, on many occasions better results could be obtained by suggestion and advice to many of the people that the Gárda come in contact with, in the rural district, than by taking men to court for petty offences.  That is more than a matter for the ordinary Gárda. It is a question of the organisation and outlook of the whole force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather impressed by certain action that was taken, whether by the Minister for Defence or by the Army officers, or by whom I am not able to say, when certain public men were secured to lecture to the officers of the Army.  I believe that was a step in the right direction.  In discussing with some people some of the lectures given, one learned gentleman suggested that when &ldquo;citizenship&rdquo; was the subject of discourse it might not be out of place sometime to get some of us members of the Dáil to attend that lecture.  But undoubtedly I feel there is a great necessity that the Gárda as a whole, and their officers particularly, should be brought together, and that problems of life with which they have to deal <Col N="1222" /> should be brought before them, perhaps by their more experienced officers, and if not, by people from outside. Their duty as citizens and the example, as citizens that they should give to the people among whom they move to keep the peace, should be explained.</P>
    <P>Officers in turn should impart that information to their own men in such a manner as would be understandable, so that the members of the Gárda might be imbued with that spirit and set an example to the people by carrying out their work in such a discreet and sensible manner as would inculcate respect for the Gárda as citizens and respect because of the manner in which they discharge their duties.  I am not able to say whether that aspect of things is considered, but I think the visits of senior officers to junior officers and the visits of junior officers to those under them would produce an excellent spirit.  I would like to have some information as to these matters.  I would like to know if lectures or discourses of the nature suggested are given to these officers.  If such is not done, I suggest the Minister should give the matter his consideration.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to this discussion, and would not, as a matter of fact, have intervened in the debate were it not that my colleague, Deputy Bolger, mentioned that the Gárda were not zealous enough in looking after road trespass.  Now here is a case, the particulars of which I have received from a publican in the town of Carlow, in regard to the zeal of the Gárda.  He says an employee of his as yardman and messenger for the last 12 or 14 years on week-days and Sundays was prosecuted and fined for being found on his premises on a Sunday. He says that on that particular Sunday there was an election meeting held on behalf of Mr. Bolger, T.D., and he let the man off to co-operate with the election party to procure Mr. Bolger's return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before he comes out the Guards come along, find him on the premises, and the result is that he is summoned to the court where he is fined 2/6 and the publican £2.  I think that is overzeal instead of the inactivity that prevailed hitherto.  I would be glad if the <Col N="1223" /> Minister would take that into consideration. Guards who travel too quickly in that way are, I think, a danger to the good government of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That sub-head A be reduced by £85,242 10s. 0d.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am actuated in doing so by more reasons than one.  In the first place, the Minister for Finance under the new procedure of balancing the Budget by taking the difference between the two sides, has allowed for £650,000 to be saved under various sub-heads of the whole.  I do not object to that procedure on the part of the Minister, but I reckon that he has not taken the Dáil into his confidence, by indicating, before <Col N="1224" /> the money is voted, under what sub-heads he will save that amount.  If we vote the Estimate as printed we will be assured at the end of the financial year that there is a deficit of £650,000 which must be found by extra taxation.</P>
    <P>Speaking on behalf of the people I represent, I say that there must not be extra taxation.  When we cannot find where the Minister for Finance means to make a saving we must make provision by reducing the Estimate by the amount he is short in his Budget.  That is one of the reasons why I urge a reduction. I will indicate to the Minister for Justice, not in general terms, but in specific amounts, how there could be a saving.  I do not mean to interfere at all with the Gárda Síochána in Dublin.  Numbers of these men have transferred from the old police force and if interfered with they would resign and there would be no saving.  In addition, the Corporation of Dublin pays a considerable sum for the services of these policemen.  For these reasons these men are entitled to better conditions than men serving in rural areas. My amendment deals only with 5,516 members of the Gárda Síochána in rural areas.  It does not propose to interfere with the Detective Division but with men in sub-stations in the rural districts who, now that we have reached a state of tranquillity and stability, have very little to do beyond the ordinary routine work of a barrack.</P>
    <P>In view of our financial position and the necessity of having no increased taxation next year, and not from any antipathy towards the force, I think we should make the reduction I will indicate. The Minister for Justice spoke about a man leaving the depot getting £3, and said that he was worth it.  It is not £3.  It is £3 10s., as there are boot, clothing and bicycles, rent, fuel and light allowances, as well as free medical attendance.  In fact, each Guard really receives about £3 10s. weekly.  Contrast these figures with the amount paid in 1914, when the policeman received £1; plus allowances, or probably 25/- or 30/- weekly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The man in training in 1914 received 20/- weekly.  A <Col N="1225" /> constable after training at the depot received from 23/- to 31/- weekly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>He received from 23/- to 31/- aften ten years' service.  At first he received 23/-, and after two years got an increase of 1/-; after three years another shilling, and if he got married he was allowed one shilling for rent of a house outside barracks.  When he reached 30/- per week he got a rent allowance of 2/-.  To-day a twenty years old boy, coming out after six months' training, gets £3 per week, an allowance of 1/6 for boots, 1/6 for uniform, 2/- for a bicycle, as well as rent, fuel, light and free medical attendance. I contend that in no other department of Government, and in no business&mdash;not even in the Civil Service &mdash;could a young man earn such emoluments. Even a national school teacher, about which there is so much talk, would not receive that amount.  The national school teacher has six years' preparation.  A boy entering the bank starts at £100 a year and in the railway service with £90 yearly.  There are, according to the Estimates, page 251, 2,377 postmen working for 6d. an hour.  There are 1,326 earning from 18/- to 41/- in a service that does not pay its way.  There are 266 postmen earning from 16/- to 49/-, with an efficiency bar at 40/-.  Contrast that particular service with the service that is now under discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to contrast the position of the man with £3 leaving the depot and that of the man with 16/-, plus 90 per cent. bonus.  That is the comparison.  There is an increase of £57,000 in this Estimate this year, and my amendment will mean that there will be an efficiency bar for two years in this young force, the cost of which is abnormal because it is a new force. You have officers, very good men, I believe, <Col N="1226" /> after four years' service in a position that they would not otherwise attain in twenty years.</P>
      <P>It is unreasonable that young men like those, gaining positions which they never expected to reach, with the emoluments which those positions entitle them to, and not accustomed to the luxury which such a high salary provides them with, should not have a bar put to their increases for a couple of years in the interests of the force. It is in that way that I mean to effect the reductions.</P>
      <P>There are twenty District Superintendents at a salary of £650-£25-£725, plus £120 motor allowance, plus house and uniform.  I am not saying anything against these men, but in an ordinary country they would not have reached that position until they would be 40 years of age, with the experience of life which that would bring them.  I say it is against the interests of the force that these men should be brought to the maximum of their scale in such a short time, and I suggest that there should be a bar put for a couple of years to their increases.  For that reason, I suggest that twenty District Superintendents should be reduced by a sum of £100 each.  That would give you a round sum of £2,000.  That, in effect, will mean that they will not get the £25 now that is on these Estimates for them.  It will only throw them back four years and it will do something towards making them worthy to receive the salary of £800 eventually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 106 Superintendents who rank with the old District Inspectors. The District Inspector, in the olden times, was on sergeant's pay when he went into the depot.  He came out of the depot at £130 a year, which eventually increased to £250, and he was allowed £50 for a house and £50 for a horse.  Our Superintendent gets £310-£10-£350 - £400-£20-£500-£520-£20-£585, plus house, uniform, travelling allowance, medical attendance and motor car.  The motor car allowance is £120, as against £50 in olden times for a horse.  I believe there are less officers now than there were in olden days, and, considering that the motor allowance is more than twice as much the allowance given for a horse, it <Col N="1227" /> should be possible to do with fewer officers.  But I do not put forward that suggestion.  What I suggest is that the efficiency bar should be applied, that they should get no increase this year, and, in fact, that the salary be put back £50 in the case of Superintendents. That would give you £5,300.</P>
    <P>There are 27 Inspectors who rank with the old head-constables, who received £2 a week.  These men are getting £280-£10-£320, plus all the allowances. They could afford to lose £40 a year.  That would be £1,080.  There are 1,099 Sergeants.  A reduction of 7/6 per week would give you £21,430. There are 4,264 Guards, and a reduction of 5/- per week would give you £55,432, making the gross total what is shown in my amendment.</P>
    <P>This is not, in fact, cutting their wage.  This 5/- in the case of Guards means merely, preventing them getting an increase this year of the 2/6 or 2/- they would be entitled to, plus a year thrown back on account of the newness of the force.  I maintain that that is a fair and reasonable suggestion.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that I did not agree with all that was said about economy in the newspapers.  I pointed out the difficulties there were in finding any Vote on which a reduction could be made.  But there must be a saving of £600,000 this year, and there are only certain services on which that saving can be effected.  This is one of the services where a saving can be effected, and it is up to us, who talk about reducing taxation, to show how it can be effected.  I agree with the Minister for Justice that a good man is worth £3 per week.  But a good man who has done only six months' training could very well wait a couple of years before getting his £3 a week, and he should not be getting automatic increases as at present.  The financial circumstances of the time necessitate a reduction of expenditure, and I think this amendment is one which the House ought to support.  The Minister for Justice will not agree.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance, if that was not the case, should have indicated to us, before we voted this money, how the £650,000 is made up.  We would then be in a better position to decide.  I think that until that method is adopted it is our duty to refuse to vote these Estimates. I have made a reasonable case and I ask the Dáil to agree with me in this amendment.  Men employed on the railways are working twenty years before they get the same salary as a man leaving the depot.  In the Post Office, men are started at a much lower basic scale than they are in the Gárda Síochána.  And that, notwithstanding the fact that in the Gárda, of every four men who enter, one can become a sergeant, and of every twenty-five who enter, one can become a high officer. There is no service I know where such an opportunity is given.  There is no such thing as nomination as in the old system.  All the officers come from the ranks.  In a service like that, men ought to be willing to enter at a lower rate.  Take the case of a young man entering the service of a bank.  He will have spent two or three years at a secondary school.  That means that he is living for that time at the expense of his parents, and after ten years a boy in the bank would only have the same pay as a six months' recruit coming <Col N="1229" /> out of the Depôt at Phoenix Park. The same thing applies to railway employees and in business outside the city of Dublin.  I contend that I have made a reasonable and definite case to the Minister for Justice for the amendment.</P>

Deputy Wilson is a sound economist on behalf of the Farmers' Party, and I am surprised at him putting forward an amendment of this nature.  One big thing we have to consider is whether we are to have a respectable police force, decently and properly paid, or whether we are to have a police force miserably paid and open to corruption.</P>

      <P>The nation has expended a very large amount of money in creating the new police force, a force which in a short time has become a highly efficient and a highly organised one, and I think the nation owes a deep debt of gratitude to the Commissioner and Deputy-Commissioners who have given us this force in such a short time.  The police to-day have to perform ordinary police duties, as we knew them performed by the R.I.C. under normal conditions in pre-war days.  These duties, it must be conceded, have very largely increased because of the degeneracy and the demoralisation that set in as the result of war conditions in this country, so that the ordinary duties in pre-war times bear very little comparison with those of to-day.  The young police force of to-day has much more responsible duties to perform than the R.I.C. had under normal conditions.  In addition to these duties many others are cast on them.  The Minister has told us that <Col N="1230" /> they have now to take the agricultural census and the population census; they have to guard our fisheries, they have new duties under the School Attendance Bill, and they have many other important duties which I cannot enumerate at the moment.  For all this a man is paid £3 a week, and he is expected to give the State a decent and honest return for the money he gets. We have no complaints that he does not, and still we are asked to reduce that pay considerably.  What would the net result of that be?  People who come from other countries will tell you of the corruption that exists amongst the police forces in those countries.  Are we to set out here on Deputy Wilson's amendment to introduce corruption amongst our police?  How can you possibly ask a man to work as an honest policeman at 30/- a week?</P>

If Deputies do not agree with Deputy Hennessy, there is perfect freedom of debate.  Perhaps Deputies will remember that our main purpose here is debate, and the reaching of decisions after proper debate.  The essence of debate is that we must listen to other people expressing views with which we do not agree&mdash;views with which we sometimes violently disagree. When you have a Minister saying: &ldquo;Does the Deputy contend so and so?&rdquo; there is no necessity whatever for the Deputy to answer, and when a Deputy says: &ldquo;Surely the Minister for Finance <Col N="1231" /> does not think so and so?&rdquo; the Minister for Finance should possess his soul in patience and reply at leisure.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Farmer Deputies, or any others, can charge me with taking up too much of the time of the House in debate.  I always like to leave as much time as I possibly can to them, and even though I disagree with them on many points that they put forward I never interrupt them.  I think, therefore, that when other Deputies rise the Farmer Deputies should, as you, sir, have suggested, listen patiently and afterwards speak against the points put forward.  I was on the point, when interrupted, that members of the police force here are human beings, exactly like the police in all other countries, and, I have no doubt, are as open to corruption as the police forces in America, France, or Great Britain.  I do not suppose that they carry angels' wings under their tunics.  I maintain that we should keep our police force in the same state of efficiency and good organisation as they are in to-day.  I think it is in cumbent on the Minister to improve it rather than to allow it to go back to a less organised and less efficient state. You cannot possibly do that by reducing the men's pay from £3 to £2 or some other figure that Deputy Wilson suggests.  Is it not a fact that to-day, even with this £3, there is an exodus of these men to the United States, where they can earn larger money?  I understand that there is a very big percentage of resignations.  The men who came in for the last two years are picked men.  Whom are we to get instead? A very inferior type.  I think <Col N="1232" /> more money should be spent in the organisation of the force, on the detective branch of the force, in training men to look after food and drugs and weights and measures.  Some money has been saved, I believe, on these particular branches of the Department for the last two years, and you know the result.  We have one weights and measures man doing the work for a whole county. How can you expect that one man would do the work of the whole County Cork, for instance, and do it well&mdash;look after the whole weights and measures and food and drugs work of the whole county?  He could not possibly do it, and the community is suffering because of light weights, perhaps, and because of poor food.  I maintain that a larger amount of money should be spent on this particular branch.</P>

The reduction of £50 in the pay of Superintendents would amount to £5,300.  I have here a note that the proposed reduction in the pay of Chief <Col N="1233" /> Superintendents is equivalent to four increments, and similarly in the case of Superintendents.  Does the Deputy mean that £100 should be taken off the pay of these 20 Chief Superintendents or does he mean a four years' halt?</P>

I maintain that if you lower that wage much below the present rate you will drive the best men out of the force, men you have already trained, and you leave young married men charged with these onerous duties open to corruption.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Desborough scale came into force in 1920.  Since then, I think I am right in saying, there has been no change except here. We are about 15 per cent. below the scale of pay obtaining in Great Britain and Northern Ireland&mdash;something between 14 and 15 per cent.  I think it is <Col N="1234" /> nearer to 15 per cent.  I can give the Deputy a table showing the rates of pay prevailing in 1920 in the R.I.C., and, perhaps, if he is interested he might note it down, and to be just to Deputy Gorey's point of view I think I will give also the 1914 rates.  The Inspector-General in 1914 had a scale of salary from £1,500 to £1,800.  In 1920 that changed from £1,800 to £2,200.  The Commissioner to-day, who is the corresponding officer, has £1,300. The Deputy Inspector-General had in 1914 from £1,000 to £1,200, and in 1920 that became £1,300 to £1,500. The Deputy Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána has £1,000.  The Assistant Inspector-General had in 1914 £700 to £800, which became in 1920, £1,000 to £1,200.  The Assistant Commissioner has £900.  Then you had two officers whose functions are performed by our Chief Superintendents. You had the Commandant and the Barrack Master.  The Commandant's pay in 1914 was £600, and the Barrack Master's was £400.  Those became in 1920, £1,000 and £700.  As I say, their functions are now performed by Chief Superintendents, whose pay is from £650 to £800.  The Surgeon of the R.I.C. in 1914 received £400; in 1920 he received £700.  Our surgeon is paid £700.  County Inspectors, who correspond to our Chief Superintendents, received in 1914 pay on the scale of £350 to £450.  Under the Desborough scale that became £700 to £900.  We are £650 to £800.  D.I.'s received in 1914, £135 to £300, and the 1920 rate was £360 to £650.  Our Superintendents, which is the corresponding rank, £310-£585.  Head-constables, 1914, £2 2s. to £2 6s. per week; rate in 1920, £310-£355; inspectors to-day, which is the corresponding rank, £280-300. Sergeants, in 1914, 35/- to 37/- per week, became in 1920, 100/- to 112/6 per week; our sergeants, 87/- to 98/6 per week.  A constable, after training in 1914, 23/- to 31/- per week, rate in 1920, 70/- to 95/- per week.  Guards, after training, 60/- to 83/- per week. Recruits, in training in 1914, 20/- per week; in 1920, 70/- per week, and in 1926, 50/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our percentage cut on the 1920 rates is, in the case of the Commissioner, <Col N="1235" /> 35 per cent.; in the case of the Deputy Commissioner, 28 per cent.; the Assistant Commissioner, 18 per cent.; Chief Superintendent, 9 per cent.; Superintendent, 11 per cent.; Inspector, 12 per cent.; Sergeant, 13 per cent.; Guard, on completion of training, 13 per cent.; Guard in training&mdash;a recruit&mdash;28 per cent.</P>

      <P>I have not that worked out, but these percentages represent the difference in the pay of the Gárda Síochána to-day and the corresponding ranks in Britain and Northern Ireland.  I just put it to Deputies that things being as they are, and having no brass wall around your country, that is a factor: what the men who do substantially similar work, and who hold corresponding rank in your neighbour police forces, are in receipt of.  We are lower, quite considerably lower, than the neighbour police forces, and I do not think it would be wise for Deputies to attempt a greater discrepancy than that.  I think you have got to have a police force, that is a substantially contented force, feeling that they are well off, perhaps better off, than the same kind of men as themselves who are not in the force.  You cannot bring that particular position down to the rank of outside positions. You have to have a man in the frame of mind thinking that he was lucky to get in and would be unlucky to get out, and further, you have to get the pick of the young men of your country for this particular work.  If you do not you will have a bad police force.  We went out for that from the start; we took the point of view that this was highly important work for the future of the country, and that we should be able to get the pick of the young men of the country.  The greatest possible sifting and rejecting went on in the building up of this force.  The standard was extremely high and the competition <Col N="1236" /> extremely keen, and I think it is necessary not to have in your police force the frame of mind that thinks in this way: &ldquo;Well, I can go out in the morning and do as well outside.  Why should I put up with this severity and discipline, why should I put up with this constant humdrum routine, and have this feeling that I am never off duty and have to be on the mark all the time and so on.&rdquo;  If you bring it down on a parity with the positions which the same kind of men are able to get in civil life, then I do not think you will have a good police force.  It is economy to pass Deputy Wilson's amendment, but is it the right kind of economy, is it true economy, and is it going to result in a real saving?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. You will not get as good men for your Guards, you will not get as good men for your officers.  We are fortunate in our higher officers, in the chief superintendents and superintendents.  I have met every one of them.  Last year, when I went around the country with General O'Duffy, we interviewed personally every officer in the Gardá Síochána.  The feeling I had at the end of that round of inspection was that the country was extremely fortunate in the type of men that had been secured for these positions.  I would not like to see any worse type handling the very responsible work they have to do.  It is all right for Deputy Wilson to say that they are young men, and that in another kind of situation they might be forty or forty-five years of age before they would attain the same rank.  The same might be said in many spheres. They have attained that rank, and they are doing the work to the complete satisfaction of their senior officers, and I think, although we are a country not easily satisfied, to the substantial satisfaction of the citizens of the country.  That fact cannot be blinked, and their age must not be reared up against the men as if it were a stigma or a crime, if they are doing the highly responsible work which fate, if you like, has allotted to them well and satisfactorily, and I believe they <Col N="1237" /> are.  The difference between 1922 and 1926 did not come about by chance, and it is, as Deputies will agree, an amazing difference, a difference which, in 1922 or 1923, few men would have been so bold as to prophesy, and yet it is there.  It is there, because all through the country efficient, active, and energetic men were labouring to bring it about.  No doubt it is there also because, as passions died down, you had a return to sanity and to an orderly outlook on the part of the great mass of the citizens, and a growing public opinion against lawlessness and against anarchic tendencies, but it is there, too, because active, efficient, and alert young men faced their responsibilities and laboured to bring it about.  It has been brought about, and I dissent from the point of view that now, just when Deputy Wilson is able to say with complacency and equanimity that there is what he calls a normal situation in the country&mdash;that the moment you have attained that the thing to do is to turn round and cut the pay of your police, which, as Deputies know, has already been cut within the lifetime of the present Government, and reduce the figure substantially below that of the neighbour police forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies think and suggest that if we could begin all over again we would get wonderful results for a much lesser sum.  I doubt it very much.  The good thing is worth paying for, and you seldom get it without paying for it. Let us get back to 1922 and assume a country without a police force.  Let us take the idealistic conceptions of Deputy Heffernan, partly shared by Deputy Johnson with a kind of philosophic doubt as to whether the present system is after all the right thing. What would the people do thrown like that on their own resources?  They would proceed to try and build up in their own way a police force, they would proceed to try and get active, efficient, and responsible young men to take on the task of preserving order in their own areas.  They would get it after awhile and after a great many disappointments and disillusionments in the young men.  They would find that in numbers and in pay, and in <Col N="1238" /> every other matter, it came to much the same thing, if not more, and they would have this disadvantage which Deputy Cooper put his finger on, that your men would be functioning in their own areas with all the drawbacks and the difficulties which that involves, subject to local ties, local pressure, and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Well you can unduly localise it.  Deputies, and Deputy Baxter in particular, spoke and it made an impression on me, about the outlook of citizens towards the police, that people were not inclined to put their back into keeping order or into moulding public opinion in favour of order because someone else was there to do it.  But these Guards are just the kind of men that the people, left to themselves in the way which Deputy Johnson envisaged, would select to do the work.  Sooner or later after a period of disorder people would find it necessary to have someone paid ad hoc and assigned ad hoc to the work of the preservation of order and the detection and prevention of crime.  To do that they would find it necessary to pay them, and they would pay them with all the disadvantage of functioning in their own areas.  That arrangement would work out, I suggest, much less efficiently, and I feel it in my bones, also, that it would work out much less economically than the present system.  Is anyone prepared to take a given division, I do not care where you take it, in Louth, Meath, Carlow, Kildare or anywhere else, and take the strength of the Gárdaí&mdash;officers and men&mdash;functioning within that area and say that the people left by themselves, without the interference of the State as such, and the Government as such, would throw up a police force of smaller numbers and smaller pay who would do the work of preserving order and maintaining the security of person and property over that area more cheaply and efficiently than it is being done by the centrally governed police force?  It does come down to that, taking a given division, and assuming that division to be thrown on its own <Col N="1239" /> resources, would there emerge from that situation a local force that would do the work as efficiently and more economically than, if you put it that way, the quota of that division's contribution to the cost of the central force.  That is really the thing that would be at stake, and we have our own very definite view on that.  I think the local force would be less efficient and quite as costly as the contribution of that area towards the central force.</P>

      <P>If I thought it was I would be here proposing it myself, just as we came to the Dáil and proposed the cut which has already been made.  The Minister for Finance with my full concurrence came here to propose that cut when we thought it right and advisable.  I do not think this proposed additional cut is wise.  I do not think it is true economy.  Perhaps the most important thing in the country at its present phase of development is that the police should be contented and feel that they are well off in comparison with the same kind of men in civil life as themselves.  Talking about a bank clerk is not really relevant, nor is the statement that the bank clerk accepts less than the Guard after training receives to-day.  He does, and no doubt in accepting it he adverts to such consideration as the social standing he takes and is able to maintain with that position.  That is a consideration to him.</P>

      <P>You might tell him, with truth, that if he were a seavenger under the Dublin Corporation he would be getting more. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I do not want to be a scavenger under the Dublin Corporation. I will take this smaller sum and maintain the social standing and prestige which I can maintain in the employment of the bank.&rdquo;  There are all kinds of inequality like that.  If, instead of doing long tots in the bank, he were delivering milk for a Dublin milk dealer he would be receiving 65/- a week, and if he were milking cows for a Dublin milk dealer he would be receiving 80/- a week, but he does not feel that it is his vocation to deliver milk or to milk cows, and he does the long tots in the bank, because that fits in with his conception of his own social standing and prestige.  You need not be delving around for contrasts.  You will find many contrasts and inequality of pay for different kinds of work.  You need not line up to it on that point of view.</P>
      <P>If Deputies think the present pay of the police ought to be reduced there is Deputy Wilson's proposal, a very moderate proposal if the Deputies think a reduction advisable.  If they think it is advisable, it is not an extreme proposal, but I could not recommend a further reduction.  I think the discrepancy that exists between our rates and the rates of pay in our neighbouring forces is just about as much as you can afford without risking discontent, discontent that will react on the efficiency, alertness and general morale of your forces, which ought not to be lightly jeopardised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a very reasonable case and he has talked in reasonable language, but I cannot accept the position that he puts up.  When he compares the salaries of our forces with the salaries of neighbouring forces he ought to give us a little more information.  We ought, for instance, be told how much per head policing costs in Great Britain and what it costs here.  I make the assertion that the cost of policing per head <Col N="1241" /> of the population here is five or six times what it costs in Great Britain. I do not know the exact figures.  I suppose those in a position to give the exact figures can give them, and I speak under correction.</P>
      <P>Comparison has been made in relation to the Gárda Síochána and the old R.I.C.  It has been said that the Gárda Síochána have to-day more difficult duties to perform; the times are different.  I say that is not so.  I make the assertion here, and I challenge anybody to contradict me, that the Gárda Síochána, are better received in the country, have the co-operation of the people and are doing, except in a few areas, much more effective work than the R.I.C. ever did.  They are better received by the people and are more in touch with the people.  It is easier for them to do their duty than it was for the R.I.C. in their day.</P>
      <P>It has been stated by some Deputies that if the pay of the Gárda is reduced according to the terms of Deputy Wilson's amendment they would be open to corruption.  I am not as sensitive on that matter as some Deputies.  My experience may not be as unfortunate as the experience of some Deputies with regard to temptations.  I do not know what the experience of Deputies has been in regard to temptation.  When we examine the question what do we find?</P>
      <P>I want to deal not with the high ranks but with the low ranks of the Gárdaí.  At present the Gárdaí are in receipt of £966,000 odd.  If you take the present strength of the Gárdaí at £3 a week per man you get a sum of £847,650 odd.  I maintain that even with the cut Deputy Wilson suggests the Gárdaí will still be receiving over £3 a week, plus allowances.  The Gárdaí have already had a certain amount of service and they will be substantially well over the figure of £3 a week, plus allowances, even if we accept the cut that Deputy Wilson suggests.  I wonder will that convince some Deputies that corruption ought not to enter into the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the Gárdaí should feel they are better off than the rest of the community; to do good work they should have a feeling of contentment.  I maintain that they <Col N="1242" /> have a feeling of contentment and will have that feeling even with more drastic cuts than the cut suggested by Deputy Wilson.  I know something about the Gárdaí and recruitment for the Gárdaí in the country.  I know there are numbers of young men of good education and position who are continually requesting Deputies and others to use their influence to try and get them into the Gárdaí.  They are the pick of the country, as the Minister describes them.  There are any amount of fine young men available; they are only waiting to find out when and how they can get into the Force.  There was a question raised about resignations from the Gárdaí and it was stated they are going to America.  I want to know from the Minister if that is so what are the causes?</P>

      <P>There are, perhaps, other reasons.  Possibly these people who resign and go away find it is the best way to get out; they find the best method is to resign from the Force and clear out of the country.  It is not because of low pay or anything of that description that they resign; it is for other reasons that are, perhaps, better not explained.  It is probably because some of them find matters too hot for them here.</P>
      <P>We have been asked whether we want a respectable police force or a corrupt police force as they have in other countries.  Well, we will make the choice and say that we want a respectable force.  But we do not contend for a moment, nor will we allow anybody to suggest&mdash;of course they will suggest it but we will not accept it&mdash;that this cut is going to corrupt them.

      <P>They are going to live on air with a nice mixture of £3, plus allowances, in their pockets.  We are told that the Gárda Síochána have more duty to do than had the R.I.C.  I say that the Gárda have less to do than the R.I.C.  The R.I.C. had very disagreeable duties to perform during the land war.  Perhaps Deputy Hennessy remembers it.  It is all an illusion and I do not think anybody means it; even the Minister does not, I think, mean it, when he suggests that the Gárda will not be as contented, as efficient and as clean if this suggested reduction takes place in their pay as they would be had the purchasing power of money remained as it was in 1923.  The purchasing power of money is much better to-day than in 1923.  I submit that £3 to-day is worth more than £3 10s. when the Gárda were appointed.  Money is likely to be still more valuable.</P>
      <P>No hostile suggestion is made in any way on our part.  We do know the capacity of the country to pay is not as good as it was when this force was established.  Even the police force must cast in its lot with the rest of the community.  We are not making wild demands or suggestions; we are just asking the police, as we will ask every other service, to cast their lot in with the people and bear their share of the common depression.  I have been in these Benches since the Estimates began to be discussed and I was expecting to hear from the disciples of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; and the disciples of other newspapers here what they had to suggest in the way of economies.  I have been disappointed.  Their favourite disciples, whom they have been always lauding to the skies, have suggested nothing so far in the way of economies. I hope they will waken out of their lethargy and do something to show they deserve the support and the clap on the back that they have been constantly receiving from the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; and &ldquo;Independent.&rdquo;</P>

I want to enter a slight correction both to Deputy Wilson and to the Minister for Justice.  Deputy Wilson assumed that the wages of the R.I.C. before 1920 were perfectly satisfactory to the R.I.C.  The Minister for Justice told us that the wages of the R.I.C. were increased as a result of measures taken in Great Britain and not as a result of any particular demand here.  They are both wrong.  I was at that time in very close touch with the circumstances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that, and the Minister was unconsciously wrong.  There were special circumstances here.  I was then in close touch with the then Inspector-General of the R.I.C.  He was a fellow-county man of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who reminds me very much of him in many ways.  The only difference is that he was removed from his position because he would not agree to the policy of frightfulness that was then about to be put into operation.  I am not quite sure about that as regards the Minister.  There was a time in 1919 when there was grave discontent in the R.I.C. on account of the inadequacy of their pay.</P>

      <P>It was before the risks had become serious.  That was before it had become acute; that was before the shooting of District Inspector Hunt, and that was one of the earliest incidents.  The risk then was not serious.  The trouble was economic. There was apprehension at the time that there was going to be either a mutiny or a strike on the part of the R.I.C.  These special circumstances existed.  The British Government, like all Governments, tried to save their faces, and as there was a committee then sitting to inquire into the terms of the British Police Force, they included the R.I.C. in their terms of reference and the R.I.C. got a very substantial increase.  It is not correct to say that the R.I.C. were contented with what they were getting in 1919.</P>

Deputy Wilson made a good case and a strong case, and I think while it is very desirable that we should pay policemen adequately, they should be beyond the reach of suspicion.  I think Deputy Wilson made some case for a revision of salaries in future but you cannot do anything that would affect men now in the service.</P>

      <P>, No, I do not think that is fair dealing and is likely to provoke some discontent and possibly the danger of mutiny.  But I do say <Col N="1246" /> that as regards the recruits, the new entrants into the Gárda, the Minister should take into account the fact that there is a great demand on the part of the best youth of the country to enter the force.  I know that at present every Deputy is being besought to use his influence to get candidates accepted for the Gárda, and on economic grounds alone I suggest that the Minister might consider a revision in the future scales of salary.  I think, however, that Deputy Wilson's amendment would be too drastic.  But the principle of it is a sound principle, and a principle that the Minister might well take to heart.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in this discussion, more particularly because of the arguments adduced by the Minister in his last speech.  I think his arguments were convincing.  I think the case made by Deputy Wilson is not sufficient to justify us in supporting his amendment.  I think it is quite in order and germane to ask the Minister why he should take this particular view of this problem, and detach it from his view of similar proposals in other relations? Some little time ago, referring to the question of pay of certain classes of people in the country, he said: &ldquo;I do not stand for 32/- a week as an ideal wage.  But it must be remembered that Ireland is a poor country and farming is its present basic industry.  At present the farmer, who is the food producer, and his agricultural labourer are down at bedrock, fighting for their lives, one working at 25/- a week and the other not clearing his overhead expenses.  Yet they are the only producers of wealth in the country.  The country's economic position is unsound because of the position of the farmer.  For that reason the Government are not justified in indulging in schemes that are not economic or reproductive.&rdquo;  He was supported in that view by the President. &ldquo;A certain wage has got to be fixed,&rdquo; the President said.  &ldquo;Is it to be fixed for the same class from which both parties come?  I presume that would be admitted.  From what class of labour are the Gárda drawn?  Very largely from the agricultural labourer.&rdquo;&ldquo;It is a case of the normal working of <Col N="1247" /> supply and demand,&rdquo; the President said.  Is this to be a case of the normal working of supply and demand?  Apparently not.  The Minister is right now but he was wrong then.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce also had something quite apposite to say when he said in respect of the other problem but not of this: &ldquo;I am not going to allow two thousand sheltered workers with certain specified requisites to get a bigger wage than the ordinary two hundred and twelve thousand farm labourers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

He now refuses to apply the same standard to the other class of workers on certain grounds which he outlined here to-day.

      <P>Following on Deputy <Col N="1248" /> Gorey's remarks, I feel that it is necessary for me to make a few comments on this matter and to explain the position in which I find myself with regard to Deputy Wilson's amendment.  I have never maintained in the matter of economy more than that the whole situation should be carefully examined in the light of any savings that could be properly made.  In that respect I regret that the first vote that should come up is the Gárda Síochána, because, I think, as regards any criticism I may make on Government expenditure, this is perhaps the vote which I, representing the commercial community, least wish to criticise adversely as regards either the pay or the standing of the force.  I think the Minister gave a very clear exposition of his views with regard to this force.  I should like to say that as a champion of the force he stands pre-eminent, and I think he is defending a force which the public and more especially the part of it which I am supposed to represent, will appreciate in connection with the services and organisation that has been built up during a time of great stress and trial.  In criticising this vote I am handicapped by the fact that I think we must recognise that the services rendered to the country by the organisation is very creditable to all concerned. As far as I am concerned I have to accept the Minister's statement that at present the country is not prepared to take on themselves and off the shoulders of the Gárdaí a sufficient amount of the civic duties that would permit of the reduction of the force at present.  When I say at the present time I should like to say that I hope, and I think everyone will hope, that the steady progress, in the direction that has been indicated here, must, of necessity, in the course of time, make the Gárdaí force of to-day excessive in number for the requirements of the community they are supposed to keep in order.  Therefore, while I say for the present time I qualify that by saying that I think the force as it stands to-day should be a maximum and descend gradually in numbers as opportunity offers.</P>

I maintain in the present situation that the Minister has laid down a fair case, and I think it is not controverted by the fact, as Deputy Gorey points out, that there is a great rush of candidates for the position of Gárda.  One could appreciate that if such was the case.  Anyone who has anything to do with employment, in any direction, is in exactly the same position of being overwhelmed by applications for positions.  If we were to give appointments to all those I think we would have to consider the payment of a very much wider circle than is represented by the Gárda.  I say with full responsibility that there is a definite, decisive demand for reduction of expenditure on the part of the Government.  I think I may venture the opinion that we should contemplate it in that direction and take up this matter of the paying of those forces.  I take the responsibility of saying that I cannot support Deputy Wilson's amendment, notwithstanding the fact that I represent, as far as I can, the fairly generally held opinion that the expenditure of the Government on administrative services is excessive.</P>

I believe there is, and it is because of that that I feel it is a demand which is justified and backed up by Deputies.  We on those benches are facing an unpleasant duty when <Col N="1250" /> clearing up those Estimates and working under great difficulties owing to the fact that we have not full information at our disposal.  We are attempting with our limited resources to see whether representations can be brought about.  We attempted to deal with this Vote in another manner in the beginning. We attempted to deal with the system of policing in this country. That has been dealt with.  I am not yet convinced that there are not considerable possibilities of reduction in the expenses of the police force owing to a changed outlook on the part of the Minister and on the part of the citizens.  I recognise the fact that such a change must be gradual and slow, but I think that is the direction in which we ought to work.  We are as I said already, simply imitating and perpetuating the old system of police, and if that is all we can do, what is the use of getting our own Government at all?</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson puts down a very moderate and reasonable amendment and that is met by a very strong argument to show that it is inadvisable to carry out Deputy Wilson's suggestion in regard to the reduction. I believe the Minister's arguments are not sound because I maintain that all matters of this kind have to be relative and that we have to take into account the actual reductions we are proposing.  If Deputy Wilson had proposed an amendment reducing the pay of a Guard to thirty shillings a week, such a reduction would have sent the good man out of the force and attracted only a very inferior and unsuitable type of recruit.  I am sure that with the reduction of five shillings per week in the Guards we would still secure the quality of the men we will get.  I can tell, from my own experience, that we Deputies are visited from time to time by excellent young men of good physique and good character who are anxious to get into the Gárdaí, and I believe if those men knew that the pay they were offered when they entered the Guards would be £2 per week they <Col N="1251" /> would still come forward.  It is all very well to talk of £3 per week as if it were rather small pay in this country.  It is not.  The Ministers and Deputies know what an extremely difficult thing it is for a young man to get into a position when he comes out of school and how difficult it is to get a position of £3 a week.  It is all very well to talk of social advantages which young men get who go into the banks.  I believe the day of social advantages has gone, and if Guards continue to get their present pay they will be regarded as the social equals, if not the social superiors, of the men in the banks.  Nowadays your social status is judged by your salary per annum or your profits per year.  The Minister gave us figures with regard to the rates of pay existing in 1914, 1920, and the present rates of pay in the Civic Guards.  He gave us some percentages of the decrease in the rates of pay at present in existence in the Civic Guards, and the rates of pay fixed in 1920, but he did not give us the percentages of increase in regard to the pay of the police in 1914 compared with that of the Guards at present.  A constable in 1914 started with 23/-.  A Guard starts with 60/-. That is an increase of 261 per cent.  A recruit started with 20/- in 1914.  Now he has 50/-, which is an increase of 250 per cent.  I maintain that the R.I.C. in 1914 found no difficulty whatever in getting suitable recruits and, in spite of that, we still see fit to offer an increased pay of 260 per cent. notwithstanding the fact that the cost of living has only gone up ninety per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an increase of one hundred and fifty per cent.  Where it was 100 it is now 250. Other things have to be taken into account in regard to the Gárda, such as the youthfulness of the whole force and the shortness of its existence. After all, if you compare, as Deputy Wilson pointed out, the position of a Chief Superintendent appointed, say, three years ago, at a salary of £650 <Col N="1252" /> with that of a County Inspector who had a salary of from £350 to £450 in 1914, you must take into account the fact that the latter class of men spent years of strenuous work, passed many tests and examinations, and stood the test of time before they reached their rank, whereas our Chief Superintendents, acknowledging that they are men of capacity, and that we have no complaint about them, are men who have risen, perhaps, from minor posts, or come from the university or college straight into this salary.  That aspect must not be overlooked.  You can take the same thing, from a superintendent down to a sergeant, and you have, at the present, outside the Dublin Metropolitan area, over a thousand sergeants. As the Minister knows, those men would have taken probably fifteen years' service as constables, sometimes twenty, before they reached that rank in the old days, whereas our present men stepped straight into their stripes. The Minister deals with the percentage reduction of the force by 20.9 per cent. since 1914.  I think the Minister omitted to say that up to the taking over of the system by the present Government and up to the time of the Treaty, the city of Belfast was policed by the old R.I.C.</P>

      <P>In 1914 there were 7,859 R.I.C. in the twenty-six counties and 1,276 D.M.P.  The total was 9,135.  The present authorised strength of the Gárda is 7,222, the exact difference being 1,913.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Another thing which must be taken into account in regard to the cost of the police is the extreme burden which the country has to bear because of the police who have left the country.  In pensions to the R.I.C., combined with the pay to the Guards, which will increase from year to year, taxpayers are actually paying out of their pockets approximately three and a half millions at present.  I think it is up to this Government to do everything it can to maintain law and order at the least possible expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vital thing to be taken into account in connection with the examination of the Estimates is the capacity of the country to pay, and the resources <Col N="1253" /> of the people to pay.  When comparison is made with the pay of the police in England the resources of the two countries ought also to be compared.  Ministers themselves have proved several times that we have not in this country the resources which Great Britain has. One of the great difficulties in connection with the whole of our services is that slavish imitation of the rates prevailing in Great Britain for work of a similar kind.</P>

With regard to Northern Ireland, when the Minister of Finance there is in difficulties about his special constabulary and finds that the expenses are more than they can bear, he goes across to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, makes a deal with him and comes back with something satisfactory for his Government. I am sure the Minister for Justice does not believe that he can rely on the English Chancellor of the Exchequer when he is in a fix.  We have to shoulder our own burden and face our own financial liabilities, and in view of the fact that there is, as Deputy Hewat says, a definite, precise demand for a reduction in expenditure by the people of the Saorstát, I believe that the Minister ought to accept this very reasonable amendment which Deputy Wilson has fully justified.</P>

      <P>I wish to say a word on the general principle involved, as the details of the question have been well debated.  As regards salaries, wages, pensions and general taxation, I think the question for this House and the country to consider is what the country is able to bear and able to pay. We of the Farmers' Party have a fair idea of how things are in the rural areas. We know that the ratepayers and taxpayers are finding it very hard to meet their liabilities.  I think I would be safe in saying that 75 per cent. of the ordinary ratepaying and taxpaying community are hardly able to meet their liabilities, and a great portion of that 75 per cent. are not able to meet their liabilities.  As I said, it is a question <Col N="1254" /> of what the country is able to bear and what the people are able to pay, and I maintain that the country is taxed to an extent that it is not able to bear and which it will go down under very shortly if something is not done to lighten it.  I wish to draw the attention of the House to a case brought under my notice last week when a rate collector in my district was going about in pursuance of his duties.</P>

We must begin somewhere, and the move that has been made by the Farmers' Party for a reduction in the pay of the Gárda Síochána is a step in the right direction.  I hope before the Estimates are finished that we shall introduce amendments to have reductions made in other departments and that we will succeed in having those reductions made.</P>

I should like to have a statement from the Minister as to whether that aspect of the organisation of the Gárda Síochána is being given consideration to or whether it is worth any consideration from him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The points of view that the Deputy gives expression to are nearly always worthy of consideration. This particular point of view is no exception.  I did not deal with the <Col N="1255" /> matter, and that perhaps was an omission on my part.  The position really is that you have at headquarters the Commissioner and competent experienced police officers in various capacities, and there is a point of view there as to the requirements.  The Commissioner of course works down through his hierarchy, through his chief superintendents and so on, and the chief superintendents at fixed intervals come to the Depot for conferences. There are discussions there with the Commissioner, the Assistant Commissioner, and the Deputy Commissioner. These conferences, I think, take place once a month, and the point of view of the senior officers is communicated in that way to the chief superintendents, through them to the district officers, and through them down to the inspectors and sergeants.  In that way contact is maintained, and so far as possible, in a force of the kind, something like uniformity in outlook and standards is also maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not much sympathy with the point of view that there should be picking and choosing, so to speak, and with the point of view that &ldquo;irritating pin-pricks and so on should be avoided,&rdquo; because that becomes a question of every man applying his own standard as to what is trifling, and as to what is irritating.  It would be better that the police should have the feeling that the Dáil has approved and adopted the body of law that at present exists in the country, and that if at any time the Dáil consider that a particular law should be amended or repealed the Dáil will attend to it.  But while the law is there it is for the Gárda to enforce it.  We had an example of the condition of feeling in regard to these matters here this afternoon. Deputy Conlan referred, in a contemptuous way, to prosecutions for road trespass, and, after a few minutes, another Deputy was emphasising the seriousness of that very offence.  So that each man will have his different point of view.  To one man the poor man having his cow on the roadside to get a mouthful of grass is a small matter, but to the fellow who breaks his neck coming round the corner in a <Col N="1256" /> motor car after colliding with the cow it is a big matter.</P>
    <P>It is all a question of angles.  The only safe angle for the police is that the Dáil will attend to the matter of what kind of laws ought to be in existence, and it is their job to enforce them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving this amendment, I was under the impression that the Minister would, at least, have accepted the alternative proposition that this is not the time when normal allowances and increases for these men should be allowed.  If he had met the reductions set forth by saying that for this and the next year he would refuse to grant any increase in salaries to officers and men of the Gárda he would in that way meet the situation as well as it could be met at the present time. It is useless for us to bring forward reasonable amendments.  This is a reasonable amendment, but the silver-tongued Minister is able, by his eloquence, to convince and cajole the people who sit behind him that he is taking the proper course when he says, &ldquo;follow me and you are safe.&rdquo;  I contend that a reasonable proposition such as this, based on actual figures and comparisons worked out carefully, ought to have consideration from the Minister and ought satisfy him and those associated with him.  Comparisons with the Northern police and the police in England do not hold at all.  The Northern police officer is a man of 30 or 40 years of age.  Our officer is a young man with 3 or 4 years' service and to stop an increase to him is nothing.  Comparisons with 1914, I think, are ridiculous.  I did not base my argument on the figures of 1914.  I based it on the present standard, less a reasonable reduction or, at all events, a block in the increases of pay for the present.  The conditions in this <Col N="1257" /> country to-day vary very much from the conditions in England.  When you remember that the best offer to the miners was 20 per cent. increase on the 1914 rates, you cannot but be astonished to find that the increases in this country are from 100 to 200 per cent. over 1914, and that these are recognised and legalised by law.  Six hundred and fifty thousand pounds of money has to be found somewhere, and we will not stand for excessive taxation next year.  If the Minister for Finance can show us where reductions are to be made in other Votes we will not press this amendment, but until that is done I do not see any way of dealing with the matter except by resisting every Vote.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a remark about one point that Deputy Wilson has made.  As one of those whom he suggests are to be led by the nose or cajoled by the Minister for Justice I ask is it a fact that when these young men entered the Gárdaí Síochána they did so under a contract from which it follows they are justly entitled to this increase in pay?  Are these the terms of the contract on which they are employed?  The conditions of employment of these young men were set forth when they entered the force, and they were led to believe that their emoluments would increase by a certain amount each year.  That is one of the inducements held out to enter the force.  Does Deputy Wilson <Col N="1258" /> suggest that it is a reasonable proposition for the Minister for Justice to deprive these men of the pay they were led to expect they would receive before they took on the job?</P>

      <P>On that I would like to say a word.  Deputy MacCurtain is right.  There is a reasonable expectation, though there is no express contract.  It would be open, apart from the wisdom of it, to the Government to make this reduction that Deputy Wilson has suggested and it would not lie in the mouth of a Gárdai or an officer of the Gárdaí to say that we had in some way broken a contract with him. He comes into the Gárdaí and he has, of course, expectations that the pay will remain and that increments will be paid and so on, but it is not quite as specific as that.  It is not a binding contract.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 4&mdash;that sub-head E be reduced by £3,000.  I congratulate the Minister on his reduction in the Vote for clothing as compared with the Estimate for the R.I.C., but I want him not to grow weary of well-doing.  I want him to reduce his own Estimates as well. This particular item is £3,000 higher than last year.  The Minister has explained that that is because of the triennial renewal of the tunics of the D.M.P.  I think it is rather an unscientific system that all the tunics of the D.M.P. should have to be renewed every three years, instead of being carried on from year to year.  But I want to suggest to the Minister that there are fields for economy, especially in the case of the Metropolitan Division of the Gárda, even if he has to renew these tunics.  The cost of the London Metropolitan Police, per head, for clothing is £8 15s. 4d.  It is impossible to work out the figure for the Metropolitan Division of the Gárda because renewals are carried over many intervals, but the cost of clothing for the Gárda as a whole is £7 10s. 0d. per head.  The scale of clothing in the country is very much lower than in the Metropolitan Division, and I do not think it is unfair to say that the cost of the Metropolitan Division for clothing per head is at least £10 per year.  I want to put up definite, specific economies to the Minister. The Metropolitan Division get two dress tunics every year.  These dress tunics are expensive.  They cost twice as much as a serge frock.  I would suggest that one dress tunic and two serge frocks would suffice, and the serge frocks might be worn on normal duty in the centre of the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>It would save the cost of one dress tunic, or £2 for every member of the Metropolitan Division in every three years.  Then, again, I find that the provision of great-coats for the Metropolitan Division is considerably in excess of the supply of great-coats for the Gárdaí in the country districts.  The Gárda in the country gets one great-coat and one waterproof coat.  The Gárda in the Metropolitan Division gets two great-coats, one waterproof and one cloth cape.  There is just as much rain in Listowel and Westport as there is in Dublin.  If the Gárda in Westport or Listowel can do with one waterproof and one great-coat, what justification is there for giving two great-coats, one waterproof and one cloth cape to the Gárda in Dublin?  I think if the Minister would revise the scale, he would find that it could be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to him that he should abolish the cloth capes.  A cloth cape is an expensive garment.  It costs <Col N="1261" /> 29/6.  It does not protect a man from the rain.  It only protects his shoulders and its advantage is that it is good to run in.  It does not impede a man when he is running.  But, in all my experience, I have never seen a man of the D.M.P. or of the Metropolitan Division of the Gárda running either after a criminal or away from him.  I would suggest to the Minister that a revision of the scale of clothing of the Metropolitan Division is overdue, and that he should get his Estimates down to the level of previous years by such revision, instead of increasing them by the sum of £3,000, as he has done this year.</P>

      <P>I explained the increase in this Vote by stating that the triennial issue of tunics falls due to be made in the Metropolitan Division this year.  I went on to say that when I was going into this question of equipment first the disparity between the <Col N="1262" /> initial equipment cost of the member of the Metropolitan Division and the cost of the member of the Gárda outside Dublin struck me as a very considerable one indeed.  On inquiry, I found that that was really an accidental difference that had grown up by the fact of having two forces for some time prior to the Act under which amalgamation was brought about, which difference has survived up to the present.  Taking a longer period&mdash; a nine year period&mdash;there is, in fact, little difference, if any, in the cost.</P>
      <P>It works out this way: A Guard outside the Metropolitan Division receives in nine years ten frocks, sixteen trousers, three breeches and three great-coats.  A Dublin Metropolitan Guard receives over that period eight tunics and frocks, as against ten in the other case.  He receives the same in the matter of trousers, and he receives four great-coats, one more than the outside Guard.  The R.I.C. used to receive in the nine years' period sixteen frocks, twenty trousers and four great-coats. So that both the Dublin Division Guard and the Guard outside Dublin are substantially below these figures in the matter of frocks and tunics&mdash;ten and eight as against sixteen, in trousers sixteen in each case, as against twenty in the R.I.C., and great-coats, four Dublin Metropolitan Division and three outside the Dublin Metropolitan Division to four R.I.C., over the nine years' period.  The periods of re-issue vary a little, and that is due to an inheritance. When we amalgamated the Dublin Metropolitan Police with the Gárda Síochána we gave tenure in the Metropolitan area to existing members of the D.M.P., and in some other respects, too, we have had to continue the Metropolitan Division as a self-contained Division of the Gárda Síochána, with some of the differences which prevailed prior to amalgamation between the members of that Division and the members of the force throughout the country. Disparities of this kind will disappear in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the sub-head as a whole, the differences are rather apparent than real.  But under this sub-head we are not in an apologetic mood.  I showed that we are doing to-day for £3 10s. per <Col N="1263" /> head per annum what was done in 1914 for £3 17s. per head per annum, and I think that that is rather an accomplishment when you consider the difference in the value of money.  It is just a question whether that can be continued.  I think that we are fortunate to have it so low, and I think we will be very fortunate if we are able to keep it so low.  I could not, of course, at all contemplate a further reduction of that sub-head.  That, in my opinion, is the bone.  You could not get it any lower than that, and it is a feat to have got it so low.</P>
    <P>There is just this point about the difference in the initial cost between the Metropolitan Division and the outside men, and that is an inheritance.  I think that in time, in this respect and in certain others, uniformity will come, but when we were dealing with a body of men such as the D.M.P., with their own esprit de crops, their feeling of separateness from the other police, and when we were approaching the delicate matter of amalgamation, it was a matter of going slow and meeting as many objections, reasonable or unreasonable, as could well be met.  Just as we guaranteed tenure to the existing D.M.P. men, so in other respects we have not interfered with the kind of stereotyped, vested rights that were in existence. These anomalies and disparities will tend to disappear, and I think in due passage of time the idea of a self-contained division within the Guards will disappear too, because, of course, recruiting now is to a single force, and a man is liable to be sent anywhere we wish to send him, the tenure idea applying only to the men who were in the D.M.P. at the date of amalgamation. The difference, taken over the long period, is a small matter and I do not think that equipment could be regarded as excessive in either case. There is, just on account of that accidental circumstance of a re-issue falling due this year, an increase in the Vote because of the re-issue for the Metropolitan Division.</P>

      <P>Therefore I must continue to pick the bone.  The Minister has not shown that the cape is in any way necessary to the efficiency of the Metropolitan Division.  He has merely based his plea for it on the survival of old traditions.  I have worn a cape on duty in my time, but I never attached any passionate interest to it as an old tradition.  I do not think that Deputy O'Doherty's point that it gives more protection from rain than a raincoat and is less warm, is a very substantial one.  Again, the Minister has not replied to the point I put up that the Metropolitan Division should have frocks, which cost 30/-, rather than tunics, which cost £2.  I would say that one dress tunic for State occasions is quite enough for the Metropolitan Division.  For occasions such as lining the streets or assisting at some ceremony it is very desirable that they should have tunics, but otherwise their duty would be done with greater ease in a frock, and that would mean a considerable saving.  I want to call attention to the Minister's statement that this Estimate has increased from last year and is likely to increase.  The Minister said that it was likely to increase rather than to be further reduced, and that he had cut it down to the bone.  I suggest to the Dáil that we ought to check increases in Estimates by every means in our power. We have been told that there is to be no committee of inquiry, no Geddes committee, but that the Dáil is the place to check these things.  We are trying to check them in the Dáil.  It will waste a certain amount of time, undoubtedly.</P>

      <P>May I say that it is the per head Estimate that I regard as being down definitely as low as it could be down.  The other Estimates will vary.  This year, because it happens to be the re-issue year of the Dublin Metropolitan Division, it is up.  I do not anticipate that it will be up next <Col N="1265" /> year; it is quite as likely to be down. I said the rates in matters of contracts and so on, were about as close as we could get them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw, and I hope that my withdrawal will be taken note of by the Press.  The reduction of the Estimate by 10/- per head is in a great part due to the fact that the helmet has been abolished in rural areas.  The helmet, when new, cost about 12/6.  That is not the entire factor, because prices are different.  I could not discuss a per head equipment unless I had the cost not merely of the whole equipment but of the individual articles of equipment of the Dublin Metropolitan Division.  Again, I congratulate the Minister on that reduction, but I want to go into the matter to see whether further reduction cannot be made.  The Minister has told the Dáil that he is considering the equipment of the Dublin Metropolitan Division.  I suggest the best way to get effective consideration, and consideration within a reasonable period of time, is to vote the money for equipment that the Minister got last year, and then if, after a detailed examination of the other costs of equipment, he finds he cannot carry on, let him come back to us and ask for a supplementary estimate.  There was, in the last year we have any knowledge of, an over-estimate of £11,000 on the Gárda Síochána.  That is for the year 1924-25.  The margin of that over-estimate would cover the £3,000 by which I seek to reduce this Vote.  If we are to exercise rigid and careful financial control, I suggest that we do not grant more than we did last year.  If the Minister has really to get more let him bring in a supplementary Vote and justify it.  I think Ministers are too frightened of supplementary estimates.  I think over-estimation is tending to become a habit and, therefore, I urge the Dáil to support my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to add.  Naturally we would desire <Col N="1266" /> to work towards uniformity in the matter of equipment as in the matter of many other things pertaining to the force, and we will try to secure that. I am not a tremendous partisan of the cape.  The question whether that distinction might disappear is something that could be looked into.  I do not know whether there is any strong feeling about it in the Dublin Metropolitan Division, but it is something that could be considered.  I think there is not very much in the Deputy's point, about the helmet accounting for the difference between the £3 10s. and the £3 17s.  The helmet, no doubt, was fairly costly at the start.  It was a matter of 12/6 or so, but the helmet lasted a man his time in the force and over a period its cost would not amount to anything considerable.  On the grounds of over-estimation, I would like to point out that for 1924-5 the estimate for clothing was £28,050, of which £27,613 5s. 9d. was expended.  There was a saving of £436 14s. 3d., so that we did not go too wide of the mark in our Estimate in that particular year, although it was one of the early years of the force, and over-estimation or even under-estimation might have been excusable on grounds of lack of experience.</P>

      <P>In regard to sub-head N, could the Minister tell us, as the Estimate for telephones shows a considerable increase, whether it is an estimate for additional equipment services rather than for the number of messages?

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I think, in speaking to the Estimate, that this was an increase and that I hoped that that particular Vote would continue to increase, because what it means is that more stations are being linked up.  The Post Office, while it has really served us quite well in the last couple of years and is meeting our requirements quite rapidly, has still a long way to go before there will be what I consider adequate communication between a given station and its divisional headquarters.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Hughes)</NameTxt>
      <P>In presenting the Army Estimates for the year 1926-27, Deputies will, doubtless, expect more informamation on Army matters generally than, from the circumstances prevailing, it was possible to give last year.</P>
      <P>The Deputies are, of course, familiar with the original constitution of the Army.  They are all aware of the circumstances in which the National Army was constituted early in 1922.  It was a case of there having been no organised military administrative machine to enable the task that was thrown on the military to be adequately carried out.  Officers, N.C.O.'s and men were hurriedly enrolled; hurriedly put into uniform, where such uniform was available; and hurriedly formed into military formations.  Then came, almost immediately, the civil strife, when the National Army was supplemented by thousands of recruits from the civil population, the strength ultimately reaching the number of 55,000 all told.  On the cessation of civil strife came the gigantic task of demobilisation.  I am aware of the difficulties that various countries have had in the demobilisation of an army improvised for war, and I can assure the House that, relatively, the difficulties associated with our demobilisation were on a very extended scale.  It was carried out ultimately with the success which, I venture to say, reflects the very greatest credit on the Army leaders of the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> After this demobilisation came the reorganisation of the National Army on a peace basis; there, again, extreme difficulties were encountered, but, after various incidents with which the House is familiar, a peace army was brought into being.  This peace army was, as is shown in the Estimates for the last two years, of greatly reduced strength.  It became necessary, in regard to the officer personnel, to give some feeling of permanence of tenure to officers who were selected for commissions in the peace army.  An establishment for the Army was constituted, showing the personnel to be attached to each individual Army formation down to the infantry company.  It is not contended that this establishment was in any way approaching finality; it has, in fact, been found that the establishment requires extensive amendments.  These amendments are inevitable, having regard to the nature of an army in itself. It must be remembered that the Army is only now four years in existence, but the progress made during that period must be considered to be, in the nature of the case, quite remarkable.</P>
    <P>Having secured the formation of the peace army, and having put into operation military formation of the type ordinarily existing in modern armies, and having constituted technical corps of various kinds, and having established an air force adjunct of considerable value, we reach the stage now, at the opening of the present financial year, when it is possible to show that within the various limitations of the case we have constituted an Army which, I venture to say, compares well with any recently constituted army in any other country.  At this stage of my remarks it might reasonably be asked: what is the objective of that Army in a country such as this?  That point has been raised more than once, and pressure has been brought to bear to indicate what is the policy governing our Army.  Well, I have no hesitation in stating the policy now.  It is this:</P>
    <P>The organisation of our defence forces should in the first place be such that it would be capable of rapid and efficient expansion in time of need to the maximum strength of the country's <Col N="1269" /> man-power.  This will necessitate the training of all ranks in duties of a more advanced nature than those normally associated with each rank.  The Army must be an independent national force, so organised, trained and equipped as to render it capable, should the necessity arise, of assuming responsibility for the defence of the territory of the Saorstát against invasion or internal disruptive agencies or against violation of neutrality on the part of an enemy.</P>
    <P>I might add to that exposition of policy that in times of peace, such as we are happily experiencing now, there is a distinct tendency to overlook the necessity for the maintenance of a force in this country trained in arms and ready to repel attack.  I may also add that the internal situation in the country does not yet justify the substitution of the Army, as it at present exists, for something in the nature of a militia force.</P>
    <P>From this it will be seen that the primary object aimed at for our Army is that it shall be capable of the defence of Irish territory, and to resist invasion from any quarter.  Having regard to the policy thus defined, Deputies will realise that many of the features brought out in this year's Estimates are imperatively necessary for an army such as that policy contemplates, and with these preliminary remarks I should like now to proceed to a consideration of the Estimates as a whole.</P>
    <P>The first point to be brought out in connection with the Estimates now presented to the House is that they represent a decrease of £577,647 on the Estimates for last year.  Every avenue of retrenchment has been explored, but, in the main, the reduction represents a reduction in strength.  It will be noted that this year provision is being made for a total of 1,064 officers and 12,500 non-commissioned officers and men.  This represents a reduction in number of 14 officers and of 3,990 non-commissioned officers and men.  The reduction of non-commissioned officers and men is contingent on the constitution of reserve, concerning which I will make some remarks later on.</P>
    <P>Regarding the officers, it will be <Col N="1270" /> within the knowledge of Deputies that the defence forces, as such, were formally promulgated on the 1st October, 1924, under the provisions of the Defence Forces Act.  Officers selected for the defence forces then became fully commissioned, and were duly gazetted. The officer corps thus became an established institution in the sense that the officers gazetted were considered to have adopted the Army as their career. I am not going to say that every one of the officers who were gazetted will ultimately find that the Army is their vocation, as it were, but I am going to say that the gazetting of these officers in the defence forces gives them certain rights which cannot be ignored. The reduction which has already taken place in the number of officers represents voluntary resignations and actual removals.  It may reasonably be argued, I think, that the proportion of officers to other ranks is, perhaps, at the moment, slightly on the large side.  Various comparisons in this connection have been made from time to time with other armies.  These comparisons, in my opinion, are to a large extent ill-considered, there being no real basis of comparison between an army which has been in existence only four years with other armies which have been in existence for hundreds of years and are highly developed, intensive organisations; but, taking the averages for what they are worth, it is observed that the proportion of officers to other ranks in the defence force is 1 to 11.75.  In the British Army it is 1 to 15; whilst in the United States Army it is 1 to 10.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that, as our Army must be capable of extension at any moment, a proportion of officers, somewhat larger than would normally be admissible, should be in the service. We may, of course, come to the formation of a reserve of officers, but, meanwhile, there are arguments for having in the defence forces a relatively larger number of officers than the strength of other ranks would normally justify. Nevertheless, it has been decided that, whilst no compulsion whatever will be used, officers who feel that the Army is not their vocation, and who desire to re-enter civil life, will be allowed to do <Col N="1271" /> so in terms of being granted a year's pay and allowance as a gratuity on their relinquishing their commissions. Deputies will note that a separate sub-head has been created in these Estimates to cover the grant of such gratuities. It is anticipated that a number of officers will take advantage of this opportunity, but I should like to repeat that there is no intention of forcing efficient officers out of the Army.</P>
    <P>As regards non-commissioned officers and men, it will be noted that whereas last year provision was made for 3,237 N.C.O.'s this year we are asking for provision for 1,965 only of non-commissioned officers.  And in regard to privates, the number this year is 10,535 compared to 13,261 last year. This reduction in the strength of N.C.O.'s and men has only been found to be possible by the creation of the reserve, for which powers exist in the Defence Forces Act.</P>
    <P>The reserve will be composed of fully trained soldiers of exemplary character who have completed their period of service with the forces.  Reservists will be paid while on the reserve at the rate of 9d. per day.  They will be subject to annual training for a period of twenty-one days, during which they will be paid at the normal army rates.  The scheme may not be in full force this year, but my idea is to have a reserve of about 4,500 men at the end of the financial year&mdash;the regular army being correspondingly reduced.  In this particular year it is contemplated to train reservists for seven days only.  The total cost of the reserve for this year, it will be noted, including clothing and provisions whilst up for training, amounts to £65,385.  The clothing and equipment included in that sum is expected to last ten years, and to that extent such expenditure can be described as non-recurrent.  A similar number of men on full time in the Army would cost £600,000.</P>
    <P>Another new aspect of affairs in the personnel of the Army is indicated under sub-head &ldquo;A&rdquo;&mdash;pay of cadets. It will be understood that the ultimate officering of the Army will be in one or other of two ways&mdash;the appointment of <Col N="1272" /> cadets or promotion from the ranks. A start is being made in regard to cadets.  A number are immediately required for the air service; some will be required for the corps of engineers; one or two will be required for the army bands; and later on, as I have said, there will be the introduction of cadets for the other arms, infantry, etc.</P>
    <P>The general scheme for the cadets is largely contingent on the establishment of our military college, but, meanwhile, we are making a start, as indicated, in connection with the air service, corps of engineers and bands.  And, mentioning the military college, it will be noted that provision is being made for sending a number of officers to the United States for the purpose of undergoing courses there in the United States military colleges, so that we shall have a nucleus of officers to take up the work in the military college when that institution commences to function.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the personnel of the Army, I should not omit to mention the army air service.  I may say at once that it is the policy of the Government that an air service, however small, should be in existence.  It is an essential part of every existing Army.  All have their air services in operation.  Our air service is small, and it is not contemplated that it should ever be very large.  Apart from the purely military value of the air service, it must not be forgotten that civil aviation is now a permanent feature in most countries, and that it must eventually be developed in this country. It would certainly be a matter of grave importance to any developments in civil aviation that, apart from military necessities, there should be a military air service to lead the way. Before I conclude my observations on military personnel, I should like to refer to the headings, &ldquo;wages to civilians attached to units&rdquo; and &ldquo;medical services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In regard to civil personnel, it will be within the recollection of Deputies that on the evacuation by British troops at the Curragh, there was left behind a large body of civilian labour employed in the various services at the Curragh Camp.  The Army, in its initial <Col N="1273" /> stage, was unable to take over the services performed by these men, and the office of works was, accordingly, deputed to undertake the administration of these various services at the Curragh. That Department, accordingly, took over all the various civilians as employed by the British Government.  As things developed in the Army, it became desirable that the control of these services should be undertaken by the Army itself, and, accordingly, the office of works transferred the services to the Army, and incidentally transferred the civilian labour referred to.  We have continued to employ this civilian labour and auxiliary clerical staff, although at one time it was contemplated to substitute a large portion of the civilian labour by military labour. This was found, however, not to be expedient, and the civil labour remains. Economies have been effected in regard to the numbers employed and the present number of civilian employees at the Curragh is 230.  The remainder of the charge for the pay of civilians is in respect of those attached to the corps of engineers at other stations; of clerks and typists, and of a number of civilians employed on miscellaneous work.</P>
    <P>In regard to the employment of civilians by the engineer corps generally, it has been found that the employment of soldier-tradesmen is uneconomical. The civilian workman works the normal number of hours per week applicable to his trade; on the other hand, the soldier tradesman, allowing for parades, orderly and other military duties, is found to do actual work of only about 30 hours a week. A further circumstance is that the number of civilians employed can be increased or diminished at short notice, civilian labour being more adjustable to meet the fluctuations of actual requirements. The ultimate idea, therefore, in regard to work services of the engineers in the maintenance of barracks, etc., is to employ civilians, in the main with a small number of soldier-tradesmen in pivotal positions, superintendents, etc.  The full effect of this policy cannot be carried out this year, and hence, it is that we still have a considerable number of soldier-tradesmen drawing extra pay as such.  As <Col N="1274" /> regards typists, a committee has enquired into the nature of the work, and the necessity for their employment. Considerable reductions have been made, and provision is made for 102 for the present year, chefs and waiters are included in the number of civilian employees.  Here, again, civilian labour is essential in the present circumstances, owing to the fact that soldiers trained in these duties are not yet available.  We propose to start a school of instruction in cookery, etc., as a result of which it will be possible to find a number of chefs, cooks, etc., to replace the civilians at present employed. Amongst the miscellaneous civilians employed is one rigger at Baldonnel aerodrome to examine machines and test the engines prior to flights.  He is a highly-trained mechanic and his employment is essential.</P>
    <P>As regards the medical service, it will be noted that there is a reduction in the charge as compared with last year.  This service, besides attending to all the medical services for the Army, including treatment of pensioners towards reduction of disability, also provides medical boards in connection with army pensions; and with the reduction in the Army there will be a substantial reduction in the strength of this service.  It must be remembered that the Army is still very scattered, there being some one hundred posts at which military are stationed.  This, inevitably, adds to the work of the medical service, the medical officer of the unit being often compelled to travel long journeys to outposts.</P>
    <P>Transport of troops by rail is a normal service, but it will be interesting to the House to know that arrangements have been made with the railway companies in the Saorstát whereby the military on duty are conveyed at substantially reduced rates.  The effect of this reduction is that the transportation of troops is carried out under rates appreciably lower than those accorded to the British authorities for conveyance of troops in Northern Ireland. As regards the Army transport, there are two sides to this very important and essential Army service&mdash;the mechanical transport and horse transport. Possibly, Deputies will have noticed that there is an increase in <Col N="1275" /> horse transport.  This is a policy which has been adopted, governing short journeys in cities, towns, etc., and is found to be both economical and efficient.  As regards mechanical transport, I have mentioned on a previous occasion that we had the heritage of a mass of mechanical transport in a very advanced stage of depreciation. The cost of upkeep in respect of these vehicles was so excessive that it was determined that the more economical policy would be to dispose of them and purchase a small number of new vehicles in replacement.  This has been done; we have disposed of practically all the old lorries and cars.  Last year we purchased some new lorries and cars, and this year the process will be continued.  There has been a material reduction, even since last year, in the number of cars in use.  It is felt that in an emergency mechanical transport can always be obtained, and the policy, therefore, is to reduce mechanical transport to the necessities of the Army as it exists at the moment.  As I have stated, it is wasteful to keep cars on the road for a long period; it is not proposed to run a car more than three or four years, and the present intention is to replace a number of cars regularly each year, thus spending the capital expenditure over a number of years.</P>
    <P>The control of the use of cars generally in the Army has been thoroughly inquired into, with the result that a more extended &ldquo;pooling&rdquo; system has been adopted without in any way curtailing essential services.  The use of petrol also has been rigidly investigated, and a system has been adopted which will secure that military users of Army vehicles will be required to show that their consumption of petrol has been on essential military services and has not been excessive.</P>
    <P>The most important feature in Army expenditure, after pay of personnel, is that of supplies.  The food of the Army, it will be noted, is expected to cost over £400,000.  This estimate is based on the estimated cost of the daily ration for officers and soldiers.  The estimated cost is 1s. 7d. per daily ration.  Incidental to the supply of <Col N="1276" /> food for the Army, it may be mentioned that the Army runs an up-to-date bakery at the Curragh.  The bread produced is of the best quality, and the cost of production compares favourably with the cost of bread by competitive tender.  In that connection evidence of cost of bread from the Army bakery has recently been furnished to the Food Prices Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Besides the bakery, the Army has an abattoir at the Curragh; for meat supplies in the Dublin area the Corporation abattoir is utilised.  The meat from the abattoirs is of the highest quality, and, although the cost per lb. of meat produced is somewhat higher than the meat contract price at outstations, I am fully convinced that the abattoir meat is better value, apart from the administrative experience gained by the Army in the working of these institutions.  The difficulty in regard to meat supplied by contractors is that, notwithstanding surprise inspections, inferior meat is regularly tendered.  This means rejection and replacement by the contractor, or, alternatively, purchase in default.  All purchases of food under contract are made under a system of rigid open competitive tender with close financial supervision.</P>
    <P>Amongst the important supply services should be mentioned clothing. Clothing for uniforms is of Irish manufacture, but it was difficult to secure exact uniformity in supply.  A standard sample is now being adopted, and Irish manufacturers will be in a position to manufacture cloth to this standard sample.  This will secure a longer life for uniforms, and a better appearance in the dress of the men generally.  The increase in the amount under this sub-head, as compared with last year, arises from the fact that at the beginning of last year there was a quantity of active service clothing on hand, and the estimate for that year was adjusted accordingly.  The active service clothing is exhausted, and replenishment, as indicated in this year's estimate, is necessary.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of animals and forage, it will be noticed that there is an increase compared with last year. The increase is partly accounted for by <Col N="1277" /> the increase in horse transport already referred to, and partly to complete the horse establishment of the artillery which has been below strength in animals. Leaving supplies, we come to stores of various kinds&mdash;general stores, warlike stores and engineer stores.  In regard to general stores, there is an increase compared to last year.  The main factors in this increase are: The provision of equipment for the army signal corps&mdash;a corps whose functions are in the highest degree technical; purchase of tip-carts in connection with horse transport; and limbers for artillery.  The provision for warlike and engineer stores represents the normal requirements for the Army, and calls for no special comment.  After stores we come to two primary services for the Army&mdash;fuel, light and water on the one hand, and barrack services on the other.  The issue of fuel is now controlled in an intensive way under regulations under the Defence Forces Act.  Regulations are also extant in respect of furniture for messes, etc. As regards military lands, the expenditure under this head has hitherto been shown under the head of works and buildings, but it was felt desirable to segregate this item and bring it out separately.  This is a service of considerable importance; the administration of it as well as its financial control is in charge of the Army Finance Officer, who has a lands officer of wide experience to carry out all the various technical and other duties.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I have only to say that the Estimate before you is the considered Estimate, having regard to the normal expenditure which would inevitably take place on the Army.  It is an Estimate which I, as Minister, can stand over in this House, and I do say it is the minimum that we can accept for the requirements of the Army for the coming year, considering the numbers we have and the numbers we intend to have.  I hope the Dáil will criticise the Estimate from the point of view of putting forward genuine and constructive criticisms, and not criticisms of a destructive nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to propose the amendment which stands in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Vote be reduced by £1,300,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I arrived at that figure by deciding in my own mind what Army would be sufficient for the requirements of the Saorstát.  I decided, as far as my ideas in regard to the maintenance of an army in keeping with the requirements of the State were concerned, that we would not be justified in maintaining an Army of a greater size than 5,000 men, with appropriate officers and N.C.O.'s In making my calculations I took off 5,535 men, which is the balance required with 5,000 men to make up the total of 10,535.  At a rough estimate, I decided that 600 officers might be retained.  The proportion of 600 officers to 5,000 men is considerably more than the present proportion of officers to men.  As has been explained by the Minister for Defence, the present proportion is higher than the usual proportion of officers to men.</P>
      <P>I decided, in view of the smallness of the Army and the possibility of creating a larger reserve, that we must retain a larger proportion of officers.  I cannot say that the number I have mentioned is worked out in any definite proportion to the possible personnel under the new organisation.  It is not possible, in dealing with a matter of this kind, to work out the exact requirements of the State in regard to the maintenance of an Army of the size of 5,000 men with officers and N.C.O.'s. I also make an allowance for 1,000 sergeants; I am not including corporals. That would leave the Army that I suggest should be retained by the State at 6,600 men.  The total number of officers and men which I suggest should be taken off Army strength is 6,972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> Dividing the total cost of the Army by the total number of officers and men we get a rough calculation of the cost of each officer and man at £187.  If we multiply that by 6,972 we arrive at a total of £1,300,000.  I propose that the Vote be reduced by this amount.</P>
    <P>I am quite cognisant of the conditions which led to the establishment of our Army and the conditions which caused the retention of an army of the present size.  My proposal is not, in any sense, a vote of censure, or in any sense a suggestion that the Army is not a very efficient force and is not an Army which we can be proud of.  I am dealing with the question purely from the outlook of the requirements of the State in regard to a military establishment, combined with the economic conditions and the possibilities of the State in regard to the upkeep of an army.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects which must be taken into account at once when we are to decide what size of an army we should retain.  We must decide what we are retaining the Army for&mdash;what the reason for the existence of the Army is.  Is it mainly for the purpose of maintaining internal order or for the purpose of acting as an insurance against a future outbreak of civil strife?  If it is, do we require the number of men we at present maintain? If it is not required for that purpose, if we decide that danger has ceased to exist, then we have to decide if we are retaining the Army as a defence force against possible invasion.  I cannot conceive any other contingency in connection with which the Army would be required.</P>
    <P>As regards the first aspect of it, whether we have reached a condition of peace and freedom from the possibility of civil strife which justifies the reduction of the Army to the extent I suggest, that is a debatable matter, a matter upon which we have to come to a decision and a matter upon which the Government, perhaps, is in a better position to give information.  I can only view this matter from the point of view of one who is in touch with the people outside&mdash;with the people of his own constituency&mdash;and who must visualise things without any inside information <Col N="1280" /> such as the Government must have as to the possibilities of civil strife.</P>
    <P>I regard the possibility of a further outbreak of civil strife as a remote contingency.  Believing this to be a fact, it is the only justification which I give for the reduction I propose.  If it can be proved that I am wrong and that there are still possibilities of an outbreak of civil strife, I am willing not to press this proposal.</P>
    <P>I expected when the Minister for Defence made his opening statement that he would have, in view of the size of this Vote, said something with regard to the peaceful conditions in the country and the possibilities of an outbreak of civil strife in future, and that he would have given us some indication of Army requirements in connection with the maintenance of law, in so far as that aspect is concerned.  The Minister barely touched on that subject. He did not give us any information upon which I could base some of my arguments.  If we take it that the possibilities of an outbreak of civil strife are remote and that we do not require an Army of 13,000 men to act as an insurance against such dangers, even if there is a slight possibility of that, and if the size of the Army which I suggest should be retained will be sufficient to meet any contingency of that kind which might arise, then I say that the Dáil should support the proposal I make.</P>
    <P>If we take the other aspect of it, the aspect of maintaining an Army for the purpose of protecting our own shores against invasion, I say we are just as likely to be able to protect our shores in the case of a future great war with 5,000 men or with 3,000 men or 2,000 men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;as with an army of 13,000 men, because I believe that in the event of an outbreak of war the fighting will be such that an army of the size which we are maintaining in this country, or an army of any size that we can build up, will really be useless in view of the form of attack which will be developed.  It seems to <Col N="1281" /> me that in any future war in which we may be liable to get involved, it will be a question of attacks by air, perhaps attacks by a still more elaborate form of poison gas delivered possibly from the air.  We cannot possibly afford to maintain an air force or an anti-air craft defence force which would in any way be able to cope with attacks that we would be likely to meet.</P>
      <P>I think that in our defence from outside attack we will have to depend, as we are part of the Commonwealth of Nations, on the defence which can be given to our shores by the British Fleet and the British air force and anti-aircraft forces.  To attempt in this country, with the very limited resources that are at our disposal, to maintain an army which would by any possibility be able to cope with outside attacks is really, to my mind, futile and hopeless. Therefore, I look upon any army that we could build up as useless for the purpose of meeting outside attacks.  I have also in view in putting down this motion that the natural development of the Army in this country would be by the establishment of a system of militia.  I see that the Minister has already made provisions, to a limited extent, for the establishment of such a force.  I would like to see the Minister take greater steps and make more elaborate arrangements for the establishment of a militia force in this country, because I believe that that is the proper system of development for this country, and is much more suitable for the conditions of the country than the maintenance of a standing army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might point out to the Minister that there are, perhaps, certain risks in connection with the maintenance of a standing army, an army which is maintained largely for defensive purposes. In a State of this kind, of the kind in which we live, in which we hope to live at peace with our neighbours, and not likely to get embroiled in a war of any consequence, that Army must always have a peace outlook, an army maintained not for military purposes but for the maintenance of law and order. It is a very difficult matter to maintain a military outlook or to maintain the discipline which is necessary in armed forces when there are no possibilities of <Col N="1282" /> active military service at some time, no matter how remote, which most other armies put before them.</P>
    <P>If we take it that we are maintaining an army really as an auxiliary force, the size of our police force must be taken into account.  To-day we have passed a Vote for the maintenance of over 7,000 police which are required for the maintenance of law and order.  At the same time we are now being asked to pass a Vote for £2,500,000 for the maintenance of another force which really may be regarded as an auxiliary arm of the police.  I say that without any intention of giving offence.  I therefore suggest that the whole cost of our force for the maintenance of law and order is altogether excessive and altogether beyond the capacity of this country to maintain as a permanent condition of affairs.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I want to say that, naturally, when we come to examine the requirements of this country in regard to the Army we will begin to look around us and to make comparison with other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations and find out what their army strength is and what the costs are.  I find in looking into the question that in connection with other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations that the number of men maintained as a permanent army in each case is much smaller than the number of men maintained in the Saorstát. I find that in the Canadian Army there are at present 15 units of the permanent force with a total establishment of 3,500.  I might say that, in addition, there is a very considerable establishment of a non-permanent militia force. In South Africa, where a system of universal service obtains there is only a permanent army establishment of 150 officers and 1,600 other ranks.  In Australia, with its enormous area, and with its population almost twice that of the Saorstát, there is only a permanent force of 1,703 men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On the circumstances we have to decide whether we are to maintain an army of this size. If it can be proved to the satisfaction of the House that we ought to maintain it, I am sure the House will give its vote in favour of the maintenance, but I am trying to show that there is no necessity for an army of the size we are maintaining.</P>
      <P>With regard to New Zealand the information I have is that constabulary and defence cost £1,021,274.  I have dealt with this matter to the extent that I intend to deal with it.  It is up to the House to examine this in all its details, to see if the Minister for Defence and the other Ministers can show, to the satisfaction of the House, that the requirements of the State are such that we ought to vote the amount necessary to maintain an army of the present size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to point out the fact that the Minister should be aware that in the remote event of a contingency arising, in which the rapid expansion <Col N="1285" /> of a small permanent Army would be necessary, undoubtedly, in this State, a very large number of men would come to his call in defence of the State. There are a great number of ex-Service men pretty well trained in military manoeuvres and in all the things necessary to carry on an Army. The big bulk of British and National ex-Service men, very well trained, would be willing, in case of necessity, to rally to the call of the nation. Why not rely on those men and make some attempt to build them up into a permanent reserve to rally to the call of the nation if they were required in conjunction with the Army which, I suggest, is too large for the financial possibilities of this country?  I think we should be able to carry on very favourably and efficiently with an army of the size which I am suggesting, and which would be maintained if my vote were passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain figures have been given to justify the amendment which Deputy Heffernan has proposed. This Vote, in my opinion, is on a basis entirely different to the last Vote, that for the Gárdaí.  Looking at the figure in the estimate put down by the Minister, I think it will be generally accepted as the opinion of the majority of the people that any such sum as that indicated to be spent on the military organisation is more than the people can afford.  When we come to deal with details, Deputy Heffernan has brought us down to brass tacks, and he suggests that a reduction of the Vote should be made to the extent of £1,300,000.  As in the case of all these Votes I cannot see, if we sanction a reduction of that sort, how it could be put into operation within the time covered by the expenditure under this Vote.  That places some of us in somewhat of a difficulty as regards the expression of our opinion that the Army is unnecessary in its present size, and is too expensive for the means of the people.  It puts us in a difficulty that, whereas we can say that with the utmost confidence, I do not know exactly how we could say that Deputy Heffernan's amendment could be put into operation.  As in the case of all the other Votes, we are up against that.  The claim is that the <Col N="1286" /> Estimates as a whole, including the Army Vote, are excessive.  The retort of the Ministers to our criticism in that direction is: &ldquo;We are the supreme authority; we have looked into this thing&mdash;not a penny.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If Ministers realised that it is really the serious opinion of the country that taxation is too heavy and that, consequently, expenditure must be reduced, I think they would face the problem in somewhat a different spirit.  It is, of course, very hard for inexpert people to say exactly where a reduction can be made in the expenditure under particular items.  In dealing with the Vote for the Gárda I thought the Minister for Justice went very fully into details in connection with that Vote.  Our opinion in regard to this Vote is that the Army, as it stands, is an extravagance which we cannot afford.  So far as I am concerned, I do not want to say that the Army, or anybody connected with it, is overpaid.  I do not want to say that the Army, if we could afford it, is not a very nice thing to have, but I do say that an expenditure of that sort is not called for at present and that a general reduction in the permanent Army should be faced as one of the necessities of the times.  The Ministry may say to us in reply, as they have, I think, said, that owing to the unsettled state of the country it is not safe to reduce the Army below what it is, or below what they propose to have it.  If that is so, I think the Dáil will require a good deal of convincing on the matter, and I say that instead of the Ministry placing the onus on us to justify our statement that the expenditure is too high, the onus rests on them as a whole, individually and collectively, to satisfy the Dáil as to the statement that the state of the country and the possibilities of the situation, in the near or distant future, justify the proposition to place this burden of £2,000,000 on the people for the purposes of defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very loath to touch on the Gárda Vote to-day because I think the Gárda are the backbone in the preservation of order, and it is to them that we have to look for the preservation of the peace generally throughout the country.  In that way I felt a grave responsibility in attacking either the <Col N="1287" /> numbers, payment, or organisation of the Gárda, but I cannot feel myself in the same position in regard to the Army.  This House has to make up its mind as to the reasonableness of the expenditure indicated in these Estimates. Of course, if the House is of opinion that an expenditure of £1,400,000 is not warranted owing to the circumstances of the case, it would be very difficult for either the Minister or anybody else to proceed with the reduction of the Army in a sort of sweep.  If that is so, I, for one, would recognise that the Ministry would be in a difficulty if the House assented to this amendment, but surely we are entitled to a statement from the Ministry as to why they will not seriously look at this question in the light of the ability of the people to bear this taxation. They should indicate to us that they will, and are prepared to, take some steps in the direction of making very substantial relief under this charge.  If that were done I would not cavil at the extent of the reduction that would take effect immediately, but from our point of view, the Executive Council take a serious view of the position when they indicate that any such sum as this has got to be faced practically as a permanent charge.  If we advanced in prosperity and were able to afford luxuries in the way of this expenditure a different aspect of the case might be presented, but we cannot look on the situation to-day with any degree of confidence when we see that the people cannot bear this taxation, and when we feel that there is really no need for such expenditure.  If the Ministry tell us that the situation is so dangerous as to require an expensive force of this sort they should take the responsibility of that and justify this Vote.</P>

After Deputy Hewat's speech, however, a rather different situation has arisen.  Deputy Hewat is a business man who has had long training in business and he has, <Col N="1288" /> perhaps, had as much, if not more, experience than any other Deputy.  There is presented before him a business proposition for the upkeep of the Army for twelve months.  He put the matter on solid ground when he asked if the country can afford this expenditure, and he told us that there is a general cry that it cannot.  In effect, although he did not put it in these words, he said: &ldquo;Everybody is talking economy except the Government.&rdquo;  I know, and have known for some time, what is behind the so-called economic push, this ramp, as I call it.  I knew that this was coming two or three years ago.  It has come now and it is just as responsible as the people who are responsible for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer entirely to outside forces, and I am sorry that people inside are impressed by them, because people inside have learned for the last three or four years that business here is conducted on a business basis.  Deputy Hewat has found fault with us for not going into the matter carefully and indicating what we want. I should like to remind the Deputy that last year the Minister for Finance indicated that in his mind any greater amount than the expenditure of two million pounds on the Army could not be justified.  Usually when counsel are opening a case they start with a history of the case.  The history of this case starts in 1922-3, when an Estimate was introduced in the Dáil for something like £7,000,000 for the Army.  It will be within the recollection of Deputies that the major portion of that Estimate was concerned with a period from 1st July to 31st March following.  That was not a complete year.  In the following year the Estimate for the Army was £10,700,000 odd.  The expenditure in the first year and the expenditure in the second year came very near the Estimate.  The Estimate for the Army in the third year&mdash;that is, 1924-5&mdash;was approximately £4,000,000.  From the Appropriation Accounts, ordered to be printed by Dáil Éireann on the 26th <Col N="1289" /> March, 1926, it will be observed that nearly £1,000,000 was saved on that Estimate.  The people responsible for the ramp omitted that from my speech in Laoighis.  If that fair dealing? They are talking about economy; we are practising it.  There is a big difference between the two.  I should like to know if the Dáil thinks that that is honestly informing the public of the circumstances.  They are the people who talk economy; we are the people who are showing where the economies are to be and where we effect them. Page 136 of the Appropriation Accounts for Public Services, 1924-5, shows that the total surplus to be surrendered that year was £923,981.  Last year the Estimate was £3,053,000, and the saving was £280,000.  They are the people who talk about economy, and we are the people who effect the economy.  They take credit to themselves and say every day that the whole country is talking about this; it is a great thing.  The thanks of the whole world ought to be passed to those newspapers, the front pages of which would not be a credit to &ldquo;yellow journalism&rdquo; sometimes.</P>

      <P>The Executive Council spend a considerable time in dealing with public business, and the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Finance, and the other members of the Executive Council took particular care in presenting this estimate that they would be able to stand over it and be able to justify it.  Now we are practically asked: did we consider this?  I submit that that is scarcely a fair question, in view of the history that I have given the Dáil of the proceedings in connection with the Army from 1922.  This fact will probably also be put away in a corner of the newspapers: that in one year, during a time of war, civil disturbance, uproar, burning of houses and all the rest, we spent almost £11,000,000 on the Army, and the following year, with an estimate of £4,000,000, we saved practically £1,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot demobilise an army rapidly without running considerable <Col N="1290" /> risk.  A very big army was demobilised at that time and certain risks were faced.  The results, I think, show the wisdom of the Executive Council during that particular year.  At the end of the present estimate there is an indication of the policy of the Ministry in connection with further savings. During the time I was Minister for Defence the Army was down to something like 12,000 men&mdash;below that figure as a matter of fact, at one time.  Its numbers were so reduced that there was practically no opportunity for the Dublin Garrison to drill by reason of the very considerable inroads that were made upon the strength to maintain the different guards.</P>
    <P>This estimate, as I said, is not lightly put up.  It is put up in the light of all the circumstances existing; in the light of our experience of the past few years; in the light of information that was open to Deputies during the last few days.  Deputy Heffernan wants to know if we fear any outbreak.  I have no fear of any outbreak&mdash;none whatever. One of the things that give me confidence in relation to a matter of that sort is the particular estimate before the Dáil.  While nobody has greater respect for the efficiency of the Gárda Síochána and the services rendered by them, I say that it would not be possible to have the Gárda Síochána unarmed in the country if it were not for this particular estimate.</P>

      <P>With some of what the President has said I am in agreement, but I want to put the other side of the question.  He complains that after careful consideration by the Executive Council and the Minister for Defence this estimate is challenged.  I would point out through you, Sir, to the President that we have repeatedly been invited to challenge estimates. We have with incessant and almost intolerable reiteration been told that no Geddes Committee or other Committee is needed&mdash;that the Dáil is the place where estimates should be scrutinised, and where Deputies should bring forward amendments.  Now the President suggests&mdash;I do not think it was a considered suggestion&mdash;that the <i>ipse dixit</i> of the Minister for Finance and the Executive Council should carry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understood the President was addressing himself to the general question of amendments. I will deal with Deputy Heffernan's amendment in detail in a moment.  I want first to deal with some of the figures given by the Minister for Defence. If the Estimates of the Minister for Defence can only be defended by such fantastic figures as he gave with reference to Australia, I really think they must be extremely unsound. I have a certain knowledge of conditions in Australia.  An uncle of mine was a member of the Parliament of one of the States of Australia.  I myself actually served in an Australian division for a time, although I was always in an Irish Regiment, and I was invited to become second in command of an Australian battalion, because, as the officer who made the offer said, &ldquo;Our fellows need somebody who understands human nature.&rdquo;  The Minister's figure of 100,000 permanent full-time men in Australia conflicts entirely with all my knowledge of the Australian military system and with the figures given in the <i>Statesman's Year Book</i>, which is the most readily accessible work of reference, and generally accurate. Those figures put the permanent defence forces of Australia at 1,703 officers and men.  These are employed in duties of instruction.  There are, however, citizen soldiers, corresponding to the British territorials.  These are engaged in their ordinary occupations. They are chemists, carpenters, tram-drivers, etc., in civilian occupation. They do drills in the evening and a week or a fortnight's training in the year.  There are 36,900 of them, and on the reserve 14,000 odd.  The total is not 110,000, but 53,000, and of those, the actual permanent full-time soldiers number only 1,700.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures I gave are the figures compiled by the Secretariat of the League of Nations.  These figures return 159,400 men as the strength of the British Army.  I think that is not far astray.  These are the figures I got from the League of Nations, and if I am wrong the Secretariat of the League of Nations is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Secretariat of the League of Nations is wrong.  I think they must have got from Australia a statement of their possible expansion, that is the army that might possibly be put into the field.  Certainly never since another great warrior, like the Minister, Sir John Falstaff, multiplied two men in buckram to sixteen, has there been such multiplication as that of 1,700 men to 100,000 men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I have not insulted the Minister by the comparison. Besides being asked to act as second in command of an Australian battalion, at one time, I was also asked by a professor of Trinity to act the part of Sir John Falstaff, but only temporarily.  I will leave the Minister's figures, which obviously need further discussion, and content myself with expressing the opinion that the League of Nations must have either adopted the Deputy on the Secretariat or have taken their figures from some general statement.  I ask the Minister to believe that his figures are not in accordance with the fact, and that Deputy Heffernan's figures are in accordance with the fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the amendment.  With the motive underlying it I am certainly in sympathy.  I think we should endeavour to reduce our permanent forces, and I welcome the Minister's proposal to set up an Army reserve, though I think it is an incomplete proposal. You can have no satisfactory Army reserve on a basis such as that <Col N="1293" /> indicated, because the period of training is too short.  I have had experience of men coming back to the Army from civilian life.  You cannot get them back to army habits under three or four days.  It requires at least that number of days, especially with strange officers and N.C.O.'s, to get discipline over them.  That means that three or four days are wasted and you have only three or four days extra for training, and that is not enough, and certainly not enough to put them through a musketry course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the intention. The intention is a period of 21 days.  The seven days mentioned by the Deputy is only for the first year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has made that clear.  In twenty-one days he will get effective training, and an effective reserve, but he will not get it this year.  He will get it next year or the year after that.  When he has got it then it will be time enough to move amendments substantially reducing the strength of the Army, and if, side by side with that reserve, he initiates an officers training corps, preferably in the two Universities, so that instead of keeping the present strength of officers he will have new officers coming in with sufficient knowledge to let them take their places possibly not in the new units of reserve but with the trained force, supplementing his existing force in case of trouble.</P>
      <P>It is essential, before you reduce the Army to the strength suggested by Deputy Heffernan, that you have an effective reserve and the means of supplementing the supply of officers, partly reserve officers and partly officers of the Officers' Training Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to Deputy Heffernan's amendment, the immediate effect of it would be instantly to disemploy 6,000 men, and to turn these 6,000 men out of the Army on to the labour market.  I am very doubtful whether such a step would be justified or whether you could reduce the strength of the Army by nearly half in any one financial year.  I think the process should be more gradual.  I spoke this afternoon of the Farmers' Party as my disciples. I am beginning to understand the feelings of the prophet when his disciples <Col N="1294" /> go to lengths of which he does not entirely approve.  Any prophet having any knowledge of the future, seeing Deputy Heffernan and Deputy Wilson coming to enrol, and to plead his cause would drive them away possibly because they are zealots.  They take up a good principle and they are so sincere and earnest that they run that good principle to an extreme that no discriminating prophet would approve. The result is that though the disciples plead the prophet, the prophet will be stoned for the errors of his disciples. I suggest to the Deputy who moved the amendment that however great was the desire of the Dáil to have the permanent strength of the Army reduced to more reasonable limits we cannot take the responsibility of disbanding over 6,000 men at the present moment.</P>

      <P>There is a point in dispute regarding the strength of the standing Army in Australia, and we have it now that Deputy Cooper has supplemented what was said by Deputy Heffernan regarding the strength of that Army.  I make them a present of the strength of the Army.  But the total estimate of the Department of Defence, including war services, in Australia, is £3,425,829.  If they like to divide that amongst 1,700 men I have no objection.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to take part at this stage in the debate, but I certainly want to say a word concerning <Col N="1295" /> this amendment of Deputy Heffernan. In 1923 24,000 men were demobilised. We had a saving, of course, in the Army Estimates, but was it a saving in reality to the people of the State? We had to vote money because of this for unemployment benefit.  We also had these men and their dependents looking for home relief.  I am against the Deputy's amendment.  I quite agree that with an army set up, such as a militia, with 21 or 23 days' training, you might, after some years, have an army that would be capable of protecting the State.  Where you have a saving of £565,547 in this year's Estimate, as compared with last year's, I do not think there is much cause for complaint.  As one of the Deputies who spoke of the extravagance of the Government, I want to say that while there are other estimates I want to criticise, and to endeavour to have reduced, in justice to my constituents, I could not support this amendment.  I am a member of the Dáil since 1922, and I remember that we had an estimate of ten millions one year.  The amount has fallen to £2,475,470 within three years. What will be the result if this amendment is carried?  As Deputy Cooper pointed out, you would have 6,000 or 7,000 men demobilised from the Army and going back to civil life where there is no employment for them.  You would be swelling the ranks of the unemployed and these men and their families would be starving.  According to a reply given to me to-day by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, there are 87,000 persons registered at the Labour Exchanges and that figure is to be, according to the amendment, increased by 6,000 or 7,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold that even Deputies who are advocating economy cannot support this amendment.  I am supporting the Minister's estimate and I do so from a real sense of economy. If the estimate is reduced by £1,300,000, which is a little more than half the total amount of the estimate you will have such trouble in this country by people who are looking for <Col N="1296" /> bread for their children as will take millions to put down.  This would be false economy.  We are not going to stand by any longer and see the workers of the country suffering. About 24,000 or 26,000 men have been demobilised from the Army, and of these not 4,000 have found employment. The others are walking about the streets.</P>
      <P>Deputies are now asked to support an amendment which would result in further swelling the ranks of the unemployed and possibly sowing the seeds of revolution.  While I am a member of the Dáil, I will never agree to a proposal that would further increase the ranks of the unemployed.  Taking the estimate as a whole, we will probably be told that the men are too well paid.  A soldier gets 17/2 a week.  He has to lie on a plank bed.  I have gone through barracks and have seen how the men are accommodated.  Those in Mountjoy Gaol at present are better off.  Men serving in the Army, however, prefer to remain in it and earn 17/2 per week to walking about the streets idle, or going to some employer asking for employment and being told that there is none available.  The amendment asks the Dáil to put these men out of the Army as there is no further use for their services.  If there is any truth in what we have read during the past few weeks, it is absolutely necessary that the Army be maintained at the present strength for the next twelve months.  We are not out of the wood yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>The President says he does not fear anything to himself.  If there is a movement on foot to create another revolution in this country and to destroy life and property, does the Dáil think that the 24,000 men that have been demobilised, as well as the 6,000 men that are now going to be demobilised, will rush to the assistance of the State?  Why should they? They will say: &ldquo;When we were there you would not keep us.  We are not now in a position to fight for you.&rdquo; That is what I would say if I was an ex-Service man and without employment. <Col N="1297" /> It is not yet safe to abolish the Army.  I think it would have been much better if Deputy Heffernan had proposed an amendment, the object of which was to have no army at all.  I would agree to have no army provided the men who are now in the Army could get employment, and that a civil army would be able to protect the State and the people.  Until there is such protection I do not see how we could possibly do without an army. What is the militia going to cost?  The men must be paid for the three weeks that they are in training and for the six or seven years that they join for. Are we going to get patriots to come forward and act as policemen, or are we going to turn every man and woman in the State into a police officer or informer?  Any civilian who gives information of a trifling nature is looked upon, even still, as an informer. Are there any Deputies here who will go down to their constituencies and get 1,000 persons to act as police or as military free of charge?  I venture to say that there is not a Deputy in the House who could possibly do that.  I listened very attentively to Deputy Heffernan's figures for other countries. We have learned from the President that this alleged army of 1,703 men costs in upkeep £3,000,000.  But here, with 13,000 men, the Vote is only £2,300,000.  This is one estimate which I have fully resolved to vote in favour of.  I have already in the country criticised the Government for extravagance, and when the amendments to the extravagant estimates are brought forward I will support them with a view to reductions.  We have 7,700 Guards in the country.  Where would these 7,700 Guards be if there was not a regular army behind them?  The Guards, I agree, are a fine body of men, but against a few &ldquo;Webleys&rdquo; or &ldquo;Colts&rdquo; an unarmed man is of little use.  We want to reduce taxation in the State, and the Minister for Defence in this estimate has gone a good way about it.  If every Department of Government could reduce its estimate in the same proportion that the Department of Defence has done, there would be no cause for complaint.  But other Departments have not done that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> I intend to vote in favour of this estimate in every division that takes place, because I maintain that we are not in a position to reduce the Army by 50 per cent. yet.  What I would urge would be better treatment for the soldiers, particularly in the way of sleeping accommodation and the provision of better facilities for recreation. I wonder if any Deputy visits the wooden shed where the military guard on this building have to remain for 24 hours?  It reminds one of bygone times, when men were carried around in caged lorries.  In times of peace the soldiers are housed in that apartment for 24 hours.  Surely that condition of affairs could be improved.  I think the Minister, or some of the Deputies, should spend a night in Portobello barracks. If they occupied beds there for a night they would not be so eager to reduce the cost of the Army.  If Deputy Heffernan's amendment were put forward for argument's sake&mdash;as amendments are very often put forward&mdash;and if the reduction proposed were merely nominal, in order to permit of discussion, I could understand it.  But surely Deputy Heffernan is not serious in the reduction he proposes.  I wonder if the amendment was put forward for the purpose of saying: &ldquo;We are out for economy.  We, the farmers, are going to effect economies.  We are going to do away with the Army and you have seen that we did our best in the Dáil. We appeal to you to return us at the next election.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we must discuss this amendment from the point of view of the policy of the Ministry in respect to defence, quite apart from individual items of possible retrenchment. I am not at all satisfied with the <Col N="1299" /> explanation given by the Minister of the Ministerial policy respecting defence for the future.  I gathered from his speech that the policy of the Ministry is to have 1,000 officers for the future, and a reduction in the number of non-commissioned officers and men, with a large reserve army&mdash;so large as, by rapid extension, to reach the maximum strength of the country's manpower. That implies that it is the Ministerial policy to have the whole manhood of the State trained to the use of arms.  With that objective it is intended that there shall be maintained as officers of that army round about 1,000 men.  The Minister explained that there are 960 at present, but inducements are being held out to officers to retire with a year's pay and allowances as a gratuity.  I am afraid one must make the comment that that is much more generous than what has been offered to the men, and I do not think the non-commissioned officers and men had any less justification for considering that they were permanent than had the officer corps.  What is the policy with regard to the Army?  What is the intention of the Minister?  The Minister for Finance has, on one or two occasions, indicated that he hopes to bring down the total cost of the Army to about £2,000,000.  But the Minister for Defence has told us that the objectives of the Army are to be capable of rapid extension to resist invasion, repel attack, and to meet any internal disruptive forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not able to distinguish between the use of an army to meet internal disruptive forces and an armed police, and really if we are to have an army mainly for the suppression of armed revolt it would be better to organise the Army directly and purposely with that in mind.  But we are also supposed to be preparing an Army&mdash;and we are going to train officers abroad, we are going to put them through schooling in America&mdash;with the object of setting up a military school in Ireland&mdash;presumably for something more than armed revolt, to repel the attacks of an invader.  Is the Army really being prepared for anything of that kind?  If that is in mind, one would imagine that instead of 68 per cent. of the Army as <Col N="1300" /> infantry we would have a much larger air force, more engineers, and very many more chemical laboratories.  I leave coastal defence out of the question altogether, what one has a right to consider in this connection, and it is. rather a curious thing that the Minister for Defence in this year 1926 should not utter one word about the requirements of coastal defence.  This year, I think, it will be requisite to meet the British Government to consider the question of coastal defence.  We had not one word in that respect, and these Estimates do not appear to make any reference to the possibilities of defence by submarines, coastal mines, or anything of that kind, against an invader. One does not hear anything of anti-air-craft guns, and one has to bear in mind that if one is thinking of repelling an invader it is rapid mobility, air force and anti-air force, and chemical warfare that we ought to be talking and thinking about.</P>
    <P>I am very much of the opinion of the Social Democrats who are in charge of the Government of Denmark and who have been advocating and pursuing a policy of disarmament, believing that the forces they could raise to repel an invader would be practically useless in modern warfare.  But I think as against that there is such a thing as putting an impediment in the way of an invader, and I think it is possible to justify having a manhood trained to rally to a call if there was an invasion.  But I am not at all satisfied that the policy of the Department, as outlined here to-day, justifies the Estimate for this year's Vote.  We are still asked to keep for this year these 12,000 men and non-commissioned officers, and I would remind Deputy Lyons that these are soldiers.  The question of employment is an entirely different one.  If you disband them as soldiers it is not essential that you should put them on to the streets.  There are other ways of utilising men than having them standing outside the Parliament House of peaceable citizens, defending the parliamentarians from the people, an entirely unsatisfactory position for us to be in, and this system of utilising guards all over the country, as it appears they must be used, is entirely unsatisfactory as a means of training an army.  If we are working towards a militia or an <Col N="1301" /> armed public&mdash;I gather that is so from the Minister's statement, supported, as it has been, by certain references from the Minister for Finance&mdash;can we justify a thousand permanent officers? I think that is entirely too many; I do not think there is any justification for that number at all.  I repeat that if we are thinking in terms of defence from an invader we are not justified in maintaining so large a proportion as 68 per cent. of infantry.</P>
    <P>The whole scheme is unbalanced; it is not satisfactory to meet one case or the other, and I think we are really driven to the conclusion that what is intended is that this Army shall be for the subduing of armed revolt, that the repelling of invasion is really not in question at all, and that the military scheme has not that in mind.  So that it comes, as I surmise, to this: the retention of this Army for this year for the purpose of subduing a possible revolt. I do not think that the risks of that revolt are great enough to justify the retention of so large an Army, and I think that the policy of the Ministry has been faulty in not having reduced the Army by a very much larger number and in not putting the men who are not required for military work on to some civil occupation of a productive character.  I want to have a little more information as to this proposed reserve.  Is the 4,000 to 6,000 or 7,000 men intended to be a reserve for this year 1926-7?</P>

      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that intended to be the total number of the reserve for the future?  What are we really aiming at in respect of the reserve?  How many of a reserve are we going to take into account this year?  Is the training to be in one part of the country only?  What class of training is it to be, training of infantry or purely disciplinary training, or will there be any training in, shall I say, engineering? I do not think that is very likely in twenty-one days.  Is it merely to be training in shooting?  I take it further, that the ninepence a day referred to will be a 365 days to the year payment.  Is it intended that they may be drawn from all parts of the country <Col N="1302" /> selected in any way, or that they shall be classified?  Is it intended that they shall be men who have served in the Army?  Many questions will arise when we are dealing with the question of a reserve.  I do not know whether it will be necessary to have legislation to meet it.  If not, then it is all the more necessary that we should have very full information as to what is intended, a scheme properly laid out before us for consideration, and that we should have that, if no further legislation is required, before this Estimate is passed.</P>
      <P>I may say that it is satisfactory to learn from the Minister that he has been able to persuade the railway companies to provide facilities for military on duty to travel at reduced rates and that there has been devised an effective check upon the use of petrol.  These two things together will probably do something to satisfy ratepayers and other motor car drivers.  Those who would like to enjoy the roads of the country will have a little relief due to these two propositions.  As I said, I am not going at this stage to deal with any of the details, but I think that the case the Minister has made outlining the policy of the Executive Council in regard to the scheme of defence is most unsatisfactory.  It does not justify the retention of so large an Army for this year, and in its view of the future is entirely uncalled for.  It is self-contradictory inasmuch as while talking of preparing to repel invasion, it is absolutely lacking in preparations that are likely to be effective.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>He has made no attempt whatever, in my opinion at any rate, to justify the amendment to cut down this estimate by £1,300,000.  I did not take the amendment seriously when I saw it on the Order Paper, and I am sure there are very few Deputies who took it seriously.  It may be argued that the army that is contemplated <Col N="1304" /> for the coming year may be expensive.  Undoubtedly every army is expensive, but the army we are contemplating for this year of 13,000 odd officers and men is not as expensive per head as the armies in other countries. I have figures on that point, and if they are examined it will be found that the cost per head of our army is considerably less than the cost per head of the English Army or continental armies.  It was asked: what is the army for?  Its purpose, as I have already stated, is to defend the interests of this country against all comers, if you like to put it that way.  Deputy Johnson said that our army, from the way it is trained and equipped, is not capable of doing that.  I think if our method of army organisation is examined&mdash;the basis that we are trying to put it on&mdash;it will be found that we are doing exactly what Deputy Johnson says we are not doing.  At the moment the army is being put into corps and services, and when the reorganisation that we are contemplating is complete, the infantry men and the rifle men proper will be very few indeed. There will not be more than five thousand men, and when it is remembered that we have to keep a garrison in the country, and to maintain a number of barracks, this number of men will be very hard pressed indeed to provide Guards for all our barracks and some of our public buildings.  Deputy Johnson complained that we are not keeping an eye on the defences of the country, and that we have not taken any account of a naval programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I think, rather misunderstands me.  I am not making any complaint that these things have not been done, but I am pointing out that there is no evidence in the Estimates that you have considered what you say is part of your purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. I think it is generally known that under the agreement entered into with the British they, at the present time, are guarding our coasts, and that in the year 1927 a conference is to be held between the Government of the <Col N="1305" /> Saorstát and the British Government with a view to arriving at the procedure to be adopted in future years for the defence of the coasts of the Saorstát.  We are not unmindful of that conference, and, as a matter of fact, our staffs are working at the moment in preparation for it, so that we will be able to put up a case and put down facts and figures to the conference if it should decide that we are to take over the defence of the coasts of the country.  If such a decision is come to, we will be ready and willing to do that, and all that will be necessary then will be that we should come to the House and ask for the necessary sum of money.  We have been working for the last three or four months on that matter, and before the end of the year we will have a perfect scheme to put forward should the necessity arise for our doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is important that the Minister should make clear the difference in the dates given. Article 6 of the Agreement in the Treaty speaks of a conference of representatives of the British and Irish Governments to be held &ldquo;after the expiration of five years from the date hereof.&rdquo;  That would be the end of the year 1926.  Does the Minister contemplate any definite distance between the 6th December, 1926, and the date of the conference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I anticipate that the conference will be held during the year 1927 when the five years are up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The five years will be up in December, 1926.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at the end of December, 1926, but I take it that at that time, or, perhaps, a month or so before it, the conference might take place unless agreement is come to in the meantime whereby the agreement now in force would continue for a year or two longer or for some other period.  That is a matter that is just in the embryo stage at the moment.  We are not, as I have said, unmindful of the fact that the conference is to take place, and, as far as our Department is concerned, we are making the necessary preparations for it.  If it is decided by the conference that the Saorstát is to have charge <Col N="1306" /> of the defence of the coasts of this State then that will oblige us to come to the House and ask for the money that will be necessary for the purpose.</P>
      <P>A question was raised as to officers' gratuities.  Everybody knows that in the year 1922, when there was a considerable amount of trouble in the country and when demobilisation was taking place, that a number of officers had retired and that others were willing to retire.  There was a certain number of officers at that time who would have retired voluntarily and taken the gratuity offered were it not for the fact that civil trouble broke out.  These men, realising the duty they owed to the nation and to themselves, remained on in the Army. Perhaps they find now that an army career is not just the thing that suits them, and some of them would be glad &mdash;I do not say a great number of officers, because we have officers in the army that I, certainly, would not like to see taking this gratuity and leaving &mdash;to go back to civil life.  They want to go back to civil life as they are still young, and feel that the army is not a proper career for them.  That is the reason why this sum of £5,000 is put in the Vote this year.  I hope and trust that our best officers will not attempt to leave the army at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the maximum gratuity given to officers, to old I.R.A. officers if you like, compulsorily retired in 1924?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Your average, then, would be higher in these particular cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>It probably would. Deputy Johnson wanted to know more about the reserve and the number of men it was intended to have in the reserve.  The number will be between 3,500 and 4,000.  These men will not be drawn from the ordinary manhood of the country, but will be soldiers whose time will expire from now to the 31st December next.  The man who goes on the reserve must have a good character, be a man whom the Army authorities can trust, and who has been <Col N="1307" /> trusted up to the present time.  It is hoped that the reserve will be an ad junct to the Army, so that when they are called up for a period of training every year they will be trained with the units and in the battalions in which they served, and, if possible, under the non-commissioned officers under whom they had served.  If a man belonged to the Engineers he would go back to that unit; if he belonged to the Infantry he would go back to that unit, and so on with regard to the Artillery or other units.  By that means we hope to have an efficient force for the protection of the nation should any crisis arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to circulate the terms under which this force is to be enrolled? Is it intended that they shall be able to choose their own time for putting in the 21 days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the men will be called from their occupations at the time of manoeuvres.  They will be men of good character.  We hope they will get ready employment, and, further, that their employers will allow these men to go up for their annual training. As these will be men of good character, the fact of their being in the reserve should assist rather than hinder the men in getting employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important we should have more information than we have about this proposed reserve.  If it is intended that they will all serve during the time of the annual manoeuvres, then they will understand what they are required for, and we shall understand the intentions regarding the reserve also.  I understand from the Minister that it is likely the reservists would be fitted into the ordinary battalions and would serve under the same officers they had served under when in the Army.  If that is only intended for the period of manoeuvres it is understandable, and the employers will take the men with the knowledge <Col N="1308" /> that during that particular month of the year they will be off work, but that rather suggests a body of reservists who are casual labourers and not permanent workmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention that these men will be trained with their units, and in order to bring the battalions up to strength for the manoeuvres, the reservists will be brought back for that period.  Manoeuvres in the ordinary way, that is training in the field, only last for four or five days, but the reservists will get camp and musketry training for the remainder of the time.  We hope to be able to build up a reserve that will be a credit to the country and to the Army.  Apart from what has been said about the Army by Deputy Heffernan and others, I am convinced that at present we do want an army in this country, if only, as Deputy Heffernan said, for insurance.  It would be a great pity, I think, if we were to disband the Army now, or to bring it down to an infinitesimal number, simply because we have enjoyed one or two years of comparative peace.  I know what would be said by Deputy Heffernan if we disbanded the Army and any trouble, either internal or external, arose.  It would be immediately said that the Executive Council had not acted in the interests of the country, and had no foresight when they disbanded the Army.  If we are going to carry on, in my opinion it would be impossible that we should go on with an Army of 4,000 or 5,000 men.  I think that Deputy Heffernan came down at one period to 1,000, and if we went on in that way there would be no men at all left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if it is proposed to make reductions in the numbers of the Army during this financial year, and, if so, to what extent? The reason why I ask that question is that the Minister for Finance expressed the hope that the normal expenditure on the Army would be in the region of £2,000,000.  The Estimate, as we have it for this year, is practically £2,500,000.  I would like to know from the Minister what is the policy of his Department in order that he may get the strength of the Army, which is at present about 13,000, down to such a figure as would bring about <Col N="1309" /> the result anticipated by the Minister for Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>The numbers last year, and practically up to the present, are roughly 17,000 officers and men.  It is intended to reduce that number this year by 4,500, which would bring it to the number we have estimated for and it is the policy to reduce that number next year by a gradual process to 10,000, which will bring us exactly in line with what the Minister for Finance stated in his Budget speech.  The policy we intend to pursue is, I think, the only way of dealing with the matter, instead of taking 7,000 or 8,000 men at one slice.  That would be a bad policy, and if I adopted that policy I would be criticised more severely than I have been for the policy I have adopted.  It is my intention, and the policy I am pursuing, to reach in Army expenditure the figure mentioned by the Minister for Finance, and to effect a saving of £500,000.  If I am here next year I have no doubt I will be able to show that that point will have been reached.</P>
