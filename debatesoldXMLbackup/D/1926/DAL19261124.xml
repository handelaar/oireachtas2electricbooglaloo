      <P>asked the President whether his attention has been called to a report in the Press of 3rd November, 1926, to the effect that it is no secret that a certain world-renowned German firm made a tempting offer for Haulbowline Dockyard but the deal was vetoed by the British Authorities; whether such report is correct; whether any offer for this dockyard, or any portion of it has been made to the Saorstát Government since March, 1922, and whether the British Authorities have at any time since this date interfered with, or protested against, the leasing of the place to any firm for commercial or industrial purposes.</P>

      <P>The report that a German firm has made an offer for Haulbowline Dockyard and that the deal has been vetoed by the British Authorities is not correct.  No definite offer for this dockyard, or any portion of it, with the exception of two small oil tanks, has been made to the Government since 1922, and there has <Col N="302" /> been no question of interference by the British Authorities with the letting of the place.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the state of business in the Circuit Court for the County and City of Dublin, and I am aware that there has been some delay in the disposal of civil actions which have been listed for hearing in that Court, as a result of the regrettable illness of the Circuit Court Judge and the Assistant Circuit Judge.  Assistant Circuit Court Judge Roche was transferred from Circuit No. 3 to the Dublin Circuit on Monday last.  Accordingly there are now three Judges assigned to this Circuit, and it is hoped that they will be able to dispose of the arrears of work within the next few months.  Should this not prove to be the case, I shall take whatever additional steps may be necessary to deal with the arrears and to prevent <Col N="304" /> a further accumulation of business in the Dublin Court.</P>

Athlone, on the 18th June, 1925, when Mr. Daly could attend with witnesses; that claimant was subsequently notified from Headquarters, Western Command, on the 16th June, 1925, that the proposed Court of Enquiry was indefinitely adjourned, and that his attendance was unnecessary; and whether enquiries in this case will be expedited.</P>

He furnished evidence of unemployment from the date of his claim up to the 28th July and again from the 4th to the 11th August.  The claim was disallowed on the ground that the claimant had lost his employment by reason of a stoppage of work which was due to a trade dispute at the Castlecomer Quarries, Ltd., where he had been employed. Against this decision Mr. Dormer appealed to the Court of Referees.  As a result of subsequent investigation it was ascertained that the trade dispute terminated on the 17th July, and after further consideration of the claim by the Court of Referees and Insurance Officer, benefit was allowed on the personal claim and also in respect of the dependent child from and including the 17th July.  Payment will be made on next Friday.  It has not been possible to allow benefit in respect of the claimant's housekeeper, but that part of the claim has been referred to the Court of Referees, which sits at Kilkenny to-day for further consideration.</P>

      <P>Legislation on the subject of Merchandise Marks generally, designed to facilitate discrimination between home-manufactured goods and imported articles is under consideration, but the practical application <Col N="309" /> of this principle is a matter of considerable complexity.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I put a question down to endeavour to find out from the Minister for Justice what the intentions of the Government were with regard to the number of prisoners at present detained, and whether these prisoners will be allowed, or are at present allowed, to communicate with their friends outside, and as to whether parcels, if sent to them, will be delivered to them this Christmas as in former years.  The Minister for Justice gave that sort of reply to my question which is usually given by Ministers to members at Westminster. I have no doubt, from long sittings at the Imperial Conference, he has come to the conclusion that the best thing is to avoid publicity, and not to reply to the questions Deputies put to him for the information of the country. There are three or four persons from the constituency I represent interned at present.  These men have been taught from 1916 that the best thing they could do and that the best manner in which they could achieve the freedom and sovereign independence of their country was to commit certain offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These men were taught by the members of the present Government in years gone by that these were political offences, and during the time when the members of this House were arrested and interned the whole cry was that they were not treated as political prisoners. Now is it because we are part of England that the men who are adhering to their ideas of independence for the country are to be branded as criminals? Did the men in power to-day in the Saorstát refuse to be branded in this way in the past?  I hold that the men and women who to-day are in opposition <Col N="313" /> to the State and who happened to be interned for that cause should be treated as political prisoners and not as criminals.  There are two ladies sentenced for trifling offences, and these ladies are treated as criminals.  Surely the Dáil must realise that men and women who in the years gone by were instructed and educated in opposition to the Government, and who now adhere to that instruction and are still against the Government and are working for what in their opinion is the quickest and best method of freedom, are political prisoners.  Some of those people have been sentenced to ten years' penal servitude.  They are locked up and branded as a lot of murderers. They must associate with murderers inside the prison walls.  Surely that is going beyond what should be done.</P>
    <P>I could fully understand in the years gone by when the Minister for Justice and other members of the Executive Council were arrested that the Government at that time might say: &ldquo;We will not give those people the right given to political prisoners; we will brand them as murderers, and we will refuse them all privileges of communication with outside; we will refuse them all right to write letters or to receive parcels of food or clothing from outside.&rdquo;  Now there came a time when members of the Dáil and many outside who are now in opposition to the Government were arrested, and they protested against being treated as criminals.  Some of those people who are now arrested have gone through the country for years trying to raise up the minds of the people against the British power.  A lot of these dupes have been led astray by the Minister for Justice and the other members of the Executive Council. Now they are arrested and put into prison, and we are told by the Minister for Justice that he does not understand what is the meaning of &ldquo;political prisoner.&rdquo;  He said I might explain the meaning of &ldquo;political prisoner&rdquo; and give him an example of what I meant, and you yourself, sir, said that if I drafted the question properly I might succeed in getting an answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say any such thing.</P>

      <P>You said if I had got assistance I could have put the question in a different way.  I do not look for assistance from anybody as to what I am to put before this House.  I have no legal adviser behind me.  I am not like the Minister for Justice who can have twelve secretaries at the expense of the State.  The other Ministers there sitting on the benches have their staff of officials, but the ordinary Deputy has not those great privileges, and consequently we have to draft those questions to the best of our ability without any assistance from the State.  I put the question down, sir.  It is quite a plain question.  It only demands to know the number of prisoners detained in these three jails and whether these prisoners will be allowed to correspond with their friends outside and whether they will be allowed parcels at Christmas. In the years gone by there was always raised a war-cry as to the treatment of political prisoners at the hands of the authorities.  Now, to-day, the very people who set up that cry, and by any amount of propaganda throughout the country succeeded in getting these men to carry out their advice, tell us these men are not to be treated as political prisoners.  I hold that that is unfair and unjust.  I do say that that man or woman who commits a crime against the State should not be treated as a common criminal.  I know that it is right for the Minister for Justice and the Executive Council to arrest men according to the Acts passed by the Oireachtas.  They can arrest the entire country and these men can be treated as criminals.  The Minister for Justice can have all the men who are against the State arrested this week. But that would be going too far.  I ask the Minister to give some explanation as to the intention of the Executive Council with regard to these men and as to whether they will treat them as political prisoners.</P>

      <P>When I suggested to the Deputy that he might get assistance in drafting a question I had in mind the assistance of officers of the Dáil who are paid out of public funds and who are always willing&mdash;as, probably, Deputy Lyons knows better than any other Deputy&mdash;to assist Deputies <Col N="315" /> in drafting motions or questions, or any other matter to be brought before the Dáil.  That is the kind of assistance that I contemplated, and I suggest that the more it is used the less waste of time there will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of opinion that Deputy Lyons has made an unanswerable case, in the sense that I am unable to answer whatever case he has made.  I do not quite know what it is. He was entirely vague as to the class of prisoner to whom he wished to refer. He used throughout his statement the very vague expression, &ldquo;political offences,&rdquo; and consistently refused to give, or attempt to give, any more precise definition as to the kind of offence he wished to have covered.  In the absence of fuller information from Deputy Lyons, I do not know that I should attempt to say very much.  The position with regard to correspondence and the getting of parcels, food, etc., from outside is as follows:&mdash;The only prisoners permitted to receive food from outside are prisoners awaiting trial and prisoners expressly directed by the <Col N="316" /> court or by statute to be placed in the first division.  First division prisoners are permitted to write and receive one letter each week.  Prisoners in the second division are permitted to write and receive one letter each fortnight. Prisoners in the third division are permitted to write and receive one letter once a month.  The question whether a prisoner is placed in the first, second. or third division is entirely a matter for the court, subject to the qualifications that for a few offences, such as sedition, seditious libel, or contempt of court, prisoners must be placed in the first division.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say whether prisoners who have been sentenced to one, two or three years' imprisonment, say for commandeering a motor car&mdash;an offence for which a large number are at present detained&mdash;are treated as political prisoners and allowed to receive correspondence and parcels?</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 3.40 p.m. until Tuesday, 30th November.</P>
